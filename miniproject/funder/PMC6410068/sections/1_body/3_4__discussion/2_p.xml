<p>In our study, the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains clearly had uniformly high DIR or CHIKV prevalence in salivary glands after infection with R99659 or LR2006 OPY1 virus. Although the DIRs were similar among the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains tested, the salivary glands infected with the two CHIKVs varied in virus titers. The mean virus titer of both CHIKVs were highest for the La RÃ©union strain and lowest for the New Jersey strain indicating that geographic origin of the vector is an important factor. Nevertheless, differences in vector competence of the New Jersey strain for LR2006 OPY1 were not significant when compared to the other 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) (see
