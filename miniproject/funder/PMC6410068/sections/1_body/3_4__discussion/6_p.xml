<p>CHIKV is now widespread worldwide and likely will continue to pose a public health threat globally wherever the invasive mosquitoes 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> exists to transmit CHIKV to a susceptible human population. The emergence of mosquito-borne CHIKV in the Americas starting in 2013 led to a geographically widespread outbreak with human illness and the establishment of CHIKV transmission cycles in urban settings. As evidence of this, 11 cases from autochthonous transmission of CHIK were detected in south Florida in 2014 [

This knowledge, coupled with enhanced understanding of critical arbovirus-vector interactions and the ecology of the major vectors will enable locally specific, efficient deployment of public health resources in the event of another outbreak of CHIKV in North America.
