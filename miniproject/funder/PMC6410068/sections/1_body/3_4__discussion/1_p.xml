<p>Vector competence, the ability of an arbovirus vector to acquire a virus and successfully transmit the virus to another susceptible host, is determined by genetic traits of vector species and vector populations within species. Vector competence, the efficiency of viral replication and external factors including temperature, the availability of vertebrate hosts, vector population density and predation, determine how successful a vector population will be in transmitting virus in nature [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations were performed here to indicate vector competence. We reasoned that the high DIR values ranging from 93% to 100% of infected salivary glands for each
