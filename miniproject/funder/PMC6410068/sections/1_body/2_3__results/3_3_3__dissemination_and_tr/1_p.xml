<p>The DIRs of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) for R99659 (blood meal virus titer 6.2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL) or LR2006 OPY1 (blood meal virus titer 6.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL) were also evaluated 9 days post-infection. DIRs were high for all CHIKV isolates tested in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, with no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.3679) between R99659 and LR2006 OPY1 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The DIRs were 92% for R99659 and 93% for LR2006 OPY1 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The TER for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) infected with LR2006 OPY1 and R99659 viruses were statistically similar (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). These data indicated that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) strains had statistically similar vector competence (DIR × TER) for these viruses. DIR, TER and vector competence for the two CHIKVs and the four 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains and one 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strain are summarized in
