<p>We observed no correlation between salivary gland virus titer (pfu/mL) and saliva virus titer (pfu/mL) for R99659 and LR2006 OPY1 viruses in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). This was also true for the four 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains infected with R99659 genotype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) and the Florida and Louisiana 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains infected with LR2006 OPY1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). However, the TER of the La RÃ©union 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strain infected with LR2006 OPY1 showed a positive correlation between salivary gland virus titer and saliva virus titer (correlation coefficient = 0.672). Although the New Jersey 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> strain had a positive correlation between the two variables, it was weak and likely insignificant (correlation coefficient = 0.323;
