<p>The presence of a salivary gland escape barrier (SGEB) was determined by dividing the number of saliva samples without virus by the number of virus positive salivary glands. The highest SGEB occurred with the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) strain since many mosquitoes were without detectable virus in their saliva even though their salivary glands were highly infected and all mosquitoes were able to salivate regardless of their infection status. This was also true for the four 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains tested but the correlation was weaker than the SGEBs associated with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Interestingly, SGEB was dependent upon the viral genotype, since the four 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains and the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strain infected with R99659 (Asian genotype) showed a higher SGEB than mosquitoes infected with LR2006 OPY1 virus. The New Jersey 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strain infected with R99659 virus presented the highest SGEB (64.3 %) compared with the Florida, La Réunion or Ae. aegypti (Poza Rica) strains (SGEB = 44.4%, 44.8%, 48% and 43.5% respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f004">Figure 4</xref>A–C). In contrast, only 10.7% to 20% of mosquitoes presented a SGEB with LR2006 OPY1 (ECSA IOL genotype), however, the titer of virus in the salivary glands did vary significantly between mosquitoes infected with R99659 and LR2006 OPY1.
