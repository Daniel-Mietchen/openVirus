<p>The DIR of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for CHIKV was evaluated 9 days after infection with R99659 (blood meal virus titer: 5.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL) or LR2006 OPY1 (blood meal virus titer: 6.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL). We detected no significant difference in DIR among the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains (Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, and La Réunion) infected with either R99659 and LR2006 OPY1 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.3916). DIR ranged from 93% to 96.6% for R99659 and 93.3% to 100% for LR2006 OPY1. However, significant differences were detected in the virus titers of salivary glands among the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains infected with either R99659 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) or LR2006 OPY1 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0461; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f001">Figure 1</xref>). R99659 virus titers in the salivary glands of the La Réunion strain were significantly higher than titers in the New Jersey strain (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0010) or Louisiana strain (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0181). LR2006 OPY1 virus titers in the New Jersey strain were significantly lower than in the Florida and La Réunion strains of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0330 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0282, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f001">Figure 1</xref>). While the LR2006 OPY1 virus titers were higher than R99659 virus titers in the salivary glands of all 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains tested, statistically significant differences were detected between R99659 and LR2006 OPY1 virus titers in the La Réunion (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0453), Florida (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0089) and New Jersey (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0472) strains. We observed no significant differences in DIR between the two CHIKV isolates in the Louisiana strain (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1920).
