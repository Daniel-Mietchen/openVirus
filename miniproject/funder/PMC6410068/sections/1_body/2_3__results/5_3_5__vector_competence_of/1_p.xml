<p>We multiplied DIR by TER to determine vector competence of each group of mosquitoes (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30/group) for each virus. The four 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains had significantly higher vector competence for LR2006 OPY1 virus versus R99659 virus (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001; 
 <xref rid="insects-10-00039-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) also had a significantly higher vector competence for LR2006 OPY1 virus than R99659 virus (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Comparisons of the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> versus 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for LR2006 OPY1 were not different (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1881). Comparisons of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) versus the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains (La RÃ©union, Louisiana, and Florida) for R99659 were also not statistically different (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The only significant differences when comparing vector competence of mosquito groups for R99659 virus was between the New Jersey strain and the Florida or Louisiana 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> groups (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0191 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0083).
