<p>We did not detect significant differences in virus prevalence in saliva (TER) among the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains infected with R99659 virus (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.3916) or the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains infected with LR2006 OPY1 virus. The prevalence (TER) of virus in saliva ranged from 33.3% to 56.6% for R99659 virus and 80% to 86.6% for CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 virus. The TER of R99659-infected 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains was significantly lower than mosquito strains infected with LR2006 OPY1 virus (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Significant differences were also observed for virus titers in saliva among 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains infected with R99659 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f002">Figure 2</xref>). No significant differences were observed for LR2006 OPY1 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.7544. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f002">Figure 2</xref>) titers in saliva of the four 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains. The LR2006 OPY1 titers in saliva of the New Jersey strain were significantly higher than R99659 titers in saliva of the same strain (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) possibly indicating LR2006 OPY1 virus has a fitness advantage in these mosquitoes.
