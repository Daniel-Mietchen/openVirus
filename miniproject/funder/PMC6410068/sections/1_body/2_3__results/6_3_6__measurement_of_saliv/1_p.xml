<p>In our assay, saliva is expectorated just after the mosquito proboscis immerses into collection fluid. Mosquitoes such as 
 <italic>Culex. pipiens</italic> salivate an average of 4.7 nL during the blood feeding process [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The rate of salivation may vary depending on the species, age, size, physiological state of the mosquito and environmental conditions. We initially determined the average of saliva volume produced during probing by uninfected 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Here we used a capillary tube (0.2 mm inner diameter) prefilled with 1 µL of immersion oil type B. Twenty-six mosquitoes were allowed to salivate into the oil at room temperature for 1 h and then measured the height of saliva in the capillary tube with a digital fractional caliper (presicion: ±0.02 mm). The volume of saliva was then calculated using the cylinder volume formula (V = π(r
 <sup>2</sup> × h) = 3.1416× 0.01 × h = mm
 <sup>3</sup> or µL;

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes salivated an average of 6.82 ± 2.88 nL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). We then determined whether the volume of saliva influenced virus titer by collecting the saliva in calibrated capillary tubes and quantifying the expectorate volume. The titer of CHIKV (pfu/mL) did not strongly correlate with the volume of saliva, since volumes 2–3 nL of saliva contained as much or more virus titer than 5–7 nL volumes of saliva (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f005">Figure 5</xref>C is one data set from multiple collections of saliva and determinations of CHIKV titer. We have observed little correlation between virus titer and saliva volume for other arboviruses such as Zika and dengue-2 viruses (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>; unpublished data) from hundreds of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> saliva samples [
