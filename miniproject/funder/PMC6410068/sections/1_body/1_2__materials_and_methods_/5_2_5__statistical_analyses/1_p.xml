<p>The proportion of infected salivary glands and saliva were calculated by averaging the number of infected samples divided by the total tested. All data were analyzed with GraphPad prism software (version 5.0, La Jolla, CA, USA) for testing significant differences (

 <sup>2</sup> test) and the correlation among virus titers in saliva and salivary glands (Pearson correlation). Analysis of variance (one-way and two-way ANOVA) was used to determine the statistical significance and CORREL function (Excel 2016, Microsoft, Redmond, DC, USA) for determining the correlation coefficient.
