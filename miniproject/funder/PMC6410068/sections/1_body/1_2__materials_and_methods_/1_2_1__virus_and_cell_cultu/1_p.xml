<p>Vero cells, LLC-MK2 monkey kidney cells and C6/36 (
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>) cells were cultured in modified Eagle’s medium (MEM) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, non-essential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C and 28 °C, respectively. The two low passage CHIKV isolates (R99659, British Virgin Islands, Asian genotype; Accession # KJ451624.1) and LR2006 OPY1 (La Réunion, ECSA genotype; Accession # DQ443544.2) were provided by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC-Fort Collins, CO, USA). The presence of the E1-A226V mutation in LR2006 OPY1 virus was confirmed by RT-PCR using specific primer sets designed to amplify the nucleotide sequence surrounding the mutation as previously described [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We infected Vero cells with low passage CHIKV at a 0.001 multiplicity of infection (MOI) then incubated cells at 37 °C for 72 h. Virus aliquots were stored at −80 °C until used for preparing infectious blood meals.
