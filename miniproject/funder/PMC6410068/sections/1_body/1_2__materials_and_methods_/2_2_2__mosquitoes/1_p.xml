 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> from Florida, Louisiana (Lake Charles), and La Réunion Island (Indian Ocean) were provided by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC-Fort Collins, CO, USA). The New Jersey 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strain was obtained from Cornell University and the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> line was collected in Poza Rica, Mexico [

 <xref rid="B21-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The La Réunion, New Jersey and Poza Rica mosquitoes were less than 10 generations in colony, Florida and Louisiana strains were more generations in colony. Mosquito eggs were hatched to obtain the immature stages and eclosed adults were held in cages at 28 ± 1 °C and 70–80% relative humidity. Adults were fed 10% sucrose ad libitum and maintained at 16:8 light:dark photoperiod. Groups of 200 adult females (1 week post-eclosion) were placed in 2.5 L cartons, deprived of sugar and water overnight to promote feeding of artificial blood meals consisting of virus-infected Vero cell and medium suspension (60% vol/vol), 40% (vol/vol) defibrinated sheep blood (Colorado Serum Co., Boulder, CO, USA) and 1 mM ATP [
