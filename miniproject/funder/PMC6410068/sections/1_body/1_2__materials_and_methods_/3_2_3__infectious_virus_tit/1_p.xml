<p>Plaque assays were performed using confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 24-well plates to determine virus titers in saliva and salivary glands. The samples were sterilized by passing them through Acrodisc HT Tuffryn 0.2-μm syringe filters (Pall Life Sciences, East Hills, NY, USA). Vero cells were infected for 1 h with 10-fold serial dilutions of saliva or salivary gland homogenate samples. Infected cells were overlaid with a 1% agar-nutrient mixture (agar solution (1g/77 mL DI H
 <sub>2</sub>O): nutrient solution (10 mL of 10×/100 mL Media 199, 7% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 7.5% sodium bicarbonate (4mL/100mL), 2% DEAE- dextrose in Hanks balanced solution (1mL/100mL), 0.5 mL/100mL MEM essential amino acids (15× solution), and 0.5 mL/100mL MEM vitamins (100× solution)). After 7 days incubation at 37 °C cells were stained with 3 mg/mL MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution and incubated for 4 h [
