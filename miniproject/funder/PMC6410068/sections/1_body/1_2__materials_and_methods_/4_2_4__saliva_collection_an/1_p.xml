<p>At day 9 post-infections, saliva from each female was collected using a previously described saliva collection method [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, females were chilled, and their wings and legs removed. The proboscis of the mosquito was inserted into a 1.0 µL micropipette (microcaps, Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA, USA) filled with immersion oil type B and allowed to salivate into the oil at room temperature. After 30–45 min, the proboscis was removed from the capillary and oil containing the saliva was expelled under pressure into 1.5 mL tubes containing 300 μL DMEM medium (20% of heat inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids) and frozen immediately on dry ice. We also measured salivation volume from mosquitoes by allowing them to expectorate into 1 µL capillary tubes as described previously and measured the height of the saliva with a digital fractional caliper (presicion: ±0.02 mm). The volume of saliva was calculated using the cylinder volume formula (V = π(r
 <sup>2</sup> × h) = 3.1416 × 0.01 × h = mm
 <sup>3</sup> or µL). Following expectoration, salivary glands were dissected from the same mosquitoes that provided saliva and placed in 500 μL of DMEM medium (7% of heat inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids). The salivary gland samples were frozen immediately (dry ice) prior to determining CHIKV titers. CHIKV titers in saliva and salivary glands were reported as pfu/mL from plaque assays as previously described.
