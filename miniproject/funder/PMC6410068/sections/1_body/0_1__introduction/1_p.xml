 <italic>Chikungunya virus</italic> (CHIKV; 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>; 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) maintained during epidemics in transmission cycles between viremic humans and infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic>) mosquitoes. The genome of CHIKV is a positive single stranded RNA (~11,800 nucleotides) containing two open reading frames (ORFs) between the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The first ORF, encodes the nonstructural polyprotein (nsP1-nsP4), and the second ORF encodes the structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K and E1). The two ORFS are separated by a small untranslated junction region [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CHIK disease in symptomatic patients presents as fever and intense rash, weakness, myalgia and polyarthralgia [
 <xref rid="B2-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The onset of fever coincides with viremia, and the viral load can rapidly reach up to 10
 <sup>9</sup> viral genome copies per milliliter of blood or virus titers of 10
 <sup>7–9</sup> plaque-forming unit equivalents /mL [
 <xref rid="B2-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The principle vector of CHIKV is 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, a peridomestic, day-biting mosquito found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world [
 <xref rid="B2-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, in 2005–2006 an outbreak of CHIKV occurred on La Réunion Island (Indian Ocean basin) that was transmitted by another day biting mosquito, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Significantly, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has invaded new regions globally. They now thrive in temperate areas of the western hemisphere and could pose additional health risks to a CHIKV susceptible human population [
