  <p>We infected the 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains and 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with blood meals containing 5–7 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU/mL of R99659 (Asian genotype) and LR2006 OPY1 (ECSA-IOL genotype) and analyzed the mosquitoes nine days later to detect maximum infection of their salivary glands and saliva.

  <p>All four 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains were highly susceptible to LR2006 OPY1 and R99659 viruses and their CHIKV disseminated infection rates (DIR) were statistically similar (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.3916).

  <p>We demonstrated here that the TER in 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> vary according to their geographic origins of the mosquitoes and the CHIKV strain contributing to a salivary gland barrier for releasing R99659 virus into saliva.

  <p>Virus titers in salivary glands did not correlate with saliva volume, but 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> expectorated on average a volume of 6.8 nL/mosquito.

  <p>If introduced, LR2006 OPY1 virus could increase the risk of CHIKV transmission by both 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> species in the western hemisphere.
