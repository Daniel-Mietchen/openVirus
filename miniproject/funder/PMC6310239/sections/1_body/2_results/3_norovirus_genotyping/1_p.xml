<p>To determine the NoV genotypes responsible for the outbreaks, nucleotide sequencing of region C was conducted on the NoV-positive specimens. A total of 75 strains were obtained from 13 NoV-positive outbreaks. These 75 NoV strains belonged to seven genotypes, namely, GII.17 (38, 50.7%), GII.2 (13, 17.3%), GI.6 (10, 13.3%), GI.5 (5, 6.7%), GII.3 (4, 5.3%), GII.1 (4, 5.3%) and GI.3 (1, 1.3%). Of these strains, 93.3% (70/75) were identified from faeces, 5.3% (4/75) from contaminated water and 1.3% (1/75) from vomit. No strains were identified from throat swabs, food samples, or surface swabs.</p>
