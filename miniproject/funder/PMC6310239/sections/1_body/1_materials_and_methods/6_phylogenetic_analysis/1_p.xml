<p>The NoV sequences obtained from the outbreaks were analyzed based on the sequence of the VP1 region by the Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis version 7.0 (MEGA7) program [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The neighbor-joining (N-J) method was used for phylogenetic reconstruction, and the Kimura 2-parameter model was used to compute evolutionary distances. The bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replications [
