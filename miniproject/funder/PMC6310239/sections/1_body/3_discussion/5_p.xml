<p>Ten outbreaks (outbreaks I-III, V-VIII and XIII-XV) in our study were associated with human-to-human transmission. These outbreaks occurred in colleges/kindergartens and had the common characteristic that the NoV-infected cases were not isolated in a timely manner. Li and colleagues reported that contact between students and individuals with suspected cases led to a 5.6-fold increase in the infection risk compared to the absence of contact with suspected cases [
