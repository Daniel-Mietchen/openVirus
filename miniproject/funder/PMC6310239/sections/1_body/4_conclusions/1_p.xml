<p>Our findings demonstrate that non-GII.4 NoV genotypes were the predominant circulating genotypes and were responsible for AGE outbreaks from 2015 to 2017 in Jinan, China. Non-GII.4 NoVs have been increasingly recognized as important causative agents of these outbreaks. In addition, the great diversity of the prevailing non-GII.4 strains, as well as the evolutionary features of these strains, demonstrated that the emergence of new NoV strains often leads to the occurrence of outbreaks. Thus, the implementation of year-round molecular epidemiological surveillance of NoVs is necessary to reduce the impact of NoVs on public health.</p>
