<p>The apparent lower susceptibility to nucleoside analogues in USUV than in ZIKV could be related to generally larger virus yields in infections with USUV. Previous studies on unrelated foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) suggested that the efficacy of lethal mutagenesis can be affected by the viral load; hence, extinction will be favored when the infection is initiated with a lower viral dose (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Thus, we decided to investigate whether passages at a lower infectious dose may also facilitate USUV extinction. We found that all three ribonucleoside analogues (800 μM) can reproducibly drive USUV to extinction in four independent replicas when a 10-fold dilution was applied before each transfer (

 <sup>8</sup> 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID
 <sub>50</sub>] per ml; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). When drugs were used at a lower concentration (400 μM), the complete elimination of USUV was only observed in some sporadic cases. Both ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil caused USUV extinction in two out of three lineages, while favipiravir never led to the complete loss of infectivity in any of three series analyzed (not shown). Further analysis revealed that treatment with 5-fluorouracil resulted in significantly larger decreases in virus titers than passages in the presence of other drugs at 400 μM (
