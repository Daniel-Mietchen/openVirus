<p>Serial passage of USUV in the presence of each ribonucleoside drug led to sustained decreases in virus titers but not to complete viral extinction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Virus lineages treated with ribonucleosides showed significantly lower titers (3 to 4 log
 <sub>10</sub> on average) than during passages in decitabine or in the absence of drug. The lowest values were observed in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, further suggesting that this compound is most effective against USUV during serial passage in cell culture (
