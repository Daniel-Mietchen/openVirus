<p>To elucidate whether these drugs are also broadly effective against other flaviviruses, we analyzed their antiviral activity on Vero cells infected with USUV. All three nucleosides (favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil) that inhibited ZIKV replication also manifested antiviral activity on USUV (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>). In contrast to what we had observed with ZIKV, 5-fluorouracil was the most effective compound against USUV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Single-cycle infection kinetics experiments with drugs at 800 Î¼M revealed that 5-fluorouracil antiviral activity becomes more prominent at later replication time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). This is also observed when the same drugs are tested against USUV during multiple cycles of infection (infections at low multiplicity of infection [MOI]). The relative activity of 5-fluorouracil compared to those of ribavirin and favipiravir is substantially larger at 48 h than at 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">C</xref>). This observation may be in agreement with a larger accumulation of mutations during larger number of replication cycles taking place during 48 h.
