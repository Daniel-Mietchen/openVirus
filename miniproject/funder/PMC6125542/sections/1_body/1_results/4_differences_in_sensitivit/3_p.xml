<p>Further analysis revealed the expected transition biases typically found in viruses treated with the same drugs (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Thus, we observed slightly higher rates of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions in viruses treated with favipiravir, while the opposite changes (A-to-G and U-to-C) were identified in 5-fluorouracil-treated viruses (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The only exception to these typical transition mutational patterns was obtained in ZIKV populations treated with ribavirin (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with higher frequencies in A-to-G and U-to-C nucleotide substitutions (when the [A-to-G + U-to-C]/[G-to-A + C-to-U] ratio is 2). In contrast, USUV treated with ribavirin exhibited the expected mutational bias, with larger numbers of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
