<p>To investigate whether the antiviral activities observed during treatment with favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil are connected to their predicted mutagenic activity, we analyzed the mutation frequencies of both ZIKV and USUV rescued after 5 passages in the presence of these compounds. Since treatment at high concentrations (400 and 800 μM) resulted in a rapid loss of ZIKV infectivity, we isolated and analyzed viral RNA from the supernatant of infected cells after 5 consecutive passages during exposure to drugs at 200 μM (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Both favipiravir- and ribavirin-treated virus populations displayed significantly higher mutation frequencies (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The highest mutation frequencies were observed in the ribavirin- and favipiravir-treated ZIKV population (7- and 4-fold higher than in untreated virus, respectively). This positively links antiviral activity with mutagenesis, as the largest decreases in ZIKV titers observed during serial passages in the presence of each drug (at 200 μM) were observed with ribavirin and favipiravir (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In the 5-fluorouracil-treated population, we only found a modest (2-fold) increase in the mutation frequency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>), reflecting the milder antiviral behavior of this compound. Treatment with decitabine did not significantly alter the mutation frequency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref>), further suggesting that this compound is not affecting RNA replication.
