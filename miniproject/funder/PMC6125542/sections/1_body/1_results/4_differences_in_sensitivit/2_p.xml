<p>Similarly, we found that the largest mutation frequencies in USUV were observed in populations collected after serial passage in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (

Viral populations recovered after 5 passages in the presence of 5-fluorouracil (800 Î¼M) showed 6-fold larger mutation frequencies than USUV passaged in the absence of drug. Ribavirin and favipiravir led to modest increases in the mutational loads, also in agreement with their milder antiviral activities against USUV (2 and 3-fold, respectively;
