<p>We further analyzed the antiviral efficacies of these drugs against ZIKV during prolonged treatment by testing their capacity to abolish infectivity during consecutive viral passages in cell culture. Sequential infections of ZIKV in the presence of these drugs resulted in a total loss of infectivity when a final concentration of 800 μM was used (except for decitabine; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The complete extinction of ZIKV infectivity was replicated in three independent lineages of passages in each drug (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>). Favipiravir eliminated ZIKV in a faster manner (undetectable viral levels reported after 4 passages for all the three independent lineages) than ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil (all three lineages were extinct after 5 passages). The extinction of ZIKV populations in these samples was confirmed by performing an additional blind passage in cell culture in the absence of mutagens (data not shown). We did not observe any detectable infectivity or viral RNA in the samples recovered, confirming that these three nucleosides completely eliminate ZIKV infectivity. Serial passage of ZIKV in cells treated with ribavirin or favipiravir at lower concentrations (100 to 400 μM) also resulted in a gradual decrease in infectivity, with the two drugs presenting similar efficacies (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">F</xref>). Unlike favipiravir and ribavirin, ZIKV exhibited lower susceptibility to passages in the presence of 5-fluorouracil, suggesting that this molecule is a weaker inhibitor or mutagen for this virus. As anticipated, decitabine had no effect on infectivity, as the viral titers measured during serial transfers were similar to those found in passages of virus in the absence of drug (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">G</xref>). A typical signature of lethal mutagenesis is that viral populations isolated in passages preceding extinction show reduced specific infectivity (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). To investigate whether ZIKV populations treated with these compounds manifested any alteration in their specific infectivity values, we determined the proportion of infectious particles relative to the total number of viral RNA molecules in the sample. We confirmed that viral populations rescued after treatment with all three drugs exhibited lower specific infectivity than the untreated viruses, and most significantly those treated with favipiravir (
