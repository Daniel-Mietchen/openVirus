<p>Treatment of infected cells with all the ribonucleosides, i.e., favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil, led to significant inhibition of ZIKV replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). These molecules exhibited similar antiviral activities when using an epidemic strain isolated in the Americas (Asian lineage; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and an African isolate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). As predicted, decitabine showed no effect on ZIKV replication, further supporting the idea that the antiviral activity elicited by the ribonucleosides is directly related to their incorporation by the viral RNA polymerase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Further analysis of ZIKV replication kinetics in the presence of different concentrations of each drug suggests that these molecules exhibit a similar inhibitory capacity. However, favipiravir seems to elicit a stronger inhibitory activity than ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil when higher concentrations are used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">F</xref>).
