<p>To investigate whether ZIKV replication could be affected by increased mutagenesis, we tested four different compounds known to be mutagenic for diverse viruses, 5-fluorouracil, ribavirin, favipiravir, and decitabine (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Its antiviral activity has been associated with lethal mutagenesis, and it is possibly related to the incorporation of the phosphorylated deoxyribonucleoside derivative into viral cDNA during reverse transcription (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). We have included this analogue as a negative control for antiviral mutagenesis in our RNA viral targets, as it is not predicted to be a substrate of RNA polymerases. We first investigated the toxicities of these compounds on Vero cells (
