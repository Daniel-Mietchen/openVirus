<p>For experiments involving serial passage of viruses in the presence of nucleoside analogues, the first infection with ZIKV or USUV was carried out at an MOI of 0.1 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell. In sequential passages, 100 μl of neat virus from the supernatant of the previous passage (which represents 1/10 of the total volume collected) was applied to a new monolayer of cells. For experiments involving transfers of diluted USUV, we used in each transfer 100 μl of a preparation containing a 10-fold dilution of the viral sample collected in the previous passage, as described in previous work (
