<p>For infections in the presence of drugs, cell culture supernatants were removed, and 250 μl of 1% FBS complete medium containing 100 to 800 μM decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; Selleckchem), 5-fluorouracil (2,4-dihydroxy-5-fluoropyrimidine; Sigma-Aldrich), ribavirin [1-(β-
 <sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; Sigma-Aldrich], or favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide; Atomax) was added to each well. Cells were then inoculated with 100 μl of virus at the MOI indicated for each experiment in the corresponding section and incubated for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Supernatants were removed, cells were washed to eliminate unattached virus, and 1 ml of fresh medium (1% FBS) containing each drug at the desired concentration was added. Cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 to 48 h postinfection for subsequent analyses.
