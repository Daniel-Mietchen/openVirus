<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 100 μl of viral sample supernatants using the GeneJET RNA purification kit (Thermo Fisher). For the calculation of mutation frequency values, we followed previously described protocols (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). Briefly, 4 μl of purified RNA was reverse transcribed in 20 μl final volume using SuperScript III (Roche), as indicated by the manufacturer. Three microliters of cDNA was then PCR amplified using high-fidelity KOD polymerase (Toyobo). To this aim, we used primers spanning genomic positions 2976 to 3009 and 5052 to 5074 in USUV and 6465 to 6486 and 7646 to 7677 in ZIKV. PCR products were gel purified using the PureLink Quick gel extraction kit (Invitrogen) and then ligated into plasmid PCR Blunt using the Zero Blunt PCR cloning kit (Thermo Fisher). Positive 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> colonies were identified by PCR screening with primers flanking the vector-cloning site and DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher). The resulting PCR products, corresponding to individual ZIKV or USUV cDNA clones, were Sanger sequenced and the mutation frequency in each population calculated.
