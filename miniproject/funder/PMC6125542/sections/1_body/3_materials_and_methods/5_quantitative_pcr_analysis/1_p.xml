<p>The number of ZIKV genomic RNA molecules in different biological samples was quantified using primers and a FAM-TAMRA (6-carboxyfluorescein–6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) probe targeting the ZIKV E gene (positions 1214 to 1244), following protocols previously described (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). For the amplification protocol, we used TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step master mix (Thermo Fisher) and one-step reaction reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification conditions, with a reverse transcription step (30 min at 48°C), followed by 1 min of incubation at 95°C and 40 amplification cycles of 15s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. For the quantification of USUV RNA, we used a FAM-TAMRA probe targeting the NS5 gene (positions 9297 to 9318) and primers previously described (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). The same RT-PCR cycle amplification protocol described above for the detection of ZIKV was used for USUV.
