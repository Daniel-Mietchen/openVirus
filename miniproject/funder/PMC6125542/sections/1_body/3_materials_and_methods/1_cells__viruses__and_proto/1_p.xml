<p>We used two different ZIKV strains purchased from the American Type Cell Culture (ATCC). The majority of the experiments described in this paper were performed with an isolate from the Asian lineage, collected during the recent epidemics in the Americas (strain PRVABC59, Puerto Rico, 2015, ATCC reference number VR-1843). In addition, for some experiments indicated here, we used the first ZIKV strain ever isolated as our reference African lineage virus (Uganda, 1947, strain MR 766, ATCC reference number VR-1838). The USUV strain (939/01) used in this study was initially isolated from infected birds in Austria in 2001 and was kindly provided by Giovanni Savini, Istituto G. Caporale, Italy (
