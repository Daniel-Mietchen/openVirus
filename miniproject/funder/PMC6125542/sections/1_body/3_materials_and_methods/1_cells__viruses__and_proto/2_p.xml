<p>We used African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (kindly provided by Sylvie Lecollinet, ANSES, France), namely, Vero cells, for ZIKV and USUV propagation, titration, and viral infections in the presence or absence of mutagenic compounds. Viral infections were performed as follows: on the day preceding virus inoculation, we seeded 24-well plates with 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in the presence of 1 ml of complete medium containing 5% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher), and 1 mM HEPES in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher). Cells were incubated overnight at 37°C with a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration. On the following day, the supernatant was removed from each plate and replaced with 250 μl of fresh medium containing 1% FBS. Then, 100 μl of virus sample (ZIKV or USUV) was applied to the cell monolayer at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) indicated, and virus adsorption was allowed for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The inoculum was removed and the cells washed with complete medium to eliminate unattached virus. Cells were then covered in 1 ml of medium containing 1% FBS, and supernatants from infected cultures collected at different time points.
