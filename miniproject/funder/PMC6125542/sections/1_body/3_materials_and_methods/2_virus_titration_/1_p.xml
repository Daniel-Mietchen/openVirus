<p>Virus samples were titrated by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assays. To this aim, 10
 <sup>4</sup> Vero cells in 100 μl were seeded in 96-well plates in the presence of medium containing 1% FBS. On the following day, 100 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions of each sample was applied to each well, reaching a final volume of 200 μl. The virus titers were determined by scoring the number of infected wells showing apparent cytopathic effect at 4 to 5 days postinfection, and using the Spearman &amp; Kärber algorithm (
