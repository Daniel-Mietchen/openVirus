<p>Some of these compounds are currently used at the clinical level; e.g., ribavirin has been extensively used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and favipiravir (also known as T-705 and commercialized as Avigan), has been trialed against influenza virus and Ebola virus disease (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Several recent studies have indicated an association between mutagenesis and antiviral activity

This antiviral activity is accompanied by increased mutation frequency and decreased specific infectivity, both signatures of error catastrophe, in samples isolated preceding complete viral clearance (
