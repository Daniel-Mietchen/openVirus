<p>Lethal mutagenesis has long been proposed as a broad-spectrum strategy to control viral infections, with recent data supporting its feasibility and efficacy

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The rationale for antiviral therapies based on mutagenesis stems from theoretical studies by Eigen and colleagues (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). These investigations led to the proposal that the elevated error frequencies during RNA virus replication are in the proximity of a maximum tolerated value for viability, namely, the error threshold (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Mutation rates beyond this value would be incompatible with maintaining meaningful genetic information, and thus virus propagation, leading to the extinction of the population in a process known as error catastrophe (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The theory was empirically proven using mutagenic agents that induce increased mutation frequencies in viruses (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). A vast repertoire of molecules that exert broad-spectrum antiviral activities linked to viral mutagenesis have been identified, including nucleoside and nonnucleoside compounds (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Mutagenic nucleosides can be incorporated into newly synthesized viral RNA genomes after their intracellular conversion into phosphorylated nucleoside analogues (
