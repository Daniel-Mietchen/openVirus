<p>Here, we examine the antiviral activities displayed by three nucleoside analogues, all licensed for human use, in cell culture infection with ZIKV and USUV. We observe that ribavirin, favipiravir, and 5-fluorouracil are all inhibitors of both ZIKV and USUV, and that consecutive passage of virus in the presence of these drugs can lead to the complete extinction of infectivity. Notably, the efficacies of these drugs vary depending on the virus. The molecules exhibiting better antiviral efficacies are typically associated with higher mutagenicity of the corresponding virus. However, the relative increases in mutation frequency observed for each drug treatment differ in USUV and ZIKV. We observed the highest mutation frequencies in ZIKV when treated with ribavirin and favipiravir, and in USUV when treated with 5-fluorouracil. The relevance of these results to a better understanding of flavivirus replication, genetic diversity, and the development of prospective antiviral therapies will be discussed.</p>
