<p>Several nucleoside analogues have demonstrated antiviral activities against a broad number of flaviviruses, which include ZIKV and WNV (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). In particular, ribavirin and favipiravir efficiently inhibit ZIKV infection in different cell culture systems, including human neuronal progenitor cells (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). However, the possible mutagenic activity of these molecules on ZIKV and USUV has not been yet investigated. It also remains unclear whether two different although related pathogens can have different responses to the treatment with the same mutagenic compounds or whether they show distinct sensitivity to them. This information could be relevant in the design of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies against the flaviviruses based on lethal mutagenesis.
