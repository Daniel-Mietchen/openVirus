<p>Human disease caused by flaviviruses represents a growing source of global health concern, with elevated numbers of deaths and cases of severe disease (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The incidence of flavivirus-related disease has increased during recent years. This is possibly related to multiple environmental and socioeconomic factors, such as long-distance spread of pathogenic flaviviruses (e.g., introduction to a different continent) and broader dissemination in temperate climate regions (

Despite having had limited relevance to public health prior to 2007 (only 14 cases reported), recent large epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Asia and the Americas have had a major socioeconomic impact. It is estimated that there have been over 1 million cases of infection, leading to several thousand people suffering from severe disease (
