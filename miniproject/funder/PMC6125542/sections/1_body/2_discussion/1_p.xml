<p>Lethal mutagenesis has been posited as an alternative strategy to the current therapies based on classical antiviral drugs. Several lines of evidence sustain that the antiviral properties of ribavirin and favipiravir

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In this study, we have investigated the sensitivity to mutagenesis of two flaviviruses that have recently emerged as serious threats to public health, ZIKV and USUV. Both pathogens were highly sensitive to the exposure of three mutagenic nucleosides, i.e., 5-fluorouracil, favipiravir, and ribavirin, although they exhibited different degrees of susceptibility to them. ZIKV was inhibited more efficiently by ribavirin and favipiravir, while USUV replication was affected to a greater extent by 5-fluorouracil. These inhibition profiles correlate with the relative increase in the mutation frequencies observed in populations rescued after treatment, supporting the idea that their antiviral efficacy is closely associated with their mutagenic activity.
