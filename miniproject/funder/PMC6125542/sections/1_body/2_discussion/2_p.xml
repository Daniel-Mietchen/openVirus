<p>A possible explanation for the different sensitivities of USUV and ZIKV to mutagenic drugs is that the molecular determinants that regulate nucleotide recognition and discrimination in their respective polymerases vary. As for other RNA viruses, flavivirus genome replication is an error-prone process catalyzed by the viral polymerase contained in the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Even though further analysis is needed to confirm this possibility, our data suggest that ZIKV is more prone to misincorporate purine analogues, such as ribavirin and favipiravir, while USUV shows a preference for pyrimidine substrates, like 5-fluorouracil. If certain, this information could be instrumental in the rational screening of nucleoside analogues to effectively control each flavivirus. Many recent studies have contributed to the better understanding of the molecular biology of ZIKV replication, including the structural and biochemical characterization of the viral polymerase NS5 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). However, there is limited knowledge on USUV replication, with no molecular data on its viral polymerase. Future studies are thus needed to elucidate the molecular determinants responsible for the different sensitivities of these flaviviruses to mutagenic nucleosides.
