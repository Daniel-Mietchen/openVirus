<p>It remains unclear whether ribavirin and favipiravir will elicit efficient antiviral mutagenesis in the central nervous system (CNS), with recent data showing different efficacies of these drugs in neuron-derived cell culture systems. While some studies demonstrate that ZIKV replication remains unaffected by these drugs in stem cell-derived neurons, other investigations have proven their inhibitory activity during the treatment of neural progenitor cell lines (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The different efficacies of these molecules could be linked to possible divergences in the cellular uptake or metabolism of nucleoside drugs in these cell lines. Thus, for the control of neurotropic disease, it would be desirable to identify mutagenic compounds with improved pharmacological properties in the CNS. Alternatively, a combination of mutagenic drugs that are effective in controlling the infection outside the CNS (favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil), together with effective inhibitors in the neuronal tissue (
