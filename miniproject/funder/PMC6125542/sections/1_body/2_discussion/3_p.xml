<p>Additional evidence hinting at molecular differences in ZIKV and USUV polymerase fidelity can be inferred from the mutation patterns found in viral populations after treatment with ribavirin (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We observed the typical dominance of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions in USUV and an unexpected prevalence of the opposite transition types in ZIKV (the [G-to-A + C-to-U]/[A-to-G + U-to-C] ratios were 4 and 0.5 for USUV and ZIKV, respectively). It has been suggested that the larger proportion of G-to-A and C-to-U transitions in viruses treated with ribavirin (included USUV) is possibly connected to the additive effect of mutagenesis by incorporation of ribavirin-triphosphate into viral RNA and depleted intracellular GTP pools as a consequence of inosine-5â€²-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibition by ribavirin (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). Although ribavirin-triphosphate is efficiently incorporated during viral RNA synthesis opposite to U and C, in such a low intracellular GTP concentration scenario, it may be preferentially incorporated opposite to C, hence leading to those biases (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). The dominance of A-to-G and U-to-C mutations in ribavirin-treated ZIKV populations suggests that its polymerase may be favoring a different base pairing behavior of ribavirin than in other viruses with independence on intracellular nucleotide pools. Other plausible scenarios may include differences in host cell rearrangements that indirectly affect virus mutability by the same drugs (e.g., alterations in the expression of cellular proteins associated with nucleotide uptake and its metabolism). Further investigations are needed to clarify the mechanism underlying these differences.
