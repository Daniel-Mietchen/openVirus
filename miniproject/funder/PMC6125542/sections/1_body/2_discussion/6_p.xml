<p>Our study also encourages the investigation of 5-fluorouracil as a therapeutic drug for the control of USUV infection in an eventual epidemic spillover to humans. Although severe disease in humans is rare, there is growing evidence that cases of neurologic disorders associated with USUV have been historically misdiagnosed as WNV (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). The diagnosis of disease caused by USUV is further complicated by the resemblance of pathology to WNV cases and the serological cross-reactivity in diagnostic tests (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). A mouse model for USUV infection has been recently established, and it represents a valuable tool to test the

 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). These studies can be extended to the potential treatment of severe disease caused by closely related flaviviruses, such as WNV and Japanese encephalitis virus, for which antiviral therapies are not available.
