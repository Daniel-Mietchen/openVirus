  <p>Treatment with mutagenic nucleosides leads to an increase in the mutation frequencies of ZIKV and USUV populations. Mutation frequencies found in ZIKV (A) and USUV (B) populations are represented as the average number of nucleotide substitutions identified every 10,000 nucleotides analyzed. (A) To analyze the ZIKV mutation profile, we isolated individual sequences from samples recovered after five passages in the presence of 200 μM 5-fluorouracil (FU), favipiravir (FPV), or ribavirin (RBV), 800 μM decitabine (DEC), or in the absence of any drug. Total viral RNA was extracted and RT-PCR amplified, and the individual cDNA sequences were isolated by cloning in the pCR-Blunt cloning vector following procedures described in Materials and Methods. A total of 29,818, 23,120, 22,497, 27,476, and 20,558 nucleotides (nt) for populations recovered after passage in the presence of no drug, DEC, FU, FAV, and RBV, respectively, were sequenced. (B) Mutation frequencies in USUV populations isolated after 5 passages in the presence of each drug at 800 μM. The mutation frequency values are based in the analysis of a total of 45,337, 33,947, 34,453, 34,218, and 25,897 nucleotides in populations collected after passage in the presence of no drug, DEC, FU, FAV, and RBV, respectively. Statistically significant increases compared to untreated populations are indicated (*,
