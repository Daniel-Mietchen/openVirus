  <p>Favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil inhibit ZIKV replication. (A and B) ZIKV titers obtained after infection of confluent Vero cell monolayers in the absence (drug concentration of 0 in the abscissa) or presence of each drug at the concentrations indicated. Cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01 and the supernatants collected at 32 h postinfection for titration. (A) ZIKV of Asian lineage (strain PRVABC59); (B) ZIKV African lineage (strain MR 766). Statistically significant differences are highlighted with asterisks (**, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; 2-way ANOVA). Every value represents the average of the results from at least three biological replicas (± standard error of the mean [SEM]). Decitabine (DEC) values are shown as black bars, 5-fluorouracil (FU) as dark gray, ribavirin (RBV) as light gray, and favipiravir (FAV) as white bars. (C) Replication kinetics of ZIKV (Asian lineage, strain PRVABC59) in the presence of different concentrations of decitabine (DEC). Every value represents the average from virus titer determinations of at least three independent biological replicas (± SEM). Each symbol illustrates a different concentration of decitabine used in the assay, as follows: diamond, 200 μM; inverted triangle, 400 μM; black circle, 800 μM. (D to F) Replication kinetics of ZIKV (Asian lineage) in the presence of FU (dark-gray squares), RBV (light-gray triangles), and FAV (white inverted triangles) are compared to those in untreated infected cultures (white circles, dashed lines). Every value is obtained from the analysis of at least three biological replicas (± SEM). Each panel depicts viral replication kinetics in the presence of inhibitors at different concentrations, 200 μM (D), 400 μM (E), or 800 μM (F).
