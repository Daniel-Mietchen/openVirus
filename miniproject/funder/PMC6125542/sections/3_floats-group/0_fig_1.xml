  <p>Cell toxicity after treatment with nucleoside drug analogues. The toxicities of decitabine, 5-fluorouracil, favipiravir, and ribavirin upon Vero cells were scored using trypan blue under the microscope. Different concentrations of each drug (200 μM, 400 μM, and 800 μM) were applied to individual cell monolayers. Cell viability values for untreated cell cultures are included in the analysis (represented as 0 μM drug concentration). Cell viability was quantified by determining the proportion of live cells (white) relative to the total (white and blue) in each well. The percentages of live cells after 24 h (A) and 48 h (B) of exposure to each drug at the concentrations indicated are represented. Statistical significant differences in viability rates found in treated cells relative to untreated cell cultures are indicated (*,
