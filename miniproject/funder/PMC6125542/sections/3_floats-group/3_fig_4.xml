  <p>ZIKV populations passaged in cell cultures treated with mutagenic compounds exhibit decreased specific infectivity. Specific infectivity values were calculated as the ratio of infectious virus units (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) to viral genome copies (quantified by qPCR) in every biological sample. (A) Values found in untreated populations (black bars) or populations treated with FU (dark-gray bars), RBV (light gray), or FAV (white) during three passages in the presence of each drug at 800 μM. The values are the averages of the results from three independent biological replicas (± SEM). (B to D) The values found during 5 consecutive passages in untreated populations (black circles) or populations treated with each mutagen at different concentrations (200 μM [light-gray squares] or 400 μM [white circles]) are represented. Each graph illustrates independent values obtained in three independent lineages for each drug and concentration tested, 5-fluorouracil (B), ribavirin (C), and favipiravir (D). Statistically significant differences are represented (*,
