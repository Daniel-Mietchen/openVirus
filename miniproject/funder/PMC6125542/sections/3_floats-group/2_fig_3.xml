  <p>Favipiravir, ribavirin, and 5-fluorouracil cause efficient extinction of ZIKV during serial passages in cell culture. ZIKV was serially passaged in the absence (black circles, dashed lines), or in the presence of mutagenic drugs at 100 μM (A), 200 μM (B and E), 400 μM (C and F), or 800 μM (D and G). Three independent lineages of passages were performed for each drug and concentration tested. Serial passages were carried out with 100 μl of the cell culture supernatant recovered from the previous infection passage (corresponding to 1/10 of the total volume collected). The different graphs show the virus titers determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assay (A to D) and the genome copy equivalents obtained by quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays (E to G) that were found along serial passages of ZIKV. A black diamond represents ZIKV titers found in the supernatants of cultures treated with decitabine (DEC); dark-gray squares illustrate 5-fluorouracil (FU)-treated series; light gray triangles, ribavirin (RBV); and white inverted triangles, favipiravir (FAV). Every value represents the average of virus titrations or viral genome copy equivalents (gRNA eq) from at least three biological replicas obtained from independent series of passages (± SEM). In panel D, individual values obtained from each lineage are represented to better illustrate independent events of virus extinction.
