<p>The way a pathogen spreads within a host has important implications for the successful establishment and maintenance of an infection, as well as the identification of therapeutic targets. BeingÂ cellular parasites, viruses have evolved different mechanisms to invade their corresponding target cells in order to replicate and spread infection. In general, these mechanisms can be categorized by two main modes of viral transmission, i.e., (i) cell-free (CF) spread by diffusing viral particles and (ii) direct cell-to-cell (CC) transmission between infected and uninfected cells [

While cell-free diffusion of viral particles allows the infection of distant cells, direct cell-to-cell transmission leads to local spread, avoids complex entry processes and is thought to have the potential to shield the virus from neutralizing antibodies and other antiviral clearance mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, the latter transmission mode is usually thought to be more efficient in spreading infection [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, CC is assumed to play an important role in the establishment of persistent infections and therapy failure [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The importance and contribution of each of the transmission modes to viral spread still has to be determined in detail. However, to address this question, a reliable quantification of the individual transmission kinetics is needed.
