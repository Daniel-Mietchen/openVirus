<p>To this end, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate viral replication and spread in a monolayer of cells. The simulated data allowed us to reveal the deficiencies of standard virus dynamics models when analyzing viral spread by cell-to-cell transmission. Based on these analyses, we developed an extension for the standard model of virus dynamics to allow for an appropriate quantification of the infection kinetics due to cell-to-cell transmission. Our novel approach adjusts for the decreasing proportion of infected cells contributing to cell-to-cell spread with progressing infection, which is especially important for viral transmission among stationary cells. In contrast to current models, our proposed model provides a more accurate quantification of the underlying infection dynamics. As such, our extension provides a means to account for viral transmission dynamics on a single cell level within the context of a model that remains applicable to common population-based experimental measurements that are used to quantify rates characterizing viral infection and spread. Additionally, we tested the ability of our novel method in comparison to previous approaches to infer the contribution of each of the transmission modes to infection spread and found that reliable approximations of these contributions depend on the diffusion rates of cell-free virus, with our novel approach leading to more appropriate estimates. Thus, our analysis provides an improved understanding of how to reliably quantify cell-to-cell transmission dynamics for various viruses spreading within solid tissue-environments.</p>
