<p>Our ABM-simulated data indicate a non-constant growth rate for foci of infected cells by cell-to-cell transmission among stationary cells. To better understand the dynamics of focus growth by cell-to-cell transmission over time, we consider a virus only capable of spreading by cell-to-cell transmission. Newly-infected cells can only appear next to already infected cells leading to large foci of infected cells. The larger a focus gets, the larger the proportion of cells that are completely surrounded by other infected cells and, hence, can no longer contribute to cell-to-cell transmission (
