<p>In summary, population dynamics models are able to provide a rough approximation for the proportion of cells infected by either of the transmission modes if viral diffusion rates allow for far-range viral spread, and in case one of the transmission kinetics can be quantified separately. In the case of high viral diffusion, there is generally no evidence for using the adjusted aCCF-model. However, if CF infection tends to spread locally, i.e., if viral diffusion rates are low, using the adjusted model aCCF-model is recommended as it provides far better approximations than the previously used CCF-model.</p>
