<p>Identifying the contribution of each of the transmission modes to viral spread could potentially be facilitated if one of the transmission rates is already known, or if it can be quantified based on separate experiments. Assuming that cell-to-cell transmission can be blocked, we simulated infection spread in our ABM only allowing for cell-free transmission. Fitting the standard model of virus dynamics (CF-model, Equation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00200-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). Specifically, in cases of low viral diffusion rates infection tends to spread locally, causing a model assuming mass-action kinetics for infection spread to provide a poor description of the dynamics. This could already be seen for local spread by cell-to-cell transmission (e.g.,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00200-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). Thus, a separate quantification of the rate of cell-free transmission is only appropriate in case of fast viral diffusion rates allowing far-range viral spread.
