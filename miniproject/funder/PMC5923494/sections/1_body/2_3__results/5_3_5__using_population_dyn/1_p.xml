<p>So far, we have only considered the spread of infection by cell-to-cell transmission and showed that the adjusted CC model (aCC) provides a good description of the underlying dynamics. However, during infection, both transmission modes most likely occur simultaneously. This leads to the question to which extent population dynamics models, as described by Equations (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1-viruses-10-00200">1</xref>) and (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD11-viruses-10-00200">11</xref>), are generally able to disentangle the contribution of each of the transmission modes to viral spread. To this end, we simulated infection dynamics allowing for simultaneous occurrence of cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission in our agent-based model. Hereby, infected cells produce virions that are exported to the extracellular space and diffuse through the simulated space before infecting other cells (see the Materials and Methods). Sampling the number of infected cells and the extracellular viral load at various time points, we then determined the ability of the different ODE models (Equations (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1-viruses-10-00200">1</xref>) and (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD11-viruses-10-00200">11</xref>)) to predict the proportion of cells infected by either cell-free (CF proportion) or cell-to-cell transmission as observed in the ABM-simulations.
