<p>We therefore tested if the simultaneous analysis of simulated data from systems considering either only cell-free or both transmission modes in case of fast viral diffusion allows us to disentangle the contribution of each of the two transmission modes to infection spread. We found that both models, CCF and aCCF, provide reasonable descriptions of the dynamics for infected cells and extracellular virus (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00200-f006">Figure 6</xref>F), both models slightly overestimate the proportion of cells infected by cell-free virus, although capturing the general dynamics (
