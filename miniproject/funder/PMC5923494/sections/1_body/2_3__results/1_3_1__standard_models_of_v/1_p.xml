<p>The standard model of virus dynamics has been extensively used to analyze time courses of infection. It describes the dynamics of the concentration of target cells, 
 <italic>T</italic>, infected cells, 
 <italic>I</italic>, and the extracellular viral load, 
 <italic>V</italic>, accounting for the infection processes and viral turnover [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00200-f002">Figure 2</xref>A and Equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1-viruses-10-00200">1</xref>) in the Materials and Methods for a detailed description of the model). In this model, the two infection processes of CF- and CC-transmission are generally described by mass-action kinetics dependent on the viral concentration, 
 <italic>V</italic>, and the concentration of infected cells, 
 <italic>I</italic>. Examining the latter term addressing cell-to-cell transmission in more detail, it becomes clear that all infected cells are assumed to always contribute to CC-transmission. However, this assumption is most likely violated for viral spread within spatially defined environments, especially for viral spread among stationary cells, as, e.g., in solid tissues.
