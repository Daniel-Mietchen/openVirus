<p>To test the ability of the basic model defined in Equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1-viruses-10-00200">1</xref>) to describe cell-to-cell transmission dynamics among stationary cells, we used an agent-based model (ABM) simulating viral spread in a 2D monolayer of cells. The ABM assumes cells to be distributed in a hexagonal grid, i.e., with each cell having six different neighbors, and accounts for intracellular viral replication and intercellular viral spread (see the Materials and Methods for a detailed explanation). For simplicity, proliferation and death of infected and uninfected cells were neglected. To concentrate on the dynamics of cell-to-cell transmission, we first studied infection spread by cell-to-cell transmission starting with a single infected and assuming unlimited target cell numbers.
