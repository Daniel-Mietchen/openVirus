 </inline-formula>, we compared the predicted proportion of cells contributing to cell-to-cell transmission (CC contributors) to the proportions inferred from the individual ABM simulations. We found that the aCC-model predicts a slightly higher proportion of CC contributors dependent on the focus size than observed in the simulations (
