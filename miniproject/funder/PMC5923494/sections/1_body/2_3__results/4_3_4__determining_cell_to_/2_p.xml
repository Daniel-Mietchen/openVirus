<p>To evaluate the appropriateness of our adjusted model to correctly infer cell-to-cell transmission dynamics given the simultaneous growth of multiple foci, we used our agent-based model to simulate viral spread assays that allow the initiation of multiple foci. According to previous experimental conditions [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we consider a monolayer of cells in which infection is randomly initiated during a time period of 17 h. After this initial infection period, the extracellular virus concentration is set to zero and cell-free infection is turned off, resembling the removal of medium and the addition of antibodies targeting the viral envelope in the experiment [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Infection is then assumed to progress solely by cell-to-cell transmission. As before, the total number of infected cells in the simulations is sampled every 24 h (see the Materials and Methods for a detailed description of the ABM). To compare the CC- and aCC-model in their ability to describe cell-to-cell transmission dynamics, we separate the two processes of initiation of infection and subsequent focus growth. Therefore, only the data after the end of the initial infection period are considered for the analysis, i.e., taking the number of infected cells 17 h post infection as initial condition.
