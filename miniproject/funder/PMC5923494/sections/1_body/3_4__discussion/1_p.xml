<p>Direct cell-to-cell transmission of viral material between infected and uninfected cells has been found to play an important role for various viruses, including hepatitis C virus, influenza and HIV-1 (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). As cell-to-cell transmission is thought to have the potential to shield the virus from host neutralizing antibodies and other viral clearance mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], it has been estimated that this route of transmission is much more efficient than cell-free viral spread [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, to reliably infer the contribution of this transmission mode for the spread of infection, appropriate mathematical models that analyze the infection dynamics are essential.
