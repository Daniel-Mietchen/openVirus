<p>As appropriate experimental methods to distinguish between cells infected by either route of transmission are lacking, mathematical models currently represent a feasible alternative strategy to estimate the contribution of each of the transmission modes to viral spread. However, disentangling the contribution of cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission to viral spread by population dynamics models in case of their simultaneous occurrence is generally challenging (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00200-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Our analysis based on simulated data indicates that our extended ODE model provides a better approximation for the proportion of cells infected by each transmission mode compared to previous approaches, when cell-free virus tends to spread locally (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00200-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). However, an underestimation of the proportion of cells infected by cell-free transmission at later time points is still observed, and is to be expected. Specifically, when viral diffusion rates are low growth patterns are more likely to resemble those relying on cell-to-cell transmission dynamics causing the contribution of cell-free transmission to be underestimated as it cannot be reliably separated from growth of foci by cell-to-cell transmission. Analysis of data from experiments where either cell-free [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] is inhibited can be used to quantify one of the transmission kinetics separately. This additional information clearly improves the quantification of the contribution of each of the transmission modes to viral spread. Hereby, the kinetics of cell-free transmission can only be reliably estimated by population-dynamics models if viral diffusion rates allow for far-range viral spread leading to non-local growth patterns. However, even with such prior-knowledge biased estimates can still be obtained as the mean-field approximations by ODE models can only insufficiently account for the effects both transmission modes have on each other (
