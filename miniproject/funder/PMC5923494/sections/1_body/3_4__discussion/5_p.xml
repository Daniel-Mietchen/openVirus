<p>Our novel approach represents a first step towards an improved quantification of cell-to-cell transmission dynamics within complex environments using ODE-based virus dynamics models. It is especially relevant for viruses spreading within solid tissues, such as hepatitis C virus within the liver [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Most importantly, the extended model formalism allows for consideration of viral spread on the cellular level, while remaining applicable to the standard population-based experimental data typically available for analysis (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], allow a more detailed description and analysis of the transmission kinetics, the complex data required to utilize such models is less often available, and the computational complexity of the models themselves can be limiting. In combination with the advances in computational methods that allow parameter estimation for such sophisticated models [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], these approaches could enhance the possibility to infer the kinetics and contribution of each of the transmission modes to viral spread for different pathogens and, thus, could provide necessary information for the development of potent antiviral strategies.
