<p>In the current study we show that standard population-based approaches fall short to explain viral spread within spatially defined environments given cell-associated viral spread. In particular for stationary cells, ODE models relying on mass-action kinetics to describe spread of infection by cell-to-cell (CC) transmission do not explain the observed dynamics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00200-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). This can be explained by the fact that such models assume that all infected cells are capable of contributing to cell-to-cell spread while the actual proportion is decreasing with increasing focus sizes. Spatial effects limit the proportion of contributors as soon as infected cells are completely surrounded by other infected cells. Models not accounting for this loss underestimate the actual transmission kinetics by overestimating the population of cells driving the spread of infection. Extending previous virus dynamics models by adding a newly developed adjustment term that accounts for this decreasing proportion of CC contributors over time, we were able to correctly describe the underlying dynamics. This novel approach provides more appropriate estimates for the kinetics of cell-to-cell transmission among stationary cells, with estimates for the cell-to-cell transmission rates being roughly 1.5-times larger than estimates relying on the uncorrected models. In this scenario, estimates based on mathematical models that rely on mass-action kinetics only provide a lower bound for the transmission kinetics as they tend to overestimate the cell population contributing to infection. To what extent this also applies for cell-to-cell transmission among motile target cells still has to be investigated. However, it has already been shown that the assumption of a well-mixed situation has to be taken with care if cell-cell interactions take time, and if multiple cells interact simultaneously [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. With the observed importance and assumed efficiency of a direct viral transmission pathway between infected and uninfected cells for several viruses, it is more important than ever to correctly account for this mode of transmission when analyzing viral spread.
