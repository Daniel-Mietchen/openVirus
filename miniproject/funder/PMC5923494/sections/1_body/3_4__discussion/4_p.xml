<p>For simplicity, our analysis explicitly concentrated on the viral transmission dynamics and neglected infected cell death and the turnover of uninfected target cells in the simulated data and analysis. As such, our approach could be especially relevant for non-cytopathic viruses, such as hepatitis B and C virus, where cell death can be ignored until effective immune responses are induced [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To which extent target cell turnover, as well as recovery of tissue could affect the dynamics and, thus, the appropriateness of our extension term, remains to be investigated. However, several theoretical studies including target cell dynamics already revealed the limitations of modeling approaches using simple mass-action kinetics in case of spatial effects [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In ecological and epidemiological studies, it has also been shown that the consideration of space for contact-dependent infection spread has important implications on the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Spatial separation of the susceptible population can lead to delayed and more reduced infection kinetics, as well as a higher likelihood of epidemics to go extinct [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A number of different modeling frameworks have been developed that study infection spread within populations and that have also been used to determine the effect of space in the context of viral spread within tissues. These modeling frameworks include meta-population models [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], pairwise-approximation or spatial moment equations [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], models based on partial differential equations [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and even sophisticated agent-based models and cellular automata [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, these studies mainly concentrated on the qualitative behavior of the systems due to the general difficulty of fitting them to experimental data. Nevertheless, they already revealed differences in the infection dynamics in comparison to non-spatial models and limitations for their assumptions [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, especially in the context of experimental systems of increasing complexity that mimic natural tissue structures [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], reliably accounting for space will be important when analyzing viral spread.
