  <p>Unrooted Bayesian-inferred maximum clade credibility tree of the RSV-A G protein gene. Posterior probabilities are labeled on major branches. Branches with a posterior probability equal or greater than 0.95 were considered to be strongly supported. Isolates from this study were labeled on their branches using colors correlating to their collection date (year). The X axis indicates the timescale (year). Vertical bar indicates subtypes of RSV-A. The GA2 subtypes were further divided into NA1, NA2, NA4, and ON1 clades. The overlap between NA1 and ON1 indicated an intermediated region that included both with and without 72-bp duplicated strains. Arrows indicated the duplicated strains (KX765894, KX765936, and KX765960) that clustered with non-duplicated strains. Details regarding the reference strains involved in the Bayesian trees are presented in Supplementary Fig.
