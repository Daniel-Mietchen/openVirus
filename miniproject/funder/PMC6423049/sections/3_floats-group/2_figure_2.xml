  <p>Unrooted Bayesian-inferred maximum clade credibility tree of the RSV-B G protein gene. Posterior probabilities are labeled on major branches. Branches with a posterior probability equal or greater than 0.95 were considered to be strongly supported. Isolates from this study were labeled on their branches using colors correlating to their collection date (year). The X axis indicates the timescale (year). Vertical bar indicates the 5 waves revealed from our data; each wave likely emerged from a surviving strain from the previous wave. The numbers below each wave refer to the sample collection dates for each specific wave, excluding reference strains. Arrows indicated the duplicated strains (KU316158, KU316172, and KU316105) that clustered with non-duplicated strains. Details regarding the reference strains involved in the Bayesian trees are presented in Supplementary Fig.
