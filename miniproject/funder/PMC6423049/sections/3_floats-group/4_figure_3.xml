  <p>Population dynamics of the RSV determined using the Bayesian skyline plot method. Skyline plots represent the population dynamics of RSV in Taiwan. The Y-axis indicates the effective population size, and the X-axis indicates the time (year). The bold line indicates the estimated mean of the effective population size, and the colored margin indicates the range of 95% HPD. 2a: Skyline plots of RSV-A in Taiwan. The horizontal arrows indicated the subtype replacement over time. The dash line indicated the estimated tMRCA of ON1 subtype. 2b: Skyline plots of RSV-B in Taiwan. The horizontal arrows indicated the wave replacement over time. The dash line indicated the estimated tMRCA of waves 3, 4 and 5. *Sample size in these years was less than 5 and may not be able to represent their diversity. Question marks indicated the years that have more than 25% samples were untypable and the effective population size may be underestimated.</p>
