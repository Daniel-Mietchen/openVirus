 </sup>. Although the genetic features of RSV have been investigated in many countries, the evolution of RSV G protein and its population dynamics in Taiwan remains unclear in Taiwan. In this study, we isolated 160 and 116â€‰G protein gene sequences of RSV-A and RSV-B representative strains, respectively, from 804 clinical samples and analyzed their phylogenetic relationship and population dynamics.
