 </sup>. There is a single RSV serotype and two major antigenic subgroups (A and B), based on monoclonal antibody detection of the G protein together with the F protein

 </sup>. Mature G protein comprise 3 regions: a cytoplasmic tail (amino acids [AAs] 1–38), a transmembrane domain (AA 38–66), and an ectodomain (AA 66–298)

 </sup>. ON1, an RSV-A genotype with a characteristic 72-nucleotide duplication in the G protein gene, was first identified in Ontario, Canada in 2010 and quickly spread globally

 </sup>. The specific RSV-B genotype, containing a 60-nucleotide duplication in the G protein gene, was termed “BA” for Buenos Aires in the late 1990s and has since been isolated from different graphic regions globally
