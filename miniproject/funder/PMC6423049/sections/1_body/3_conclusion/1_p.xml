<p id="Par17">In the present study, we employed the most recent information, collected over a long period, pertaining to RSV G gene isolates from children in the northern region of Taiwan from 2000 to 2016. By analyzing these samples, we estimated the tMRCA for currently circulating RSVs and the timescale of lineages and genotype replacement. Genetic variability between RSV strains is a signature characteristic that may alter the pathogenicity and fitness of the virus and contribute to its ability to cause repeated infections and outbreaks through immune system evasion.</p>
