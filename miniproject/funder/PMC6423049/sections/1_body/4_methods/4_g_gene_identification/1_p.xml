 </sup>. All samples were amplified through two-step RT-PCR by each primer set. Thermocycling was conducted on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) that had been programmed as follows: 95 °C for 10 mins for polymerase activation; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were 760 bp for RSV-A and 801 bp for RSV-B. The PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. All PCR products with correct size were sequenced using the Sanger method for subsequent phylogenetic analysis
