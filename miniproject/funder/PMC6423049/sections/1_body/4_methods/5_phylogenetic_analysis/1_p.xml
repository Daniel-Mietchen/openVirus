<p id="Par22">To estimate the evolution rate and reconstruct the demographic history of Taiwan strains of RSVs, 103 RSV-A and 92 RSV-B nucleotide sequences from GenBank and 276 isolates from this study were included in the phylogenetic analysis. DNA sequences were aligned by codon using MEGA5

 </sup>. Overall, 120 and 105 unique patterns were observed on the first codon, 128 and 125 on the second codon, and 153 and 169 on the third codon for the RSV-A and RSV-B, respectively. Phylogenetic trees of the G gene were reconstructed by Bayesian inference with the best-fit GTR + Γ model using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, and sequences were partitioned according to the 3 codon positions, through BEAST software package

 </sup>. A Bayesian skyline plot framework was introduced with a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal distribution (UCLD) clock model to estimate the change in effective population size over time. MCMC was performed with 300,000,000 generations and samples were recorded every 30,000 generations for each run and multiple runs were combined with 5% burnin until the effective sample size for each parameter exceeded 200. Bayesian trees were constructed from combined data for maximum clade credibility.
