<p id="Par19">Primary isolates were collected by obtaining throat swabs with sterile cotton buds and NPA fluids from all subjects within 48 hours of hospitalization. The specimens were preserved in standard transport media and inoculated on 4 cell lines (MRC-5 from fibroblast of human fetal lungs, Hep-2, A549 from laryngeal carcinoma, and RD cells from rhabdomyosarcoma) as a stock of respiratory viruses. Cultures exhibiting RSV-specific cytopathological effects were confirmed through reactions with immunofluorescent antibodies and immediately stored at −80 °C without any further passage.</p>
