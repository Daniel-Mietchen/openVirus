<p id="Par8">Bayesian skyline plots describing the population dynamics of RSV-A and RSV-B in Taiwan are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The results for RSV-A revealed a steady effective population until 2000, a slow decline in its genetic variation until 2005, a rapid recovery to the basal level in 2009–2010, and then a sharp decrease in 2012 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). By contrast, the effective population of RSV-B remained steady until 2008, followed by a sudden decrease, and then recovery to the basal level in 2010 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Both RSV-A and RSV-B subsequently demonstrated a significant increase until 2013.
