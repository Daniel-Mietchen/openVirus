<p id="Par9">To estimate the selection pressure that may emerge after recent coalescent events, NA1 and ON1 of the RSV-A Taiwan isolates, and wave 3 to wave 5 of the RSV-B Taiwan isolates were involved in the selection-pressure analysis. Putative selection sites that only appeared within the internal node were excluded. The results revealed 4 putative positive selection sites in both RSV-A and RSV-B Taiwan isolates. Residues under positive selection pressure are listed in TableÂ
