<p id="Par5">A total of 160 RSV-A and 116 RSV-B representative strains from Taiwan (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) were obtained and phylogenetically analyzed after removing the identical sequences. The nucleotide sequence involved in the phylogenetic analysis corresponded to 298–891 nt (100–297 a.a.) and 271–873 nt (91–291 a.a.) of G gene coding region from the RSV-A reference strain M11486 and RSV-B reference strain AF013254, respectively. Based on the G gene Bayesian tree, all known RSV-A subtypes were statistically supported by posterior probability (pp) of &gt;0.95. Of the 160 RSV-A strains, 20 belonged to GA5 (collected from 2000–2004), 2 belonged to GA7 (2002 and 2004), and 138 belonged to GA2 (2000–2016). Of the GA2 strains, 4 belonged to NA4 (2002–2003 and 2012), 6 belonged to NA2 (2000–2001 and 2007–2008), 80 belonged to NA1 (2004–2012), and 48 belonged to ON1 (2011–2016) (Fig.
