<p id="Par6">Although traditional RSV-B subtypes were not well supported on the RSV-B Bayesian tree, RSV-B strains revealed 5 continuously evolving lineages with high statistical support (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). During 2000–2001, waves 1 and 2 co-circulated in Taiwan, with 2 exceptions that were isolated in 2005 (excep.1 and except. 2 of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Wave 2, the initial wave of BA subtypes in Taiwan, became predominant after 2002. The RSV-B Taiwan strains isolated during 2004–2009, 2009–2015, and 2014–2016 were included in waves 3, 4, and 5 of the BA strains respectively.
