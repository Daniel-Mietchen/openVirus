<p id="Par16">Four positively selected sites were possibly involved in subtypes NA1 and ON1 of RSV-A, and in waves 3 to 5 of RSV-B strains in Taiwan strains (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The substitutions of amino acids D237A and L274P in RSV-A caused a loss of N-glycosylation sites. The 237 residue of RSV-A constituted a well-known immune escape hotspot, but did not demonstrate an altered on the binding affinity for antibodies

 </sup>. The E284 + 2K and L284 + 14P were located within the duplicated 72-bp region, and similar substitutions could be found in some reference strains that had been isolated prior to the duplication event (e.g., E262K and L274P in JX015486 and KF826838), suggesting that the duplicated region may have been subjected to the same selection pressure as the original fragment. The E284 + 2G, conversely, is a unique substitution that has only been observed in one strain (MF496482) isolated in 2015 from Taiwan. It is interesting to follow up whether it is a fixed substitution or not. The positively selected site, residues 274 of RSV-A and 255 of RSV-B, were consistent with the observations of a study that included all known strains before 2006
