<p id="Par12">According to the RSV-B Bayesian tree, wave 3 to wave 5 likely emerged as a consequence of the survival of a single strain from a previous wave (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The tMRCA of waves 3, 4, and 5 were dated back to 2001, 2007, and 2012, respectively; the results were exactly match the collection date of clinical isolates from their previous wave. Two exceptions were noted; excep.1 and excep.2 of the RSV-B strain were not observed in these waves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and both were isolated in 2005. On other hand, one of the NA4 subtype of RSV-A was isolated in 2012, 10 years after the NA4 subtype isolate last appeared in Taiwan. Both observations suggested that minor strains may still be circulating in Taiwan.
