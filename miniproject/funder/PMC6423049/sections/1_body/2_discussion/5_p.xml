 </sup>. The downward trend in the effective population size of RSV-A during 2000–2005 likely signified a loss of diversity because GA5, and both NA2 and NA4 of GA2 became less common or even disappeared from Taiwan. Explaining the increase in the effective population size of RSV-A in 2010 is difficult; however, the decrease that occurred in 2012 may be associated with the complete replacement of all circulating strains by an invading ON1 strain because of the gain of strong fitness conferred by 72-bp duplication and consequently reduced the overall diversity.
