 </sup>, thus establishing their population diversity as even greater than that of past lineages. In contrast to RSV-A, the steady phase during 2000â€“2008 signified the predomination of BA strains that had been conferred with gain of fitness through 60-bp duplication. The sudden decrease in the effective population size of RSV-B in 2009 likely corresponded to the shift of circulating strains from wave 3 to wave 4. Somehow, one strain that survived past wave 3 successfully recovered its effective diversity and became the founding strain of wave 4. The rise in the effective population of RSV-B in 2014 was likely associated with the coexistence of waves 4 and 5.
