<p id="Par11">We discovered that GA2, GA5, and GA7 were co-circulating during 2000–2004 and that GA5 was the most abundant strain in Taiwan. These results are similar to a study from Belgium in the same period

An estimation of time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) indicated that ON1 evolved from the progenitor GA2 subtype NA1 around 2009–2010 which is much later than the times reported by studies using a fragments of approximately 300-bp
