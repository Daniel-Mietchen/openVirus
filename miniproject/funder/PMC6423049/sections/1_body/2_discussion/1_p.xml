<p id="Par10">Samples involved in this study were randomly picked from viral stocks and the sample size did not reflect to the number of hospitalized patients. The detecting rate of RSV-A and RSV-B represent their proportion for each years (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The result suggested that RSV-A was the predominant subgroup circulating in northern Taiwan during the study period. All samples from the years 2012–2014 were double tested from the first step: retrieving of frozen supernatant from viral stock and still have unordinary (more than 25%) untypable rates. The virus evolves continually and the false negative rate of PCR genotyping is inevitably growing by time. Since all samples involved in this study were recruited from the RSV positive primary cultures, the untypable samples represented false negative rate of PCR typing (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For the 52 putative RSV-A and RSV-B co-infection samples, only 16 of 52 samples were confirmed as either RSV-A or RSV-B by sequencing (1 and 15 samples were confirmed as RSV-A and RSV-B, respectively). The sequencing results of these 16 samples for another genotype showed poor signals suggesting a possible false positive detection of the putative co-infections.
