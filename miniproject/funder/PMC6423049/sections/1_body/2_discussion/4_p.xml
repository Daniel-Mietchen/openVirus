<p id="Par13">The ON1 subtype is believed to have been derived from an NA1 strain through a single duplication event. Phylogenetic evidence supports the classification of majority of ON1 strains as a monophyletic group; however, a set of strains without 72-bp duplication were clustered with some ON1 strains (KX765894, KX765936, and KX765960) on the basis of robust statistical support and represented as an overlap between NA1 and ON1 on the RSV-A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) This phenomenon can also be observed in the wave 1 clade of RSV-B. Three reference strains (KU316158, KU316172, and KU316105) with 60-bp duplication are clustered with other non-duplicated wave 1 strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In another study, Schobel 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported the same circumstance in the RSV-A, and attributed the double occurrence of the duplication event. Their hypothesis was based on a later genesis of paralogs group TN1, which included a mixing of both the 72-bp duplicated strains and non-duplicated strains of subtype ON1
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. The group TN1, however, still shared a common ancestor with the ON1 exclusive group in their results. Furthermore, both RSV-A and RSV-B, the duplicated strains that clustered with non-duplicated strains did not form a monophyletic group in our results (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Therefore, we proposed another opinion: RSV requires approximately 10
 <sup>5</sup> viral particles for effective infection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, indicating that the duplicated strains may somehow co-circulate with normal strains as a minor part of the mixture from a replicative unit of quasispecies before emerging as the consensus sequence and therefore share the same evolutionary history with some non-duplicated strains
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. The duplicated strain clustering with non-duplicated strains represented an intermediate state before the duplicated strains become predominant and could be considered as the evolutionary relics that failed to fix the duplicated phenotype and therefore distributed at the overlapping part between the successful clade (i.e. ON1 and BA) and their progenitor on the phylogenetic trees. Under this scenario, the secondary occurrence of the duplication event is not essential and the duplicated strains will be contemporaneous and have rare or no progeny. This implied that rare or no sequences will present the same substitution pattern with these duplicated strains especially after years from their collection date and suggested that the occurrence of the duplication event might be close to the collection date of these strains. Therefore we collected and constructed alignments from most recent common ancestor of the overlapping region and nearest successful monophyletic group of duplicated strains from our dataset in chronological order to show the substitution pattern between the overlapping region and nearest duplicated strains (available in Supplementary Dataset). The substation patterns were showed in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). In the Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, the 72-nt duplicated strains KX765894, KX765936, and KX765960 that clustering with those non-duplicated strains were labeled. KX765936 and KX765960 showed some unique mutations, and shared a few similar mutations with KX765894 that were clustered together with two of our samples (R100-15 and R101-16). Both R100-15 and R101-16 do not have the 72-nt duplication and are not possible a cross contamination with KX765894 (collect from New Zealand), which implied they may share the same common ancestor. By doing BLAST for the analyzed region of this study, the sequences that exactly match to KX765894 were all from the same submission source including itself. No any sequence that exactly matches to KX765936 and KX765960 can be found in GenBank up till date. Within the 72-nt duplication region, both KX765894 and KX765936 were identical to the original version of the duplication region. KX765960 have a C to T substitution that similar to our sample R104-05-GA-TWN-2015 but without any other similar substitution in the rest part. In the Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, the 60-nt duplicated strains KU316158, KU316172, and KU316105, that clustering with those non-duplicated strains present only unique mutations, except the KU316158 have a C to T substitution within in the duplicated region that similar to substitution but without any other similar substitution in the rest part. No other exact matched sequences can be found by BLAST search. Since all the duplicated strains that clustered with non-duplicated strains were obtained from GenBank database rather than our own samples, it is difficult to confirm if these duplicated strains are artifacts in the sequencing assembly process. Nevertheless, our speculation may provide a new insight for future studies.
