We analyzed a total of 160 and 116&#x02009;G protein gene sequences of RSV-A and RSV-B representative strains, respectively, from 804 clinical viral stocks collected between July 2000 and June 2016. Population dynamic patterns of the RSV G protein gene were analyzed using Bayesian inference through the Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that RSV-A from Taiwan could be categorized into GA2, GA5, and GA7 lineages. GA2 of RSV-A could be further divided into NA1, NA2, NA4, and ON1 clades. These RSV-A lineages has been replaced over time, whereas RSV-B strains from Taiwan continually evolved from a single lineage with significant time-dependent waves. Four putative positive selection sites were observed in both RSV-A and RSV-B. The Bayesian skyline plot revealed that the local population dynamics of RSV were associated with lineage displacement events. Both circulating subtypes and population dynamics represented a unique local pattern. Our results affirm the necessity of continuing molecular surveillance of RSV to attain a more comprehensive understanding of epidemics.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004861</institution-id><institution>Mackay Memorial Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MMH-105-63</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chi</surname><given-names>Hsin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of acute respiratory tract disease in children younger than 5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

All samples from the years 2012&#x02013;2014 were double tested from the first step: retrieving of frozen supernatant from viral stock and still have unordinary (more than 25%) untypable rates. The virus evolves continually and the false negative rate of PCR genotyping is inevitably growing by time. Since all samples involved in this study were recruited from the RSV positive primary cultures, the untypable samples represented false negative rate of PCR typing (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For the 52 putative RSV-A and RSV-B co-infection samples, only 16 of 52 samples were confirmed as either RSV-A or RSV-B by sequencing (1 and 15 samples were confirmed as RSV-A and RSV-B, respectively). The sequencing results of these 16 samples for another genotype showed poor signals suggesting a possible false positive detection of the putative co-infections.</p><p id="Par11">We discovered that GA2, GA5, and GA7 were co-circulating during 2000&#x02013;2004 and that GA5 was the most abundant strain in Taiwan. These results are similar to a study from Belgium in the same period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. After 2005, however, GA5 faced decline in Taiwan and GA2 became the predominant genotype with the GA2 subtype ON1 eventually becoming the exclusive strain after 2013, merely 2 years after its first appearance in Taiwan (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The RSV-A subtype ON1 is trending toward predomination among circulating RSV strains after the genesis of a C-terminal duplication as well as RSV-B genotype BA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our ON1 strains were first identified in a sample collected in 2011, of which is also the earliest isolate in Taiwan. An estimation of time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) indicated that ON1 evolved from the progenitor GA2 subtype NA1 around 2009&#x02013;2010 which is much later than the times reported by studies using a fragments of approximately 300-bp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but is similar to the time reported by a study that analyzed G gene sequences using a fragments of approximately 600-bp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">According to the RSV-B Bayesian tree, wave 3 to wave 5 likely emerged as a consequence of the survival of a single strain from a previous wave (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The tMRCA of waves 3, 4, and 5 were dated back to 2001, 2007, and 2012, respectively; the results were exactly match the collection date of clinical isolates from their previous wave. Two exceptions were noted; excep.1 and excep.2 of the RSV-B strain were not observed in these waves (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and both were isolated in 2005. On other hand, one of the NA4 subtype of RSV-A was isolated in 2012, 10 years after the NA4 subtype isolate last appeared in Taiwan. Both observations suggested that minor strains may still be circulating in Taiwan.</p><p id="Par13">The ON1 subtype is believed to have been derived from an NA1 strain through a single duplication event. Phylogenetic evidence supports the classification of majority of ON1 strains as a monophyletic group; however, a set of strains without 72-bp duplication were clustered with some ON1 strains (KX765894, KX765936, and KX765960) on the basis of robust statistical support and represented as an overlap between NA1 and ON1 on the RSV-A phylogenetic tree (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) This phenomenon can also be observed in the wave 1 clade of RSV-B. Three reference strains (KU316158, KU316172, and KU316105) with 60-bp duplication are clustered with other non-duplicated wave 1 strains (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In another study, Schobel <italic>et al</italic>. reported the same circumstance in the RSV-A, and attributed the double occurrence of the duplication event. Their hypothesis was based on a later genesis of paralogs group TN1, which included a mixing of both the 72-bp duplicated strains and non-duplicated strains of subtype ON1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The group TN1, however, still shared a common ancestor with the ON1 exclusive group in their results. Furthermore, both RSV-A and RSV-B, the duplicated strains that clustered with non-duplicated strains did not form a monophyletic group in our results (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Therefore, we proposed another opinion: RSV requires approximately 10<sup>5</sup> viral particles for effective infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, indicating that the duplicated strains may somehow co-circulate with normal strains as a minor part of the mixture from a replicative unit of quasispecies before emerging as the consensus sequence and therefore share the same evolutionary history with some non-duplicated strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The duplicated strain clustering with non-duplicated strains represented an intermediate state before the duplicated strains become predominant and could be considered as the evolutionary relics that failed to fix the duplicated phenotype and therefore distributed at the overlapping part between the successful clade (i.e. ON1 and BA) and their progenitor on the phylogenetic trees. Under this scenario, the secondary occurrence of the duplication event is not essential and the duplicated strains will be contemporaneous and have rare or no progeny. This implied that rare or no sequences will present the same substitution pattern with these duplicated strains especially after years from their collection date and suggested that the occurrence of the duplication event might be close to the collection date of these strains. Therefore we collected and constructed alignments from most recent common ancestor of the overlapping region and nearest successful monophyletic group of duplicated strains from our dataset in chronological order to show the substitution pattern between the overlapping region and nearest duplicated strains (available in Supplementary Dataset). The substation patterns were showed in Supplementary Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). In the Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, the 72-nt duplicated strains KX765894, KX765936, and KX765960 that clustering with those non-duplicated strains were labeled. KX765936 and KX765960 showed some unique mutations, and shared a few similar mutations with KX765894 that were clustered together with two of our samples (R100-15 and R101-16). Both R100-15 and R101-16 do not have the 72-nt duplication and are not possible a cross contamination with KX765894 (collect from New Zealand), which implied they may share the same common ancestor. By doing BLAST for the analyzed region of this study, the sequences that exactly match to KX765894 were all from the same submission source including itself. No any sequence that exactly matches to KX765936 and KX765960 can be found in GenBank up till date. Within the 72-nt duplication region, both KX765894 and KX765936 were identical to the original version of the duplication region. KX765960 have a C to T substitution that similar to our sample R104-05-GA-TWN-2015 but without any other similar substitution in the rest part. In the Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, the 60-nt duplicated strains KU316158, KU316172, and KU316105, that clustering with those non-duplicated strains present only unique mutations, except the KU316158 have a C to T substitution within in the duplicated region that similar to substitution but without any other similar substitution in the rest part. No other exact matched sequences can be found by BLAST search. Since all the duplicated strains that clustered with non-duplicated strains were obtained from GenBank database rather than our own samples, it is difficult to confirm if these duplicated strains are artifacts in the sequencing assembly process. Nevertheless, our speculation may provide a new insight for future studies.</p><p id="Par14">The population dynamic patterns of RSV-A and RSV-B in Taiwan (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) are delayed by approximately 2 years in comparison with those of global RSVs, suggesting that a local epidemic may exhibit different dynamics from those global epidemics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The downward trend in the effective population size of RSV-A during 2000&#x02013;2005 likely signified a loss of diversity because GA5, and both NA2 and NA4 of GA2 became less common or even disappeared from Taiwan. Explaining the increase in the effective population size of RSV-A in 2010 is difficult; however, the decrease that occurred in 2012 may be associated with the complete replacement of all circulating strains by an invading ON1 strain because of the gain of strong fitness conferred by 72-bp duplication and consequently reduced the overall diversity.</p><p id="Par15">After 2 years, the nature of error-prone replication and quasispecies feature of RSV enabled the effective population to recover. Some lineages may have evolved thereafter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, thus establishing their population diversity as even greater than that of past lineages. In contrast to RSV-A, the steady phase during 2000&#x02013;2008 signified the predomination of BA strains that had been conferred with gain of fitness through 60-bp duplication. The sudden decrease in the effective population size of RSV-B in 2009 likely corresponded to the shift of circulating strains from wave 3 to wave 4. Somehow, one strain that survived past wave 3 successfully recovered its effective diversity and became the founding strain of wave 4. The rise in the effective population of RSV-B in 2014 was likely associated with the coexistence of waves 4 and 5.</p><p id="Par16">Four positively selected sites were possibly involved in subtypes NA1 and ON1 of RSV-A, and in waves 3 to 5 of RSV-B strains in Taiwan strains (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The substitutions of amino acids D237A and L274P in RSV-A caused a loss of N-glycosylation sites. The 237 residue of RSV-A constituted a well-known immune escape hotspot, but did not demonstrate an altered on the binding affinity for antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The E284&#x02009;+&#x02009;2K and L284&#x02009;+&#x02009;14P were located within the duplicated 72-bp region, and similar substitutions could be found in some reference strains that had been isolated prior to the duplication event (e.g., E262K and L274P in JX015486 and KF826838), suggesting that the duplicated region may have been subjected to the same selection pressure as the original fragment. The E284&#x02009;+&#x02009;2G, conversely, is a unique substitution that has only been observed in one strain (MF496482) isolated in 2015 from Taiwan. It is interesting to follow up whether it is a fixed substitution or not. The positively selected site, residues 274 of RSV-A and 255 of RSV-B, were consistent with the observations of a study that included all known strains before 2006<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>; an analysis was conducted before the emergence of the ON1 strain of RSV-A and wave 2 of RSV-B, suggesting that both sites were under strong selection pressure, irrespective of their lineages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par17">In the present study, we employed the most recent information, collected over a long period, pertaining to RSV G gene isolates from children in the northern region of Taiwan from 2000 to 2016.
