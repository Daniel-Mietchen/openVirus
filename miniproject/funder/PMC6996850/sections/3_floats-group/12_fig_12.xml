   <bold>A</bold> Validation of RNA-Seq data. Correlation plot of log2 transformed values of expression of genes in RNA-Seq and RT-PCR. Spearman rank Correlation coefficient value is 0.7788, P value 2.20E-16. The plus signs in the plot indicates genes with similar expression pattern (red) and genes with different expression pattern (green) in RNA-Seq and RT-PCR. Samples from healthy pregnant all trimesters, acute and convalescent phase non-pregnant patients and acute later trimester pregnant patients were taken for validation of RNA-Seq data. 
   <bold>Fig 12B</bold> Relative gene expression by SYBR green-based Real Time-PCR in different study groups. The XY plots represent normalized log fold expression of defensin genes (DEFA1 and DEFA4) estimated by Real-Time PCR and RNA Seq analysis when compared to healthy non-pregnant controls. 
   <bold>Fig 12C</bold> Relative gene expression by SYBR green-based Real Time-PCR in different study groups. The XY plots represent normalized log fold expression of S100A6, S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 genes estimated by Real-Time PCR and RNA Seq analysis, when compared to healthy non-pregnant controls in NPR-Acute, PR-2-Acute PR-3-Acute and PR-3-SC. 
   <bold>Fig 12D</bold> Relative gene expression by SYBR green-based Real Time-PCR in different study groups. The XY plots represent normalized log fold expression of immunoglobulin IGJ gene estimated by Real-Time PCR and RNA Seq analysis. PR-2-SC, PR-3-SC, PR-2-CONTROL and PR-3-CONTROL groups were compared with healthy non-pregnant controls while PR-2-Acute, PR-3-Acute groups are compared with respective healthy trimester controls using Taqman assay.
