  <title>Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in PBMCs of healthy pregnant controls and HEV infected patients.</title>
  <p>Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes with altered expression in healthy pregnant trimester 2 (C), 3 (D) control groups, sub-clinical (J and K), acute HEV infected pregnant trimester 2 (G) and 3 (H) and non-pregnant acute (E) patients as compared to healthy non-pregnant control group (A).A heat map illustrates two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of selected 384 immune-related genes identified as differentially regulated in early acute non-pregnant patients, pregnant women during trimester 2 and 3 with subclinical and clinical infection and healthy pregnant women in trimester 2 and 3 versus healthy non-pregnant controls. On the heat map the rows represent m RNA quantitation data (log2 transformed fold change) and the columns represent the RNA samples isolated from PBMCs. Increased and decreased expression of specific genes is illustrated by red and green, respectively, while black indicates no change.</p>
