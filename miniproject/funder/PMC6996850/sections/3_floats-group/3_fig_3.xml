  <title>Changes in gene expression and biologic pathways affected following HEV infection: Comparison of acute-phase, non-pregnant and pregnant patients with reference to the non-pregnant controls.</title>
  <p>Differential expression analysis in PBMCs from pregnant (PR-2-acute and PR-3-acute) and non-pregnant (NPR-acute) clinical patients as compared to healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-control). (A) Venn diagram showing the number of genes uniquely expressed by NPR-acute (orange), PR-2-acute (green) and PR-3-acute (violet) patients as compared to healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-control) and shadows of corresponding colors denote genes commonly expressed in the respective patient groups. (B) DAVID was used to identify over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Significant enriched GO terms of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in PR-2-acute, PR-3-acute and NPR-acute patients. The vertical axis is the GO category and the horizontal axis is–log P value &lt;0.05.(C) The enriched KEGG pathways of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in PR-2-acute, PR-3-acute and NPR-acute patients (P value &lt;0.05). (P value is modified Fisher’s Exact test P- value or EASE score).</p>
