  <title>Number of significant down-regulated genes among acute non-pregnant and pregnant HEV infected patients.</title>
  <p>Venn diagram showing the number of down-regulated genes uniquely expressed by NPR-acute (orange), PR-2-acute (green) and PR-3-acute (violet) patients and shadows of corresponding colors denote genes commonly expressed in the respective patient groups. Differential expression analysis was done by comparing the PR-2-acute and PR-3-acute patients with respective healthy trimester controls (PR-2-control and PR-3-control) and NPR-acute as compared to healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-control).</p>
