   <bold>A</bold> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the variation among all samples under study. PCA was done on log10FPKM values to assess sample similarity in each group and to identify outlier samples. (Tools: Base package of R). The alphabets in the plot indicate study groups. The proportion of the variance explained by the principal components is indicated in parentheses. The study groups are: A = NPR-controls, B = PR-1-controls, C = PR-2-controls, D = PR-3-controls, E = NPR-acute, F = NPR-conv, G = PR-2-acute, H = PR-3-acute, I = PR-1-SC, J = PR-2-SC and K = PR-3-SC. All the samples within groups are intact and there are no outliers. (Data for the first trimester i.e., groups B and I is not included in the present study). 
   <bold>Fig 1B</bold> Correlation Plot of all samples under study. Correlation analysis was performed on log10FPKM values. The plot shows the pair-wise Pearson's correlation coefficients between the expression values of the samples. Pairs of samples coming from the same group showed high correlation values (Tools: Lattice package of R). The alphabets in the plot indicate study groups. The scale bar indicates Pearson's correlation coefficients.The study groups are: The study groups are:(A):NPR-control, (B):PR-1-control, (C):PR-2-control, (D):PR-3-control, (E):NPR-acute, (F):NPR-conv, (G):PR-2-acute, (H):PR-3-acute, (I):PR-1-SC, (J):PR-2-SC and (K):PR-3-SC. All the samples within groups are intact and there are no outlier samples. (Data generated from groups B and I is not included in this study).
