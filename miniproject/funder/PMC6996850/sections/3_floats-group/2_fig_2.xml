  <title>Changes in gene expression and biologic pathways affected following HEV infection in acute and convalescent non-pregnant patients with reference to the non-pregnant controls.</title>
  <p>Differential expression analysis in PBMCs from NPR patients during acute (NPR-acute) and convalescent phase (NPR-conv) as compared to healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-control). (A) Venn diagram displaying numbers of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in PBMCs from NPR-acute and NPR-conv patients as compared to healthy non-pregnant controls (NPR-Control). The green and orange circle represents DEGs in NPR-conv and NPR-acute patients and shadow of corresponding colors represent overlapping genes between the two groups. (B) DAVID was used to identify over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Significant enriched GO terms of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in NPR-acute and NPR-conv patients. The vertical axis is the GO category and the horizontal axis is–log P value &lt;0.05. (C) The enriched KEGG pathways of differentially expressed up-regulated genes in NPR-acute and NPR-conv patients (P value &lt;0.05). (P value is modified Fisher’s Exact test P- value or EASE score).</p>
