<p>Importantly, for the first time, possible involvement of NOD1 signaling pathway in acute disease during the third trimester is shown. Association of NOD1 with subclinical HEV infection during 2
 <sup>nd</sup> trimester was pregnancy driven. Though NOD1 and NOD2 members of the NLR family are activated by specific bacterial peptides [

 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we report HEV-induced NLR activation. In the light of increased expression of NOD1 in hepatitis C patients [
