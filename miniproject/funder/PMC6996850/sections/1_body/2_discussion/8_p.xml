<p>Of note, RNA-seq data with respect to defensins, S100 and Ig genes was further confirmed by the gene-specific real time PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g012">Fig 12Bâ€“12D</xref>) strengthening the association of modulation of these genes with hepatitis E and clinical presentation. A single pregnant woman in the third trimester with fulminant hepatitis E showed downregulation of defensin and S100 genes. At recovery defensin expression increased while that of S100 remained low. This observation of lowered innate immune response needs to be confirmed with a large series.
