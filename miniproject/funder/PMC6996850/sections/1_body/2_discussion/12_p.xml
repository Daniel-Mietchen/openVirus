<p>The transcriptome analysis did not identify increased expression of mRNA levels of the cell-specific markers of immune cell types such as dendritic cells, natural killer cells and macrophages in any of the groups studied. However, the involvement of NK and NKT (NK cells carrying T cell receptor) was suggested by the increased expression of GZMM and CD1d genes respectively in the NPR patients. CD1d alone was detected in self-recovering PR patients during the acute phase and was part of pregnancy-associated immunomodulation. Previously our lab recorded higher proportion of activated CD16+ Cd56+/CD3+ cells in the NPR patients [

For RSV, LCMV, CMV and HSV1, a beneficial effect was seen. The role of NK cells in determining fulminant outcome of HEV infection needs to be evaluated. Similarly, our data pointing possible involvement of T regulatory cells in subclinical infection during 2
 <sup>nd</sup> trimester should be confirmed and extended to severe disease.
