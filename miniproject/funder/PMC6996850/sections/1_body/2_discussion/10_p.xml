<p>Overexpression of alpha defensins in hepatitis E patients (irrespective of pregnancy and clinical presentation) suggests definite role in protection. These small, cationic peptides have broad anti-microbial activity and the ability of human α-defensins to neutralize viruses has been described. Neutralization of the enveloped viruses depends on the disruption of viral lipid envelope, steric interference with receptor binding, interaction with cellular factors, or post-entry blocks [

 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Antiviral activity through potentiation of neutralizing antibody response adds to the possible mechanisms of alpha defensins-dependent immunity. The role of both alpha defensins and S100 series molecules need to be confirmed by functional assays and extended to fulminant hepatitis E. Response to vitamin D was uniquely associated with subclinical infection during 2
 <sup>nd</sup> trimester. Activated vitamin D is known to act as an immune system modulator preventing excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines, increasing “oxidative burst” potential of macrophages and stimulation of the expression of potent anti-microbial peptides including defensins present in neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells and certain epithelial cells.
