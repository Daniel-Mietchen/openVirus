<p>TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and TNF-
 <italic>β</italic> have antiviral activity and synergize with interferons in the induction of resistance to both RNA and DNA virus infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0228068.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The production of TNFs is induced by viruses; virus-infected cells are selectively killed by TNFs and this activity is accelerated by IFN-γ. The present study revealed that induction of TNF gene was associated with subclinical HEV infection in both the trimesters (4.8 fold and 4.2 fold respectively). During the second trimester, 1.7fold increase was seen in healthy controls and acute disease whereas no change was recorded during the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> trimester.
