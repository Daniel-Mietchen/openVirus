<p>To obtain an initial overview of gene expression patterns, we performed principal component analysis that clearly separated data between HEV infections in non-pregnant and pregnant patients in all the three trimesters and normal non-pregnant and pregnant controls (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228068.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), the acute disease was distinctly different, PR-2-acute and PR-3-acute separating from NPR-acute patients. The 2
 <sup>nd</sup> cluster was divided into trimester-dependent subclinical infections and pregnant controls. Clearly, the hierarchical clustering was based on HEV infection type and pregnancy duration. For this study, our analysis is restricted to immune response only. In view of the higher mortality during later trimesters, only 2
 <sup>nd</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> trimester were studied further.
