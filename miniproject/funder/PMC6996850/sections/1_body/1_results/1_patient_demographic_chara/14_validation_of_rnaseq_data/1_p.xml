<p>Validation of RNA-seq data using TaqMan-based quantitative RT-PCR showed excellent correlation (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.78,p- value 2.20E-16) suggestive of utility of RNA-seq in identifying targets that can be examined during subsequent studies employing appropriate experimental protocols (

 <sup>rd</sup> of the samples tested. A complete correlation was seen for the remaining genes.
