<p>There were large differences between the acute samples taken from NPR and PR patients relative to NPR controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228068.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). GO terms associated with the initial non-specific immune response such as chemotaxis, response to wounding and defense response were common to all the patient categories. Involvement of innate response in the PR patients was evident by enrichment of GO terms such as toll-like receptor signaling pathway, pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway, innate immune response-activating signal transduction, activation and positive regulation of innate immune response. Uniquely, patients in the third trimester enriched MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway, toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 signaling pathway.
