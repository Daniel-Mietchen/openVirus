<p>GO terms specific to proinflammatory cytokines (IL2, IL6, TNF), cytokine-mediated signaling pathway and regulation of chemokine production / positive regulation of chemokine biosynthetic process were common to both the PR patient groups while IL1(inflammatory) and IL12 (Th1) were unique to PR-3-acute. Both PR patient categories enriched GO terms associated with T cell responses. The PR-3-acute patients uniquely overexpressed GO terms such as complement activation classical pathway, humoral immune response, humoral immune response mediated by circulating immunoglobulin, activation of plasma proteins involved in acute inflammatory response. Overall, during acute phase, expression of immune response genes was higher and broader in the PR patients than the NPR patients exhibiting exclusive expression of non-specific immune response genes.</p>
