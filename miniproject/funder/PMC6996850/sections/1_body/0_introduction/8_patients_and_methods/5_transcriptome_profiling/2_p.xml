<p>Fresh blood samples were collected from all the study subjects in 10ml EDTA vacutainers (BD Biosciences, USA). Plasma and PBMCs were separated within 4 hrs of collection by Ficoll-hypaque gradient method. The PBMCs from all the study groups were immediately stored after isolation in RNA LATER at -80°C till further use. Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using RiboPure kit (Ambion, Life Technologies USA) and was subjected to quantitation and quality analysis using Nanodrop 1000A spectrophotometer and Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies, U.S.A.) respectively. Samples exhibiting high quality total RNA with RIN value &gt;9 were selected for further processing. Four RNA samples from a group were pooled (total RNA 2.5μg per sample).</p>
