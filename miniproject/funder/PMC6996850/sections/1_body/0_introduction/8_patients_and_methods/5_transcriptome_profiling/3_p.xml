<p>Single-end sequencing of whole transcriptome barcoded libraries from 200–500 ng of rRNA-depleted total RNA isolated from PBMCs was performed on SOLID V4.0 (Sequencing by Oligo Ligation and Detection) analyser, Life Technologies, USA. Briefly, mRNA enrichment from total RNA was performed by rRNA depletion method using RiboMinus Eukaryote kit v2. To each of the rRNA-depleted total RNA sample pools, 1μl of 1:10 dilution of ERCC RNA Spike-In Control Mixes (Ambion USA) reagent was added to assess the platform dynamic range and lower limits of detection.</p>
