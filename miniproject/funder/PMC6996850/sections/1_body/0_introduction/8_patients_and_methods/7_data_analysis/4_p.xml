<p>Reads were also mapped to ERCC sequences using Bowtie-0.12.8 ERCC RNA Spike-In control concentration values were transformed as per volume and dilution, which is 1 μL (1:10) for 300-400ng rRNA depleted RNA. ERCC Spike-in Log2 transformed concentration values and FPKM values were used to obtain dose response plots. All samples showed correlation value close to 2.0. Cufflinks v2.0.2 program was used to get transcript abundance estimates in terms of FPKM values. Expression levels were calculated based on kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (FPKM). To assess replicate similarity and to identify outlier samples, PCA and correlation plots were obtained on log10 FPKM values using R package. Differential expression analysis was done for all pair-wise comparisons using Cuffdiff (Cufflinks v2.0.2) and Cummerbund package in GenePattern. Variances in the expression levels were calculated using negative binomial distribution. P-values were adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg’s FDR correction. A gene/transcript was identified to be significantly differentially expressed if FDR corrected p-value was &lt; = 0.1. For comparative transcriptome analysis, only significantly differentially expressed gene/transcripts with fold change &gt; = (+/-) 2.0 were considered for the downstream analysis. Mean fold change value was calculated for each group and used for group comparisons. The gene ontology and pathway analyses were carried out using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and KEGG database. The differentially expressed genes (DEG) in all the study groups were enriched based on function using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment in DAVID with a EASE score cut-off &lt;0.05. KEGG Pathways with at least two genes and P value &lt; = 0.05 were considered as “associated” with respective groups examined. P-value is Modified Fisher's exact test p-value or EASE Score. The sequences generated during this study are uploaded in NCBI-Short Read Archive (SRA) under the Bioproject SRP100353.</p>
