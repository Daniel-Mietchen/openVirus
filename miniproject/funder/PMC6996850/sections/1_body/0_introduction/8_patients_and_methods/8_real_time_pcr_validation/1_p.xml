<p>Real Time-PCR validation was performed using individual TaqMan primer probes and SYBR green-based assays for selected genes. For TaqMan assay, 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 18S rRNA as the endogenous control were selected. These included: chemokines /receptors and cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CX3CR1,CXCR4, CCL3L3,CCR2, PF4), pattern recognition receptor (TLR8), proinflammatory cytokine (IL1B, IL8), Th-1 cytokine (IFNγ), cell adhesion molecule involved in T-cell activation (ICAM1), defense response to pathogens (DEFA4, ELANE, CAMP,PLAUR,TICAM1,DNASE2, IER3), transcription factors (JUN, PLAGL2, ZNF70), mitochondrial apoptotic inducer (IFI27), immunoglobulin gene (IGJ), co-stimulatory molecules (CD37, CD48 and PRDX5,WDTC1). TaqMan primer-probes were synthesized from Life Technologies, Thermofisher, USA. For SYBR green-based assay (FastStart Universal SYBR Green master mix (ROX)(Roche), antimicrobial peptides defensins (DEFA1 and DEFA4), S100 molecules (S100A6, S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12), immunoglobulin (IGJ) genes and 18S rRNA as the endogenous control were selected. Representative RNA pools were reverse transcribed using High capacity c-DNA kit (Life Technologies, USA) and further used for PCR amplification on 7300 Real Time PCR machine for both the assays. Relative gene expression values were obtained employing comparative Ct method using Applied Biosystems’ 7300 System SDS software. cDNAs from healthy NPR and PR controls were considered as calibrators for analyzing the relative gene expression in all the patient categories. Primers used for SYBR green-based assay are enlisted in (
