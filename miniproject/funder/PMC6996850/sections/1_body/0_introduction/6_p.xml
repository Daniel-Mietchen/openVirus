<p>In view of the time dependent immunologic changes during pregnancy [

RNA-seq is a powerful tool that provides unbiased, simultaneous profiles of gene expression and is particularly suitable to get an overview of differential, complex interactions of a very large number of genes. Such a global analysis is likely to identify mechanisms that need to be addressed further in terms of functional analyses.
