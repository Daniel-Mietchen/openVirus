 <p>In spite of the large-scale production and widespread distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs, viruses remain a prominent human disease. Recently, the discovery of antiviral peptides (AVPs) has become an influential antiviral agent due to their extraordinary advantages. With the avalanche of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, there is a great demand to develop a sequence-based predictor for timely identifying AVPs as this information is very useful for both basic research and drug development. In this study, we propose a novel sequence-based meta-predictor with an effective feature representation, called Meta-iAVP, for the accurate prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences. Herein, the effective feature representation was extracted from a set of prediction scores derived from various machine learning algorithms and types of features. To the best of our knowledge, the model proposed herein represents the first meta-based approach for the prediction of AVPs. An overall accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 95.20% and 0.90, respectively, was achieved from the independent test set on an objective benchmark dataset. Comparative analysis suggested that Meta-iAVP was superior to that of existing methods and therefore represents a useful tool for AVP prediction. Finally, in an effort to facilitate high-throughput prediction of AVPs, the model was deployed as the Meta-iAVP web server and is made freely available online at http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/ where users can submit query peptide sequences for determining the likelihood of whether or not these peptides are AVPs.</p>
