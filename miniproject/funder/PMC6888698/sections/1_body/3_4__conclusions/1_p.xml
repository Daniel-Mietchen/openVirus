<p>Owing to the medical significance and potential utility of AVPs as promising antiviral drug candidates, there is intensive efforts in the development of computational models for rapidly and accurately identifying AVPs on unknown peptides. In this study, we have developed a novel meta-predictor for AVP prediction called the Meta-iAVP. In constructing this meta-predictor, a feature representation learning scheme based on six different ML algorithms and five feature types were applied in model construction. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed Meta-iAVP model based on the feature representation learning scheme over models constructed by the aforementioned ML algorithms and features. Furthermore, to confirm the effectiveness of the Meta-iAVP model, we have also performed comparative analyses with other state-of-the-art AVP predictors. It was observed from rigorous five-fold cross-validation and independent validation test that the proposed model was more effective and promising for AVPs prediction. To maximize the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, the model was deployed as a web server that also goes by the same name, Meta-iAVP, which has been made freely available at

It is anticipated that Meta-iAVP will serve as a useful, high throughput and cost-effective tool for large-scale analysis of AVPs that would help contribute to a series of interesting follow-up research studies involving antiviral peptides and other related therapeutic peptides. Although, Meta-iAVP displayed a superior performance over that of existing methods as assessed by rigorous cross-validation methods, there is still room for further improvements. For example, to improve the usefulness and efficacy for drug development and experimental research, we will make an effort to develop a computational model for predicting the inhibition of specific viruses in future studies.
