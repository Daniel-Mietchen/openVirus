<p>In an effort to maximize the utility of the prediction model by the scientific community, we have deployed the predictive model as a web server that is also called the Meta-iAVP (i.e., using the best model as described in previous sections). The web interface of the web server was established using the Shiny package under the R programming environment. The web server is freely accessible at 
 <uri xlink:href="http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://codes.bio/meta-iavp/</uri>. Screenshots of the Meta-iAVP web server are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f007">Figure 7</xref> in which panel A shows the web server prior to submission of input data and panel B shows the web server after the prediction has been made.
