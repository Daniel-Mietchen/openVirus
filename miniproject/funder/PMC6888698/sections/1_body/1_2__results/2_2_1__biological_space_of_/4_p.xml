 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> was Serine (Ser) which plays an essential role in several cellular and metabolic processes [
 <xref rid="B65-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, as previously mentioned, Ser also makes up an important component of virus-encoded serine/threonine kinases [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, an extensively studied and well-known AMP, lactoferrin, is recognized as a potent inhibitor of various viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus types one and two, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. One such study conducted by Scala et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], examined in detail the structure of lactoferrin-derived peptides and their activity against influenza virus using protein-protein interactions. In addition, all the peptide fragments tested were derived from the Ser418-Pro429 loop which formed a structural conformation that was critical for the resulting peptide activity. The authors noted that the presence of Ser was observed in the top three active peptide fragments. Hence, the presence of Ser in terms of formation of effective peptides for antiviral activity is highly advantageous.
