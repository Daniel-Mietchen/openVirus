<p>Interestingly, three of the five top-ranked informative amino acids from both

 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, are common and represent polar amino acids (i.e., Lys, Thr, and Ser), while the other amino acids are non-polar and hydrophobic residues (i.e., Leu and Ile for the experimental dataset and Pro for the random Non-AVP dataset). As stated, the top ranked amino acid, Lysine (Lys) was observed in both the experimentally validated dataset as well as the random Non-AVP dataset. Being a basic residue, Lys is abundantly found in the composition of therapeutic peptides due to its ability to enhance the electrostatic properties that facilitate the interaction and insertion of peptides into the anionic cell walls and phospholipid membranes of microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B54-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported the antiviral role of a cationic peptide, α-defensin which was described as inhibiting a number of viruses including herpes simplex virus types one and two, cytomegalovirus as well as inhibiting the vesicular stomatitis virus with human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1) in vitro. Since then, many reports have shown antiviral activity of cationic host-defense peptides such as α-defensins (i.e., HNP-1, HNP-2, HNP-3, and HNP-4), β-defensins (i.e., HBD-2 and HBD-3), and θ-defensin (i.e., Retrocyclin-2), and the use of effective antiviral therapy with cathelicidins (i.e., LL-37), as previously reviewed [

 <xref rid="B59-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Furthermore, Mandelboim et al. observed that the initiation of lysis via natural killer cells by the P8 epitope of coxsackie viral peptide was pronounced with Lys as compared to other basic amino acid residues such as Arg or His [
