<p>Threonine (Thr) is another common amino acid observed between the two datasets of 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Thr plays an essential role in the phosphorylation of virus-encoded serine/threonine kinases, a unique feature of large DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This important phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein by interfering with its enzymatic activity, cellular location, and/or association with other proteins [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, a disruption of this property could hinder the efficient spread of the virus. This notion was also elucidated in a study conducted by Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] on a nuclear shuttle protein (NSP)-interacting kinase (NIK1) which acts as a receptor-like kinase identified as a virulence target of the begomovirus NSP. The authors conducted mutagenesis on residues Thr-474 and Thr-468 on the A-loop of the NIK1 and observed that these mutations impaired autophosphorylation and were unable to attain kinase activation. In addition, Hale et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] reported that an Ala substitution of Thr-215 of the NS1 protein phosphorylation mechanism caused a disruption in viral propagation of human influenza A virus. Similarly, Hemonnot et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] conducted mutational analysis of HIV mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK-2) by substitution of Thr-23 to Ala-23. The resulting electron microscopy and western blot analysis showed that the substitution of a single Thr-23 residue, which provided an essential function in the release of viral particles from the cell surface, was disrupted. Thus, from the aforementioned studies, it is clear that Thr is extremely vital for proper kinase phosphorylation of viral proteins which further allow for efficient viral budding from infected cells.
