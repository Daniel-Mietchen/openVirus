<p>To demonstrate the superiority and capability of our proposed model, we compared the aforementioned prediction results with the meta-predictor. 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows that the overall Ac and MCC values obtained from the meta-predictor are 4–9% and 9–17%, respectively, which are higher than those resulting from 
 <italic>k</italic>-NN, rpart, glm, RF, XGBoost, and SVM models on both V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> datasets. It could be stated that our proposed meta-predictors are justified as the more powerful and highly efficient AVP predictor. For convenience of the subsequent description, we will refer to these two meta-predictors as Meta-iAVP.
