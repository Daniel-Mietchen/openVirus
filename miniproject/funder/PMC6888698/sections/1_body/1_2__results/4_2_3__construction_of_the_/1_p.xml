<p>In general, the meta-predictor utilizes an important pattern from the predicted output derived from different predictors under the assumption that using combined methods will provide substantially accurate prediction results than a single method [

 <xref rid="B71-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. As described above, AAC and PseAAC are the most important features for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs. Thus, to verify the power of these two features in AVP prediction, the six ML models are trained with the AAC and PseAAC features for performing on the benchmark datasets T

 <sup>60p+60n</sup> with the highest Ac, Sn, Sp, and MCC of 91.53%, 90.00%, 93.10%, and 0.83, respectively. Therefore, the AAC and PseAAC features were used as the initial features for constructing the new feature representation to train the meta-predictor, as summarized in the
