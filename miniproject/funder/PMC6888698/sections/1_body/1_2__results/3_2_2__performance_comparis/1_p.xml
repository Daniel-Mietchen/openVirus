<p>To assess the effectiveness of each feature in discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs, the five-fold CV and independent validation test were conducted for each feature by performing six commonly used ML models.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the average Ac over the five-repeated five-fold CV on T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> datasets are (78.52%, 78.72%, 79.69%, 78.68%, and 77.04%) and (84.91%, 84.88%, 85.28%, 82.19%, and 86.44%) for ACC, PseAAC, Am-PseAAC, DPC, and GDC, respectively. The average Ac of each type of feature was obtained by averaging six Ac values derived from six ML algorithms over the five-repeated five-fold CV and independent validation test. Meanwhile, the performance comparisons on the independent validation datasets V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> were (80.29%, 83.17%, 79.01%, 79.49%, and 77.41%) and (86.16%, 86.44%, 85.88%, 86.02%, and 84.59%) for ACC, PseAAC, Am-PseAAC, DPC, and GDC, respectively. For performance comparisons among the six ML models, the prediction results showed that average Ac over the five-repeated five-fold CV and independent test results on T

 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> datasets were (80.55%, 76.36%, 74.46, 86.86%, 85.93%, and 85.65%) and (82.16%, 78.00%, 74.09%, 86.86%, 85.93%, and 85.65%), respectively.
