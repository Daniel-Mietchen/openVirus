<p>By observing the performance comparisons in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f005">Figure 5</xref>, it could be summarized as follows: (i) ACC and DPC features did not afford better performance than other three predictors but they provide more interpretability for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs, which is helpful for biologists in designing novel peptides. This observation is quite consistent with previous works [

 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; (ii) the top three most powerful ML models over the five-repeated five-fold CV and independent test are RF, XGBoost, and SVM; and (iii) these prediction results demonstrate that the three top-ranked important features in discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs are PseAAC, AAC, and DPC, where AAC and PseAAC are the most beneficial features for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs on the benchmark datasets T
