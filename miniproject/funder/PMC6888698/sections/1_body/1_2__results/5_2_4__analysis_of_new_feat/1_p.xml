 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the improved performances of the proposed model was achieved due to the method that takes new feature representation as the input feature and the meta-predictor as the prediction engine. In the previous sub-section, the AAC and PseAAC were mentioned as the optimum features amongst the five popular-used features, thus, these two features were used to compare with the new feature representation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new feature representation, the principle component analysis (PCA) approach is used to compare the distribution of AVPs (red circles) and Non-AVPs (blue circles) by representing them with PCA scores as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f006">Figure 6</xref>. In this study, PCA analysis was performed using the FactorMineR R package [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] in R programing environment. To perform PCA analysis, T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> datasets were represented by the first two PCs (PC1 and PC2), where the percentage of variance can be explained by the first two PCs where high percentage values is suggestive of the feature importance for the predictive model. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,c depict the distribution of AAC and a new feature representation, respectively, obtained from the dataset T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup>, while 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,d represent the distribution of PseAAC and a new feature representation, respectively, obtained from T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> dataset. It should be noted that, more overlap between the red and blue circles indicate the feature is less capable in AVP prediction. Remarkably, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05743-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d revealed that the new feature representation is efficient and effective as the input feature for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs. This might explain why the proposed model, Meta-iAVP, outperformed the other conventional models.
