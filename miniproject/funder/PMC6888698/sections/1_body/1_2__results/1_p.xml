<p>In this study, AVPs and Non-AVPs were predicted by the proposed method Meta-iAVP. Firstly, the importance of each amino acid to antiviral activities of peptides using mean decrease of Gini index (MDGI) and univariate analysis were performed. Secondly, the features that are beneficial for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs were determined by conducting performance comparisons between five types of features, i.e., AAC (20D), DPC (400D), GDC (400D), PseAAC (20 + 2λ), and Am- PseAAC (20 + 2λ), and six commonly used ML algorithms. Thirdly, Meta-iAVP based on the meta-predictor was constructed by using the new feature representation as the input feature. Finally, to serve easy and rapid classification of query peptide sequence, Meta-iAVP is exploited as a free prediction web server for discriminating AVPs and Non-AVPs.
