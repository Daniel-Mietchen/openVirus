<p>To indicate the effectiveness of Meta-iAVP, we benchmarked it against the three state-of-art AVP predictors namely AVPpred [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Chang et al.’s method [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and AntiVPP 1.0 [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Among the three AVP predictors, only AVPpred and Chang et al.’s method provided the prediction results over five-fold CV and independent test results on T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup>. In view of this, we only performed comparisons between Meta-iAVP with AVPpred and Chang et al.’s method. The overall performance comparisons of Meta-iAVP with other three existing methods over five-fold CV and independent test results on T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> are shown in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The pioneer work on the benchmark datasets was firstly reported by Thakur et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Initially, they provided prediction results (Ac, MCC) on the independent dataset V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> with (85.70%, 0.71) and (92.50%, 0.85), respectively. Later on, Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] utilized the RF model cooperating with their proposed features to enhance the prediction performance. Their prediction model yielded (89.50%, 0.79) and (93.30%, 0.87) on the independent datasets V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup>, respectively, indicating that Chang et al.’s method outperformed AVPpred. Meanwhile, as noticed in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, our proposed model Meta-iAVP achieved the best performances in terms of Ac, Sn, and MCC (V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup>, V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup>) of (95.20%, 94.90%), (93.20%, 98.30%), and (0.90, 0.90), respectively. Remarkably, Ac and MCC of Meta-iAVP were approximately 3.3–11.0% and 3.0–11.0% higher than the three state-of-art AVP predictors, thus demonstrating the superiority of our proposed predictor.
