<p>With regard to the performance comparison as discussed in the two previous sub-sections, the consistent performance comparison over five-fold CV and independent validation test demonstrates that the proposed Meta-iAVP could accurately discriminate AVPs from Non-AVPs on unknown peptides. In particular, its high MCC value indicates that this new AVP model could effectively reduce the number of both false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) as well as narrow down experimental efforts. As our proposed model outperformed the other existing methods, it is reasonable due to the following aspects: (i) amongst various types of features employed in this study, PseAAC and Am-PseAAC features are firstly employed in AVP prediction. Many studies reported that these two feature have been successfully implemented to predict many peptides and proteins [

On the other hand, we used only six-dimensional (6D) feature vectors that provided not only sufficient but also comprehensive information for AVP prediction; and (iv) our final meta-predictor was constructed by taking advantage of feature learning scheme. As seen in
