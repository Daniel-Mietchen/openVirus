 <sup>1</sup> and lamda
 <sup>1</sup>) and Am-PseAAC (weight
 <sup>2</sup> and lamda
 <sup>2</sup>) were optimized by varying weight and lambda values from 0 to 1 and 1 to 10 with step sizes of 0.1 and 1, respectively, on the whole T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> datasets as assessed by a 5-fold CV procedure. More details of how to estimate such parameters can be found elsewhere [
