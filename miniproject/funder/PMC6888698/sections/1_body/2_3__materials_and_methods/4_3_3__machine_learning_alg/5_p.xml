<p>RF was constructed according to the described original RF algorithm [

 <xref rid="B102-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. This model is an ensemble model consisting of many classification and regression tree (CART) classifiers to perform classification and regression tasks and improves prediction performances of CART classifiers by growing a number of weak CART classifiers. RF utilizes the concepts of bagging and random feature selection. The prediction result of the classification task is obtained by using a simple voting among outputs of all trees to get one final prediction. In regression, a final prediction is the average of prediction results of many decision trees. Herein, the RF classifier was established using the randomForest package in the R software [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. To enhance the performance of the RF model, two parameters namely ntree (i.e., the number of tree used for constructing the RF classifier) and mtry (i.e., the number of random candidate features) were determined using the caret R package [
 <xref rid="B100-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] with a five-fold CV approach. The search space of ntree and mtry are (100,500) and (1,10) with the steps of 100 and 1, respectively.
