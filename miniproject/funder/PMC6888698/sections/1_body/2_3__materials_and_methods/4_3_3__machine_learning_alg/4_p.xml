<p>The glm method is one of the most useful ML algorithms used for classification and regression tasks, because it can be applied to many different types of domains. This method is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows the output variables having error distribution models rather than a normal distribution. The glm method attempts to determine the relationship between a set of features and classes by fitting a linear equation to a dataset consisting of labeled peptide
