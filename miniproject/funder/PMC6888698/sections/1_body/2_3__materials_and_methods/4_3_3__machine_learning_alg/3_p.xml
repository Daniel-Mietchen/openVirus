<p>The rpart method has been developed since the 1980s [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. This method uses recursive partitioning for classification, regression and survival trees. This method can be used to build classification or regression models using two main steps. Firstly, the single feature which provides the best split for the dataset into two groups is identified. After that, each dataset in further divided into two groups as a sub-group, and so on recursively until a particular stopping criterion is reached, i.e., either reaching a minimum size or on improvement can be made. The second step is to resample a dataset and trim back to full tree.
