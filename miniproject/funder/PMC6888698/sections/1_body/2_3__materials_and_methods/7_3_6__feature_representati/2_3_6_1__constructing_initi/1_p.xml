<p>As mentioned above, each peptide sequence was extracted as a numerical representation based on AAC, PseAAC, Am-PseAAC, DPC, and GDC called initial features. The parameters of PseAAC (weight
 <sup>1</sup> and lamda
 <sup>1</sup>) and Am-PseAAC (weight
 <sup>2</sup> and lamda
 <sup>2</sup>) were optimized by varying weight and lambda values from 0 to 1 and 1 to 10 with step sizes of 0.1 and 1, respectively, on the benchmark datasets T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> as assessed by a five-fold CV procedure. In this study, values of weight
 <sup>1</sup>, weight
 <sup>2</sup>, lamda
 <sup>1</sup>, and lamda
 <sup>2</sup> as performed on the benchmark datasets T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> are (0.6, 0.1, 3, and 4) and (0.6, 0.2, 4, and 3), respectively. Meanwhile, the parameter of GDC feature (
 <italic>g</italic>-gap) were optimized by choosing from one to five as assessed by a five-fold CV procedure. The optimum values of 
 <italic>g</italic> on the benchmark datasets T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> are one and three, respectively.
