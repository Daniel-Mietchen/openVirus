<p>Firstly, the initial features for each type of feature were exploited to train six ML models (i.e., 
 <italic>k</italic>-NN, rpart, glm, RF, XGBoost, and SVM) using the two benchmark datasets and five-fold CV for generating the predicted label. Secondly, for each type of feature, the new feature representation O(M) was obtained by concatenating all the predicted labels from the six ML models. In our experiment, the predicted label is represented with either the value of 0 or 1, where 1 and 0 represent the predicted results as AVPs and Non-AVPs, respectively. Finally, for a given peptide sequence P, the sequence P is represented with a new 6D feature vector.
