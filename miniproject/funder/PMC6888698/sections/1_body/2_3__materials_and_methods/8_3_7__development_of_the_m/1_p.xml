<p>The best predictive model was deployed as a web server by harnessing the Shiny R package to craft the web interface. Firstly, the web server accepts as input the input sequence in FASTA format (i.e., either by from the input text box or from the uploaded FASTA file). Secondly, upon submission of the input sequence by invoking the Submit button, the query sequences are subjected to descriptor calculation and subsequently applied to the predictive model described previously. The resulting prediction of the class labels (i.e., as either AVP or Non-AVP) along with their probability values are displayed in the prediction output box. Results from the prediction process is also provided as a CSV file upon invoking the Download button found directly underneath the output box.</p>
