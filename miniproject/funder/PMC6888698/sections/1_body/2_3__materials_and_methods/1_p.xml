<p>In practice, the prediction of peptide function is quite difficult and hard, particularly in dealing with a complicated biological system. Nevertheless, the development of an accurate prediction method might be deemed rewarding and successful if it could help provide some useful information. Thus, the present study was devoted to develop a new meta-predictor for discriminating AVPs from Non-AVPs in peptide sequences. To establish a really useful computational method for a biological system, we followed Chouâ€™s five-step guidelines mentioned in [

Below, we describe in detail how to deal with these steps one by one. Furthermore,
