<p>Antiviral peptides (AVPs) is a subset belonging to the group of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and in that regard, exhibits antiviral activity. As of 23 September, 2019, the antimicrobial database (APD3) contains a total of 3129 AMPs, out of which, 188 are antiviral peptides [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, another database of antimicrobial peptides, DRAMP 2.0, contains 19,899 entries which consist of general, patent, and clinical AMPs [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, a database focused solely on antiviral peptides contains 2683 experimentally verified AVPs including 624 modified AVPs [

 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] as well as therapeutic peptides [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, it is evident that peptide-based research is gaining momentum. In some cases, a given peptide shows more than one activity and is, therefore, called a promiscuous peptide (i.e., showing dual antimicrobial and antiviral effects). In addition, AVPs have been shown to possess cationic and amphipathic characteristics with positive net charges, all of which are essential for these peptides to work as antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, hydrophobicity seems to be a key property for peptides with activity against enveloped viruses [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To date, Fuzeon™ (Enfuvirtide), a synthetic peptide that blocks viral fusion by binding to gp41 (polypeptide chain) of HIV type-1 envelope protein is the only peptide to have been commercialized [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, Bulevirtide™ (Myrcludex B), an anti-Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D peptide targeting sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) of liver cells, has also been studied in a phase IIb clinical trial [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and is scheduled for phase III trials [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The structure of some AVPs that have already been elucidated experimentally, are shown in
