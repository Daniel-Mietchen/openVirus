<p>Furthermore, there are several mechanisms of action whereby antiviral therapeutic agents can inhibit viral activity (i.e., block the attachment of viruses, prevent fusion of viruses to host cells, interrupt the signaling process of viruses, or inhibit the replication of viruses in host cells) [

 <xref rid="B32-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; while others have shown that AVPs interfere with viral replication [

 <xref rid="B35-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and attachment of the virus to host cells [

For example, P9, an AVP derived from mouse Î²-defensin acts against various flu strains (i.e., H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9) by binding to viral glycoproteins and inhibiting RNA replication through the prevention of viral fusion in the endosome [

Additionally, protegrin-1, a cyclical cationic peptide derived from swine white blood cells, showed potent antiviral activity against dengue virus by inhibiting the specific viral protease important for dengue virus replication, named NS2B-NS3pro [

Hence, accurately identifying the biological activities of peptides provides great importance for the exploration of the mechanism of action of AVPs and the development of antiviral drugs. However, the experimental approaches are still very slow, inefficient, and expensive. Besides, with the rapid explosion of newly-found peptide sequences in the post-genomic era, the peptide sequences in various database are rapidly increasing day by day. In that regard, bioinformatics-based tools are crucial for efficient analysis of the ever-increasing availability of data. Thus, it is in a great demand to develop a prediction model based on an efficient machine learning algorithm for fast and reliably identifying the biological activities of peptides according to their primary sequences. This process could further shed light on novel AVPs having potent clinical outcomes.
