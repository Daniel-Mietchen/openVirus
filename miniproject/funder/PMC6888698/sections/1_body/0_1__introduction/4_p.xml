<p>Until now, there are four prediction models based on various machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been developed for AVP prediction, i.e., AVPpred [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Chang et al.’s method [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Zare et al.’s method [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and AntiVPP 1.0 [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Three of the four prediction models [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were performed on the same benchmark datasets, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-05743-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Initially, Thakur et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] was the first to propose a prediction model for AVP prediction called AVPred as well as established the two benchmark datasets T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup>. AVPred was constructed by using a support vector machine (SVM)-based model with physicochemical properties from the AAindex database. AVPred provided moderate prediction accuracies on the independent datasets V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> of 85.7% and 92.5%, respectively. Shortly afterward, Chang et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] utilized a combination feature of amino acid composition (AAC) and aggregation tendencies to develop a random forest (RF) model. Their prediction model achieved higher prediction accuracies as compared to AVPred with 89.5% and 93.3% for T
 <sup>544p+407n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+45n</sup> and T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> datasets, respectively. Recently, Lissabet et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] proposed a computation tool based on RF in conjunction with various physicochemical properties called AntiVPP 1.0. In their experimental setting, AntiVPP 1.0 was developed using one of the two benchmarked datasets, i.e., T
 <sup>544p+544n</sup> + V
 <sup>60p+60n</sup> and obtained a prediction accuracy of 93.0% which did not show any improvement as compared to AVPpred and Chang et al.’s method. Although, the above-mentioned methods produced promising results, there is still room for improvement in regards to prediction performance. First, the features used for constructing the previous methods did not offer the sequence-order or position-specific information and hence might considerably limit the prediction quality. Second, most of the existing predictors [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were developed using the embodiment of redundant features, causing a decrease in performance. Finally, the accuracy and transferability of the prediction model still require improvement.
