<p>Motivated by the aforementioned issues, we proposed a novel sequence-based meta-predictor, called Meta-iAVP, for the prediction of AVPs from given peptide sequences to address the shortcomings of the existing methods. First, the benchmark datasets were collected to construct a model and fairly compare with the previous models. Second, we encoded the peptide sequence with AAC, pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (Am-PseAAC), dipeptide composition (DPC), and g-gap dipeptide composition (GDC). Third, we fed each feature separately into six different ML algorithms, i.e., RF, SVM, 
 <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbor (
 <italic>k</italic>-NN), recursive partitioning and regression trees (rpart), generalized linear model (glm), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), to generate a new feature representation. Subsequently, effective feature representation was used to build a meta-predictor. The performance comparisons on the two benchmark datasets illustrated that Meta-iAVP significantly outperformed other existing AVP predictors. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is the first meta-based approach in the prediction of AVPs. We anticipate that Meta-iAVP may serve as a useful computational resource for high-throughput AVP prediction and also facilitate experimental researchers in the discovery of novel AVPs. Finally, for the convenience of experimental scientists, a Meta-iAVP web server was established and made freely available online at
