<p>Human morbidity, mortality, and economic productivity continue to be affected by viral infections and their associated diseases. The dominance of sporadic viral outbreaks by zoonotic viruses such as Ebola and Zika in recent years have added to the prevalence of viral species with which humans are already in battle (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rhinoviruses, and influenza viruses). Viruses are successful in causing malaise to humans due to their high genetic variation, different routes of transmission, efficient replication, and the capability to persist in the host cells [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although, up until recently, trial and error has led to the discovery of 90 antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of 9 virus families (i.e., HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus, varicella-zoster virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human papillomavirus), these drugs cannot begin to cover the &gt;200 viruses discovered thus far [

 <xref rid="B4-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, major breakthroughs in combating viral infections by vaccine production have led to remarkable advances in modern medicine such as the eradication and control of disease such as small pox [

 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], respectively. Nevertheless, the development of new vaccines remains a huge challenge in terms of time and expenses [

 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of viral epidemics as observed for H1N1 [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Ebola [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and Zika [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] viruses, demands the production of new antiviral drugs with broad-spectrum activity [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More recently, peptide-based drugs have gained much interest as a new class of drugs due to their ability to be highly selective, relatively safe while also possessing good tolerability and a lower production cost [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-05743" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Besides the advantages of peptide-based drugs, a short half-life, immunogenic potential, and low oral absorption are some of their current limitations [
