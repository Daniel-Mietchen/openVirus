<p>Complexities ensue when these considerations conflict. Consider, for example, pregnant women and investigational vaccine trials against Zika virus infection. Concern about adverse effects on the fetus might argue for excluding all pregnant women. However, pregnant women and their fetuses are likely to benefit the most if an investigational Zika vaccine proves effective. Excluding them can make a trial’s risk–benefit profile significantly less favorable, by not collecting data on a key target population for the vaccine. Importantly, these considerations are also relevant for judging whether a trial’s participant selection is fair, inasmuch as compelling reasons are required for excluding entire population subgroups. A systematic precautionary approach has led to the previous exclusion of pregnant women from vaccine trials, even when they are an important target population for the vaccine [
