<p>Efforts to enhance the risk–benefit profile of a trial may lead to performing a trial in a group that is especially likely to benefit if the investigational vaccine proves effective, such as those with occupational, familial, or household exposure to infection. Similarly, efforts to enhance a trial’s risk–benefit profile may favor excluding those who are most at risk from possible adverse effects of the investigational vaccine; these may include children, pregnant women or the fetuses they carry, or individuals with particular medical conditions, such as immune deficiencies. However, if such individuals would be in the eventual target population for a vaccination program, there are compelling arguments for including them in a trial.</p>
