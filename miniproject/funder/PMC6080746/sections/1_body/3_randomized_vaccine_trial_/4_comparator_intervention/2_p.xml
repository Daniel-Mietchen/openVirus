<p>The rationale for considering an active control (a vaccine against another disease) is to provide some benefit to the control group, which may enhance a trial’s risk–benefit profile, albeit not with respect to the disease under study. This is especially the case when the active control can be administered in such a way as to allow for double-blinding, as in the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine trial, in which rabies and meningococcal C vaccines were used as active controls for infants and children, respectively [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002632.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Additionally, there may be a possibility that the control vaccine has an effect on the outcome measures against which the investigational vaccine is targeted. Active controls should therefore be considered but used judiciously.
