<p>Compared to both an active control and delayed intervention, use of a placebo control is likely to maximize a trial’s social and scientific value because of the opportunity for a double-blind design (neither investigators nor participants are aware of who has received the vaccine) and absence of concern that the placebo may affect the incidence of the disease under study in the control group. Use of a placebo control also facilitates assessment of adverse effects. Perhaps the strongest objection to using a placebo arises when the investigational vaccine is thought likely to be highly effective against a lethal disease (e.g., Ebola). Then, investigators may be thought to have a “duty to rescue” by providing the vaccine to all participants in a trial. While vaccines are a form of prophylaxis, not “rescue,” some may see a vaccine against a highly lethal disease as a form of rescue. However, we agree with Millum and Wendler that, in nearly all circumstances, the duty to rescue does not apply to clinical trials [

Placebo-controlled trials are typically conducted when the intervention under test is not licensed and is of unproven efficacy. A placebo control group is often scientifically necessary for assessing the investigational vaccine. In such circumstances, the loss for future populations from foregoing a placebo-controlled trial is too high [
