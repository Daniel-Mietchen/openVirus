<p>During an epidemic, political leaders or community representatives may have a strong preference for ensuring that all trial participants have access to the investigational vaccine, especially if prior evidence strongly suggests effectiveness (e.g., high immunogenicity and protection shown in animal studies), the disease is serious, the disease burden is high, and available preventative or therapeutic measures are limited. If this preference makes use of a placebo control unfeasible, delayed administration may be an alternative, provided the social and scientific value of the study remains intact [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002632.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. When the investigational vaccine is expected to be effective, delayed administration can enhance the trial’s risk–benefit profile compared to a placebo control. The major disadvantage is that individuals clearly know if they are in the vaccine or control group, and this may lead to differential behavior changes, affecting their risk of disease independently of any protective effect of the vaccine. In cRCTs, another disadvantage of assigning control clusters to delayed administration (rather than active or placebo control) is that it may be impossible to identify those in the control clusters who would have been vaccinated had they been offered the vaccine. As acceptors and refusers may be at differential risk of disease independently of vaccination, the only possible unbiased comparison is disease rates among all those in the vaccine clusters compared to those in the control clusters—an intention-to-treat analysis. If substantial numbers refuse vaccination, the vaccine’s effect may be underestimated. A final disadvantage of delayed administration is that it may compromise assessment of the longer-term efficacy of the vaccine. This concern may be moot, however, if the plan is to offer the vaccine to all participants after the trial [
