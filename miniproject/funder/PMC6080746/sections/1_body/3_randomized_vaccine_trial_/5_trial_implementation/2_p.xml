<p>Deliberate rollout of the investigational vaccine over a period of time may be implemented because of limited supply of the investigational vaccine or limited capacity to implement the intervention in many locations simultaneously [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002632.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A stepped rollout can permit prompt commencement of the trial, without waiting until rollout everywhere is feasible. Low and variable disease incidence may also make parallel rollout unfeasible, because the trial can gain sufficient power only by targeting at-risk populations and randomizing individuals or clusters in the vicinity of known or predicted cases [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002632.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Such trials, following cases in real time, are necessarily rolled out in a stepped fashion.
