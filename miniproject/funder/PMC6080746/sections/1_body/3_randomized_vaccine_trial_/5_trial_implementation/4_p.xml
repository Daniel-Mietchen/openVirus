<p>The Ebola experience shows that conditions favoring stepped rollout can readily occur in an emergency setting. This was an important part of the justification for the ring vaccination design of the “Ebola ça Suffit!” trial. Notably, some conditions (limited supplies and logistics) were particularly acute at the start of the epidemic, while others (variable disease incidence) were particularly pressing at the end. When sufficient supplies of the investigational vaccine and any control interventions are available at the trial’s start; when the trial’s geographic area is clearly identified and anticipated to have continuing transmission throughout the trial; and when logistics permit large-scale rollout simultaneously to the entire trial population, starting the trial at a similar time in all participants will minimize the time required to obtain a result. When these criteria are met, a parallel rollout should be used.</p>
