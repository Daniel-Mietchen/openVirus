<p>In the simplest experimental trial design, known as a “parallel” design, all participants are enrolled into the trial at about the same time and followed for the same period of time. However, sometimes it is not feasible to enroll all participants in a short period and a “stepped” rollout is used, in which entry to the trial is phased over time. While some degree of stepped rollout occurs in almost all trials (not all participants can be vaccinated on the same day), stepped rollout has been used deliberately in cRCTs. In a so-called “stepped-wedge” cRCT, the order of introduction of the vaccine to the various clusters is randomized, and disease incidence is then compared in successive time intervals between those clusters in which the intervention has already been rolled out and those in which it has not yet been rolled out [
