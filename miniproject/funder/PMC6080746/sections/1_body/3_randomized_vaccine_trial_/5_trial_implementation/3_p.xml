<p>Stepped rollout does not have this same advantage if the order of rollout is fixed in advance, as, for example, in a classic stepped-wedge cRCT design, in which clusters (e.g., villages) are offered an investigational vaccine in an order predetermined by randomization. This design was considered during the Ebola epidemic when supplies of investigational vaccines were limited. However, in this case the design was poorly suited to a setting with unpredictable and spatially variable incidence, because much variation would occur between clusters because of factors other than the vaccine, inflating the design effect and reducing the trialâ€™s power. The solution proposed was an iRCT with parallel rollout, which would have greater power than a stepped-wedge design and thus greater social and scientific value [
