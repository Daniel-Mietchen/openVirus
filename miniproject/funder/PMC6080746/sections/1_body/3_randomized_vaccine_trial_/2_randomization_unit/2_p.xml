<p>When testing an investigational vaccine during an epidemic, it is important to establish an efficacy estimate as rapidly as possible so that, if efficacious, the vaccine may still be deployed in the same epidemic. Also, in a declining epidemic, cases may become so rare that a trial is no longer feasible. iRCTs generally yield results more rapidly and that are easier to interpret than cRCTs and, in that respect, enhance the social and scientific value of a trial.</p>
