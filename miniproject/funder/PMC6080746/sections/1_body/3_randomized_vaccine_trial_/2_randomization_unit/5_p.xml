<p>Nonetheless, particular circumstances may weigh in favor of a cRCT. Recent work has shown that despite the larger sample size typically required in cRCTs compared to iRCTs because of the design effect (see glossary), in some settings, the difference in sample size may be modest, because the larger effect measured (indirect plus direct) in a cRCT partly offsets this effect [

Additionally, in some circumstances, an iRCT design may be logistically complex or may be unacceptable to the local population, which could threaten a trial’s successful completion—and thus its social and scientific value, essential to its justification [
