 <xref rid="pmed.1002632.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes key features of iRCTs, in which vaccination is randomized between individuals in the same population, and cRCTs, in which groups of individuals are randomized. In iRCTs, individual-level protective effects are measured (also called direct effects, which can be thought of as the extent to which an individualâ€™s risk of infection, or disease, would be reduced if he or she were the only person vaccinated). In cRCTs, population-level protective effects are measured (i.e., direct plus indirect effects, which take into account the reduction in the transmission of infection in a population if many are vaccinated) [
