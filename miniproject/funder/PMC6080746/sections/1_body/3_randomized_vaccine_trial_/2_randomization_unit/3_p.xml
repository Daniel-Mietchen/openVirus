<p>The fact that an iRCT measures the direct effect of a vaccine, whereas a cRCT measures the combined direct plus indirect effect, may favor either design. By including indirect effects, cRCTs provide a measure of protection closer to what might be obtained in widespread rollout of a vaccine. The combined effect may thus be of specific interest to decision-makers. However, indirect effects are more difficult to extrapolate to other settings than direct effects, the former depending on setting, population, network structure, and vaccine coverage [

A cRCT measures the protective effect that is highly relevant to the context in which the trial is conducted but may be less relevant at a later time in the same population, or in a different population. A cRCT’s direct and indirect effects cannot be easily separated, and it is possible that a vaccine’s performance would be different if another rollout strategy were used or in different settings within the same epidemic (e.g., urban versus rural) [
