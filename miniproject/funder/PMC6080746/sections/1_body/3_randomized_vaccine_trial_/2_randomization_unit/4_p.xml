<p>The direct vaccine effect, as measured in iRCTs, is likely to be less variable in different settings and, with assumptions about transmission dynamics, can be used to model indirect effects in different coverage and epidemic settings. Deriving an estimate of the direct effect from a cRCT is more complex and assumption dependent. Thus, we posit that the most valuable parameter to estimate in trials of unproven vaccines is the direct effect, as measured in an iRCT. Importantly, also, direct effects are generally the basis for regulatory decisions on the licensure of vaccines. For all these reasons, we believe that iRCTs should be the default design for evaluating investigational vaccines during epidemics.</p>
