<p>When designing and implementing randomized efficacy trials for investigational vaccines after safety and immunogenicity data have been collected (in Phase 1 and 2 trials), some key choices must be made. In the current regulatory system, randomized trials are considered the gold standard and, except in rare circumstances, have been required for vaccine licensure [
