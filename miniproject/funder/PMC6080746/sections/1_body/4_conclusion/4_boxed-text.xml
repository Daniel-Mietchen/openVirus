     <bold>Blinded design</bold>: In a blinded design, the trial’s participants do not know whether they are receiving the investigational vaccine or the control. In a double-blinded design, neither the trial’s participants nor the investigators know who is receiving the investigational vaccine or the control. In non-blinded trials, bias can arise in intervention allocation if, for example, the investigators knowingly put the more or less vulnerable participants in the investigational vaccine arm, or if participants change their behavior if they know they did or did not receive the investigational vaccine.

     <bold>Design effect</bold>: A statistical “penalty” incurred in the analysis of cRCTs to account for correlations in outcomes among members of the same cluster, leading to larger sample size requirements [

     <bold>Direct effects</bold>: The extent by which the risk of disease is reduced when an individual is exposed to the infectious agent. The direct effect of a vaccine is mainly a characteristic of the vaccine itself and how it interacts with individuals rather than of the way the vaccine is deployed in a particular population. While direct vaccine effects are not always generalizable [

     <xref rid="pmed.1002632.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,

     <xref rid="pmed.1002632.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], they are often assumed to be more easily extrapolated to other settings because direct effects are measured at the individual level and not typically thought to depend much on the patterns of exposure and transmission in the population.

     <bold>Effective/efficacy</bold>: We use effective and efficacy in this paper as shorthand for protection against becoming infected without prejudging various aspects of this protection, which are sometimes called efficacy and effectiveness.

     <bold>Indirect effects</bold>: Indirect effects occur when the number of persons vaccinated in a community reduces the overall transmission rate of the infection in the community. Sometimes called herd effects, indirect effects benefit both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and the size of the effect will depend both on the level of the direct effect and the proportion of persons vaccinated in the population [
     <xref rid="pmed.1002632.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The indirect effects of a vaccine depend not only on the direct effects on vaccinated individuals but on such factors as the incidence rate of the disease, the level of pre-existing immunity in the population, the contact network structure, the coverage of the vaccine, and the phase of the epidemic (growing or declining), among others. Each of these factors will vary across populations that may consider using the investigational vaccine if it proves effective, and some of them (e.g., epidemic phase, immunity) may vary over short time periods within the same population.
