<p>We argue that individually randomized trials with a placebo control should be the default strategy for evaluating investigational vaccines during epidemics. Placebo-controlled trials typically maximize the social and scientific value of the trial, and objections to using placebo, such as a duty to “rescue” individual participants—with an unlicensed investigational vaccine candidate of unproven efficacy—are rarely persuasive. Depending on the pathogen as well as statistical, fairness, and feasibility considerations, trial participants may be selected either from the general population or from a group at high risk of exposure to infection. Starting the trial at approximately the same time for all participants, in a parallel rollout, will minimize the time required to obtain a result and maximize social and scientific value. If resources are limited and/or incidence is spatiotemporally variable, a stepped rollout may be necessary, in which recruitment to the trial is staggered over time.</p>
