<p>In order to further prepare in advance for epidemics, future work should characterize choices for specific pathogen characteristics and contexts. Mathematical modeling and simulation are useful tools for addressing choices beyond the four discussed here, e.g., sample size, trial location, duration, or end point [

Rigorous ethical analysis, as well as inclusive and transparent debate by different stakeholders, would help to illuminate the underlying moral questions. Ethical considerations not discussed here, such as informed consent and community acceptance, may also tip the balance between several possible designs. Both scientific and ethical questions would be best debated in advance of future epidemics.
