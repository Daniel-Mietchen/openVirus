   <p>*Note: If a “control” vaccine or placebo is used in the control clusters, then vaccine efficacy assessment can be focused on the comparison of disease incidence between those who actually received the vaccine in the vaccine clusters and those who actually received the control intervention in the control clusters. However, if no control vaccine or placebo is used in the control clusters (e.g., delayed vaccination), then the only unbiased comparison is between all those eligible to receive the vaccine in both types of cluster, including those who refused vaccination in the vaccine clusters (as this group cannot be separated out in the control clusters).</p>
