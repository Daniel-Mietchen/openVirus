  <title>Phylogenetic tree of EV71 isolates from Russia and CIS (indicated in bold) and all GenBank sequences of EV71 genotype C that differ by over 1%.</title>
  <p>For Russian/CIS sequences, the isolate number is indicated, which refers to the sampling location indicated in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097404-g001">Fig. 1</xref>. The tree was created using the complete VP1 genome region (891 nucleotides) and the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm implemented in Beast 1.7.5. Scale bar indicates time. Branches are colored according to isolation region indicated in the legend.
