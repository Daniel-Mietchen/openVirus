<p>Genetic host factors have been implicated in EV71 epidemiology previously. Indeed, despite comparable seroprevalence levels, only Asian countries are repeatedly hit by outbreaks of overt disease. It has also been shown that genetic background of patients affects severity of EV71 infection. One study associated HLA-A33 genotype and several other genetic polymorphisms were significantly associated with susceptibility to EV71

 <xref rid="pone.0097404-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, however this finding was not supported by other studies

The role of host genetics in susceptibility to EV71 infection was also suggested in a study on EV71 seroepidemiology in Singapore, which reported up to five-fold differences in HFMD incidence in groups of patients of Asian versus Caucasian ethnicity 
 <xref rid="pone.0097404-Ang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, as socioeconomic status and sanitary habits also differed between these groups, it was not possible to establish the cause of different morbidity. In Russia, higher EV71 seroprevalence was found in regions with prevalent Asian ethnic background. Unfortunately, samples used in this work were collected without information on ethnic background, and further studies are required to investigate the role of host genetic background on EV71 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic.
