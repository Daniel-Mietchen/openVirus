<p>Seroprevalence of EV71 varies significantly between different regions of the world, and even between samples from the same region. Few studies were conducted in countries that did not have epidemics of neuroinfection. In Germany, one study reported seroprevalence of 12% at age of 1–4 years

 <xref rid="pone.0097404-Diedrich1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These seroprevalence rates were not obviously lower than in the countries that experience massive epidemics of EV71 infection. In China, retrospective analysis revealed 40% seroprevalence of EV71 before the 2008 outbreak
