<p>Before 2011, genotypes C1 and C2 were more prevalent in Russia. All isolates of these genotypes had the closest relatives among viruses identified in Europe, and these two subtypes were also the most common EV71 subtypes detected in European countries

 <xref rid="pone.0097404-Bible2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Subtype C4 was occasionally isolated in Europe, but it constituted only a minor fraction of all EV71 detections

 <xref rid="pone.0097404-Diedrich1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Subtype C4 was first detected in Russia in 2009 and became predominant in 2013. In China, genotype C4 caused epidemics in 2008, 2009, and 2010, while genotypes C1 and C2 were rarely detected 
 <xref rid="pone.0097404-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Spread of genotype C4 to other regions was anticipated 
 <xref rid="pone.0097404-vanderSanden1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, however in Russia is was not followed by epidemic of EV71 neuroinfection up to 2013. Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 genome region suggested multiple introductions of the virus to Russia, but did not allow establishing the exact number and direction of EV71 transfers, because the sample of sequences available in Genbank (especially for genotypes other than C4) was not sufficient (both by the size and by the geographic coverage) to trace epidemiology of EV71 with sufficient resolution.
