 <bold>Neutralization test</bold> was performed in RD cell culture. Serial two-fold dilutions of serum, starting with 1∶8, were incubated with 50–100 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of the virus for one hour at 37°C and added to cell culture in 96-well plates. Two wells were used for each titration point. Cytopathic effect was accounted 4 days after infection. Antibody titer of individual sera was expressed as a reciprocal of a dilution that completely neutralized infectivity. Neutralizing titer of 8 and higher was considered positive.
