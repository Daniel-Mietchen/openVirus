<p>Phylogenetic analysis indicated that in many cases Russian isolates did not group together, or grouped reliably with different reference sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097404-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Such grouping pattern is compatible with multiple introductions of virus to/from Russia; however it is not possible to establish the exact number and direction of such transfers because of low posterior probability support on some nodes.
