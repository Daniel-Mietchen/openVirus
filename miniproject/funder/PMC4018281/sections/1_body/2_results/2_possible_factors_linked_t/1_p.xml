<p>In children aged 3-5 years EV71 seroprevalence differed significantly between the regions of Russia. There was no apparent link between the EV71 seroprevalence and population density or income level in a region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097404-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), but the general statistics do not necessarily reflect exact conditions at the point of sampling. The climate in all study regions is cold continental, and minor variations of climate could not explain significant difference in EV71 seroprevalence. EV71 seroprevalence was notably lower in the sampling regions located in the European part of Russia than in the Asian regions (19–27% vs. 41–83%). Khabarovsk Region and Tyva have frequent trans-border contacts with China and Mongolia, respectively. Moreover, Amur, the major river that flows through the main cities of the Khabarovsk region, receives runoff from China and could promote spread of enteroviruses. However, intensity of travel to South-East Asia was not universally correlated to EV71 seroprevalence. The highest number of regular flights to China and East Asia originate from Moscow airports (on average 18 flights per day), but this did not result in elevated EV71 seroprevalence. Other study regions have on average one or less flight to endemic regions per day. Yakutia, with its 41% EV71 seroprevalence rate, also has about one direct flight to South-East Asia per day and very limited possibilities for land travel.
