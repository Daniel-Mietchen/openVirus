<p>EV71 prototype strain BrCr, which is commonly available from virus collections, belongs to the extinct genotype A, while most circulating viruses belong to genotype C. An EV71 strain isolated in Moscow in 2001 (strain 13689, genotype C2, see below) was the only contemporary strain available at the beginning of the study in 2008. It was compared in a preliminary neutralization test experiment with the prototype strain BrCr to select the most suitable virus for the main study. A panel of 30 sera from children aged 3–9 years and 20 sera from adults aged 32–73 years collected in 2008 in Khabarovsk region (Far East of Russia) was used because this region borders the epidemic area and was therefore of prime interest for the study. The same sera were positive with both viruses. The number of positive sera was 17/30 (57%) in children and 19/20 (95%) in adults. The mean geometric neutralizing titers against strain BrCr were somewhat higher in adults (45 vs. 18, Mann Whitney P = 0.006), while in children neutralizing titers were slightly higher against the contemporary genotype C2 strain 13689 (145 compared to 67, Mann Whitney P = 0.07). In 5 out of 17 seropositive children the antibody titer against strain 13689 was significantly (4–16 times) higher than against strain BrCr. As infants are the most susceptible to EV71 infection and were the target group of the main study, strain 13689 was used for further neutralization tests. The higher neutralizing titers against genotype A strain BrCr in adults suggest that the viruses that elicited immune response were antigenically distinct from genotype C and probably represented genotype A.</p>
