 <bold>Seroprevalence of EV71 infection</bold> was investigated among children below 5 years old in six regions of Russia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097404-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The prevalence of EV71 antibodies in the younger age group varied from 5% to 20% in different regions without any obvious pattern. In the older age group, the fraction of children that had encountered EV71 was higher (19â€“83%). In two areas (Moscow and Sverdlovsk regions) the difference between the age groups was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05, Fisher's test), in other four regions it was significant (p&lt;0.05, Fisher's test). Interestingly, mean geometric titers of antibodies against EV71 were consistently higher in elder children (
