<p>Although most vector competence studies only take mean temperature values into account, recent evidence for DENV shows that diurnal temperature range (DTR) plays an important role in influencing the behaviour of

Our findings suggest using a DTR that mimics field conditions is needed to better understand infection dynamics within mosquito hosts.
