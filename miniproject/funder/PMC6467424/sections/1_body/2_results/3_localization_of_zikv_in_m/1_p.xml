<p>To visualize ZIKV distribution in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> tissues over time, we performed immunofluorescent antibody staining using a monoclonal antibody recognising 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> NS1 proteins (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g004">4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g005">5</xref>). We quantified ZIKV staining density (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) through image analysis of the relative staining area of ZIKV to DNA for individual organs/tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g004">Fig 4C–4E</xref>). The ZIKV staining density in mosquito midguts was visible from 3 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). ZIKV staining was detectable in tissue/organs surrounding midguts (“body” samples) from 7 dpi. It was detected in the heads of a majority of mosquitoes from 10 dpi. Fewer salivary glands than other organs/tissues could be observed within the mid-sagittal mosquito sections, however, staining of the salivary glands that were observed indicated that a small proportion were infected by 7 dpi. By 10 dpi, all salivary glands had detectable ZIKV staining. An analysis of the staining density within the tissue/organs as a function of dpi and temperature regime found that, for all tissues, the effect of time post infection on ZIKV staining density was highly significant, whereas the effect of temperature regime was not significant (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007281.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Interactions between time and temperature were non-significant in all cases. Post hoc comparisons revealed that significant increases in staining density occurred between 7 and 14 dpi for all tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). ZIKV was also detected and quantified within the ovaries of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, which showed a significant increase in staining density between 5 and 14 d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007281.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007281.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Staining was limited to the follicular epithelium surrounding oocytes (
