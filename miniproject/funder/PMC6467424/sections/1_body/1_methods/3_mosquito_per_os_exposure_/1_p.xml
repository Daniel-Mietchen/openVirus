<p>Mosquito infection with ZIKV occurred in a Biosafety Level 3 insectary at QIMR Berghofer. An artificial membrane feeding apparatus, fitted with a porcine intestinal membrane, was used to orally challenge adult females (3–5 day old) with a mixture of defibrinated sheep blood (Life Technologies, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) and virus at a final concentration of 8.8 log CCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml (C6/36 cells) for 1 h. Following ZIKV inoculation, mosquitoes were maintained in environmental growth chambers (Panasonic), with either a constant temperature program set to 28°C or a fluctuating (cyclical) temperature program (24.5–32°C) around a mean of 28°C [
