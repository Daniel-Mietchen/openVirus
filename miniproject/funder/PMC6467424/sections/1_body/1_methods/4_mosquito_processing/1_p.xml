<p>Twenty mosquitoes were harvested at each of three time points (3, 7 and 14 days) post blood feeding by anaesthetizing the insects with CO
 <sub>2</sub> on ice before removing legs and wings. Mosquitoes were gently transferred by their antennae to a glass plate and immobilized on double-sided sticky tape. Saliva was collected by placing the proboscis of each mosquito into a 200 μl pipette tip containing 10 μl of 10% FBS and 10% sugar solution. The insertion of the proboscis into the salivation solution was performed under a dissecting scope and peristaltic movement of the abdomen observed to indicate salivation. Mosquitoes were allowed to salivate for 20 min, after which the contents of the pipette tip were then expelled into a microtube and preserved at -80°C.
