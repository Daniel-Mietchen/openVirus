<p>To determine the absolute number of ZIKV copies in each mosquito body or body part, a control plasmid, containing a cloned copy of the targeted ZIKV gene fragment (nucleotides 835 to 911, Genbank accession number EU545988), was constructed. Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany), and cDNA synthesized using the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The targeted ZIKV fragment was amplified using CloneAmp HiFi PCR Premix (Takara, Clontech Laboratories, USA), and cloned into the pUC19 plasmid vector (Genscript, New Jersey, United States) using the In-Fusion Cloning Kit (Takara, Clontech Laboratories, USA) as described by the manufacturer. The presence of the insert DNA was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. For quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the plasmid was linearized by 
 <italic>Eco</italic>RI (Promega, USA) and purified using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany). The concentration and purity of the linearized plasmid DNA was determined using the NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The plasmid copy number was calculated based on the measured DNA concentration and its molecular weight. Plasmid DNA concentrations were confirmed prior to the preparation of a 10-fold serial dilution from 3×10
 <sup>7</sup> to 3×10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μl and run in parallel with the samples in all qRT-PCRs.
