 <italic>albopictus</italic>) cells grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with L-glutamine, 5% heat denatured FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco Life Technologies, USA) and maintained at 28Â°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 days. Mosquito saliva samples were diluted 1:25 in the media described above, supplemented with 0.1% Gibco Amphotericin B (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), and used to inoculate duplicate monolayers of C6/36 cells (~90% confluent). Samples were then fixed and stained as described above.
