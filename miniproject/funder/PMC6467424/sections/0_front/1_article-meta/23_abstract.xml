 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that generally causes a mild febrile illness but mostly remains asymptomatic in 50–80% of infections. Infection during pregnancy can cause congenital malformations, notably microcephaly. In adults, it can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome. The recent ZIKV epidemic in the Americas has been linked to the urban vector 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. The presence of the species in Australia makes the region vulnerable to emerging mosquito-borne viruses. A mosquito’s competence to transmit a pathogen will depend on both the virus and vector strains. Here, we determine the vector competence of Australian 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes for a ZIKV epidemic strain, originating from the epicentre of the Brazilian outbreak, under constant and fluctuating temperatures that simulate field environments in Australia. Our results demonstrate that, although both species were susceptible to ZIKV infection, 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> is more likely to transmit virus. Our results may aid in the formulation of public health strategies to mitigate the threat of ZIKV.
