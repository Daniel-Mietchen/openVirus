<p>In the last decade, there was only one publication related to resistance to HIV drugs. There has been no report on HIV DR profile in the north-eastern region of India till our recent study in the year 2016. According to our recent studies, 53% of HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced individuals in Manipur harbour DR mutation at different DR sites [

It also further revealed that 29%, 37% and 8% have mutations at the target sites of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs) sites respectively. Predominant drug-resistant mutations at reverse transcriptase (RT) genes were M184V, T215Y, M41L and V108I and H221Y while at protease (PR) genes were M46I and I47V. Among the high-risk groups, IDUs have the highest number of drug-resistant mutations followed by heterosexual individuals. It was further shown that drug-resistant mutations at the target sites of RT inhibitors are high and these were found to have developed resistance to the primary ART drugs that are used in Manipur.
