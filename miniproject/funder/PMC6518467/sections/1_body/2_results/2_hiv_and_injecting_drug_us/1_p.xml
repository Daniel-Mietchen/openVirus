<p>Injecting drug use has received increased attention because of the high risk of HIV transmission and, more recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Since last decade, there were at least 16 publications related with IDUs. In 2008, Mahanta 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that 98% of the IDU use injecting ‘heroin’ and 63% of them shared their injecting equipment and containers. This unsafe injecting practice exposed themselves in the risk of contracting blood-borne viruses. According to Kermode 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in 2009, the main theme of using drugs was for pleasure-seeking, influence of peers and economic reasons. The idea of injecting drug was initiated by another person (most commonly a friend, who helps in injecting the drugs) in the well-established social networks. Another study showed that to deal the problem of IDUs, opioid substitution therapy is effective and leads to the improvements in the quality of their lives [

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A study by Armstrong 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in 2011 showed that those IDUs having the knowledge of HIV prevention services are more likely to engage in safe injecting, sexual practices and avoid risky characters. Chakrapani 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in 2011 showed that effective HIV prevention and care programmes for IDUs may hinge on several contexts; supportive government policy on harm reduction programmes; an end to harassment by military, and anti-drug groups, with education of these entities regarding harm reduction and creation of partnerships with the public health sector. However, in another study by Suohu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in 2012 revealed that if the IDUs practice the unsafe injection by sharing injecting equipment and risky sexual practices, it magnifies the risk of HIV infection. Medhi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in 2012 estimated the sizes of IDU population in five districts of Manipur. Not only men but women also used injecting heroin according to Kermode 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in 2012 [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The study further showed that heroin on women has negative health impact such as reproductive health, mental health, social exclusion, violence, children's welfare and financial difficulties. Lalmuanpuii 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in 2013 showed that harm reduction approach in Manipur could be even managed better. In 2013, Kermode 
 <italic>et al.</italic> revealed that 64% of young women (mean age of 31 year) who used heroin and alcohol were widowed or divorced. It also further indicates that women used drug and alcohol to avoid symptoms of withdrawal, to suppress emotional pain, to overcome the shame of sex work, pleasure and widowhood [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another study by Armstrong 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in 2014 identified that the risky injecting practices were more common among younger people. Goswami 
 <italic>et al.</italic> stated that improvements in safe injection practices and consistent condom use with regular partners enhance the HIV preventives measure [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Armstrong 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] in 2014 showed that most of the HIV-positive people who inject drug in Manipur were not aware of their HIV status and practice unsafe injection and sexual activities. However, when they become aware of their HIV status, they avoid their high-risk behaviours. So, it is utmost important to heighten the HIV testing coverage scale across the state. However, Ganju 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in 2016 revealed that HIV testing among IDUs is low. Urgent program to build awareness among the IDUs about their HIV status is necessary to limit the expansion of HIV, timely treatment and care. Phukan 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in 2017 provided a useful program to understanding the network pattern of injecting drug users for enriching the HIV prevention in this region.
