<p>In the last 10 years, there were five publications related with HIV and risky sexual behaviours. In 2008, Mahanta 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that nearly half of IDUs have engaged in sexual activity with at least one female in past one year. In another study by Suohu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in 2012 indicate that a significant proportion of IDUs engage in unsafe sex and have multiple sexual partners. They have more sexual partners as compared with non-injecting heroin users. More than 27% IDUs reported having had unsafe sex with two or more female partners within a year. These provide a higher chance of transmitting or contracting HIV. Armstrong 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in 2014 also showed that injecting drugs user aged 18â€“24 years had two or more female sexual partners (50.2%) compared with aged 35 or older (10.9%) indicating youth have higher risk. In the same year, Mishra 
 <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that 40% of IDUs had a casual sexual partner and among those who had casual sexual partners, 65% of them have inconsistently used condom [
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. IDUs who shared needles/syringes were more likely to engage in unprotected sex with their regular partners. Similarly, IDUs who reported inconsistent condom use with casual partners were more likely to report unprotected sex with their regular partners. Kermode 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in 2015 reported that condom use with regular partners was poor: 40.6% used a condom the last time they had sex with their regular partners, and only 10.7% reported consistent condom use with their regular partners. Many participants with regular partners (40.2%) had more than one sexual partner in the last year, 29.5% had casual sex and 6.1% paid for sex in the last year. Consistent condom use with casual sexual partners was 32.9% and with paid partners was 36.5%. Half of those with regular partners (51.0%) had never had an HIV test, and 14.3% were HIV-positive.
