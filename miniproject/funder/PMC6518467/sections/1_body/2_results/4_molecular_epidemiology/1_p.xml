<p>During the last 10 years, there were six publications related with molecular epidemiology of HIV as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the year 2009, a study by Sarkar 
 <italic>et al.</italic> on 30 HIV-infected IDU samples recruited from Manipur suggested the possibility of emerging new HIV-1 strains along with the dual infection [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The prevalence of subtype C with BC recombinants in the HIV tat gene was shown by Mullick 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in year 2010 [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the same year, a study was conducted on HIV infection and host genetic mutation from the IDU samples of north-eastern states of India, including Manipur. It revealed that the absence of CCR5 mutant gene which suggests that they do not have any additional protection against HIV infection. They were vulnerable to acquire HIV infection due to high-risk behaviour and other related factors [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Sarkar 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in two independent studies in year 2012 revealed the emergence of unique recombinant forms (URFs) [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Later Sharma 
 <italic>et al.</italic> further analysed the viral subtype using larger sample size based on two gene pol and/or tat-vpu-env gene [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it showed that the HIV-1 genotypes distribution was 65.45% (72/110) subtype C, 32.73% (36/110) URFs and 1.82% (2/110) subtype B. The distribution of HIV-1 genotypes among the risk groups was: heterosexual: 58.33% (35/60) subtype C, 38.33% (23/60) URFs and 3.34% (2/60) subtype B; IDUs: 85.36% (35/41) subtype C, 9.76% (4/41) URFs and 4.88% (2/41) subtype B; mother to child (MTC): 50% (3/6) URFs and 50% (3/6) subtype C and blood transfusion: 100% (3/3) subtype C.
