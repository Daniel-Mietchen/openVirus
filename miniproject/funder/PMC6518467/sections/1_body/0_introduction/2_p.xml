 <sup>2</sup> with a population of 2.7 million (density of 120 people per square kilometres) is reported to be hard hit epicentres of HIV/AIDS epidemic in India. Manipur, a far north-eastern corner of the country with hardly 0.2% of country's population is contributing nearly 8% of India's total HIV-positive cases. HIV infection rate among the IDUs had increased tremendously from 2% to 3% in 1989 to &gt;50% in 1991 and 64% in 2000 [

HIV/AIDS has emerged as a serious public health emergency and seems like impossible task to halt the ever-increasing rate. Unlike other states of India, HIV transmission in this region is mainly correlated with the sharing of HIV-infected injecting equipment/needles among the IDUs [
