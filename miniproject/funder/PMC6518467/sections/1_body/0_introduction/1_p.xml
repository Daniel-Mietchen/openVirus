Sexual mode of HIV transmission was the main mode of HIV transmission in India. Initially, the progress of HIV epidemic was relatively slow but over the years the number of HIV-infected persons has increased and become a major public health problem. The spread of HIV in India was primarily restricted to the southern and north-eastern regions of the country.
