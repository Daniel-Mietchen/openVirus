<p>In August 2018, based on the keywords ‘Manipur’ and ‘HIV’, an advanced systematic search for published literature in English in the last decade (since 2008) was performed using the PubMed (
 <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</uri>), a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. Only the publications from 1 January 2008 to 31 August 2018 were taken into consideration. All the displayed articles were accessed and identified. The articles were further accessed in ISI Web of Science database by Clarivate Analytics. Only those publications in the journals included in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) list, 2018 (Clarivate Analytics/Thomson Reuters) were selected for this study. The selection of the article based on the journals within the ISI Web of Science database is to maintain a quality or standard of article to be reviewed in this study. The title, abstract, journals and full text of eligible publications were scrutinised independently by two authors. The articles which report empirical data with respect to the transmission, molecular epidemiology, DR and co-infection in Manipur were further considered. This systematic search clearly indicated that the review literature on this topic is limited. We further access the electronic databases at the Manipur AIDS Control Society (MACS) (

The final step in our methodological approach involved plotting the information from published literature; extraction of relevant data and charted them to assist with our analysis of the findings.
