<p>The prevalence of HIV-1 subtypes varies greatly depending on the geographic region [
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The subtype C is the most prevalent among all HIV-1 genetic subtypes and is predominant in India [
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, recombinant form of virus is most visible in border areas where different genetic variety meets. The extensive variability of HIV-1 genetic forms complicates diagnosis, treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection. Therefore, HIV-1 subtype characterisation is becoming an important aspect to adequate clinical management of HIV-1-infection. Mullick [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in 2009 identified BC recombinant based on the tat gene and long terminal repeats from IDUs of Manipur. However, we have conducted extensive analysis of molecular epidemiology of HIV in the year 2016 using large sample size [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Surprisingly, our study revealed the emergence of URF (32%) (
 <xref rid="tab02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Manipur being a state of transit and commercial area that trade and connect the south East Asia may have the potential to introduce the complex genetic variant. The impact of foreign travellers and immigrants due to cross border transport in HIV epidemic is unknown. However, to identify the URFs found were formed locally or derived from Myanmar and/or other border area, molecular epidemiology across the border area need further investigation.
