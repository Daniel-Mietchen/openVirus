<p>Due to the geographical location and lack of good HIV/AIDS surveillance despite being high prevalence, the state, Manipur is deeply affected economically and socially due to the HIV epidemic. There are many HIV viral load test (VLT) centres in the country to monitor the progression of the disease, but none in the state has the highest HIV adult prevalence in the country. Therefore, blood samples are collected from HIV-positive patients and sent outside the state for VLT. Since blood samples are transported to the viral load testing centres only in bulk by air or surface transportation, blood samples are stored until sample collection reaches certain numbers. Therefore, patients get their viral load result after 3â€“4 weeks and by the time doctors know viral load of a patient, there is always possibility that the viral load has increased many folds. It may be another contributing factor of failure ART. In such situation, lives of HIV-positive patients are in danger since viral load is vital for different ART treatments. This shows that the necessity for effective HIV/AIDS surveillance even in resource-limiting area.</p>
