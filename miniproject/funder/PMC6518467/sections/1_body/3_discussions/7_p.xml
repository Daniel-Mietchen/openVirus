<p>The ART has greatly advanced the management of HIV-1 infection [

 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the main cause for the failure of ART is the presence of drug-resistance-associated mutations in the polymerase gene of HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The emerging of HIVDR is mainly due to drug pressure of ART. The drug-resistant mutated virus can be transmitted from one individual to another. The effect of transmitted DR is a cause of concern for the scaling up of HIV programs, as HIV resistance also affects the efficacy of MTCT prophylaxis. There has been no report on HIV DR profile in the north eastern region of India till our recent studies. According to our recent studies, 53% of HIV-infected ART exposed individuals in Manipur harbour DR mutation at different DR sites. The study revealed that 29%, 37% and 8% have mutations at the target sites of NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs sites, respectively [
