<p>HIV and HBVs/HCVs, the three important blood-borne infectious diseases, are the major public health concerns [
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Due to co-infection, HIV and HBV/HCV simultaneously interact in a host complicating pathogenesis and disease progression of these two infections [
 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The deleterious effect of HIV leads to more rapid progression towards end-stage liver diseases (liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) and higher risk for liver disease-related mortality in HIV/HBV co-infected individuals as compared with those infected with HIV or HBV only. Since the IDU is the chief transmission route of HIV/HBV co-infection in Manipur, the vulnerability of co-infection is predominant. HIV-HBV co-infection had 17 times higher incidence of liver disease-related deaths than HBV mono-infected ones. There are limited molecular studies on co-infection of HIV-HBV-HCV in the north-eastern region of India. However, Kermode

 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This shows the high rate of co-infection with other blood-borne virus in this region. There is an urgency to manage the co-infection to limit the expansion of viral-borne diseases. Further, more research is required on the social, economic and cultural determinants of HIV/AIDS diagnosis, treatment and response to ART program. The collaborative approaches should be initiated so as to raise awareness and discuss risks associated with blood-borne viruses. Entire international border areas need to be enhanced the screening and detection systems of HIV and other blood borne viral diseases.
