<p>The frequent political and social turmoil in the state worsens the HIV/AIDS situation. The insurgency movements of Manipur led to enforcement of strict law by government in the form of Armed Forces Special Powers Acts (AFSPA). Under this act, possession of any illegal or suspicious goods is liable to be sent to custody without any warrant. Therefore, armed forces and local police are given special power to arrest any suspect including IDUs. The above situations consequence the ineffectiveness of the syringes exchange program, initiated to prevent the spread of HIV through sharing of syringes among IDUs in this region since carrying syringes is risky. As such preventive measure fails to stop sharing of injecting equipment. Hence, the law and order situation also influence negatively on the adherence to drug since lifesaving drugs could not be available in time due to sudden curfew and strikes. The socio-political problem hinders the effective programs initiated to limit the HIV transmission. The above factors finally influence the molecular epidemiology, DR and coinfection with other types of virus.</p>
