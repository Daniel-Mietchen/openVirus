<p id="Par93">Some participants noted that HIV genetic data might result in serious civil and criminal cases depending on how the data are managed. This finding suggests that guidelines on the use of HIV sequence data should be responsive to privacy issues. Furthermore, the boundaries within which HIV phylogenetic data are used could be blurred [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] as the field and its applications evolve. These findings call for further ethical deliberations on the downstream use of HIV sequence data for purposes other than the original intended use - HIV diagnosis and treatment. Ordinarily, public health surveillance data are collected without the express consent of the patient [
