<p id="Par96">HIV molecular surveillance makes use of HIV sequence data from HIV positive persons who have agreed to HIV testing and drug resistance genotyping primarily for treatment purposes. Such clinical data could be linked to surveillance and patient follow-up without the express consent of the sample donor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which brings into focus the long-standing tension between public health, ethics and human rights. Questions need to be asked about whether HIV positive persons understand what they are consenting to when they give their samples for HIV genotyping and the implications of their consent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The rationale would be to identify the most appropriate models of consent for HIV molecular epidemiology studies and to optimize the public health and research utility of HIV genotype data without violating research ethics guidelines and standards.
