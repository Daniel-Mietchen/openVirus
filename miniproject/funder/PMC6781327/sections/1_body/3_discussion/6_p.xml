<p id="Par89">Molecular epidemiology involves data and sample sharing. The concept of data sharing is not only abstract but also unknown to most individuals and communities outside the sciences. Comprehensive guidelines on access, sharing and use of HIV sequence data should be developed (or revised if available) in consultation with key stakeholders cognizant of the potential risks of harm that may result [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which could be reviewed to incorporate HIV genetic data for public health surveillance. However, for effective guidelines to be developed, the real and perceived risks of harm associated with the technique need to be clearly defined. This would require further research, broader consultation and community engagement. It is one thing to develop a set of guidelines and a governance framework and yet another to implement and enforce them. Without a clear strategy on enforcement and compliance, it would be difficult to control or minimise any privacy-invasive use of HIV molecular data.
