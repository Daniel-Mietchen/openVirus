<p id="Par87">Challenges are expected when communicating technical and scientific terms like genetics or genomics partly due to the non-availability of such words in the vernacular language in which informed consent is obtained [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, researchers are obliged to take additional steps to explore, develop and implement appropriate strategies for conveying research messages, to maximize understanding, notwithstanding the difficulties outlined above. Among low literacy populations, simple vernacular language and analogies from everyday local examples have been applied successfully to clarify scientific terms commonly used in clinical trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Several strategies have also been used in consent documents to explain genetics to prospective research participants by linking them to commonly used terms like heredity or inheritance and how observable individual characteristics or conditions are passed from parents to their offspring [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Similar approaches could be applied to explain the genomics of pathogens, with explanations adapted for the evolution of viruses and HIV network research. The provision of verbal and visual explanations could enhance both comprehension and retention of the disclosed information [
