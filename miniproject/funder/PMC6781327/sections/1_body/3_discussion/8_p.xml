<p id="Par91">Our analysis showed some gaps in understanding of what constitutes privacy risk associated with HIV molecular epidemiology, its properties and boundaries. This is not surprising. Risk to individual privacy is commonly identified as a key ethical issue in most genomic studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. With advances in technology the nature of privacy, and by extension, privacy harm, has evolved significantly from what it was known to be in the past decade. De-identification and data anonymisation, traditionally regarded as cornerstones of protection of individual privacy in research, have increasingly become illusory in genomic research. Advances in technology and data access from the internet have considerably simplified cross-matching of datasets and chances of re-identification [
