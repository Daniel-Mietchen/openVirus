<p id="Par95">Several strategies could be implemented to protect research participants and build public trust in HIV phylogenetic network research. One approach could be to systematically investigate whether existing ethics, legal and governance frameworks are responsive to the privacy concerns raised in this paper. Secondly, RECs reviewing molecular epidemiology studies could benefit from the expertise of data protection and privacy experts, particularly information and computer technologists and legal experts. Lastly, the use of differential privacy as a data security strategy to mitigate privacy breaches in HIV network research [
