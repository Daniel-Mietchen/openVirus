<p id="Par99">Some participants had a strong background in research ethics but had limited exposure to HIV molecular epidemiology and vice-versa. A few had been exposed to both research ethics and molecular epidemiology. Our respondents might have over- or underestimated the benefits and risks of HIV molecular epidemiology depending on their area of specialization. Experts in molecular epidemiology might have expressed conservative views about the risks to privacy associated with HIV phylogenetics because of limited ethics knowledge. On the other hand, those with a strong research ethics background might have overestimated the predictive power and accuracy of HIV phylogenetics and consequently become overly concerned about unlikely scenarios, threats to privacy, stigma and related ethical and legal concerns.</p>
