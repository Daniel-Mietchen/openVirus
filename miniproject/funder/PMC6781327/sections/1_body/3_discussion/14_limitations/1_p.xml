<p id="Par97">The findings of our study were based on in-depth interviews conducted with a sample of scientists with backgrounds in epidemiology, public health, virology and bioethics. Most of our participants were from Europe and USA. The views expressed by our participants may not, therefore, represent the full range of perspectives from experts in global HIV molecular epidemiology. Different issues may arise from experts working in other geographical, cultural or socio-economic regions that were not represented in our sample (Asia and Latin America), which could be an opportunity for future follow-on research. However, the primary aim of our study, like many other qualitative studies, was not to make generalizable inferences about the population of experts from the purposive sample of scientists. Rather, we sought to explore perspectives on the subject, which could be further explored or validated using quantitative approaches.</p>
