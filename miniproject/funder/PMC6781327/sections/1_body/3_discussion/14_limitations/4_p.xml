<p id="Par100">Molecular epidemiology research involves multiple stakeholders with differing interests. Among them are researchers who generate the data, research participants from whom the sequence data and associated attributes are collected, health professionals involved in HIV care and treatment and the general public. This report focused primarily on one group of stakeholders â€” the scientists. The views of historically stigmatized populations, for example, men who have sex with men, sex workers, injecting drug users and people living with HIV would also be critical for a fuller appreciation of these discussions. Their views could be different from those expressed by experts interviewed in our study and actively soliciting their views could enrich and consolidate some of the ethical concerns raised. Members of Research Ethics Committees as well as Data Access Committees also have a critical contribution to make towards a fuller appreciation of the risks concerned.</p>
