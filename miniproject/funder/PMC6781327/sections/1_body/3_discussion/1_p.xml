<p id="Par84">The aim of this study was to explore the perspectives of experts on key ethical issues associated with HIV phylogenetics. Our analysis revealed that while participants were generally optimistic about the use of HIV phylogenetics for research and public health, they were concerned that communicating the concepts and procedures involved in molecular epidemiology in ways that could easily be understood by prospective participants would be challenging. In addition, there were misgivings about the capacity of researchers and research participants alike to fully delineate the risks and benefits associated with this technique. More specifically, while there was consensus that HIV molecular epidemiology poses a risk to individual privacy, the nature and quantum of the risk could not easily be determined.</p>
