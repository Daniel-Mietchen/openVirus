<p id="Par9">Phylogenetic analytic techniques have been widelyÂ used to study the history of HIV, including how it got into humans (where and how) and its spread across nations and populations. This is done by examining the relatedness of different viruses and how they evolved from a common ancestor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Two viruses are regarded as more related if they share a more recent common ancestor and vice-versa. HIV phylogenetics has great potential to advance our knowledge of HIV epidemics by providing high quality data on the diversity of HIV strains and on HIV transmission dynamics at country and global levels.
