<p id="Par12">This paper reports on an exploratory study of scientists’ views on key ethical issues associated with HIV molecular epidemiology as a contribution to the small but growing body of empirical studies on this topic. An earlier analysis of the same dataset using a predetermined analytical framework found that favourable risk-benefit ratio and informed consent were the most invoked ethical principles [

As HIV sequencing becomes increasingly affordable, and the need to optimize HIV prevention methods becomes a necessity [
