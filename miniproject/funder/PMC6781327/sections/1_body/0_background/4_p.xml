<p id="Par11">In spite of the conventional use of HIV genetic sequence data for research and public health surveillance, guidance on use is unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Specific guidance for use is particularly important considering that analysis of HIV phylogenetic sequences is data intensive. Sequences may be collected at one site, but stored for long periods, analysed or re-linked with data sets from elsewhere. Researchers have therefore expressed concern over potential ethical and legal issues that could arise from the application of HIV phylogenetics in HIV transmission dynamics research and in public health settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, despite the numerous ethical concerns raised, conceptual and empirical studies to explore these issues are relatively scarce [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
