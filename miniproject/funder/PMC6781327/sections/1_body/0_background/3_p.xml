<p id="Par10">The use of HIV phylogenetic analysis for molecular HIV surveillance and for optimizing HIV prevention strategies through targeting specific populations at high risk of transmitting HIV is gaining prominence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Customarily, HIV sequence data are obtained from HIV positive patients as part of routine clinical care, for example, to prescribe an antiretroviral treatment regimen during diagnosis and when drug resistance is suspected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Some sequences are obtained from study cohorts, primarily for research purposes. After phylogenetic analysis of HIV sequences, networks in which HIV transmission is occurring are identified, which inform the design of high impact HIV prevention and care interventions for persons in those networks. Targeted interventions may include follow-up of potential transmitters and partner notification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], provision of HIV testing services and pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as linkage and re-engagement to care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although common in high-income countries (HICs), which can afford the high costs and have the requisite laboratory infrastructure for genotyping, molecular HIV surveillance and HIV phylogenetic studies are inevitable in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) as the cost of genotyping becomes affordable [
