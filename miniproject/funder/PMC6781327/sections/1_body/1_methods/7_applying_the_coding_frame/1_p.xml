<p id="Par21">The coding frame was programmed into NVivo and all the transcripts were imported into the software. The coding frame was applied systematically across each transcript on a code-by-code basis. New themes and novel ideas of understanding different perspectives were explored in subsequent interviews. The coding frame was also revised to accommodate any emerging issues, taking note of such changes and the reason for the change. Coding was done by both SM and FM and reviewed by DW at the time of writing. Discrepancies were resolved by mutual agreement. The coding frame was continuously updated to accommodate new information until no new insights relevant to the research question were provided by additional interviews.</p>
