<p id="Par17">Due to the wide geographic distribution of the participants, most interviews were conducted via Skype. All participants provided verbal consent for both the interview and digital recording of the interview. Verbal consent was requested instead of written consent because of practical challenges associated with obtaining written consent from participants remotely (participants were from different parts of the world). This was explained in the protocol, which was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Ref BE224/16). The participants were also not a vulnerable population and the study questions were entirely scholarly and required no disclosure of personally sensitive information or any other information that could identify the participants.</p>
