<p id="Par16">Fourteen interviews were conducted between November and December 2016 guided by an open-ended interview schedule. Each interview was different from the others as subsequent questions were guided by the responses from each preceding question. Participants were first asked a broad question on their knowledge and experience with HIV phylogenetics followed by specific questions on what they perceived to be key ethical issues associated with the technique. The intention was to maximize diversity of views without confining participants to any pre-defined themes. All interviews were conducted by the first author (FM), a social scientist with a postgraduate degree in research ethics, but no formal training in molecular epidemiology. Each interview lasted an average of 45â€‰min.</p>
