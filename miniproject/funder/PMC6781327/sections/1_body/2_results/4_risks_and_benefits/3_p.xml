   <italic>Yes it’s a complicated thing... So actually, we did a lot of studies here. We try to explain phylogenetics to some of the population here and what we will try to do with the data. And we found that it was indeed very difficult for people to understand the process, the benefits and the risks associated with it.</italic> (#9)

   <italic>I think we are all working in good faith and we developed consent so that the situation will be working. But I think the idea of truly getting consent from someone and the moment they get consent they truly understand the risks, I think that’s a fallacy. I think what we are doing is say that we trust the people doing this work to work in the best interest of the population and protect individuals to the extent that we can. But there are risks that we do not anticipate and we have to make sure that the people who use the data downstream understand the protection that should be applied to this data. (#12)</italic>
