   <italic>“I think the biggest issue is that when we study small or large populations of genetic sequences of HIV, we know a lot about the people who contribute to those sequences and the relationship between them. We learn a lot about the people who contribute to the sequences depending on the amount of associated attributes that we have for the sequences... but I think it is potentially possible even without identifying information to work backwards with the other information to identify accurately who the infected individual is” (#14)</italic>
