   <italic>I think it remains a potential risk only as long as people don’t realize what the risks are. And once people start to realize that these data hold within them a lot more information than they realized, only then will people start to realize what they can do with those data and how they can be both used and thus misused. So my hope is that no one will ever use this data to go searching for opportunities to criminally prosecute an individual for HIV transmission. Having said that, do I think it could happen? Sure. It could. But right now I don’t think it’s likely to happen mostly because I don’t think people have really thought through that. I don’t think that’s high on people, certainly in the research field, that is not high on anybody’s list, but again I think once, at least in the field of research, it becomes a potential risk.
