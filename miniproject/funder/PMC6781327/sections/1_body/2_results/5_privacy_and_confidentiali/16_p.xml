   <italic>We have been trying to look at the strategy ... and probably the simplest thing I can say is that it is a very challenging strategy applied to molecular epidemiology. Because the structure of the network is critical to the interpretation of the results and differential privacy relies on the introduction of noise. The purpose for introduction of certain amount of noise into the data set is so that you preserve the structure of the data set but you make it less possible for the user of the data set to identify key features of identifiers of individuals in the data set and I don’t mean names. I just mean identifiers of any kind. And the challenge that I have with it is the introduction of noise almost by definition corrupts the structure of the data set. So I think we are not done with it but I will say it’s not something that in my mind is easily adapted to molecular epidemiology. (#14)</italic>
