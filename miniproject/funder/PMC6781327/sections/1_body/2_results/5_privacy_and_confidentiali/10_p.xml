   <italic>And I think to me the most critical information is the fact of the potential to infer putative transmission, which is to say, if two individuals have linked genetic sequences, meaning they are nearly genetically identical, identical enough that we could infer what we call putative transmission it is possible that one individual transmitted to another.
