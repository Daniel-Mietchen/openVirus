   <italic>Yeah, as long as the information that you ask belongs to a big enough group then it’s impossible to actually, as a researcher, link a particular sequence to a particular individual. Where it becomes difficult is when patients themselves release too much information on social media, for example. And if someone really wants to identify someone it might be possible.... I can imagine that if there is too much social information that along with a lot of information that the patient is releasing outside the research question, for people who really want, they might be able to identify a person, but still you cannot prove transmission, that is who infected whom. You cannot prove that.” (#1)</italic>
