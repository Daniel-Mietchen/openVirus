<p id="Par101">Based on the interpretation of the findings and our previous work, we conclude that existing research ethics guidelines may need to be adapted to the distinct ethical issues arising from HIV molecular epidemiology, in particular, phylogenetic HIV network research. As the discipline of molecular epidemiology evolves with the increasing availability of HIV sequence data it is critical to ensure that research ethics guidelines keep pace with biomedical advancements in the field. In particular, the social and public health implications of HIV molecular epidemiology studies need to be constantly interrogated in order to understand the impact and implications of HIV molecular epidemiology studies’ results on individuals and communities. Furthermore, the design of novel and evidence-based models of community engagement, consent and research governance could be instrumental in advancing both the science and ethics of the molecular epidemiology of HIV.</p>
