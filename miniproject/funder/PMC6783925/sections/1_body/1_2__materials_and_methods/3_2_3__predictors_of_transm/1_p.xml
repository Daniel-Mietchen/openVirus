<p>We extended the phylogeographic model above using a generalized linear modelling (GLM) framework to investigate the contribution of climactic, ecological, and demographic factors as potential predictors of transmission [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], preliminary ecological factors of interest included longitude, latitude, average temperature, and average precipitation. Preliminary demographic predictors included average population growth, population density, gross domestic state product (GDSP), and the percentage of S/UT population living in urban environments. We also calculated aviation passenger flux as the average number of domestic passengers recorded in all S/UT between 2009 and 2017 using data publicly available from the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. After assessing for collinearity, the final GLM included S/UT population density, average temperature, longitude, and passenger flux. We also included great-circle-distance between each pair-wise location and sample size by S/UT to assess for potential sampling biases. We estimated the mean posterior probability of each predictorâ€™s inclusion in the model, BF, and the effect coefficient using R as per [
