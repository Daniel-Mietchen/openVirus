<p>We used BEAUti v1.10 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to specify a discrete-trait phylogeographic model to estimate all possible transitions between the 14 Indian S/UT included in our Indian dataset (
 <italic>n</italic> = 613). We selected a GTR+Î“
 <sub>4</sub> substitution model with a relaxed clock based on preliminary path sampling and stone-stepping sampling results [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) and correlation (R

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We ran four models independently with 50 million Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) generations sampling every 5000 steps. We inspected runs for similar convergence around the posterior using Tracer v1.6 [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We combined combined runs using LogCombiner v1.10 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] after inspecting for similar convergence around the posterior using Tracer v1.6 removing 10% each as burn-in [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Each model specified a nonparametric Bayesian Skygrid tree prior [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with 50 intervals as default to reconstruct past population demographics. We produced maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees from the combined posterior tree distribution using TreeAnnotator v1.10 specifying median node heights [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We used SpreaD3 v0.9.6 [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to calculate Bayes factors (BF) for each pairwise transition between the 14 S/UT as well as to geospatially render the phylogeographic projections. We defined sufficient support for transmission as a BF &gt; 3 as per convention [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Higher levels of statistical support were defined according to
