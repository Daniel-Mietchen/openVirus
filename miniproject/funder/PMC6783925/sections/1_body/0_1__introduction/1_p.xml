<p>In early 2009, a novel influenza A H1N1 (A/H1N1pdm09) virus emerged in Veracruz, Mexico and California, USA and was responsible for the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a triple-reassortant influenza virus antigenically distinct from the former seasonal A/H1N1 [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the virus quickly spread around the world causing severe perturbations to health and surveillance systems [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During the pandemic, estimated case fatality ratios (CFR) ranged from less than 0.001% to 10% due in part to significant case under-ascertainment and the heterogeneity of case definitions between countries [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, a true geographic variation in CFR could not be excluded [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, as diagnostic capacity was overwhelmed, laboratory confirmation of infection was largely restricted to severe and fatal cases leaving estimates of total morbidity unknown. Studies have since estimated approximately 24% (95% confidence interval: 20â€“27%) of the global population was infected during the pandemic [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], while mortality was similar to that of a severe seasonal epidemic (~0.01% CFR) [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consistent with past pandemics, A/H1N1pdm09 has continued to circulate around the world seasonally every year since 2009, replacing pre-pandemic A/H1N1 strains [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and co-circulating with influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B viruses [
