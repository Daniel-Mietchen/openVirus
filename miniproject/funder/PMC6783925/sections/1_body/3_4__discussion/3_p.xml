<p>Our analysis also detected significantly increased selection at positions 84 and 256, relative to overseas viruses (

 <sub>S</sub> = 3.83; BCI = 2.68–5.35) but not significantly more than overseas (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00791-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>: BCI = 1.79–6.38), residue changes at these positions such as S84N, K163Q, and A256T (along with S185T mentioned previously) were frequently observed in our sample and are known to be characteristic of clade 6B and 6B.1 (S84N) A/H1N1pdm09 strains [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Clade 6B viruses are further defined by residue changes D97N and K283E in HA1, yet only position 97 and not 283 observed increased selection (d

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). Overall 36.1% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 221/613) of our sample comprised clade 6B H1N1pdm09 viruses, the majority (63.8%; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 141/221) of which were collected in 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Table S9</xref>). Clade 6B strains have been detected globally since 2012 [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and our results show sporadic detection of 6B resides since then (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Table S9</xref>) contrary to previous analyses [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] which suggested emergence in India in 2015. Notably, a previous study from 2014 found an association between clade 6B viruses with reduced immune responses among younger and middle-aged persons born after 1985 [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. As the majority of sequences isolated during the severe 2015 season (96.1%; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 141/147) comprised of 6B viruses, the increased selection at these sites relative to overseas viruses (excluding K163Q and K283E) provides additional explanation for increased morbidity and mortality observed in India during that season. By 2017, 77.7% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7/9) of the sequenced dataset was of clade 6B.1, although there was little data available from that year. Following the widespread global circulation of clade 6B and subclade 6B.1 (S84N, S162N, and I216T) residues, the A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain was updated for the first time since 2009 (from A/California/7/2009 to A/Michigan/45/2015) during the 2017–2019 Southern Hemisphere influenza seasons [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The 2019–2020 Northern Hemisphere recommendation includes another updated A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain, A/Brisbane/02/2018 from clade 6B.1A, which includes additional residue changes [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Since the uptake of the influenza vaccine however remains low in India, the increased selection and significant emergence of clade 6B in 2015 and 6B.1 in 2017 could have contributed to the high morbidity and mortality observed there. Increasing influenza vaccination rates should help to reduce the impact of future A/H1N1pdm09 epidemics in India.
