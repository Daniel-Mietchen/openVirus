<p>Overall the combination of increased selection for and circulation of clade 6B genogroups, increased selection of known determinates of A/H1N1pdm09 severity such as D222N/G, and the identification of potentially new antigenic determinates of severity such as A186T, together provides credible genomic evidence that might explain the increased frequency and severity of A/H1N1pdm09 epidemics in India. Seasonal surveillance of clade 6B residues (and related subclades), D222G/N, and residue changes at site 186 may assist with the early detection of severe epidemics in the future.</p>
