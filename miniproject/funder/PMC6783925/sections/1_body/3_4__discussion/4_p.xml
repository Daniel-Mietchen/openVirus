<p>Finally, we calculated selection ratios at position 222 up to eight times greater than the equivalent sample of globally circulating A/H1N1pdm09 (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00791-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the highest of all sites detected. Variants at this position, particularly D222G/N are known to preferentially bind to α2,3-linked sialic acid (α2,3-SA) receptors necessary for lower respiratory tract colonisation in humans [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and have demonstrated an associated 11% increase in morbidity and 23% increase in mortality in cases infected with D222G/N mutants [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] although this was contested by the National Institute of Virology in Pune [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In our sample of 613 Indian taxa we identified both G222 and N222 residues, albeit at low frequencies, 3.1% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19/613) and 1.6% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10/613) respectively, and only once in 2015. Like position 186, the sporadic detection of residue changes at position 222 means the impact on the observed morbidity and morbidity in India is not clear. However, the disproportionate increase in selection at position 222 (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00791-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) further exemplifies the unusual epidemiological situation in the country. Because short-term selection is a stochastic process [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] but long-term is known to involve complex interactions between A/H1N1pdm09 evolution, host response, and human behavior [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00791" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the observed increase in pervasive positive selection in India could therefore be the result of between-host transmission characteristics unique to the country and warrants further investigation [
