<p>Our study is also the first to simultaneously integrate GLM and Bayesian phylogeography analysis methods to empirically quantify the transmission dynamics of A/H1N1pdm09 in India revealing supported routes of A/H1N1pdm09 transmission. We have identified Maharashtra state as a key location disseminating A/H1N1pdm09 to many S/UT including Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, and Kerala (

These results could have important implications for surveillance, risk assessment, and epidemic control strategies including vaccination in the country, as they could also be generalisable for other influenza A viruses such as A/H3N2 or other potentially pandemic variants that could emerge in the future. For example, India, along with East and Southeast Asia has been shown to be a significant source for globally circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses [

Therefore understanding the transmission patterns of influenza A within India allows for rapid risk assessment not only within the country, but also risk assessment for subsequent spread around the world.
