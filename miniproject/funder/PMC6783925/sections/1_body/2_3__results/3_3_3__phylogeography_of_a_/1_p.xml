<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00791-f003">Figure 3</xref> we show the spatio-temporal projection of definitive A/H1N1pdm09 transmission (BF &gt; 100) in India from 2009 to 2017 based on the most complete sequence dataset available (
 <italic>n</italic> = 613). The corresponding phylogeographic MCC tree can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>. We observe consistent historic transmission over time from Maharashtra to most S/UT included in our model, spanning the entire latitude of India. The average of each of the five randomly down-sampled datasets showed similar routes of transmission demonstrating connections from Maharashtra to most S/UT (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Figure S4 and Table S7</xref>). Between the 14 S/UT modelled as discrete-traits, we identified 30 supported (BF &gt; 3) routes of asymmetric transmission out of a possible 182 unique paths (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00791">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). Maharashtra was the most frequently implicated origin site for transmission (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9/30; 30%) and the most supported (221,244 &gt; BF &gt; 199.23) followed by Karnataka (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8/30; 27%), and Jammu and Kashmir (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4/30; 13%). Kerala was the most frequently implicated destination for transmission (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5/30; 17%), followed by Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Karnataka (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3/30; 10% each). Assam, Punjab, and Rajasthan were not supported sources for transmission (BF &lt; 1) but were variably implicated as destinations (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4/30; 13% and 1/30; 3% respectively). Maharashtra was the only state implicated as a frequent source of transmission (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6/30; 20%) but never as a destination.
