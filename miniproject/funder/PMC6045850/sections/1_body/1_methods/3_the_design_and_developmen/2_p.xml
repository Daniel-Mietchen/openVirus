<p id="Par52">In 2012, national stakeholders held several NTF meetings to discuss ways of revitalising IDSR in Uganda. They finally reached a consensus about building a competent workforce at the sub-national level to ensure a solid IDSR system. A plan, to implement a nationwide IDSR training to health facilitiesbased on the revised IDSR guidelineswas developed. The training plan was costed at an average cost of US $230 per trainee. (Makumbi, I., Personal communication). The training was planned to be accompanied by systematic follow-up visits, regular monitoring and support supervision to improve reliability and quality of the system gradually in a manner that could ensure sustainability and foster accountability. However, between 2013 and 2014, the implementation of the plan stalled mainly due to lack of funding.</p>
