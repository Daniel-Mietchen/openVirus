<p id="Par53">The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2013–2014 posed an imminent risk of importation of the virus to Uganda owing to the many Ugandans supporting the response in West Africa and the unrestricted international travel and trade. MOH together with partners developed a national EVD/Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) preparedness and response plan and mobilised resources locally to enhance the country’s readiness. Drawing from the lessons of the EVD outbreak in West Africa, and in line with MOH’s decision in 2012, this plan prioritised training for frontline health workers to strengthen surveillance and response capacities within the IDSR framework. This training was complemented by building capacity in EVD case management, infection prevention and control (IPC), in addition to the regional capacity for laboratory verification and confirmation (Table
