<p id="Par50">We reviewed published and unpublished national policy documents and guidelines to document the IDSR implementation framework in Uganda, from 2001 to 2016. We also reviewed preparedness and response protocols developed during the study period, in addition to unpublished reports and minutes of the NTF meeting on epidemics and emergencies. Reports and minutes from the technical working group meetings held for planning and monitoring of the IDSR program during the study period were also reviewed. We reviewed the respective training curriculum documents, training materials, training reports and trainee databases to understand the design, organization and conduct of the training. We also interviewed 18 key informants at the national and district levels to understand the implementation of the training. For information on program funding, we interviewed 10 surveillance focal persons at the districts, MOH and the WHO Country Office(WCO). We also reviewed the program financial documents including budget documents, procurement and equipment handover records to understand logistics and resources deployed in the process.</p>
