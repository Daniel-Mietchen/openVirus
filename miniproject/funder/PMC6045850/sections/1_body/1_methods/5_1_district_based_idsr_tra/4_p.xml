<p id="Par57">Participants covered specific modules relevant to their roles and tasks in IDSR with emphasis on relevant skill development. Training in the form of facilitated workshops with guided practice sessions was held at both national and district levels. Case scenarios generated from real-life events were included to facilitate competence and skill acquisition. Efforts were made to integrate different programs. For-example modules on m-Trac (a mobile telephone SMS based information system), electronic Health Management and Information System (HMIS), plus tools for maternal and perinatal deaths surveillance were incorporated into the training [

   <p id="Par58">Training of health facility-based health workers: From the IDSR core function matrix, IDSR core activities performed at this level are mainly case detection, reporting and data analysis [

    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. While these health workers are expected to participate in other IDSR core activities, they are usually supported by the higher levels. Training of operational health workers targeted 80% coverage of the public sector. These were trained during the first 3 training days, covering modules 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 
    <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Additional short modules covered included VHFS’ control overview, key strategies and indicators of the national Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI), plus the IDSR monitoring framework.

   <p id="Par60">District task force (DTF) training: The DTF is a coordinating committee composed of technical members from various sectors in addition to the district political and technical leadership. The DTF’s role is to develop and oversee the implementation of emergency preparedness strategies, action plans and procedures [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The 1-day DTF training was to enhance district capacity to prepare for and coordinate public health emergency response and this training covered modules 5, 6 and 7(fig. 
    <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). To engage the district leadership to provide oversight of the program, the permanent secretary MOH issued a circular notice to targeted districts. The letter advocated for a functional disease surveillance and early warning system and pointed out expected key deliverables following IDSR training. This letter was delivered by the central facilitators during a courtesy and mobilisation visit to the district leadership through the DHO prior to the DTF training.

   <p id="Par61">Performance monitoring and accountability framework: A framework for monitoring IDSR performance in the district with key deliverables and indicators was collectively agreed upon during the training. The two indicators selected for monitoring IDSR performance were; the proportion of health facilities submitting weekly surveillance report on time to the district level and the proportion of health facilities conducting a detailed case-based investigation for acute flaccid paralysis and measles cases [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Also, the DHT/DTF resolved to include the district’s IDSR performance as an agenda item for discussion during all regular health committee meetings. With support from the district leadership, trainers led a detailed discussion of factors that could affect attainment of these indicators and subsequently supported teams to develop tailored action plans to mitigate the issues. Clear next steps and commitments were obtained and followed upon during quarterly support supervision activities and IDSR review meetings.
