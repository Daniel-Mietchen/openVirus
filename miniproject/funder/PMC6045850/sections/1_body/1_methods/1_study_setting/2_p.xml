These facilities offer a comprehensive health-care including specialised services. General hospitals are at the district level whereas health centre IVs (HCIV) are located at the health sub-districts (HSD) and provide comprehensive services including blood transfusion and comprehensive emergency obstetric care. HCIIIs are found at the sub-county level, are manned by a clinical officer and offer both basic in-patient and out-patient services, whereas HC IIs are at the parish level and provide only out-patient services. The HC I has no physical structure but comprises a village health team(VHT) which links the community to the health system [

The district level is the focus for integrating and implementation of IDSR, in addition to health workforce management, support supervision plus health system performance monitoring. The district health department receives reports from HSDs and submits an aggregated report to the national level electronically. The HSD oversees health services within health facilities within the catchment area, receives surveillance reports from these units and submits aggregate data to the district. The District Surveillance Focal Person (DSFP) oversees surveillance activities in the district supervised by the District Health Officer (DHO) [
