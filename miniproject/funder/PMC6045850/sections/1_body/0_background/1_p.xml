<p id="Par42">In 1998, the World Health Organization Africa region (WHO-AFRO) introduced the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy as one of the approaches to control the disproportionate communicable disease burden in the region [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The strategy aimed at strengthening integrated, action-oriented public health surveillance and response at all levels of the health system [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a functional system, all the six IDSR core activities (detection, registration, confirmation, reporting, data analysis and provision of feedback) must operate optimally for prompt public health action [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These are enabled by managerial and support functions such as communication, training, supervision, and resource-provision. Since the introduction of IDSR, 46 member states in WHO-AFRO region have adopted and implemented the strategy to varying levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The strategy, however, has achieved positive outcomes in countries where IDSR support functions such as training, supervision and resource provision were optimal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, the number of IDSR trained personnel was found to be directly proportional to improvements in IDSR core function indicators in several WHO-AFRO states [
