<p id="Par75">Due to the lack of isolation units in the country, MOH with support from DFID through WHO procured five tents, each with a 20-bed capacity designed to serve as emergency isolation facility that can quickly be deployed in case of a VHF outbreak. Assorted drugs, medical supplies and over 2000 sets of personal protective equipment were also procured and pre-positioned at RRHs and district hospitals.
