<p id="Par67">The initial IDSR TOT was held in 2013 and targeted 30 national trainers. However, the majority of these trainers were deployed to West Africa to support the response to EVD outbreak between 2013 and 2014. Another TOT was conducted in 2015, training 26 participants. National trainers were drawn from the WHO Country Office, MOH departments and regional referral hospitals and the academia. The regional EPI /IDSR focal persons were prioritised. The pool of national trainers assisted by district trainers enabled concurrent training of multiple districts. Trainers were also identified from DHTs of well-performing districts (districts with consistent weekly HMIS reporting over the previous quarter) to share their best practices and enriched the training.</p>
