<p id="Par84">The re-vitalisation of the IDSR program in Uganda highlights unique features which can be easily adopted and applied by other countries that would wish to strengthen their IDSR programs. Through a coordinated partner support and response, funding which was not primarily earmarked for IDSR implementation was mobilised and harnessed to achieve nation-wide equipping of multi-disciplinary district teams with skill-sets and tools necessary for performing relevant IDSR functions. The program also promoted engagement of local district leadership which is critical in fostering accountability and is a positive step in exploring sustainability possibility of the program as the long-term funding from governments for global health security is pursued. We demonstrate that when partners work collaboratively and pool their efforts together in a coordinated manner, a significant impact on public health can be achieved countrywide.</p>
