<p id="Par78">The design and process of the program implementation also provide valuable and key considerations. Firstly, the IDSR training brought together health workers of multiple disciplines. In higher health facilities, this helped health workers who are primarily not involved in surveillance activities appreciate their indirect yet critical contribution to the program and helped foster teamwork. In lower health units, frontline health workers were identified and equipped with skills to execute relevant IDSR at that level. Training of laboratory staff through the two complementary courses helped supplement the efforts to strengthen laboratory capacity for appropriate pathogen confirmation and sensitivity monitoring, a critical yet one of the weakest program components in the WHO-AFRO region [

This approach was to ensure that competent one health teams that can readily be mobilised and deployed for rapid outbreak investigation and response are available within the districts. Veterinarians at the district level were also included in the DRRT training in the spirit of one health. In contrast to earlier IDSR training where participants covered all eight modules, participants in this training only covered modules that were considered the most crucial to building their required primary skill-set according to the WHO-IDSR function matrix [
