The goal was to build the country&#x02019;s capacity to detect, report promptly, and effectively respond to public health emergencies and priorities. The considerable investment into the program startup realised significant IDSR core performance. However, due to un-sustained funding from the mid-2000s onwards, these achievements were undermined. Following the adoption of the revised World Health Organization guidelines on IDSR, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) in collaboration with key partners decided to revitalise IDSR and operationalise the updated IDSR guidelines in 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Through the review of both published and unpublished national guidelines, reports and other IDSR program records in addition to an interview of key informants, we describe the design and process of IDSR revitalisation in Uganda, 2013&#x02013;2016. The program aimed to enhance the districts&#x02019; capacity to promptly detect, assess and effectively respond to public health emergencies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Through a cascaded, targeted skill-development training model, 7785 participants were trained in IDSR between 2015 and 2016. Of these, 5489(71%) were facility-based multi-disciplinary health workers, 1107 (14%) comprised the district rapid response teams and 1188 (15%) constituted the district task forces. This training was complemented by other courses for regional teams in addition to the provision of logistics to support IDSR activities. Centrally, IDSR implementation was coordinated and monitored by the MoH&#x02019;s national task force (NTF) on epidemics and emergencies. The NTF and in close collaboration with the WHO Country Office, mobilised resources from various partners and development initiatives. At regional and district levels, the technical and political leadership were mobilised and engaged in monitoring and overseeing program implementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">The IDSR re-vitalization in Uganda highlights unique features that can be considered by other countries that would wish to strengthen their IDSR programs. Through a coordinated partner response, the program harnessed resources which primarily were not earmarked for IDSR to strengthen the program nation-wide.

The strategy aimed at strengthening integrated, action-oriented public health surveillance and response at all levels of the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a functional system, all the six IDSR core activities (detection, registration, confirmation, reporting, data analysis and provision of feedback) must operate optimally for prompt public health action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These are enabled by managerial and support functions such as communication, training, supervision, and resource-provision. Since the introduction of IDSR, 46 member states in WHO-AFRO region have adopted and implemented the strategy to varying levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although remarkable improvements in surveillance have been realised in some countries, challenges in IDSR core and support functions still prevail in many of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The strategy, however, has achieved positive outcomes in countries where IDSR support functions such as training, supervision and resource provision were optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, the number of IDSR trained personnel was found to be directly proportional to improvements in IDSR core function indicators in several WHO-AFRO states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Uganda, like many countries in WHO-AFRO region, is disproportionately affected by endemic, emerging and re-emerging communicable disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The rapid population expansion, increased human ecosystem interaction and climate change make the country vulnerable to disease outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is imperative that Uganda has a robust public health surveillance and response system that can effectively detect, respond to these public health threats and mitigate their impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Uganda adopted and has been implementing IDSR since 2000 in a phased manner. Implementation commenced with a baseline assessment of the vertical surveillance programs in the country then a 5-year strategic plan and consequent annual work-plans followed. These aimed at creating a functional early warning surveillance system and appropriate public health response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Subsequently, several initiatives were undertaken to strengthen IDSR in Uganda over the years resulting in evident improvements such as early detection and prompt response to outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The 2009 assessment of the national public health surveillance systems in the country confirmed these achievements and affirmed that the solid IDSR foundation established could be harnessed to build the WHO/International Health Regulations(IHR 2005) core capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This assessment, however, uncovered several challenges affecting IDSR implementation including inconsistent and inadequate support for training, support supervision, communication and feedback. The majority of the districts assessed lacked personnel trained in IDSR. Key reporting tools and reference materials were lacking at the operational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Following the revision of the generic WHO-IDSR guidelines in 2010, Uganda adopted the changes in revised national IDSR guidelines in 2011. The Ministry of Health&#x000a0;(MOH) in collaboration with key partners decided to revitalise the IDSR program and implement the revised guidelines in 2012 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Timeline of implementation of activities to strengthen the IDSR program in Uganda</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2018_5755_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par46">The re-vitalisation aimed to enhance the capacity of districts to promptly detect, assess and effectively respond to public health emergencies.</p><p id="Par47">We describe the design and process of IDSR re-vitalisation in Uganda highlighting the roll-out of the revised IDSR guidelines through structured training of the health workforce up to the operational level nation-wide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par48">The Uganda MOH is mandated to lead health service delivery including public health emergencies (PHEs), supported by line sectors such as the agriculture and animal industries ministry in the case of zoonotic disease outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The national task force (NTF) on epidemics and emergencies is a structure under MOH that coordinates public health emergency response and also is a platform for resource mobilisation, stakeholder engagement and coordination. The NTF reports to the multispectral National Disaster Risk Reduction platform, which platorm ultimately reports to the state cabinet. At the district level, a similar structure, the district task force (DTF) which is an entity of the multisectoral District Disaster Management Technical Committee takes the lead in response to PHEs. Technically, the DTF reports to the NTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Health service delivery in Uganda is decentralised to districts and health sub-districts (HSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. By 2015, there were 112 districts within 14 health regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The health system is structured into national referral hospitals (NRH) at the top, followed by regional referral hospitals (RRHs). These facilities offer a comprehensive health-care including specialised services. General hospitals are at the district level whereas health centre IVs (HCIV) are located at the health sub-districts (HSD) and provide comprehensive services including blood transfusion and comprehensive emergency obstetric care. HCIIIs are found at the sub-county level, are manned by a clinical officer and offer both basic in-patient and out-patient services, whereas HC IIs are at the parish level and provide only out-patient services. The HC I has no physical structure but comprises a village health team(VHT) which links the community to the health system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The district level is the focus for integrating and implementation of IDSR, in addition to health workforce management, support supervision plus health system performance monitoring. The district health department receives reports from HSDs and submits an aggregated report to the national level electronically. The HSD oversees health services within health facilities within the catchment area, receives surveillance reports from these units and submits aggregate data to the district. The District Surveillance Focal Person (DSFP) oversees surveillance activities in the district supervised by the District Health Officer (DHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Laboratory or surveillance focal persons at each level ensure safe specimen processing or referral to regional or centralised reference laboratories via the laboratory hub system. Laboratory results are delivered via the reverse mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and procedures</title><p id="Par50">We reviewed published and unpublished national policy documents and guidelines to document the IDSR implementation framework in Uganda, from 2001 to 2016. We also reviewed preparedness and response protocols developed during the study period, in addition to unpublished reports and minutes of the NTF meeting on epidemics and emergencies. Reports and minutes from the technical working group meetings held for planning and monitoring of the IDSR program during the study period were also reviewed. We reviewed the respective training curriculum documents, training materials, training reports and trainee databases to understand the design, organization and conduct of the training. We also interviewed 18 key informants at the national and district levels to understand the implementation of the training. For information on program funding, we interviewed 10 surveillance focal persons at the districts, MOH and the WHO Country Office(WCO). We also reviewed the program financial documents including budget documents, procurement and equipment handover records to understand logistics and resources deployed in the process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The design and development of the nation-wide IDSR training plan</title><p id="Par51">The 2009 IDSR assessment in Uganda revealed that while substantial resources had been allocated for establishing IDSR in the early to mid-2000s, the marked reduction of funds for IDSR systems over the years led to a loss of previously attained capacities particularly at the operational level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Analysis of the country&#x02019;s responses to disease outbreaks also showed several bottlenecks that needed to be addressed collectively in a coordinated manner. Among them, was a need for a harmonised outbreak response and information flow at the district level.</p><p id="Par52">In 2012, national stakeholders held several NTF meetings to discuss ways of revitalising IDSR in Uganda. They finally reached a consensus about building a competent workforce at the sub-national level to ensure a solid IDSR system. A plan, to implement a nationwide IDSR training to health facilitiesbased on the revised IDSR guidelineswas developed. The training plan was costed at an average cost of US $230 per trainee. (Makumbi, I., Personal communication). The training was planned to be accompanied by systematic follow-up visits, regular monitoring and support supervision to improve reliability and quality of the system gradually in a manner that could ensure sustainability and foster accountability. However, between 2013 and 2014, the implementation of the plan stalled mainly due to lack of funding.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Risk of Ebola virus importation from West Africa, a catalyst to IDSR revitalisation</title><p id="Par53">The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2013&#x02013;2014 posed an imminent risk of importation of the virus to Uganda owing to the many Ugandans supporting the response in West Africa and the unrestricted international travel and trade. MOH together with partners developed a national EVD/Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) preparedness and response plan and mobilised resources locally to enhance the country&#x02019;s readiness. Drawing from the lessons of the EVD outbreak in West Africa, and in line with MOH&#x02019;s decision in 2012, this plan prioritised training for frontline health workers to strengthen surveillance and response capacities within the IDSR framework.

Significant participant knowledge gain noted across the board was noted across the board, and this was further complemented with post-training support through the integrated support supervision. The number of trained health personnel has been shown to be associated with improvements in IDSR functioning particularly regarding completeness and timeliness of reporting, analysis, interpretation and use of surveillance data at the source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The program also equipped all health workers trained with job aids such as case definitions, surveillance thresholds, reporting forms and national IDSR guidelines. Such tools have been shown to be largely missing at peripheral health system levels in many countries, yet are essential to support health workers in executing day today IDSR activities such as reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">The design and process of the program implementation also provide valuable and key considerations. Firstly, the IDSR training brought together health workers of multiple disciplines. In higher health facilities, this helped health workers who are primarily not involved in surveillance activities appreciate their indirect yet critical contribution to the program and helped foster teamwork. In lower health units, frontline health workers were identified and equipped with skills to execute relevant IDSR at that level. Training of laboratory staff through the two complementary courses helped supplement the efforts to strengthen laboratory capacity for appropriate pathogen confirmation and sensitivity monitoring, a critical yet one of the weakest program components in the WHO-AFRO region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. A multi-disciplinary team consisting of the DHT, HSD, and high volume health facilities were trained as the DRRT. This approach was to ensure that competent one health teams that can readily be mobilised and deployed for rapid outbreak investigation and response are available within the districts. Veterinarians at the district level were also included in the DRRT training in the spirit of one health. In contrast to earlier IDSR training where participants covered all eight modules, participants in this training only covered modules that were considered the most crucial to building their required primary skill-set according to the WHO-IDSR function matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This approach provided participants adequate time to concretise the content and also shortened the duration participants spent away from duty-stations which is a concern during capacity building initiatives for in-service personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">Secondly, the cascade approach generated a pool of trainers that enabled concurrent training of multiple districts. Preparations for the training followed a standard checklist, and continuous quality improvement was made based on the end of training evaluation. Districts were engaged to do the selection and mobilisation of participants according to preset criteria. Districts also handled logistical and administrative preparations of the training, an approach that promoted district involvement and ownership of the program. The best practices shared by the district trainers enriched the training and participant action plan development.</p><p id="Par80">Thirdly, the integration of other modules into the IDSR training fostered complementarity of programs, minimising wastage of resources due to duplication of efforts. This was further strengthened by NTF coordination and oversight of the program. Though more elaborate content was covered in the regional VHF and laboratory courses, the training was conducted within the IDSR framework enhancing complementarity.</p><p id="Par81">Fourthly, drawing from lessons learnt during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the importance of prompt and effective community engagement in outbreak preparedness and response cannot be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. This program approached this component through engagement of the district technical and political leadership to oversee the IDSR implementation and accountability framework. More still, district political leaders in Uganda have free weekly air-time access to advocate, strengthen and monitor government programs through major local media houses in the district. The same platform could be leveraged to further engage and involve the local communities in the IDSR program.</p><p id="Par82">Lastly, the program illustrated how funding from both national programs and partners that otherwise was not directly earmarked for IDSR activities was harnessed to strengthen the program. Lack of sustainable funding of IDSR activities is the major challenge in IDSR implementation in many countries, Uganda inclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The program, thus anticipated that funding for IDSR would be incorporated into the districts&#x02019; budgets, once the program&#x02019;s importance and utility were appreciated by the district leadership. More-still, the WHO /IHR and the CDC global health security agenda advocate for countries to allocate a budget line at the central level to facilitate IDSR implementation which is the vehicle to implement IHR in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par83">One limitation in this study is that the key informants&#x02019; views could have been were influenced by their role in the programme. They could have had a natural bias to focus on positive aspects of the programme and the reviewed records could have forcused on programme successes. However we tried to tease out the pertinent issues and also we triangulated sources of information to mitigate the effect of the limitation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par84">The re-vitalisation of the IDSR program in Uganda highlights unique features which can be easily adopted and applied by other countries that would wish to strengthen their IDSR programs. Through a coordinated partner support and response, funding which was not primarily earmarked for IDSR implementation was mobilised and harnessed to achieve nation-wide equipping of multi-disciplinary district teams with skill-sets and tools necessary for performing relevant IDSR functions. The program also promoted engagement of local district leadership which is critical in fostering accountability and is a positive step in exploring sustainability possibility of the program as the long-term funding from governments for global health security is pursued. We demonstrate that when partners work collaboratively and pool their efforts together in a coordinated manner, a significant impact on public health can be achieved countrywide.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AFP</term><def><p id="Par5">Acute Flaccid Paralysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CERF</term><def><p id="Par6">Central Emergency Response Fund</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DFID</term><def><p id="Par7">Department for International Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DGHS</term><def><p id="Par8">Director General Health Services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHIS2</term><def><p id="Par9">Disrict Health Information Software 2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHO</term><def><p id="Par10">District Health Officer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DHT</term><def><p id="Par11">District Health Team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRRT</term><def><p id="Par12">District Rapid Response Team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSFP</term><def><p id="Par13">District Surveillance Focal Person</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DTF</term><def><p id="Par14">District Task Force</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPI</term><def><p id="Par15">Expanded Program on immunization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EVD</term><def><p id="Par16">Ebola Virus Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPEI</term><def><p id="Par17">Global Polio Eradication Initiative</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HC</term><def><p id="Par18">Health Centre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HMIS</term><def><p id="Par19">Health Management and Information System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSD</term><def><p id="Par20">Health Sub-district</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IATA</term><def><p id="Par21">International Air Transport Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDSR</term><def><p id="Par22">Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IHR</term><def><p id="Par23">International Health Regulations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPC</term><def><p id="Par24">Infection Prevention and Control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOH</term><def><p id="Par25">Ministry of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NTF</term><def><p id="Par26">National Task Force on Epidemics and Public HealthEmergencies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PHE</term><def><p id="Par27">Public Health Emergencies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POE</term><def><p id="Par28">Port of Entry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RMANCH</term><def><p id="Par29">for Reproductive Maternal Newborn Adolescent and Child Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RRH</term><def><p id="Par30">Regional Referral Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOPS</term><def><p id="Par31">Standard Operating Procedures</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TOT</term><def><p id="Par32">Training of Trainers</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p id="Par33">United Kingdom</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UNICEF</term><def><p id="Par34">United Nations Children&#x02019;s Fund</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US CDC</term><def><p id="Par35">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USAID</term><def><p id="Par36">United States Agency for International Development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VHF</term><def><p id="Par37">Viral Hemorrhagic Fever</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VHT</term><def><p id="Par38">Village Health Team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WCO</term><def><p id="Par39">World Health Organization Country Office</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par40">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO-AFRO</term><def><p id="Par41">World Health Organization Africa Regional Office</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the Epidemiology and Surveillance Division, Ministry of Health Uganda for their support during this study.
