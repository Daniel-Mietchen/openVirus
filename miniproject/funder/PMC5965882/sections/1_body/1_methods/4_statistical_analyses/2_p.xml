<p>In exploratory analyses, we first used logistic regression models to examine the bivariable relationships between depression, harmful alcohol use, problematic drug use and sexual compulsivity (reporting the results using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals), anticipating positive associations between these closely related conditions. Next, to examine the hypothesis that syndemic burden is associated with the degree of HIV risk among MSM, we constructed simple and multivariable linear regression models using the syndemic count (defined as the total number of syndemic conditions present in each participant) as the primary predictor variable and the HIRI-MSM score as the outcome variable. When building the multivariable model, we considered all available demographic, clinical, attitude- and discrimination-related data, after removal of variables due to collinearity and exclusion of variables that are components of the HIRI-MSM index (ie. age and the type of sexual exposure prompting nPEP use). Patient characteristics were retained as covariates in the final model if they changed the magnitude of the parameter estimate for the primary predictor variable by â‰¥10% in bivariable analyses. Results are reported as beta estimates with 95% confidence intervals and p-values. Finally, applying an approach suggested by other authors to ascertain whether this relationship might be additive or synergistic in nature,[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] we constructed a separate multivariable linear regression model in which each syndemic condition, as well as each possible 2-way, 3-way and 4-way interaction term between these conditions, was included as a predictor variable, and the HIRI-MSM score was included as the outcome variable.
