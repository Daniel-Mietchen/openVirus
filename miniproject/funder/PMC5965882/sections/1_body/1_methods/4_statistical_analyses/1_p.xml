<p>Primary and secondary analyses for this study were descriptive. We tabulated scores for each of the included scales and sub-scales for each respondent, and summarized results using both actual scores as continuous outcomes, and proportions of participants surpassing cutoffs as dichotomous outcomes. Results are presented as medians (interquartile ranges) and frequencies (percentages) as appropriate.</p>
