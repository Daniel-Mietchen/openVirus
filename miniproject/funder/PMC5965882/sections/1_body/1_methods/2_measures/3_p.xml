<p>Our secondary objectives were to assess attitudes relevant to HIV risk behaviours. These included perceptions of HIV risk, which we measured using the 16-item Disengagement Coping with HIV Risk (DCHR) scale (α = 0.86).[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Its three sub-scales measure fatalistic beliefs about eventually acquiring HIV (‘HIV fatalism’, eg. “I sometimes wonder if it’s worth all the trouble it takes to stay HIV-negative”), reduced perceived severity of HIV infection due to medical advances (‘HIV optimism’, eg. “I’m less concerned about getting AIDS now that there are new effective medicines to treat it”), and negative affective states associated with the risk of HIV infection (‘anxieties’, eg. “I give myself grief about not protecting myself”). We used the 14-item Multi-Axial gay men’s Inventory–Men’s Short Version (MAGI-MSV) to assess four domains of internalized homophobia: low self-esteem related to sexual orientation (eg. “Whenever I think about being gay, I feel depressed”, discomfort with public appearances related to homosexuality (eg. “Some gay men are too effeminate”), maladaptive responses to homosexuality (eg. “Over the past 2 years, I have actually attempted suicide because I could not accept my homosexuality”, and negative feelings towards homosexuality due to HIV/AIDS (eg. “Occasionally, when I think about AIDS, I start wishing that I weren’t gay”) (α = 0.92).[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We used the 9-item Benefits of Barebacking scale (BBS) to measure perceived benefits of intentional condomless anal intercourse among MSM (eg. “Barebacking is sexier than sex with condoms” α = 0.92).[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] We also included the 9-item Sexual Sensation Seeking (SSS) Scale,[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to explore motivations for engaging in riskier sexual activity (eg. “I like new and exciting sexual experiences and sensations”, α = 0.80). For all four attitude scales, lower scores indicate lower levels of the measured construct. Finally, to assess MSM participants’ experiences of homophobia, we included two four-level Likert scale items of our own design, reading, “I have experienced discrimination related to my sexual orientation in my life” and “I experience discrimination related to my sexual orientation often”.
