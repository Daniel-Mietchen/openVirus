<p>Our primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of depression, harmful alcohol use, problematic drug use, and sexual compulsivity in the study cohort, using the following standardized scales and cutoff values. On the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale,[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] we used a cut-off score of 16, which has been established as a useful screening tool for depression (Cronbach’s α = 0.92).[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] On the 10–item Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT),[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] we used a cutoff score of eight, which gives a sensitivity and specificity as good as, or superior to comparator scales for harmful alcohol use (α = 0.87).[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] we used a cutoff of six, which in men, indicates drug-related problems (α = 0.88).[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] On the 10–item sexual compulsivity scale (SCS),[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] we used the recommended cutoff of 24 to indicate problems with ‘sexual addiction’ (α = 0.93).[
