<p>During the study period, clinical nPEP protocols at the participating sites recommended a 28-day regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine with either lopinavir/ritonavir or raltegravir, although the timing of final follow-up visits changed from 4â€“6 months to 3 months post-exposure during the course of the study. We reviewed patient charts six months post-enrolment to assess clinical outcomes, including prevalent STIs at the time of presentation, HIV status, nPEP side effects, and completion of follow-up.</p>
