<p>We distributed a one-time self-administered questionnaire to patients seeking nPEP between July 2013 and August 2016, and reviewed patient charts six months post-enrolment. Any adult presenting for the first time to participating infectious diseases clinics at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital, Toronto General Hospital, or The Ottawa Hospital regarding nPEP for potential sexual exposures to HIV was eligible to complete the questionnaire. Because the vast majority of participants were MSM, we restricted our analyses to this population.</p>
