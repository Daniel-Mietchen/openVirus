<p>The target sample size was based on the number of participants required to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in the sample with reasonable precision. Using the equation N = (Z
 <sub>1-α/2</sub>)
 <sup>2</sup> * p(1-p) / 
 <italic>l</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, where Z
 <sub>1-α/2</sub> is the 1-α/2 critical value of the standard normal distribution, p is the proportion of interest, 
 <italic>l</italic> is half the length of the desired 95% confidence interval, and N is the required sample size, a conservative estimate of 50% prevalence determined that 171 participants were needed to achieve a 95% confidence interval that was 15% wide.
