 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197998.t002">Table 2</xref>. The median DCHR subscale scores showed low levels of HIV fatalism (7.0, IQR = 6.0–9.0) and optimism (8.0, IQR = 6.0, 14.0), and moderate levels of HIV-related anxiety (13.0, IQR = 10.0–15.0), compared to the ranges of possible scores (6–30, 6–30, 4–20 respectively). The median MAGI-MSV score (6.5, IQR = 2.0–13.0) indicated low levels of internalized homophobia, as further reflected in each subscale: Gay self-assurance and worth (2.0, IQR = 0.0–7.0), Public appearance of homosexuality (2.0, IQR = 0.0–5.0), Extreme/maladaptive measures to homosexuality (0.0, IQR = 0.0–0.0), and Impact of HIV/AIDS on homosexuality (0.0, IQR = 0.0–2.0). The relatively low median score on the BBS (20.0, IQR = 13.0–28.0) indicates that, overall, MSM did not perceive strong benefits to condomless anal intercourse. The median score on the SSS scale was moderate (19.5, IQR = 16.0–23.0), indicating that most participants only partially identified as sexual sensation-seeking.
