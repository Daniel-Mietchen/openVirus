<p>In linear regression models exploring the relationship between syndemic count and HIV risk, we observed an estimated 2.2-point increase (95%CI = 1.0, 3.3) in the HIRI-MSM score per syndemic condition in the unadjusted analysis (

Younger age and presenting for nPEP due to condomless receptive anal sex were also positively associated with higher risk, as would be expected since both these variables are incorporated into the HIRI-MSM score. Other variables associated with a higher risk score in unadjusted analyses included, moderate/high perceived HIV risk, having a bacterial STI at baseline, lifetime experience of homophobia, and higher scores on the DCHR, BBB and SSS scales. The relationship between syndemic count and HIV risk persisted in the multivariable model, with an estimated 1.6-point HIRI-MSM score increase (95%CI = 0.1, 3.1) per syndemic condition, with moderate/high perceived HIV risk and lifetime experience of homophobia also retaining a statistically significant association with higher risk scores.
