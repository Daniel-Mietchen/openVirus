<p>The median number of male partners in the past six months was six (IQR = 3–11), with 72.0% (118/164) of participants reporting at least one sexual encounter with a partner of unknown HIV status and 42.4% (75/177) with a partner of known HIV-positive status. The median score on the HIRI-MSM scale was 18 (IQR = 12–22) and 80.7% (150/186) met the cutoff for high objective HIV risk. Of note, these figures likely underestimate overall HIV risk since 33.3% (62/186) had at least one missing response in the HIRI-MSM scale.</p>
