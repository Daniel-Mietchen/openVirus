<p>Our findings suggest an alarmingly high burden of syndemic health problems in nPEP patients (74%), with high proportions screening positive for depression (54%), harmful alcohol use (35%), problematic drug use (30%), and sexual compulsivity (16%). In exploratory analyses, we further observed positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use, and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use, suggesting that syndemic conditions frequently cluster together in individuals. Finally, we found that the total number of syndemic conditions in a given individual was associated with increasing HIV risk, as estimated using the HIRI-MSM risk score, but that these conditions had an additive, rather than truly synergistic effect.</p>
