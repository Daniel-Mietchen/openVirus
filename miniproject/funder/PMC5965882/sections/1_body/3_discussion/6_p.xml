<p>Syndemic theory posits that the individual conditions not only predict future adverse outcomes, but that they are clustered, and mutually reinforcing. In our cohort of nPEP patients, as in the above-mentioned Boston cohort,[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] there were several positive bivariable associations between the individual syndemic conditions observed. However, an interesting point of contention in the literature is whether the effects of individual conditions on HIV risk among MSM are truly multiplicative (implying synergy) or simply additive in nature.[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] The original theoretical description and etymologic origin of the term ‘syndemics’ explicitly refer to synergy between co-occurring epidemics, that combine to produce an excess burden of disease.[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] However, most studies have instead found an additive effect,[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and a systematic review of studies employing the syndemic framework to understand HIV risk found that only 28% of studies formally tested for multiplicative effects.[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] That we observed a relationship between syndemic count and HIV risk, but not between any interactions between these conditions and HIV risk, supports an additive rather than multiplicative model. However, we caution that our analyses were exploratory in nature, and we concur with other authors who argue that the development of interventions must not wait for the methodologic question of interaction to be resolved.[
