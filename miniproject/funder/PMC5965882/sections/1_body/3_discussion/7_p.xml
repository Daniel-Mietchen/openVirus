<p>In addition to syndemic count, we observed that lifetime experience of homophobia was also associated with higher HIRI-MSM scores in our exploratory multivariable model. This finding is consistent with another tenet of syndemic theory, which situates these interrelated health challenges within a life-course of social marginalization.[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Prior literature has proposed that experiences of discrimination contribute to the emergence of syndemic health problems both directly,[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] Despite low levels of internalized homophobia in our cohort (represented by low MAGI-MSV scores), the overall levels of self-reported lifetime discrimination were high (59%). These findings underscore the role of broader social forces in driving health outcomes in MSM, as abundantly illustrated in literature from diverse global settings,[

Examples of structural interventions that could reduce stigma and discrimination may be legislative (eg. expansion of civil rights), programmatic (eg. providing queer-friendly services) and social (eg. public efforts to decrease homophobia). While significant strides have been made in this regard in Canada (eg. legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in 2005, participation of the sitting Prime Minister in gay pride parades for the first time in 2016), efforts to address anti-gay discrimination must be sustained and expanded.
