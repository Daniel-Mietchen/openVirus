<p>This study has limitations that warrant consideration. First, the tools used to measure syndemic conditions in this study were self-administered screening questionnaires and therefore do not directly represent clinical diagnoses; further, the stress of being recently exposed to HIV may have biased participantsâ€™ questionnaires towards more pessimistic responses. Nevertheless, these tools may still be useful to screen for patients warranting further diagnostic evaluation. Second, the cohort was highly educated, and we restricted analyses to MSM, limiting our ability to draw conclusions about other groups. However, this sample does reflect the population typically seen for nPEP in our setting,[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and likely reflects the success of awareness-raising efforts in MSM communities. Of note, people who used nPEP in the context of sexual assault were unlikely included in this sample, since these patients are usually seen at sexual assault centres separate from our hospitals. Third, only 203/375 individuals approached about the study agreed to participate. Although the reasons for non-participation were not recorded prospectively, the most common reasons were a lack of time and a preoccupation with the need for PEP, and it is unclear in what direction the omission of these individuals may have biased our findings. Fourth, the HIRI-MSM tool which we used to estimate HIV risk has intrinsic limitations related to the 1990s dataset from which it was derived.[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] In particular, the scale does not consider the tremendous impact of suppressive antiretroviral therapy on preventing HIV transmission,[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and thus may overestimate risk, although higher scores should still represent higher risk overall. Lastly, our study was not powered to quantify the relationships between syndemic health problems and HIV risk, and our logistic regression analyses should thus be considered exploratory in nature. Because comprehensive screening of all nPEP patients for syndemic problems may not be practical in all settings, larger studies should examine these issues in the future to develop more targeted approaches.
