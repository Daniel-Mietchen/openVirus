<p>Such assessments are important for at least two reasons. First, these syndemic conditions are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in their own right, and it is ethically and clinically important to link patients with unmet health needs into appropriate care. Second, previous literature has shown that these syndemic conditions are strongly associated with HIV risk behaviours, prevalent HIV infection, and most importantly, incident HIV infection.[

By identifying these issues and referring affected patients into care, it is hoped that HIV risk could be reduced over the longer term.
