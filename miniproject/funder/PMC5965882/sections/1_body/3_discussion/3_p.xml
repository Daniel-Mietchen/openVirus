<p>To our knowledge, only a single other study has previously examined the burden of syndemic conditions among nPEP patients, in a cohort of 894 adults in Boston.[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The authors found that the prevalence of pre-existing mental health conditions was high at 40.0%, including depression (24.4%), anxiety (21.9%), substance use disorders (14.4%), attention deficit disorder (7.8%), post-traumatic stress disorder (3.3%) and psychotic disorders (3.3%). Of note, that study classified participants as having mental health issues based on medication use and/or referrals for treatment, which may have underestimated the prevalence of conditions that were undiagnosed. The estimated prevalence of depression and substance use problems in our study was considerably higher, although we used screening tools with limited specificity rather than formal diagnostic tests. Taken together, however, these findings suggest that interrelated syndemic conditions are common among MSM using nPEP, and that measures to systematically assess and provide onward referrals for them may be warranted in this population.
