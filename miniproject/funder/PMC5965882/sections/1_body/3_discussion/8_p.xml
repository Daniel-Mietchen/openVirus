<p>The only other variable associated with HIV risk in our multivariable model was moderate/high perceived HIV risk. This finding may reflect some degree of participant awareness of their own risk, and is encouraging because such awareness is an important first step in being receptive to modifying this risk. However, 57% of participants perceived their lifetime HIV risk to be either “no risk” or “low risk”, despite all presenting for sexual exposures that were high enough risk to warrant nPEP. In addition, respondents’ low overall levels of perceived risk contrast with their relatively high levels of objective HIV risk as measured by the HIRI-MSM, with 81% meeting the cutoff for high risk.[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Clinical encounters for nPEP may be an ideal setting in which to counsel patients in greater detail about how they perceive their HIV risk, given that these patients have identified themselves as being concerned about this issue. Patients presenting for nPEP may further be an ideal population in which to test HIV risk reduction interventions grounded in syndemic theory, for the same reason. In this regard, it is also noteworthy that overall levels of HIV fatalism and optimism in our study cohort were relatively low, even though HIV-related anxiety was moderately high. These findings suggest that participants were not heavily reliant on ‘disengagement coping’ strategies (ie. maladaptive responses to the stress of HIV risk including fatalistic attitudes and HIV-related anxiety), and again may suggest that nPEP patients may be receptive to syndemics-based risk reduction interventions.
