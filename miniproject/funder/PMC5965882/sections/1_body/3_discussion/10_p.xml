<p>In summary, we suggest that nPEP clinical encounters be harnessed as an opportunity to routinely screen for syndemic health problems among MSM, and that affected patients be linked to related services as appropriate. Such a strategy exemplifies the concept of ‘combination HIV prevention’,[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] which posits that biological, behavioural, and psychosocial problems should be addressed in combination for effective HIV prevention. The success of such a screening program in reducing HIV risk would be contingent on factors including physician uptake, patient willingness to be screened, availability and efficacy of treatment for syndemic problems, and the downstream impact of treating syndemics on HIV acquisition. Further work should be done to elucidate the optimal program structure, feasibility, effectiveness and efficiency at decreasing long-term HIV risk.
