<p>To our knowledge, only a single study has previously examined the burden of syndemic conditions in nPEP patients, and found a high prevalence of pre-existing mental health diagnoses through retrospective case review.[
 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We therefore sought to prospectively estimate the prevalence of depression, harmful alcohol use, problematic drug use, and sexual compulsivity in patients seeking nPEP at our institutions. We hypothesized that these syndemic conditions would be common, and reasoned that documenting a high prevalence would support efforts to systematically screen for them in the future. Our secondary objective was to assess respondent attitudes and experiences of discrimination relevant to HIV risk behaviours, to identify potential topic areas for clinicians to explore during risk-reduction counseling. Exploratory objectives were to examine the co-occurrence of the syndemic conditions, to assess for a relationship between syndemic count and overall HIV risk, and to explore whether such a relationship might be additive or synergistic in nature.
