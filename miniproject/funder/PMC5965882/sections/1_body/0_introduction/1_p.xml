<p>HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), involving 28 days of antiretroviral medications after an HIV exposure, is an effective prevention strategy that has become the standard of care in North America in both occupational settings such as needlestick injuries (oPEP), and non-occupational settings such as condomless sexual activity (nPEP).[

 <xref rid="pone.0197998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Traditionally, the focus of nPEP delivery has been on biomedical aspects of the intervention including clinical assessment, sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening, coordinating medication access and monitoring for side effects. Notably, this approach tends to overlook important co-existing conditions that may underlie HIV risk behaviour.[

These health concerns, and related problems such as sexual compulsivity, are often referred to as ‘syndemic’ conditions in the literature on HIV prevention, since they are interconnected, co-endemic health problems that are mutually reinforcing.[
