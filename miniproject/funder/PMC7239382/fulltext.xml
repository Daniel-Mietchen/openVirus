However, how SAgs alter the breadth of IAV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell (T<sub>CD8</sub>) responses is unknown. Moreover, whether recall responses mediating heterosubtypic immunity to IAVs are manipulated by SAgs remains unexplored. We employed wild-type (WT) and mutant bacterial SAgs, SAg-sufficient/deficient <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains, and WT, mouse-adapted and reassortant IAV strains in multiple <italic>in vivo</italic> settings to address the above questions. Contrary to the popular view that SAgs delete or anergize T cells, systemic administration of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) or <italic>Mycoplasma arthritidis</italic> mitogen before intraperitoneal IAV immunization enlarged the clonal size of &#x02018;select&#x02019; IAV-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> and reshuffled the hierarchical pattern of primary T<sub>CD8</sub> responses. This was mechanistically linked to the TCR V&#x003b2; makeup of the impacted clones rather than their immunodominance status. Importantly, SAg-expanded T<sub>CD8</sub> retained their IFN-&#x003b3; production and cognate cytolytic capacities. The enhancing effect of SEB on immunodominant T<sub>CD8</sub> was also evident in primary responses to vaccination with heat-inactivated and live attenuated IAV strains administered intramuscularly and intranasally, respectively. Interestingly, in prime-boost immunization settings, the outcome of SEB administration depended strictly upon the time point at which this SAg was introduced. Accordingly, SEB injection before priming raised CD127<sup>high</sup>KLRG1<sup>low</sup> memory precursor frequencies and augmented the anamnestic responses of SEB-binding T<sub>CD8</sub>. By comparison, introducing SEB before boosting diminished recall responses to IAV-derived epitopes drastically and indiscriminately. This was accompanied by lower Ki67 and higher Fas, LAG-3 and PD-1 levels consistent with a pro-apoptotic and/or exhausted phenotype. Therefore, SAgs can have contrasting impacts on anti-IAV immunity depending on the na&#x000ef;ve/memory status and the TCR composition of exposed T<sub>CD8</sub>. Finally, local administration of SEB or infection with SEB-producing <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> enhanced pulmonary T<sub>CD8</sub> responses to IAV. Our findings have clear implications for superinfections and prophylactic vaccination.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Exposure to bacterial superantigens (SAgs) is often a consequence of infection with common Gram-positive bacteria causing septic and toxic shock or food poisoning. How SAgs affect the magnitude, breadth and quality of infection/vaccine-elicited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell (T<sub>CD8</sub>) responses to respiratory viral pathogens, including influenza A viruses (IAVs), is far from clear. Also importantly, superinfections with IAVs and SAg-producing bacteria are serious clinical occurrences during seasonal and pandemic flu and require urgent attention. We demonstrate that two structurally distinct SAgs, including staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), unexpectedly enhance primary T<sub>CD8</sub> responses to &#x02018;select&#x02019; IAV-derived epitopes depending on the TCR makeup of the responding clones. Intriguingly, the timing of exposure to SEB dictates the outcome of prime-boost immunization. Seeing a SAg before priming raises memory precursor frequencies and augments anamnestic T<sub>CD8</sub> responses. Conversely, a SAg encounter before boosting renders T<sub>CD8</sub> prone to death or exhaustion and impedes recall responses, thus likely compromising heterosubtypic immunity to IAVs. Finally, local exposure to SEB increases the pulmonary response of immunodominant IAV-specific T<sub>CD8</sub>. These findings shed new light on how bacterial infections and SAgs influence the effectiveness of anti-IAV T<sub>CD8</sub> responses, and have, as such, wide-ranging implications for preventative vaccination and infection control.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/</ext-link>) project grant (PJT &#x02013; 156295) to S.M.M.H., and by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>).

First, unlike in several other laboratory strains, MHC molecules expressed in BALB/c mice have a sufficient binding avidity for SEB [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Second, i.p. inoculation of mice with PR8 does not lead to viral propagation, which is due, at least in part, to the modest ability of this virus to infect macrophages and to activate or recruit peritoneal leukocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, it can prime T cells adequately [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This simulates many seasonal flu vaccination protocols in which inactivated viruses are introduced to the immune system via an unnatural route. Third, the peptide epitopes of PR8 are well-defined in BALB/c mice (<xref rid="ppat.1008393.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and give rise to T<sub>CD8</sub> clones consistently arranged in a reproducible hierarchical order [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This enables examination of the breadth of IAV-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> responses. Fourth, since i.p. inoculation of PR8 does not cause active viral infection, cognate T<sub>CD8</sub> responses could be monitored in the absence of severe complications otherwise ensuing in moribund animals.</p><p>We found a single i.p. injection of SEB prior to IAV immunization to raise the frequency of splenic NP<sub>147</sub>-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> by dextramer staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This could be translated, in terms of absolute numbers, to an approximately 3-fold increase over control values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

N23 (Asn<sup>23</sup>) should also mediate the reactivity of SEB with mouse V&#x003b2;8.3. This notion is supported by a previous report that several SEB variants carrying point mutations at this position (SEB<sub>N23S</sub>, SEB<sub>N23I</sub>, SEB<sub>N23Y</sub> and SEB<sub>N23K</sub>) induce only minimal interleukin (IL)-2 production by a V&#x003b2;8.3<sup>+</sup> hybridoma [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. To understand how SEB targets and activates mouse T cells expressing V&#x003b2;8.3, we superimposed the &#x003b2;-chain from the crystal structure of mouse V&#x003b2;8.3/V&#x003b1;3.3 [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] onto the structure of the homologous mouse V&#x003b2;8.2 chain in complex with SEB [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and then built MHC class II into the complex from the SEB-HLA-DR1 crystal structure [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Based on this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), SEB forms a ternary complex whereby the TCR is &#x02018;wedged&#x02019; apart from the antigenic peptide displayed by MHC II, and the sidechain of SEB N23 engages three residues within CDR2&#x003b2; (Asn<sup>54</sup>, Leu<sup>55</sup> and Gln<sup>56</sup>), and likely forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the side chain of V&#x003b2;8.3 Asn<sup>54</sup>. Although these three residues differ between V&#x003b2;8.2 and V&#x003b2;8.3, critical contacts between SEB and the TCR &#x003b2;-chain are believed to occur through backbone atoms of the &#x003b2;-chain, rather than sidechains, indicating that V&#x003b2; recognition by SEB is based mostly on the conformation of the CDR2 loop [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Moreover, SEB was significantly more potent than SEB<sub>N23A</sub> in inducing HA<sub>518</sub>- and HA<sub>462</sub>-specific responses, and a similar trend was observed in the case of NP<sub>147</sub>, which approached but did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>In the next series of experiments, we tested two additional SAgs, namely MAM and SEA, in our model.

These included WT NT60 and HK strains whose HA and neuraminidase (NA) together comprise an H3N2 coat that is antigenically dissimilar to the H1N1 coat of PR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Another cohort of mice was vaccinated with X31, a reassortant virus that contains a PR8 core and an HK coat [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, we used the reassortant H3N1 strain J-1, which contains seven PR8 genes along with an HK-derived HA [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g003">Fig 3B&#x02013;3E</xref>, a sizeable response to NP<sub>147</sub> was evident following immunization with NT60, HK, X31 or J-1, which all expressed a nucleoprotein (NP) containing this immunodominant peptide. Importantly, pretreatment with SEB enhanced this response in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g003">Fig 3B&#x02013;3E</xref>). In contrast, NP<sub>39</sub>- and NP<sub>218</sub>-specific responses were not augmented. This was consistent with the findings from our PR8 vaccination experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>).

We used a prime-boost strategy to test this hypothesis. Accordingly, mice were injected with SEB, primed with PR8 and boosted 30 days later with SEQ12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). SEQ12 was initially generated through sequential passages of PR8 in the presence of anti-HA mAbs [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, it cannot be efficiently neutralized by anti-HA Abs produced by mice during the priming phase. This prevents the removal of the virions before they can induce an anamnestic T<sub>CD8</sub> response. It is also noteworthy that SEQ12 has accumulated mutations within its HA&#x02019;s globular domain while retaining the structure of this membrane glycoprotein and identical sequences in and around HA<sub>518</sub>, one of our epitopes of interest. Therefore, the response to HA<sub>518</sub> should be preserved as we previously reported [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>As hypothesized, heterologous prime-boost vaccination with PR8 and SEQ12 resulted in a more rigorous secondary response to both NP<sub>147</sub> and HA<sub>518</sub> compared with the primary response to PR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>).

Together, the above results demonstrate that when a SAg is introduced before a primary response to an IAV strain is mounted, subsequent responses to unrelated IAV serotypes harboring identical core protein epitopes can be enhanced, provided that T<sub>CD8</sub> specific for such epitopes utilize SAg-responsive TCR V&#x003b2; families.</p><p>Next, we explored the effect of SEB on recall responses when this SAg is &#x02018;seen&#x02019; before a secondary anti-IAV response gets underway. Mice were primed with PR8, given SEB, and then boosted with SEQ12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Remarkably, seven days after boosting, the frequencies and absolute numbers of IAV-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T<sub>CD8</sub> were drastically reduced, a finding that was manifest across all tested epitopes regardless of their hierarchical position or TCR V&#x003b2; usage preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that injection with SEB shortly (3 days) before SEQ12 may unusually weaken the responsiveness of T<sub>CD8</sub> to this particular strain irrespective of their na&#x000ef;ve versus memory status, we examined the primary response to SEQ12.

Although immunodominance has been often investigated in experimental settings using mouse models, increasing evidence suggests that it is also relevant to human anti-IAV responses [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p>Of note, IAVs are highly mutating viruses whose HA and NA constantly change, in a process called antigenic drift, to avoid detection by neutralizing Abs. In contrast, internal proteins, such as NP, are highly conserved. However, this does not necessarily mean that they never mutate. In fact, mutations in HLA-B27- and HLA-B35-restricted NP-derived peptides to facilitate escape from CTL recognition have been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In this investigation, we found pre-exposure to SEB and MAM to selectively enhance primary responses to NP<sub>147</sub> and HA<sub>518</sub>, which promoted the hierarchical rank of the latter. Importantly, which T<sub>CD8</sub> clones could be expanded by the above SAgs was mechanistically linked to the TCR V&#x003b2; composition of T<sub>CD8</sub> as opposed either to their default hierarchical status or to the propensity of the protein source of the epitope they detect, namely NP and HA. It will be interesting to assess whether SAg-expanded IAV-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> will be equally likely, less likely or more likely to undergo mutations, which may potentially affect their significance in the context of influenza following exposure to the toxins or bacterial pathogens that release them.</p><p>To investigate how SAgs influence T<sub>CD8</sub> responses in heterosubtypic immunity to IAV, we administered SEB at two different but critical time points, which yielded opposite results. Exposure to SEB before priming augmented recall responses to NP<sub>147</sub> and HA<sub>518</sub>. This was consistent with increased frequencies of T<sub>CD8</sub> responding to these epitopes at and after their primary response peak and with a differentiation program favoring the generation of KLRG1<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup> memory precursors. On the contrary, SEB administration prior to boosting immunization drastically diminished IAV-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> responses, which was accompanied by lowered Ki67 expression and increased levels of Fas and LAG-3. The observed contrast may highlight differences between na&#x000ef;ve and memory T<sub>CD8</sub> in terms of their quality and threshold of activation by bacterial SAgs and before they are exposed or re-exposed to cognate IAV Ags, respectively. Therefore, whether the immune system sees an entirely new IAV strain or IAVs harboring similar Ags to those previously seen may determine, at least partially, how T<sub>CD8</sub> will behave when they encounter a SAg. This has obvious implications for pandemic and seasonal flu with complications arising from sepsis, non-menstrual toxic shock, food poisoning and other SAg-mediated illnesses and conditions.</p><p>Huang <italic>et al</italic>. previously reported that exposure to SEB seven days after a primary infection with X31 does not change the frequency of TCR V&#x003b2;8.3<sup>+</sup> cells among NP<sub>366-374</sub>-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> (an immunodominant population in C57BL/6 mice) upon a PR8 challenge [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In contrast with our recall system, Huang <italic>et al</italic>. examined NP<sub>366-374</sub>-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> within the BAL of intranasally primed-boosted mice. MHC II molecules in the C57BL/6 strain have a notoriously low affinity for SEB, which may explain why a larger dose of SEB (100 &#x003bc;g) had to be administered. Therefore, even though NP<sub>366-374</sub>-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> preferentially use V&#x003b2;8.3, they may not establish strong and/or long enough contacts with SEB and MHC II<sup>+</sup> APCs.</p><p>In our initial PR8 infection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7</xref>), SEB was injected i.p. first to mimic systemic exposure to this SAg. SEB administered through this injection route can reportedly find its way into the lungs [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. We found the absolute numbers of anti-IAV T<sub>CD8</sub> to remain unaltered in the lungs and within the BAL. In contrast, there was a significant rise in the splenic NP<sub>147</sub>-specific response. According to a mathematical model, the spleen contributes the lion&#x02019;s share of the overall IAV-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> response in the lungs, especially at later time points post-IAV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, it was pertinent to find out whether intranasal co-administration of SEB and PR8 may affect the local PR8-specific response. Indeed, we observed an increased NP<sub>147</sub>-specific response in the lungs of SEB-pretreated mice in this setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g008">Fig 8</xref>), a finding that could be recapitulated in a superinfection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial culprits of SAg-mediated illnesses typically express more than one toxin. How multiple SAgs encoded by a single bacterial species may cross-regulate T cell responses to each other is unknown. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that SAg-provoked T cell activation is modulated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligands embedded within the cell wall peptidoglycan of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, the effects of SAgs on anti-IAV immunity may also vary depending on the presence, absence or physical proximity of the very bacteria that secrete these toxins. In our superinfection model, infection with an SEB-deficient mutant of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> COL resulted in a weaker T<sub>CD8</sub> response to NP<sub>147</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Therefore, SEB production by COL enhanced the subsequent response to this IAV epitope, an effect that could have been potentially more pronounced in the absence of the inhibitory effects of TLR2 agonists. The implications of this finding may be clinically relevant as far as secondary viral infections in the aftermath of toxic shock and sepsis are concerned.</p><p>Another important question is whether exposure to bacterial SAgs similarly modulates cognate T<sub>CD8</sub> responses to other viruses, especially those used in vaccination modalities. We addressed this question in a VacV immunization model in a pilot study. We chose to work with VacV because: i) it is very different from IAV structurally and genetically and also in terms of tissue tropism; ii) it is used in prophylactic vaccination against smallpox; iii) poxviral vectors have been employed in vaccine formulations to protect against other infectious diseases, including influenza [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]; iv) several VacV-derived epitopes have been identified in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], which enables studies on T<sub>CD8</sub> immunodominance.</p><p>Intriguingly, SEB administration before immunization with VacV failed to increase T<sub>CD8</sub> responses to this virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008393.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In fact, both local (peritoneal) and systemic (splenic) responses against F2L<sub>26</sub>, the immunodominant peptide epitope of VacV in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] were dramatically reduced. By comparison, T<sub>CD8</sub> responses to two subdominant determinants (A52R<sub>75</sub> and E3L<sub>140</sub>), were preserved in SEB-pretreated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008393.s004">S4A&#x02013;S4D Fig</xref>). Why the immunodominant T<sub>CD8</sub> response to VacV is depressed, rather than elevated, is unknown at this point and a subject of our ongoing investigation. Unlike IAV, VacV readily propagates in the peritoneal cavity to establish an active infection. However, the ability of a viral intruder to propagate locally should not account, at least largely, for the observed differences. Our finding that SEB could enhance the splenic NP<sub>147</sub>-specific response following both i.p. and i.n. IAV inoculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) lends support to the above notion. This is because unlike the i.p. injection of IAV, its i.n. administration results in viral propagation and active infection. At this point, we favor the possibility that distinct requirements for T<sub>CD4</sub> help, APC types and/or T<sub>CD8</sub> priming pathways may determine the susceptibility of antiviral T<sub>CD8</sub> to SAgs. In our IAV infection experiments, SEB reduced virus-specific IgG2b titres in the serum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008393.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), which can be viewed as an indirect measure of T<sub>CD4</sub> help in Ab class-switching. However, despite the apparent SEB-induced anergy in the T<sub>CD4</sub> compartment, the splenic (systemic) NP<sub>147</sub>-specific T<sub>CD8</sub> frequency was raised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In contrast, primary anti-VacV T<sub>CD8</sub> responses are known to depend on T<sub>CD4</sub> help when the virions are injected via the i.p. route [<xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. How various SAgs may impact APC functions, for instance after binding to MHC II, and potentially promote one priming pathway versus another in different organs remains an open question.</p><p>In summary, we have investigated how bacterial SAgs, including but not limited to SEB, alter both the strength and the breadth of T<sub>CD8</sub> responses to multiple IAV strains. In doing so, we employed several <italic>in vivo</italic> models of primary and recall anti-IAV immunization and active viral infection. We propose that the nature and the TCR makeup of T cell populations participating in IAV-specific responses, the phase at which a SAg (or multiple SAgs) is/are encountered, and the means and modes of IAV Ag processing and presentation are among the most important determinants of protection versus immunopathogenesis in the context of vaccination and superinfections with IAV and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1008393.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>SEB administration before PR8 immunization increases the clonal size of HA<sub>518</sub>-specific T<sub>CD8</sub>.</title><p>BALB/c mice were injected i.p. with PBS or with 50 &#x003bc;g of SEB three days before they were immunized i.p. with the PR8 strain of IAV.

While the data it interesting, the reviewers commented that in its current form, it is mainly "phenomenology" that has questionable relevance for actual influenza virus/bacterial co-infections (or vaccinations).</p><p>The authors should repeat their experiments in systems which more closely mimics actual influenza virus vaccination and co-infection conditions/exposure routes. Specifically, inactivated influenza should be administered i.m. to mimic inactivated influenza virus vaccination (and/or an attenuated influenza virus could be administered i.n. to mimic FluMist). Secondly, in the context of both infection and vaccination, SEB should be administrated into the lungs at moderate levels that would mimic those predicted to occur during natural co-infection, or better still, an SEB-expressing pathogen could used to confirm the reported phenotypes under more physiologically-relevant conditions.</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Part I - Summary</bold></p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Influenza infection in the respiratory tract is known to greatly increase susceptibility to bacterial infection. Thus research to study the interaction between influenza infection and exposure to bacterial superantigens may be of interest in understanding how to improve clinical outcomes. However this paper studies something completely different. Mice who are na&#x000ef;ve to influenza, and therefore representing only very young children, are exposed to SEB by the i.p. route, and then influenza virus by the i.p. route. This does not model any situation that occurs in humans.</p><p>The paper states that 'IAVs constantly mutate to escape TCD8-mediated immunosurveillance' without citing a reference. Where is the evidence that this is true? Antigenic drift definitely occurs in the surface glycoproteins but internal antigens are highly conserved. There is very little evidence for 'immunodominance' of influenza virus epitopes in humans.</p><p>The researchers go on to assess SEB administration before immunization with 'rVVs'. Presumably recombinant Vaccinia viruses, which need a much better description in the methods section - what strain, and how are the minimal epitopes targeted to the ER (and also, why?) Why use epitopes only instead of whole antigens?. Again, humans will never be immunized with rVVs expressing influenza epitopes. Humans will never be immunized by rVVs expressing whole influenza antigens either, and especially not by the i.p. route.</p><p>My issue with this manuscript is my failure to understand why the research was conducted.</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting study that explores how superantigens, particularly SEB, influence CD8 T cell responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. In well designed and well executed experiments they show that SEB injected three days before A/PR8 IAV infection enhances the T cell response to peptide epitopes, where SEB-reactive TCRs are part of the response. They extend this to other superantigens and also use a mutated SEB to show the enhanced response is superantigen specific. These results were all found when the infection was intraperitoneal and when SEB was given ip and the IAV intranasally, there was no difference in the lung T cell response, though the splenic response was enhanced. Following ip SEB and IAV priming, secondary responses to a second (T cell ) cross reacting virus were enhanced. However, when SEB was given after the first priming, the secondary T cell response was decreased, implying differential effects of the SEB on na&#x000ef;ve versus memory T cells. However early exposure to SEB after priming, enhances the T cell response.</p><p>Overall the issue is of some importance given the well-known but poorly understood interactions between IAV and bacterial infections in humans, that have also been explored to some extent in mouse models. However this model using purified super antigens and IP IAV infection is rather oversimplified. When they infect intranasally the findings become quite complex. Overall it iis not clear how relevant these findings will be to humans and that could be discussed and reviewed in more detail in the Discussion.</p><p>Reviewer #3: In this study by Meilleur et al, the authors investigate the impact of bacterial superantigen SEB on CD8 T cell responses. Intraperitoneal administration of SEB followed by ip administration of the influenza virus PR8 strain increased the numbers of CD8 T cells. This increase was specific to T cells with Vb3 or Vb8 TCR. A similar increase in CD8 T cells was observed with several influenza virus strains when SEB was administered prior to influenza virus injection. However, SEB administration had no effect on the numbers of CD8 T cells in the respiratory tract upon intranasal administration of influenza virus. There was some increase in NP147 epitope specific CD8 T cells in the spleen. Interestingly, SEB administration in influenza virus primed mice prior to boosting resulted in significantly decreased CD8 T cell numbers. Overall, the authors convincingly demonstrate that SEB administration prior to influenza virus administration increases the number of CD8 T cells with Vb3 and Vb8 TCR. A major weakness in the study is the relevance of the model system used here - ip injection of infectious influenza virus is very different from intramuscular injection of inactivated vaccine or natural infection of the respiratory tract. Thus, the significance of these results in the context of co-infection or the impact of SEB on influenza virus specific CD8 T cell responses is not thoroughly addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #4: The manuscript addresses an interesting and medically important subject. The approach used to examine the effect of superantigen exposure on the response to IAV and/or IAV associated peptides in robust and should help gain a better understanding of the complex role superantigens and/or superinfections play in the response to influenza and possibly other viruses. Further, the findings of the importance of V&#x003b2; chain expression on the response to SEB exposure is novel. However, there are a number of issues that weaken the strength and impact of this work</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold></p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: Rather oddly in the Discussion they immediately discuss results not mentioned in the Results section but shown only in the supplementary figures where rather different results were found using recombinant vaccinia or minigene priming. Then the normally immunodominant response to NP147 epitope was almost completely suppressed. This raises issues about use of T cell receptors and antigen presentation that ought to be explored experimentally in the Results section. They could either complete these experiments and put in the main section, strengthening the paper, or cut this additional data set out of this version and present those results later in a second paper, in which case they should put a caveat summarising these findings in this Discussion. The latter would be easier but the former would improve the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Major comments:</p><p>1. The authors should use a relevant model system. Time course experiments should be performed with SEB administration at various times (0, 3, 7, 10 days) post-infection (in) or post vaccination (im) to determine the effects of SEB on na&#x000ef;ve and activated /memory CD8 T cells.</p><p>2. The majority of super infections or co-infections occur in the respiratory tract. It will be important to establish if administration of SEB at moderate levels in the respiratory tract affects IAV specific CD8 T cell responses.</p><p>3. Supplementary Fig 2 &#x00026; 3 are not mentioned in the results section but only in the discussion section.</p><p>Reviewer #4: 1. The data, in its current form, is largely observational and does not provide solid evidence of a mechanism to support the observed effects. The authors provide reasonable explanations but no data to confirm. Additional work to substantiate their suggested mechanisms would significantly strengthen this work.</p><p>2. The work described in figure 4 has the potential, from a clinical standpoint, to be the most important observation. The effect of SEB exposure on the response in the lungs speaks to the clinical relevance of this work. In the current form, the authors suggests that the fact that they see a response in the spleen but not the lungs suggests that SEB exposure works locally and not at peripheral sights. While this is an important observation, no work was presented to describe whether local exposure in the lungs would result in alterations in the immune response to IAV. This is a critical experiment and would significantly increase the strength of this work.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold></p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: None</p><p>Reviewer #3: Minor comments</p><p>1. Does the amount of purified SEB administered in mice reflect the levels of SEB produced during bacterial infection?</p><p>2. Does SEB administration followed by SEQ12 result in increased TCD8 numbers?</p><p>3. P17 &#x0201c;N23 (Asn23) should also mediate the reactivity of SEB with mouse V&#x003b2;8.3&#x0201d; should read &#x0201c;not mediate reactivity&#x0201d;?</p><p>4. Fig 2C: As compared to SEB, mutant SEB N23A does not show significant decrease in NP147. The results section should be modified accordingly.</p><p>5. P16 &#x0201c;the above results demonstrate that systemic exposure to SEB expands,</p><p>rather than deletes&#x02026;&#x0201d; As both the SEB and PR8 are injected ip, this is just local exposure and not systemic exposure.</p><p>Reviewer #4: Minor Points:</p><p>1. The data presented in figure 1G demonstrating an increased response to NP147 loaded target cells is not convincing without inclusion of the control data. The authors should consider including the histograms from the na&#x000ef;ve (PBS and SEB) mice.</p><p>**********</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).

</p><p>Dear Dr. Haeryfar,</p><p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "Discordant rearrangement of primary and anamnestic CD8+ T cell responses to influenza A viral epitopes upon exposure to bacterial superantigens: implications for prophylactic vaccination, heterosubtypic immunity and superinfections," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Pathogens.</p><p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the pre-publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p><p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Pearls, Reviews, Opinions, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p><p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript, if you opted to have an early version of your article, will be published online. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p><p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Pathogens. </p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Kasturi Haldar</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>&#x0200b;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5065-158X">orcid.org/0000-0001-5065-158X</ext-link></p><p>Michael Malim</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7699-2064">orcid.org/0000-0002-7699-2064</ext-link></p></body></sub-article></article>
