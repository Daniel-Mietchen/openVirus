<p>Although i.p. injection of mice with PR8 is commonly used in murine immunization studies, we sought to extend our work to two additional models of seasonal flu vaccination. First, we administered SEB (or PBS) i.p. to mice that subsequently received an i.m. injection of heat-inactivated PR8 (

 <sub>CD8</sub> was found in the spleen of SEB-treated mice (

Interestingly, once administered to BALB/c mice, the A/California/7/2009 component of this human vaccine yields a PR8-cross-reactive NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific response [

 <sub>CD8</sub> were present in the spleens of SEB-pretreated animals [66,980 ± 10,921 (n = 5)
