<p>Our experiments thus far involved only PR8, an H1N1 strain suitable for mouse studies and for propagation in chicken eggs. It was therefore pertinent to explore whether pre-exposure to SEB could similarly enhance T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to other IAV strains, including H3N2 viruses that are included in seasonal flu vaccine formulations. To this end, we tested several WT and recombinant viruses. These included WT NT60 and HK strains whose HA and neuraminidase (NA) together comprise an H3N2 coat that is antigenically dissimilar to the H1N1 coat of PR8 (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, we used the reassortant H3N1 strain J-1, which contains seven PR8 genes along with an HK-derived HA [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g003">Fig 3B–3E</xref>, a sizeable response to NP
 <sub>147</sub> was evident following immunization with NT60, HK, X31 or J-1, which all expressed a nucleoprotein (NP) containing this immunodominant peptide. Importantly, pretreatment with SEB enhanced this response in all cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g003">Fig 3B–3E</xref>). In contrast, NP
 <sub>39</sub>- and NP
 <sub>218</sub>-specific responses were not augmented. This was consistent with the findings from our PR8 vaccination experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Finally, none of the H1-derived epitopes elicited a measurable response in PBS- or SEB-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g003">Fig 3B–3E</xref>). This was expected since NT60, HK, X31 and J-1 strains all express H3, not H1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The above results demonstrate that cognate T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to multiple IAV strains can be intensified by SEB.
