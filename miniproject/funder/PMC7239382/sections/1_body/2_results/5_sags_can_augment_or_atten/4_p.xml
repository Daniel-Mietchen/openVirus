<p>As hypothesized, heterologous prime-boost vaccination with PR8 and SEQ12 resulted in a more rigorous secondary response to both NP

Together, the above results demonstrate that when a SAg is introduced before a primary response to an IAV strain is mounted, subsequent responses to unrelated IAV serotypes harboring identical core protein epitopes can be enhanced, provided that T
 <sub>CD8</sub> specific for such epitopes utilize SAg-responsive TCR VÎ² families.
