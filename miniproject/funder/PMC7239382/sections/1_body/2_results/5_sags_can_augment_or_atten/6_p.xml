<p>To dissect this hyporesponsive phenotype, we examined the expression levels of several proliferation, death and exhaustion markers among detectable T
 <sub>CD8</sub>. Cognate tetramer
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>CD8</sub> from SEB-treated animals showed diminished expression of Ki67 but elevated levels of Fas and LAG-3 on a per-cell basis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). In addition, there was a trend towards increased PD-1, especially in HA
 <sub>518</sub>-specific cells. Therefore, exposure to SEB may impede the proliferative capacity of anti-IAV memory T
 <sub>CD8</sub> and render them prone to death or exhaustion when animals encounter another IAV serotype with conserved internal epitopes.
