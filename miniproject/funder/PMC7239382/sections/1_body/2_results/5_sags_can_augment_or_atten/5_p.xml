<p>Next, we explored the effect of SEB on recall responses when this SAg is ‘seen’ before a secondary anti-IAV response gets underway. Mice were primed with PR8, given SEB, and then boosted with SEQ12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Remarkably, seven days after boosting, the frequencies and absolute numbers of IAV-specific IFN-γ-producing T
 <sub>CD8</sub> were drastically reduced, a finding that was manifest across all tested epitopes regardless of their hierarchical position or TCR Vβ usage preferences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that injection with SEB shortly (3 days) before SEQ12 may unusually weaken the responsiveness of T
 <sub>CD8</sub> to this particular strain irrespective of their naïve versus memory status, we examined the primary response to SEQ12. In this control experiment, naïve mice received SEB or PBS three days before they were inoculated with SEQ12 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008393.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>). Similar to primary immunizations with PR8, NT60, HK, X31 and J-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g002">Fig 2</xref>), select cognate responses to SEQ12 were augmented. Therefore, the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref> reflect a unique feature of anamnestic T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses launched shortly after exposure to SEB.
