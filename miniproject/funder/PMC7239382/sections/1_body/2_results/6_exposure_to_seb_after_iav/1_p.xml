<p>In certain scenarios, exposure to SAgs may succeed a recent encounter with a new IAV strain, due for instance to vaccination. To determine how T
 <sub>CD8</sub> react to IAV in this case, we inoculated mice with PR8 followed, three days later, by an SEB injection. Seven days later, PR8-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> were enumerated by ICS, and their 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> cytolytic function was also assessed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We found a dramatic increase in both the frequencies and the absolute numbers of IFN-Î³-producing T
 <sub>CD8</sub> recognizing multiple PR8 epitopes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Furthermore, NP
 <sub>147</sub>-displaying target cells were much more readily eliminated in SEB-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). This was evident at several time points after cognate target cells were injected into PR8-primed animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Therefore, functionally competent IAV-specific CTL pools are expanded following an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure to SEB.
