<p>To address how bacterial SAgs alter the magnitude and breadth of primary anti-IAV T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses, we injected cohorts of BALB/c mice i.p. with PBS or with 50 μg of SEB, a prototypic and clinically relevant staphylococcal SAg that is well tolerated in this mouse strain. Three days later, a time point at which SEB-induced T cell proliferation reaches its maximum [
