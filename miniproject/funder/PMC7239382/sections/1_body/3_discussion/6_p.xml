<p>In our initial PR8 infection model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7</xref>), SEB was injected i.p. first to mimic systemic exposure to this SAg. SEB administered through this injection route can reportedly find its way into the lungs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. We found the absolute numbers of anti-IAV T
 <sub>CD8</sub> to remain unaltered in the lungs and within the BAL. In contrast, there was a significant rise in the splenic NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific response. According to a mathematical model, the spleen contributes the lionâ€™s share of the overall IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> response in the lungs, especially at later time points post-IAV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, it was pertinent to find out whether intranasal co-administration of SEB and PR8 may affect the local PR8-specific response. Indeed, we observed an increased NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific response in the lungs of SEB-pretreated mice in this setting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g008">Fig 8</xref>), a finding that could be recapitulated in a superinfection model (
