<p>In summary, we have investigated how bacterial SAgs, including but not limited to SEB, alter both the strength and the breadth of T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to multiple IAV strains. In doing so, we employed several 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models of primary and recall anti-IAV immunization and active viral infection. We propose that the nature and the TCR makeup of T cell populations participating in IAV-specific responses, the phase at which a SAg (or multiple SAgs) is/are encountered, and the means and modes of IAV Ag processing and presentation are among the most important determinants of protection versus immunopathogenesis in the context of vaccination and superinfections with IAV and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
