<p>Of note, IAVs are highly mutating viruses whose HA and NA constantly change, in a process called antigenic drift, to avoid detection by neutralizing Abs. In contrast, internal proteins, such as NP, are highly conserved. However, this does not necessarily mean that they never mutate. In fact, mutations in HLA-B27- and HLA-B35-restricted NP-derived peptides to facilitate escape from CTL recognition have been reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In this investigation, we found pre-exposure to SEB and MAM to selectively enhance primary responses to NP
 <sub>147</sub> and HA
 <sub>518</sub>, which promoted the hierarchical rank of the latter. Importantly, which T
 <sub>CD8</sub> clones could be expanded by the above SAgs was mechanistically linked to the TCR VÎ² composition of T
 <sub>CD8</sub> as opposed either to their default hierarchical status or to the propensity of the protein source of the epitope they detect, namely NP and HA. It will be interesting to assess whether SAg-expanded IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> will be equally likely, less likely or more likely to undergo mutations, which may potentially affect their significance in the context of influenza following exposure to the toxins or bacterial pathogens that release them.
