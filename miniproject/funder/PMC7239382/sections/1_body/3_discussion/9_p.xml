<p>Intriguingly, SEB administration before immunization with VacV failed to increase T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to this virus (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008393.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In fact, both local (peritoneal) and systemic (splenic) responses against F2L
 <sub>26</sub>, the immunodominant peptide epitope of VacV in BALB/c mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] were dramatically reduced. By comparison, T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to two subdominant determinants (A52R
 <sub>75</sub> and E3L
 <sub>140</sub>), were preserved in SEB-pretreated animals (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008393.s004">S4Aâ€“S4D Fig</xref>). Why the immunodominant T
 <sub>CD8</sub> response to VacV is depressed, rather than elevated, is unknown at this point and a subject of our ongoing investigation. Unlike IAV, VacV readily propagates in the peritoneal cavity to establish an active infection. However, the ability of a viral intruder to propagate locally should not account, at least largely, for the observed differences. Our finding that SEB could enhance the splenic NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific response following both i.p. and i.n. IAV inoculations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g001">Fig 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) lends support to the above notion. This is because unlike the i.p. injection of IAV, its i.n. administration results in viral propagation and active infection. At this point, we favor the possibility that distinct requirements for T
 <sub>CD4</sub> help, APC types and/or T
 <sub>CD8</sub> priming pathways may determine the susceptibility of antiviral T
 <sub>CD8</sub> to SAgs. In our IAV infection experiments, SEB reduced virus-specific IgG2b titres in the serum (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008393.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), which can be viewed as an indirect measure of T
 <sub>CD4</sub> help in Ab class-switching. However, despite the apparent SEB-induced anergy in the T
 <sub>CD4</sub> compartment, the splenic (systemic) NP
 <sub>147</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> frequency was raised (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In contrast, primary anti-VacV T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses are known to depend on T
 <sub>CD4</sub> help when the virions are injected via the i.p. route [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. How various SAgs may impact APC functions, for instance after binding to MHC II, and potentially promote one priming pathway versus another in different organs remains an open question.
