<p>The bacterial culprits of SAg-mediated illnesses typically express more than one toxin. How multiple SAgs encoded by a single bacterial species may cross-regulate T cell responses to each other is unknown. Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that SAg-provoked T cell activation is modulated by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligands embedded within the cell wall peptidoglycan of

Therefore, the effects of SAgs on anti-IAV immunity may also vary depending on the presence, absence or physical proximity of the very bacteria that secrete these toxins. In our superinfection model, infection with an SEB-deficient mutant of

 <italic>aureus</italic> COL resulted in a weaker T
 <sub>CD8</sub> response to NP
 <sub>147</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008393.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Therefore, SEB production by COL enhanced the subsequent response to this IAV epitope, an effect that could have been potentially more pronounced in the absence of the inhibitory effects of TLR2 agonists. The implications of this finding may be clinically relevant as far as secondary viral infections in the aftermath of toxic shock and sepsis are concerned.
