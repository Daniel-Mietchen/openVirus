<p>To investigate how SAgs influence T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses in heterosubtypic immunity to IAV, we administered SEB at two different but critical time points, which yielded opposite results. Exposure to SEB before priming augmented recall responses to NP
 <sub>147</sub> and HA
 <sub>518</sub>. This was consistent with increased frequencies of T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responding to these epitopes at and after their primary response peak and with a differentiation program favoring the generation of KLRG1
 <sup>-</sup>CD127
 <sup>+</sup> memory precursors. On the contrary, SEB administration prior to boosting immunization drastically diminished IAV-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses, which was accompanied by lowered Ki67 expression and increased levels of Fas and LAG-3. The observed contrast may highlight differences between na√Øve and memory T
 <sub>CD8</sub> in terms of their quality and threshold of activation by bacterial SAgs and before they are exposed or re-exposed to cognate IAV Ags, respectively. Therefore, whether the immune system sees an entirely new IAV strain or IAVs harboring similar Ags to those previously seen may determine, at least partially, how T
 <sub>CD8</sub> will behave when they encounter a SAg. This has obvious implications for pandemic and seasonal flu with complications arising from sepsis, non-menstrual toxic shock, food poisoning and other SAg-mediated illnesses and conditions.
