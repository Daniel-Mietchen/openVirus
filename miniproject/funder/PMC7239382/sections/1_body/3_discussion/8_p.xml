<p>Another important question is whether exposure to bacterial SAgs similarly modulates cognate T
 <sub>CD8</sub> responses to other viruses, especially those used in vaccination modalities. We addressed this question in a VacV immunization model in a pilot study. We chose to work with VacV because: i) it is very different from IAV structurally and genetically and also in terms of tissue tropism; ii) it is used in prophylactic vaccination against smallpox; iii) poxviral vectors have been employed in vaccine formulations to protect against other infectious diseases, including influenza [
