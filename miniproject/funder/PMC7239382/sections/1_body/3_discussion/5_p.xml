<p>Huang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. previously reported that exposure to SEB seven days after a primary infection with X31 does not change the frequency of TCR Vβ8.3
 <sup>+</sup> cells among NP
 <sub>366-374</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> (an immunodominant population in C57BL/6 mice) upon a PR8 challenge [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. In contrast with our recall system, Huang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. examined NP
 <sub>366-374</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> within the BAL of intranasally primed-boosted mice. MHC II molecules in the C57BL/6 strain have a notoriously low affinity for SEB, which may explain why a larger dose of SEB (100 μg) had to be administered. Therefore, even though NP
 <sub>366-374</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub> preferentially use Vβ8.3, they may not establish strong and/or long enough contacts with SEB and MHC II
 <sup>+</sup> APCs.
