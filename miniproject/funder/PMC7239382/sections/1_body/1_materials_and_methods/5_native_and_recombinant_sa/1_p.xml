<p>Native 
 <italic>Mycoplasma arthritidis</italic> mitogen (MAM) was purified as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Briefly, 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>arthritidis</italic> strain PG6 (ATCC 19611) was grown to senescence in autoclaved modified Edward-Hayflick medium, which was then subjected to (NH

 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> fractionation. This was followed by sequential rounds of gel filtration and cation-exchange chromatography prior to the final purification of MAM by fast protein liquid chromatography.
