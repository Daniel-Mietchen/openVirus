<p>Following immunization or infection with indicated IAVs or VacV, mice were euthanized at indicated time points and erythrocyte-depleted splenocytes or peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were prepared. In the case of i.n. IAV infection, BAL fluid and lungs were also aseptically collected. BAL was conducted using 1 mL of cold PBS. This procedure was repeated thrice to recover the maximal number of cells. Lungs were then perfused with cold PBS to remove contaminating peripheral blood cells and subsequently homogenized to obtain non-parenchymal cells.</p>
