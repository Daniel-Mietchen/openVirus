<p>The mouse-adapted IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8, H1N1) was used in the vast majority of experiments. Sequential 12 (SEQ12) is an escape mutant selected after sequential neutralization of PR8 in the presence of 12 different hemagglutinin (HA)-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008393.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All IAV strains were grown in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Infectious allantoic fluid was harvested, pooled, filtered, titrated and stored at -80Â°C until use.
