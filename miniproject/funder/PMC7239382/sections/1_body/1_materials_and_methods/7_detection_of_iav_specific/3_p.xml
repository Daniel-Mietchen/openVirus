 <sup>d</sup>:HA
 <sub>518</sub> dextramers generously provided by Dr. Stephen Haley (Immudex, Copenhagen, Denmark) to detect NP

 <sub>518</sub>-specific T
 <sub>CD8</sub>, respectively. Up to 3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> splenocytes were incubated first with a 2.4G2 supernatant aliquot and then with 10 μL of dextramers in dark for 10 minutes at room temperature. This step was followed by staining with anti-CD8α mAb (clone 53–6.7) as described above.
