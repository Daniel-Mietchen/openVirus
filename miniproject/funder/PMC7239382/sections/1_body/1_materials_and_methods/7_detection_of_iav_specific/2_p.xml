<p>In kinetic experiments, tetramer staining was also conducted on serial peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from each animal. Up to 200 μL of peripheral blood was collected from the lateral saphenous vein, immediately mixed with 20 μL of heparin sodium (Sandoz Canada Inc.), diluted 1:2 in PBS, and overlaid on 500 μL of low-endotoxin Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Cells were spun at 400 ×
