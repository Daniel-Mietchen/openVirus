<p>At indicated time points after IAV inoculation, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation for their spleen, which was manually homogenized and subjected to treatment with ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer to eliminate erythrocytes. Cells were washed, filtered through a strainer with 70-μm pores, and incubated on ice for 20 minutes with a 20-μL aliquot of 2.4G2 hybridoma supernatant to block Fc γ receptors (FcγR) II and III. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated H-2K
 <sup>d</sup> tetramers loaded with synthetic peptides corresponding to NP
 <sub>147-155</sub> or HA
 <sub>518-526</sub> (NIH Tetramer Core Facility, Atlanta, GA) were then added to the cells at a 1:200 dilution in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NP
 <sub>147-155</sub> and HA
 <sub>518-526</sub> will be simply referred to as NP
 <sub>147</sub> and HA
 <sub>518</sub>. After 30 minutes on ice, an allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD8α mAb (clone 53–6.7) was added to the cells for an additional 30 minutes. In several experiments, cells were co-stained with mAbs to surface CD3ε (clone 145-2C11), CD127 (clone A7R34), Fas (clone 15A7), killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) (clone 2F1), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) (clone C9B7W) or programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) (clone J43) or with a mAb detecting intracellular Ki67 (clone SolA15). All fluorochrome-labeled mAbs and isotype controls were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
