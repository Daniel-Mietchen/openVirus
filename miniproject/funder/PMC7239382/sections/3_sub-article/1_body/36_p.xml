<p>The researchers go on to assess SEB administration before immunization with 'rVVs'. Presumably recombinant Vaccinia viruses, which need a much better description in the methods section - what strain, and how are the minimal epitopes targeted to the ER (and also, why?) Why use epitopes only instead of whole antigens?. Again, humans will never be immunized with rVVs expressing influenza epitopes. Humans will never be immunized by rVVs expressing whole influenza antigens either, and especially not by the i.p. route.</p>
