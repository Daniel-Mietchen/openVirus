<p>The authors should repeat their experiments in systems which more closely mimics actual influenza virus vaccination and co-infection conditions/exposure routes. Specifically, inactivated influenza should be administered i.m. to mimic inactivated influenza virus vaccination (and/or an attenuated influenza virus could be administered i.n. to mimic FluMist). Secondly, in the context of both infection and vaccination, SEB should be administrated into the lungs at moderate levels that would mimic those predicted to occur during natural co-infection, or better still, an SEB-expressing pathogen could used to confirm the reported phenotypes under more physiologically-relevant conditions.</p>
