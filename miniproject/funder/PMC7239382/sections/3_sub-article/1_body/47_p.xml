<p>Reviewer #2: Rather oddly in the Discussion they immediately discuss results not mentioned in the Results section but shown only in the supplementary figures where rather different results were found using recombinant vaccinia or minigene priming. Then the normally immunodominant response to NP147 epitope was almost completely suppressed. This raises issues about use of T cell receptors and antigen presentation that ought to be explored experimentally in the Results section. They could either complete these experiments and put in the main section, strengthening the paper, or cut this additional data set out of this version and present those results later in a second paper, in which case they should put a caveat summarising these findings in this Discussion. The latter would be easier but the former would improve the paper.</p>
