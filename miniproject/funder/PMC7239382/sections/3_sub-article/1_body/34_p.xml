<p>Reviewer #1: Influenza infection in the respiratory tract is known to greatly increase susceptibility to bacterial infection. Thus research to study the interaction between influenza infection and exposure to bacterial superantigens may be of interest in understanding how to improve clinical outcomes. However this paper studies something completely different. Mice who are na√Øve to influenza, and therefore representing only very young children, are exposed to SEB by the i.p. route, and then influenza virus by the i.p. route. This does not model any situation that occurs in humans.</p>
