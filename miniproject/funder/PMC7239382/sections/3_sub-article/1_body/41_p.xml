<p>Reviewer #4: The manuscript addresses an interesting and medically important subject. The approach used to examine the effect of superantigen exposure on the response to IAV and/or IAV associated peptides in robust and should help gain a better understanding of the complex role superantigens and/or superinfections play in the response to influenza and possibly other viruses. Further, the findings of the importance of VÎ² chain expression on the response to SEB exposure is novel. However, there are a number of issues that weaken the strength and impact of this work</p>
