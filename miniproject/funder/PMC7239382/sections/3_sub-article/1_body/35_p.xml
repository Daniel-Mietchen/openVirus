<p>The paper states that 'IAVs constantly mutate to escape TCD8-mediated immunosurveillance' without citing a reference. Where is the evidence that this is true? Antigenic drift definitely occurs in the surface glycoproteins but internal antigens are highly conserved. There is very little evidence for 'immunodominance' of influenza virus epitopes in humans.</p>
