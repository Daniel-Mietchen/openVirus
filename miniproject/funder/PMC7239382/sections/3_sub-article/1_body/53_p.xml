<p>2. The work described in figure 4 has the potential, from a clinical standpoint, to be the most important observation. The effect of SEB exposure on the response in the lungs speaks to the clinical relevance of this work. In the current form, the authors suggests that the fact that they see a response in the spleen but not the lungs suggests that SEB exposure works locally and not at peripheral sights. While this is an important observation, no work was presented to describe whether local exposure in the lungs would result in alterations in the immune response to IAV. This is a critical experiment and would significantly increase the strength of this work.</p>
