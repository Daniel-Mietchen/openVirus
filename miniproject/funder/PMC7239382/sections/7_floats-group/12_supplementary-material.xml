  <title>Pretreatment with SEB selectively enhances primary NP
   <sub>147</sub>- and HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> responses elicited by SEQ12 immunization.
  </title>
  <p>(A) BALB/c mice (n = 4/group) were injected i.p. with PBS or with 50 μg SEB three days before they were immunized i.p. with SEQ12. At the peak of the primary response (
   <italic>i</italic>.
   <italic>e</italic>., on day 7 post-immunization), T
   <sub>CD8</sub> recognizing the indicated epitopes were enumerated by MHC I tetramer staining (B) and by ICS for IFN-γ (C). Error bars represent SEM. * and ** denote statistically significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, respectively, which were determined using an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test
