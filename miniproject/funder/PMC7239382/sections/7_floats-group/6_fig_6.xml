  <title>Exposure to SEB after PR8 immunization augments IAV-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> responses.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Mice were inoculated with PR8 and then injected with PBS or SEB (50 μg) i.p. Seven days after the SEB challenge (or after PBS injection), animals were euthanized, and PR8-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were enumerated by ICS for IFN-γ in each spleen. Data pooled from two independent experiments yielding similar results are shown in B-C. In separate experiments, CFSE
   <sup>low</sup> naïve splenocytes displaying NP
   <sub>118</sub> (control target cells) and CFSE
   <sup>high</sup> naïve splenocytes pulsed with NP
   <sub>147</sub> (cognate target cells) were mixed in equal numbers and injected i.v. into PR8-inoculated mice that had subsequently received PBS or SEB. Mice were sacrificed after 1, 2 or 4 hours for their spleens in which target cells were identified based on their differential CFSE intensities. (D) Representative histograms from a 1-hour 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> killing assay are depicted. (E) 
   <italic>In vivo</italic> cytotoxicity at indicated time points is averaged and shown for 3 mice/group/time point. Error bars represent SEM. *, **, *** and **** denote differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, respectively, using unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests.
