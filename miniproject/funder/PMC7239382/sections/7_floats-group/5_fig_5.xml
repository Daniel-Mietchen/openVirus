  <title>Exposure to SEB before boosting immunization upregulates Fas and exhaustion markers on anti-IAV T
   <sub>CD8</sub> and compromises their anamnestic responses.
  </title>
  <p>(A) Mice were primed with PR8, injected with either PBS or 50 μg of SEB, and then boosted with SEQ12 through the i.p. route according to the schematically depicted schedule. Seven days after SEQ12 inoculation, animals were sacrificed for their spleens in which the frequencies (B) and the absolute numbers (C) of IFN-γ-producing epitope-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were determined by ICS. (D) NP
   <sub>147</sub>- and HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub>, which were identified by MHC I tetramers, were co-stained with mAbs against intracellular Ki67 and surface Fas, LAG-3 and PD-1. Error bars represent SEM (n = 4 per group). *, ** and *** denote statistically significant differences with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 and 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, respectively, using unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests.
