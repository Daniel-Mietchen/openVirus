  <title>SEB administration before PR8 immunization increases the clonal size of HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specific T
   <sub>CD8</sub>.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were injected i.p. with PBS or with 50 μg of SEB three days before they were immunized i.p. with the PR8 strain of IAV. Seven days later, HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specfic T
   <sub>CD8</sub> were identified through surface staining with an anti-CD8α mAb and MHC I dextramers. Representative dot plots after live gating on CD3
   <sup>+</sup> events are demonstrated in panel A. In addition, the absolute numbers of splenic HA
   <sub>518</sub>-specific cells were calculated (B). Data are shown as mean ± SEM for 4 mice per group. ** denotes a statistically significant difference with 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 using an unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
