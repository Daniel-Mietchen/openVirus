<p>(1) The paper lacks discrete research questions. The narrative on pp. 3-4, where research questions could be included, read more of a summary of the studyâ€™s findings. To that end, lines 76-103 could be cut from this section as this material is more appropriate in a Discussion. Please add research questions, based on prior literature and current events, to guide the analysis and presentation of results.</p>
