<p>It is clear that the experience of the epidemic and its management depends on the quality of interactions between response actors and populations. This must be conducive to the establishment of a relationship of trust. However, the actors themselves have little means of intervening in the context of the interaction, whether it is international (African populations, however poorly educated they may be, make a pragmatic reading of the post-colonial relationships that structure their ordinary lives and in which the Ebola epidemic falls), or national: the illegitimacy of the actors in the response to the epidemic refers to the illegitimacy of national elites whose populations feel that they have long been forgotten. As is shown by the authors, people's distrust of the state and its proclaim goodwill does not begin with intervention.... Thus, the restoration of the confidence in biomedicine called for by the authors is illusory if it is only mentioned during Ebola. In times of crisis, it appears very late to lay the foundations for a relationship of trust with biomedicine (or to strengthen a health system that has been abandoned since the advent of structural adjustment policies...). Preparedness must also be considered at the level of ordinary health systems!</p>
