<p>The relationship between populations and intervention is not necessarily fixed and the terms of interaction are constantly redefined. Credible testimony such as that of a survivor can thus have a positive effect on how the intervention is perceived. The impact of survivors can therefore be crucial, as the authors report. However, it remains to be recalled that the figure of the survivor is also the subject of negotiations. In Guinea during the 2013-2015 outbreak, they were sometimes perceived as having benefited from the intervention themselves, sometimes as having sold their own deceased parents and to benefit from Ebola resources (which, in the eyes of the populations, was confirmed by their position as official witnesses paid by NGOs). This figure of the survivor taking advantage of Ebola's money is not favorable to a positive reception of his speech. Survivors have often been ostracized by their relatives and the figure of a witness, the only recourse to exist for them after the sickness (as they were often excluded from their communities) masked the painful experience of the relegation that often characterizes survival after Ebola (Gomez-Temesio 2018).</p>
