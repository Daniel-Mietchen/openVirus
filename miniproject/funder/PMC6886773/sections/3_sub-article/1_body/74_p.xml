<p>(5) The Discussion is well done. This sentence particularly stands out to me: “In short, restoring trust in medicine requires Ebola Virus Disease to be re-contextualized within a broader framework of concern for the health of all citizens.” In my opinion, this issue is actually the backdrop for the entire study and should be emphasized more strongly as an organizing framework for the paper. The stigma around Ebola, the lack of understanding of transmission pathways, and the (understandable) mistrust of international actors all point to the failure of the larger health system to withstand the shock of Ebola – and the failure of the international health community to invest sufficiently in health systems strengthening versus (as the authors put it) situations where “foreigners are afraid this disease will affect them”.</p>
