<p>We completely agree with reviewer 2 on this point, but we believe that expanding our discussion on the ambivalence and stigma faced by survivors would distract from our core message. We agree that more research on survivors and their experiences is much needed, and we welcome the work done in the piece by Gomez-Temesio that reviewer 2 refers to. However, since this is not the main focus of our paper we have chosen to not expand on this point here. </p>
