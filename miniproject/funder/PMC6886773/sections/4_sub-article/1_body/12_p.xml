<p>The data in this paper are from focus group interviews and key informant interviews undertaken in 2017. All this material is now provided in the file of supporting material. Additionally we now explain that one of the focus group interviews in 2017 was conducted among villagers in a community (“Taninihun”) first studied at the height of the Ebola outbreak in 2014. We include in the supporting material questionnaire interview and focus group data from this earlier study as a “baseline” for the current analysis. Comparisons between the two data sets (for 2014 and 2017) are briefly discussed. But the paper primarily analyses the focus group and key-informant interview materials from 2017. Given the clarifications now added, we do not see a necessity to re-structure our results or discussion section. </p>
