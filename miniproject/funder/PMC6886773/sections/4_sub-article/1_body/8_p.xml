<p>The bigger overarching study on trust in medicine after the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, Ghana and Uganda largely utilized qualitative methods, but included a smaller quantitative survey in all three countries. The data analysed here, however, was collected in a different study period and with a slightly different thematic focus. In this manuscript we do not draw on the quantitative material, as it is not relevant to the topic of this manuscript.</p>
