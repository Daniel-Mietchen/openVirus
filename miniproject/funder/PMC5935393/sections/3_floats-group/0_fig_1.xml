  <title>The mechanism of calculating the mean of alarms indicators.</title>
  <p>The mean of each alarm indicator was consecutively measured from the point of estimate (W = epidemiological week) and for a preceding number of weeks. The window size of the alarm indicator is objectively set to define the appropriate length of the preceding period when calculating the mean alarm indicator (e.g. choosing alarm window size of 4, this step will measure the mean of each alarm indicator during the last four consecutive weeks including the week we are measuring from). The calculated alarm mean then enters the logistic regression model as a predictor of an outbreak.</p>
