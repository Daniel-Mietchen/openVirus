<p>When developing the first version of the EWARS tool [
 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the ability of an extended list of candidate alarm indicators [
 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] for outbreak prediction was assessed but had to be reduced to a few viable indicators. The subsequent development of the EWARS-R tool was progressing towards model enhancement by processing multiple meteorological, epidemiological and entomological indicators but was also limited by the lack of robust local information on a weekly basis. One of the persisting challenges is access to real-time meteorological data. The use of satellite data for surface temperature and rainfall as well as a more formalized collaboration between MoH and meteorological institutions has been initiated. Furthermore, testing the previously-mentioned installation of robust meteorological stations in Mexico is currently underway. Another important challenge is to integrate EWARS-R into national electronic surveillance systems which has the potential to avert double recording of data (one for the routine surveillance and one for EWARS practice) thus, increased efficiency and consistency.
