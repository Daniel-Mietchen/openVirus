<p>The EWARS model is based on the Shewhart method, which is typically applied in industrial and business settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. When applied to dengue, the EWARS adopts systematic control charts, using the historic mean and standard deviation (SD) of the dengue outbreak. This defines the Endemic Channel which represents the number of dengue cases within the expected normal range or the ‘in-control’ state, while anything above this moving average is considered representative of an unusual number of cases and, an ‘out-of-control’ state (i.e., an outbreak). Although the use of the Endemic Channel applying a fixed 2 SD threshold for disease surveillance has been reported in some countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the EWARS tool includes locally valid alarm signals and thresholds both for alarm indicators and dengue cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This early warning model does not merely rely on outbreak records but utilizes a broad spectrum of epidemiological, entomological and meteorological data to inform about a forthcoming dengue outbreak. The EWARS tool has more recently been complemented by a computer-assisted user’s work book (WHO 2017) [
