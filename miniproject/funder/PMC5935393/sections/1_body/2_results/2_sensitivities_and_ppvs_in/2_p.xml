<p>During the calibration and validation process, the new tool proved better in handling inconsistent data, for instance when data records in one variable are reported as both absolute values and fractions. Improvement of the operational aspects of the modified version also targeted situations when data records on outbreak indicator (hospitalized cases) in some spatial units were merely “zero”, which would usually cause systematic error when running the binary regression. Moreover, the processing rate of the new tool is around 30 second per run using an ordinary computer, which is almost 10 times faster than the older version–an essential element for this process. The user-friendly interface and instant “error/ solution” messages show potentials for increased acceptability of applying such tool in different settings. Indeed, a significant trend towards improved data quality and reporting has been documented during this study.</p>
