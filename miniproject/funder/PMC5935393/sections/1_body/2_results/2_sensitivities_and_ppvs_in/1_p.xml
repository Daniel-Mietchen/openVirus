PPVs ranged between 40–88% in Brazil, 71–80% in Malaysia and 50–83% in Mexico. The analysis of serotype (using two-week lag-time) and ovitrap variables (using three-week lag-time) showed promising findings with sensitivity and PPVs of 50% and 71% for serotype and 79% and 60% for ovitrap, respectively.
