<p>A total of 34 district health managers responded to the survey and answered questions during these semi-structured interviews in Brazil (n = 7), Malaysia (n = 10) and Mexico (n = 17). 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196811.t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes all responses. There was an overall consensus towards the usefulness of the EWARS tool in averting or mitigating dengue outbreaks and its potential use with other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases. Health managers equally acknowledged the benefits of EWARS training courses and the technical support provided by tutors. User opinions about the mode of data collections and interpretations were positive and respondents viewed it as appropriate for their corresponding settings. Some operational aspects concerning data availability and the post-outbreak responsiveness, however, remain to be fully addressed. According to the interviewees, the mechanism of case notification needs to be enhanced and obtaining timely meteorological data is yet a challenge. Several recommendations have been taken on board for updating the tool, particularly the use of smaller geographical units, the use of entomological indicators (ovitrap data from Mexico as these was the only systematically collected entomological information with timely reporting) and the combination of indicators (allowing for multiple environmental, entomological and epidemiological indicators to predict an outbreak probability).
