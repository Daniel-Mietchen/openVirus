<p>Based on recommendations from previous EWARS report [
 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we used a range of 1.0–1.5 of ‘z’ value to define our Endemic Channel and thus, an ‘outbreak week’ (i.e. state of out-of-control) was triggered once dengue incidence crossed the upper threshold of the Endemic Channel (z*SD). Although there is not much evidence on mean lag times, based on findings from other reports [

 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and further consultations with expert panels, a range of 1–12 weeks for outdoor air temperature, 3–12 weeks for rainfall, 2–12 weeks for outdoor humidity and 2–8 weeks for Ovitrap Index and serotype were used in the prediction process as lag-times from the state of alarm to the beginning of the outbreak. Single and multiple logistic regression using a list of alarm indicators were performed to estimate the ‘outbreak probability’ needed to define the ‘alarm signal’ at district level. Using the recommended range of 0.08–0.2 for alarm threshold [
 <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], an ‘alarm signal’ was triggered when the derived outbreak probability crossed the ‘alarm threshold’. For this quantitative assessment of the second generation EWARS-R, we sought simple descriptive statistics to present average sensitivity and PPVs separately for each country. The Free R software version 3.4.3 was used in this analysis.
