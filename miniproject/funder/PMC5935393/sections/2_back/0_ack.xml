 <p>We would like to thank the country teams in Brazil, Malaysia, and Mexico as well as in the Dominican Republic and Vietnam for their continuous collaboration and feedback of experiences. Likewise the national programme managers in the study countries played an important role in facilitating the implementation of the new tools. The Special Programme for Tropical Disease Research and Training (TDR-WHO) was instrumental in supporting the project financially and organizationally supported by the NTD Department in Geneva and the WHO Regional Offices (PAHO, WPRO and SEARO). Special thanks to Beat Schwegler and his team at Microsoft Company, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland for advising on the further development of the EWARS tool.</p>
