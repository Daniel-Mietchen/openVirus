The ability to detect early emerging outbreaks is key to mounting an effective response.

These recommendations were incorporated into the second-generation EWARS-R, using the free R software, combined with recent surveillance data and resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values of alarm signals compared to the first-generation EWARS.

It has become a leading cause of morbidity in children and adults in many tropical and sub-tropical countries [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Disease outbreaks (epidemics) overburden stretched health systems, impoverished societies and households alike.</p><p>The transmission of dengue and other <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne arboviral diseases can only be controlled through effective vector control interventions, potentially combined with an efficacious vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the required level of interventions to prevent transmission has not been achieved and outbreaks have become increasingly frequent in the past two decades, more recently also joined by other <italic>Aedes</italic> borne diseases such as chikungunya and Zika [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196811.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemics are usually detected too late when the case numbers are already growing unrestrained. It is argued that early outbreak warning and response may be crucial for mitigating or averting the destructive consequences of outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>For other communicable diseases of epidemic potential, research on outbreak warning has often been restricted to the definition of an epidemic as compared to endemic transmission (Rift Valley Fever [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], malaria [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], influenza [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), or limited to alarms under extreme meteorological conditions [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] such as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation). ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere mode of variability, which can produce extreme climate conditions such as heavy rainfall, which can boost the breeding places for disease vectors such as <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, early outbreak warning using alarm indicator(s) to trigger early response has rarely been studied [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In order to address the need, for an alarm system for dengue outbreaks, the Special Programme for Tropical Disease Research and Training (WHO/TDR) initiated together with national dengue control services and academia in partner countries the development of an early dengue outbreak warning and response system (EWARS), jointly supported by the EU-funded IDAMS consortium. The stepwise development of the EWARS method and its retrospective testing with preliminary results have been previously published [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The EWARS model is based on the Shewhart method, which is typically applied in industrial and business settings [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but more increasingly in the context of public health [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. When applied to dengue, the EWARS adopts systematic control charts, using the historic mean and standard deviation (SD) of the dengue outbreak. This defines the Endemic Channel which represents the number of dengue cases within the expected normal range or the &#x02018;in-control&#x02019; state, while anything above this moving average is considered representative of an unusual number of cases and, an &#x02018;out-of-control&#x02019; state (i.e., an outbreak). Although the use of the Endemic Channel applying a fixed 2 SD threshold for disease surveillance has been reported in some countries [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the EWARS tool includes locally valid alarm signals and thresholds both for alarm indicators and dengue cases [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This early warning model does not merely rely on outbreak records but utilizes a broad spectrum of epidemiological, entomological and meteorological data to inform about a forthcoming dengue outbreak. The EWARS tool has more recently been complemented by a computer-assisted user&#x02019;s work book (WHO 2017) [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In the context of EWARS incorporation into routine national surveillance systems, there was an opportunity to advance both the technical and operational components via feedback from participating countries that ensures the tool becomes increasingly user-friendly.</p><p>In this paper, we summarize these recent adaptation efforts guided by the experience of local health managers when applying the tool and by further statistical analyses that underpin the recent modifications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study settings and data collection</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Qualitative assessment of field experience of the first generation of EWARS</title><p>The first generation of the EWARS tool identified evidence-based meteorological, epidemiological and entomological indicators predicting a forthcoming outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These indicators were later tested across ten districts in each of the three participatory countries in the prospective study: Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico. The information on the plausibility of applying the tool in routine surveillance, user-friendliness and &#x0201c;lessons learned&#x0201d; were collected through a self-applied questionnaire following a seven to ten-months testing period, from December 2016 to February 2017. This was complemented by data from personal semi-structured interviews. Participants in these interviews were staff members from the vector control, epidemiology and health promotion units covering all localities/ districts where the EWARS tool is being implemented. Among the participants are biologists, physicians and social communicators. In Mexico, all staff from different components of dengue surveillance and response were invited to voluntarily and anonymously conduct the semi-structured interviews through organized meetings. In Brazil and Malaysia, however, all recruited staffs were sent these semi-structure interviews via email. These interviews included 17 open-ended questions covering the different components of the EWARS tool and health officers&#x02019; opinions/ satisfaction regarding its prospective application. Qualitative content analysis was used as methodology. Concepts were obtained from the interviews and systematically compared with the rest of interviews using a technique from the Grounded Theory, i.e. the constant comparisons technique [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These concepts were compared and grouped throughout the interviews accounting for patterns and variations. The references selected are representative of the most frequently shared concepts that arose from the interviews.

All data records reported after these cut-off points (years) were used as the evaluation data (i.e. the second half of the retrospective surveillance data, used to validate the derived parameters from the prediction model, and to identify the correct and false outbreak alarms), which facilitates a multiple rounds of cross-validation process.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reduced duration of the period of the &#x0201c;moving average&#x0201d; (from 13 to 7 weeks): Average (mean) number of dengue cases&#x02013;within the expected &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; or seasonal range&#x02013;were calculated for a fixed window size of three preceding and three succeeding weeks from the point of measure 3+1+3 weeks to generate a smoothed &#x0201c;moving average&#x0201d;. Relatively smaller window size would likely reveal more details about the outbreak indicator.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Extended number of candidate alarm indicators (meteorological, entomological and epidemiological) which now includes: i) Ovitrap-index in Mexico (the proportion of positive ovitraps and the mean number of eggs per block of houses- the only available entomological indicator with weekly reporting) and, ii) Predominant dengue virus serotype in Malaysia (indicating changes of serotype; weekly information on this indicator was previously unavailable in any of the study countries). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196811.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates the mechanism of calculating the mean of alarms indicators before entering the regression model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Advanced method of analysis. The second generation EWARS-R has advanced into multiple logistic regression modelling of outbreak probability, allowing one or more alarm indicator(s) per analysis. This has the potential to account for missing or inconsistent records and improve the explanation of the outbreak prediction. Another analytical advancement with potential for model enhancement is the inclusion of the &#x02018;Spline&#x02019; function to adjust for likely non-monotonic nature in some variables. A non-monotonic relationship occurs when the number of dengue cases take an inversed direction as the mean alarm indicator continue to increase, during a particular period. For instance, the number of dengue cases increase as the environmental temperature increases but at one point, a decrease in dengue cases is observed due to a decreased vector activity as a result of excessive temperatures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use of district-level Excel spreadsheet files (prospective analysis) containing the algorithm and all parametric coefficients needed for calculating the outbreak probability: These coefficients are estimated during the retrospective phase, depending primarily on the sensitivity (i.e. the proportion of correctly predicting an outbreak out of all outbreaks) and PPV (i.e. the proportion of correct alarms out of all alarms) as direct measures for deciding the best calibrated settings (i.e. those with highest sensitivity and PPV). In the Excel spreadsheet file, the prospective information of alarm indicators is being entered to estimate the probability of an &#x02018;alarm signal&#x02019; for a forthcoming outbreak&#x02014;an alarm signal is triggered when the outbreak probability crosses a given alarm threshold. This process is achieved by inserting weekly district-level prospective data of outbreak cases and alarm indicators (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196811.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In these excel spreadsheets, displayed parameters (top-left hand corner) and the graph can guide the interpretation of the &#x0201c;alarm signal&#x0201d; field. For instance, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196811.g002">Fig 2</xref>, prospective information on &#x0201c;mean temperature&#x0201d; in week 12 shows an &#x0201c;alarm signal&#x0201d; predicting a forthcoming outbreak in the following 2 weeks (prediction distance, lag time) from the current week.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implementation of an external interface to reduce human error and increase users&#x02019; acceptability.

The analysis of serotype (using two-week lag-time) and ovitrap variables (using three-week lag-time) showed promising findings with sensitivity and PPVs of 50% and 71% for serotype and 79% and 60% for ovitrap, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0196811.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0196811.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Sensitivity and PPV for outbreak detection using hospitalized dengue cases as outbreak indicator in relation to earlier weekly changes in alarm indicators in Brazil.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0196811.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0196811.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Alarm Indicator</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sensitivity (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Positive Predictive Value (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean temperature (Celsius)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">91</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total rainfall (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age (years)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Probable cases</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Humidity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">89</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiple indicators<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t002fn001">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t002fn001"><p>*Temperature, rainfall, mean age, probable cases &#x00026;

Improvement of the operational aspects of the modified version also targeted situations when data records on outbreak indicator (hospitalized cases) in some spatial units were merely &#x0201c;zero&#x0201d;, which would usually cause systematic error when running the binary regression. Moreover, the processing rate of the new tool is around 30 second per run using an ordinary computer, which is almost 10 times faster than the older version&#x02013;an essential element for this process. The user-friendly interface and instant &#x0201c;error/ solution&#x0201d; messages show potentials for increased acceptability of applying such tool in different settings. Indeed, a significant trend towards improved data quality and reporting has been documented during this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Achievement of updating the EWARS tool</title><p>When developing the first version of the EWARS tool [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the ability of an extended list of candidate alarm indicators [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] for outbreak prediction was assessed but had to be reduced to a few viable indicators. The subsequent development of the EWARS-R tool was progressing towards model enhancement by processing multiple meteorological, epidemiological and entomological indicators but was also limited by the lack of robust local information on a weekly basis. One of the persisting challenges is access to real-time meteorological data. The use of satellite data for surface temperature and rainfall as well as a more formalized collaboration between MoH and meteorological institutions has been initiated. Furthermore, testing the previously-mentioned installation of robust meteorological stations in Mexico is currently underway. Another important challenge is to integrate EWARS-R into national electronic surveillance systems which has the potential to avert double recording of data (one for the routine surveillance and one for EWARS practice) thus, increased efficiency and consistency.</p><p>Progression with this project provided clear indications that interested countries should allocate appropriate resources into a functioning and high-quality electronic surveillance system that can allow detection and response to outbreaks at early stages [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore and against the background of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will involve major investments in health by many countries, robust indicators for tracking health systems&#x02019; effectiveness will be critical. EWARS-R is therefore, an example of a tool able to contribute directly to that process.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Progressive developments towards a widespread use of the EWARS-R tool</title><p>The use of the open-access software package &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; have made the tool more user-friendly, with improved sensitivity and PPVs for early outbreak predictions, and its open source web-based applications encourages further developments, which are underway.</p><p>The transformation of software application (from STATA to &#x0201c;R&#x0201d;) is coupled with the development of an integrated web-based dashboard to facilitate a user-friendly interface and allow instant reporting and sharing of model coefficients for the prospective data entry.

Despite systematic integration of this action plan in the new EWARS-R, which can routinely report about appropriate response stage, further research is needed to provide evidence of the operational and cost-effectiveness of these actions and to develop clear indications about priority areas where to start and focus response actions when an alarm signal is reported (&#x0201c;hot spots&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="pone.0196811.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The EWARS system is a pragmatic solution for countries to mount during the pre-outbreak phase as an effective dengue outbreak response defined by alarm signals.
