<p>The largest funder of public research within Europe is the European Union's (EU's) multiannual Framework Programme (FP), which has supported research on NIDs since the 4th Framework Programme (FP4, 1994–98), when International Cooperation (INCO) activities were introduced. INCO was one of the first major research funding schemes to focus specifically on NID research through transnational collaborative research. Between 1997 and 2006, it provided some €70 million support for 55 NID research projects. The projects covered a wide range of research areas, from vector control to vaccine research, as well as development of non-medical innovations such as traps for tsetse flies and solar-powered disinfection of drinking water. The projects included research on individual diseases but also addressed complex diseases such as childhood infections and diarrhoeal diseases, as well as research on health systems and health service issues of disease control.</p>
