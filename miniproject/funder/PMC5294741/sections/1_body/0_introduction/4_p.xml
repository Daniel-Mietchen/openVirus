<p>When world leaders adopted the Millennium Declaration in September 2000 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, the fight against “HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases” was included as the sixth goal. This resulted in significant global support to combat the three major poverty-related diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis), whereas other important diseases of poverty were largely overlooked 
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This situation has improved significantly over recent years, and the international community has become increasingly aware of the importance of confronting NIDs. In their statement of 9 October 2015, the ministers of science from the G7 countries expressed their resolve to support the fight against neglected tropical diseases, in line with the declaration of the G7 leaders at their meeting in Elmau, Germany on 8 June 2015 
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Similarly, the heads of state of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) included the fight against neglected tropical diseases in the Ufa declaration in July 2015 
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These high-level statements align well with target 3–3 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which promises to end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, and to combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases by 2030.
