<p>Neglected infectious diseases (NIDs) comprise a highly diverse group of communicable illnesses that disproportionately affect poor populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in tropical and subtropical parts of the world. NIDs affect more than one billion people

 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. While NIDs disproportionately affect the poorest countries in the world, they are not exclusively a problem of developing countries. The recent and devastating outbreak of Ebola in several West African countries demonstrated that NIDs can rapidly develop into a global threat. It also illustrated how social stability, economic growth, regional peace and national security can be threatened by an emerging disease outbreak when no adequate medical interventions are available.
