<p>Building on the activities of the INCO programme, NID research was identified as a specific priority for the 7th EU Framework Programme (FP7; 2007–13) 
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. FP7 had a total indicative budget of more than €50 billion and was composed of four major sub-programmes (in addition to a special sub-programme on nuclear research). The largest sub-programme, Cooperation, represented two-thirds of the overall budget and focused on collaborative research between research teams in different countries. While research teams from most countries in the world could participate and receive funding from the Cooperation sub-programme, individual projects should always include organisations from at least three different EU or FP7-associated countries, thereby giving a bias towards participation and funding of European institutions. The Ideas programme, with the European Research Council (ERC) as its flagship initiative, supported individual research teams around a principal investigator. The People programme, including Marie Curie actions, provided fellowships for researcher mobility and career development. The Capacities programme, the smallest of the four sub-programmes, was predominantly aimed at strengthening research infrastructure.
