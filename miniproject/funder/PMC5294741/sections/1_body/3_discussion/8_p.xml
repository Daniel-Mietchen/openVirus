<p>While the first EDCTP programme focused on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, EDCTP2 has a wider remit that includes NIDs. The additional funding will enable EDCTP2 to support all phases of clinical trials (phases Iâ€“IV) and it can therefore fill an important gap in the development, clinical evaluation and uptake of new products for NIDs. EDCTP2 also aims to ameliorate the shortage of human and institutional capacity for NID research. Collaborative research is a cornerstone of EDCTP2, as the larger clinical trials must be carried out in partnership between research teams from Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. This will help to create multidisciplinary consortia and networks of NID scientists spanning multiple institutions and countries, generating a critical mass with the expertise and capacity to undertake complex clinical trials in resource-poor settings.</p>
