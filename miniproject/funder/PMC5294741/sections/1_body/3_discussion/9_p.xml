<p>The focus of FP7 on translational and collaborative research consortia has undoubtedly strengthened the capacity of European scientists to discover and develop new products against NIDs in collaboration with disease-endemic countries. European-funded research progressed a number of vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tests from preclinical testing into later development stages. Vaccine and drug candidates against leishmaniasis, helminths and diarrhoea have been moved from pre-clinical to early clinical trials, while other projects strengthened understanding of co-infections between poverty-related diseases and helminth infections, and discovered new biomarkers and genetic factors relevant to disease progression and drug resistance. With the expanded remit of EDCTP2, promising candidate products can be progressed through the development pipeline. EDCTP2 can also catalyse their successful uptake by the healthcare systems by supporting, in collaboration with other partners, important public health aspects like health education, pharmacovigilance, and cross sectoral approaches (One Health) to combat neglected zoonoses. At the same time it is important to continue strengthening the capacity for basic research in disease-endemic countries in order to create a critical mass of expertise that could have a long-lasting effect on the scientific landscape. The strong focus on collaborative research in FP7 has strengthened the links between research teams in different countries, including disease-endemic countries, and helped to create a global network of NID researchers. This network forms a solid basis for further collaborative research that could have a lasting impact on human health and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
