<p>Global support for NID research increased by approximately 70% from 2007 to 2011 
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but our analysis demonstrates that average annual financial support for NID research from the EU increased by 200% during the implementation of FP7. European support for NID research therefore grew almost three times faster than the global average during FP7. It should be noted however that the increased support for NID was associated with a concurrent decrease in support for the three major poverty-related diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis). The total EU contribution to research activities for the big three in the four years of FP6 (2002–2006) was thus more than €455 million (including a contribution of €200 million to the first phase of the EDCTP programme), corresponding to approximately 119 million per year
