<p>A total of €169 million was spent by the EU on NID research during the 7 years of FP7, targeting 65 research projects. This is more than the EU investments in malaria (€122 million) and tuberculosis (€118 million), and comparable to the EU investments in HIV/AIDS (€175 million) in the same period 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, the total budget for the health research programme in FP7 was more than €6.1 billion, and NID research therefore received less than 3% of all health research investments.
