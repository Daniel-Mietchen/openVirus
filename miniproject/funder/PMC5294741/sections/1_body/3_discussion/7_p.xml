<p>The second phase of EDCTP (EDCTP2) was launched in December 2014 with a financial contribution of up to €683 million from the EU's Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, the successor to FP7 
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. EU contributions will match funds provided by participating European governments, either in cash or in-kind, while additional contributions and collaborations will be sought from African governments, industry, private charity funders and like-minded organisations. Taken together, the EDCTP2 programme has therefore a projected financial volume of more than €1.8 billion over a 10-year period, making it the world's largest pooled funding mechanism with a specific focus on poverty-related disease research.
