<p>In the period from 2007 to 2014, the EU was one of the world's largest funders of NID research, together with the US National Institutes of Health, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust

It is notable that the largest European investments have been made in vaccine research, while many other major funders have focused primarily on the development of new or improved drugs for NIDs. The strong focus on vaccine research can probably not be explained by a single factor, but an important element could be the strong historical legacy and industrial base for vaccine research in Europe.
