<p>Several of these candidates should be advanced over the coming years. However, bringing new products through clinical development and to market requires substantial financial resources. The shortage of human and institutional capacity to perform clinical trials to international standards in disease-endemic countries is another important bottleneck. The principal European response to address these challenges has been an expansion of the European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) â€“ a pooled funding mechanism jointly owned by a group of African and European countries and financially supported by the EU. Currently, EDCTP has 28 participating countries, 14 European and 14 from sub-Saharan Africa. It was established in 2003 as a response to the Millennium Development Goals, and had the objective of accelerating the clinical development of new medical products against poverty-related diseases. Since its establishment, EDCTP has funded more than 240 projects, and contributed to 102 clinical trials, while also supporting local capacity strengthening through fellowships, networking and infrastructure development.</p>
