<p>To estimate how the level of EU funding for NID research compares with other funders of global health we used the G-Finder Public Search Tool, which contains information on global disbursements for research into 35 neglected diseases. The group of diseases in the G-Finder survey is slightly different from the group of diseases in our study. In addition, the G-Finder data are based on actual or estimated disbursements in a given year, rather than total investments over the lifetime of a project or an activity. Despite these shortcomings, the G-Finder data base can nevertheless provide a fair estimate of the level of funding from different funders. We found that the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) were by far the largest global funders of NID research. In the period from 2007 to 2014, the total disbursements to disease-specific NID research (excluding disbursements to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) from these two organisations amounted to more than 1.8 billion and 1.0 billion USD, respectively. The third largest funder of NID research was the Wellcome Trust with disbursements of 237 million USD, while the European Commission took fourth place with 166 million USD. This was followed by two French organisations, INSERM and the Pasteur Institute in Paris, which both invested slightly more than 110 million USD, while the US Department of Defence (DoD) disbursed approximately 100 million USD.</p>
