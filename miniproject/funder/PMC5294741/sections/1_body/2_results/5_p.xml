<p>A more detailed analysis revealed that 481 research teams were involved in EU-funded NID research projects. Some 67% of these 481 research teams were from academic (212) or public (110) research institutions, whereas participation from the private sector was more evenly distributed between non-profit organisations (63) and for-profit companies (75). In some cases, the same research team participated in two or more FP7 projects, while some institutions participated with different research teams in separate FP7 projects. The participating research teams nevertheless represented 325 different organisations from 72 countries on six continents. Out of these, 65 institutions (20%) were based in 38 LMICs in Africa (20), Asia (8) and Latin America (10). While these institutions represented about a fifth of all participants, they collectively received less than â‚¬25 million (15%) of the total funding.</p>
