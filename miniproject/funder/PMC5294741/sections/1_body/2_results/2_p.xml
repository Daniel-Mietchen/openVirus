<p>We identified 65 NID research projects that were funded during the seven years of FP7 and received a total financial contribution of almost €169 million (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This corresponds to an average annual commitment of more than €24 million. By comparison, less than €8 million was disbursed on average during the nine years of the INCO programme. EU funding for NID research therefore tripled in the period 2007–13 in comparison to the preceding decade. NID research was funded within each of the four major sub-programmes of FP7, but more than 87% of funding (€147.5 million) was allocated to just 34 projects within the Cooperation programme.
