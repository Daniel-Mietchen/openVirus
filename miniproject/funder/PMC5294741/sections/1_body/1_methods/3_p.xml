For each funder we extracted the total disbursements in the period from 2007 to 2014 for all of the 35 diseases covered by the G-Finder database and subsequently subtracted disbursements for HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and non-allocated research to arrive at an estimated level of funding for NID research.
