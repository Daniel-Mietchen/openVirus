<p>We used the European Commission's Community Research and Development Information Service (CORDIS,

Search terms included broad classifications of pathogens (e.g. helminth, kinetoplastid, protozoa, virus, worm) and diseases (e.g. diarrhoea, filariasis, neglected infectious diseases, neglected tropical disease, trypanosomiasis) as well as specific infections (e.g. dengue, elephantiasis, leishmaniasis, rabies, schistosomiasis) and organisms (e.g. bancrofti, buruli, cruzi, leprae, shigella). This resulted in a gross list of 640 projects of potential interest. The abstracts of these projects were then examined to identify projects for which NID research was the core activity, resulting in a shortlist of 65 projects. These projects were subsequently categorised according to the diseases and pathogens they addressed, and according to the type of research funded. A few projects were addressing both NID and other diseases, in which case they were proportioned evenly between NID and other diseases. Financial data and information about participants in the shortlisted projects were obtained from the CORDIS database and cross-checked with downloaded data from the EU Open Data Portal (

For collaborative projects involving multiple partners, the distribution of project budgets among partners was available in most cases through the Open Data Portal. However, for a few projects (approximately 5%) only the total project budget was available and in these cases we assumed that the total budget was distributed evenly among all project partners.
