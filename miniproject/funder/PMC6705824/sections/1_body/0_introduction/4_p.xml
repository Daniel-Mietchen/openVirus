<p>Given that PrEP uptake has been slow among MSM in early adopter countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it is imperative that efforts to bring PrEP to scale in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), like Mexico, address barriers to PrEP use to support its rapid uptake among those at high risk of HIV acquisition. To inform these efforts, we conducted an exploratory LCA to identify distinct classes of MSM in Tijuana, Mexico with respect to perceived barriers to PrEP use and factors associated with class membership. As in other LMIC, the HIV epidemic in Mexico is concentrated among MSM [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Several socio-structural factors unique to the Mexico-United States border region, including elevated levels of poverty, sex work, drug trafficking, and migration, contribute to the HIV risk environment among MSM in Tijuana [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, as seen in other LMIC [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], HIV risk and access to HIV prevention services among MSM in Tijuana are also shaped by stigma toward sexual minorities [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As such, findings from this exploratory study may help inform strategies to ensure that comprehensive HIV prevention packages that include PrEP are accessible to MSM in Mexico and other similar LMIC.
