<p>Although many of these barriers to PrEP use have been consistently identified among MSM across diverse settings, less is known about how patterns of perceived barriers may vary across subgroups within MSM populations. Latent class analysis (LCA) identifies unobserved classes or subgroups within populations based on the similarity of their responses across individual measures [

Understanding the underlying patterns of perceived barriers to PrEP use across subgroups of MSM and whether these subgroups differ by socio-demographic, psychosocial, healthcare access, substance use, and sexual risk factors may help inform future interventions to support PrEP uptake among MSM.
