<p>International research among MSM has identified barriers to PrEP uptake across multiple domains characterized by PrEP attribute, individual, interpersonal, and structural barriers. PrEP attributes are the most commonly cited barriers to PrEP use among MSM, particularly concerns about PrEP’s cost, efficacy, and side-effects [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Individual barriers to PrEP use include low perceived risk of HIV infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], concerns about daily adherence [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and the potential for increased risk of other sexually transmitted infections due to decreased condom use as a result of PrEP use [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. With respect to interpersonal barriers to PrEP use, prior work has documented concerns that sex partners may expect condomless anal intercourse (CAI) in the context of PrEP use [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as fears that PrEP users may be perceived as sexually promiscuous [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or HIV-positive [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] if others see them taking PrEP. Finally, structural barriers that limit healthcare access can also significantly impact PrEP use. For instance, stigma towards sexual minorities often limits the willingness of MSM to discuss sexual health and HIV prevention with healthcare providers (HCPs) [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which may inhibit their ability to access PrEP [
