<p>Participants were then given basic information about PrEP, including its effectiveness, the importance of daily adherence, and potential side-effects. To assess awareness and use of PrEP, participants were asked whether they had ever heard of PrEP and, if aware, whether they had ever taken PrEP. To assess willingness to use PrEP, participants were asked how willing they would be to take PrEP if available in Mexico for free and at a cost. Participants who were willing to pay for PrEP, were asked how much they would be willing to spend monthly in Mexican pesos (≤150; 151–350; 351–550; 551–750; 751–950; ≥951). Perceived barriers to PrEP use were assessed by asking participants to indicate their level of agreement with 12 statements about why someone would not want to use PrEP using 5-point Likert scale responses (strongly disagree; disagree; neither agree nor disagree; agree; strongly agree). The statements were developed to assess important barriers to PrEP use identified in previous research [
