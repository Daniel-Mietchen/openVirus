<p>Between March 2016 and September 2017, 397 participants who tested HIV-negative as part of a parent study, 
 <italic>Proyecto Enlaces</italic> (“Project Links”), were recruited to participate in 
 <italic>Proyecto Redes</italic> (“Project Networks”). The primary aim of 
 <italic>Proyecto Enlaces</italic> was to compare the effectiveness of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and venue-based sampling (VBS) to identify MSM and persons who identify as transgender women (TW) with previously undiagnosed HIV infection in Tijuana. VBS is a time-space sampling method [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] that was conducted at venues identified via formative research as those where MSM and persons who identify as TW meet sexual partners (e.g., bars, public spaces). RDS is a chain-referral sampling method [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and was initiated by 32 seeds selected to be diverse with respect to HIV status, age, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and recruitment source (i.e., Tijuana’s government-funded HIV treatment clinic and VBS venues). An additional goal of 
 <italic>Proyecto Enlaces</italic> and 
 <italic>Proyecto Redes</italic> was to characterize the sexual networks of MSM and persons who identify as TW due to the high prevalence of HIV among both populations in Tijuana and their often-overlapping sexual networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As such, both MSM and persons who identify as TW were recruited via RDS and VBS to participate in these studies.
