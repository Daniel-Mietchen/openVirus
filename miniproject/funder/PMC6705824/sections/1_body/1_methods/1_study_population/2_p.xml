<p>Eligibility criteria for VBS participants included: no prior HIV diagnosis, cisgender male or transgender female, ≥18 years-old, and anal sex with a cisgender male or transgender female in the past 4 months. Eligible individuals were offered rapid HIV testing (Advanced Quality HIV 1/2 Test Kits, Intec Products, Inc., Xiamen, China) and those who tested HIV-negative were offered enrollment in 
 <italic>Proyecto Redes</italic>. Eligibility criteria for RDS seeds included: cisgender male or transgender female, ≥18 years-old, Tijuana residence, anal sex with a cisgender male or transgender female in the past 4 months, and a social network including ≥15 MSM or persons who identify as TW living in Tijuana. Seeds were given three coupons to recruit MSM peers and peers who identify as TW from their social networks who were then given three coupons to recruit their peers in subsequent recruitment waves. Peer-recruit eligibility criteria were similar to those for seeds, but peer-recruits were not required to live in Tijuana and only had to report anal sex with a cisgender male or transgender female in the past year. Peer-recruits without a prior HIV diagnosis were offered HIV testing. To ensure comparability to VBS participants, peer-recruits who tested HIV-negative and reported anal sex with a cisgender male or transgender female in the past 4 months were offered enrollment in 
 <italic>Proyecto Redes</italic>. Since the 
 <italic>Proyecto Redes</italic> survey only included MSM-specific measures for perceived barriers to PrEP use (described below), the sample for the current study was restricted to 364 HIV-negative MSM (i.e., cisgender males who reported anal sex with other cisgender males in the past 4 months) participants.
