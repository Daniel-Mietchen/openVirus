<p>We then examined whether class membership was associated with socio-demographic, substance use, psychosocial, healthcare access, and sexual risk factors using Vermunt’s bias-adjusted three-step approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. First, we used the posterior probabilities of class membership estimated from our final model (selected in Step 1) to assign participants to one of three classes based on the proportional assignment method (Step 2). Next, we used multinomial logistic regression to examine the relationship between class membership and the factors of interest (Step 3) applying Vermunt’s ML method to correct for classification errors in Step 2 and a robust variance estimator [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], we created directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] to illustrate potential relationships among the factors of interest and class membership. We then used these DAGs to identify confounders of the relationship between each factor of interest and class membership. Finally, we constructed individual models for each factor to account for the possibility that a confounder of the relationship between one factor and class membership could be a mediator of the relationship between another factor and class membership [
