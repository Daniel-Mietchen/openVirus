<p>We conducted an exploratory LCA to identify distinct classes of participants with respect to perceived barriers to PrEP use. LCA probabilistically assigns individuals with similar response patterns on a series of observed measures to distinct classes of an unobserved latent variable [

 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For our LCA, we dichotomized participants’ Likert-scale responses to the 12 items measuring perceived barriers to PrEP use (strongly disagree, disagree, or neither agree nor disagree vs. agree or strongly agree), fit a series of models using those binary indicators with one to five classes, and examined the distribution of the log-likelihood values for each model to determine whether a maximum likelihood (ML) solution could be identified [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although we added Bayesian priors (1.0) to stabilize parameter estimation and fit these models using 100 random starting values to facilitate the identification of an ML solution [
 <xref rid="pone.0221558.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], we were unable to identify an ML solution for models with more than two classes due to the sparseness of our data (2
 <sup>12</sup> possible response patterns).
