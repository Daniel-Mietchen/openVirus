<p>It is promising that MSM with any HIV-positive or status unknown partners were less likely to be in the “perceived PrEP attribute barriers” class, indicating those who could benefit the most from PrEP may experience few barriers to PrEP uptake. Additionally, we found that having seen a HCP in the past year was associated with membership in this class. MSM already engaged in healthcare may perceive themselves to be healthy and thus at low risk for HIV infection. As such, they may feel the additional cost and potential side-effects of PrEP use are not worth the benefits. This finding suggests that achieving an increased level of PrEP coverage may be easily addressed in the context of provider-delivered PrEP education. However, the impact of such education on PrEP uptake may also depend on HCPs’ knowledge and perceptions of PrEP, which previous research suggests is linked to their willingness to prescribe PrEP [

Thus, efforts to raise HCPs’ awareness of the benefits of PrEP and bolster their capacity to deliver culturally competent PrEP-related care to their sexual minority patients, including patient-centered, non-judgmental sexual risk assessment, may be critical to the success of provider-delivered PrEP education in Tijuana.
