<p>We assessed perceived barriers to PrEP use across four domains (PrEP attribute, individual, interpersonal, and structural) among HIV-negative MSM in Tijuana, Mexico. Using exploratory LCA, we identified three classes of participants with respect to patterns of perceived barriers to PrEP use. It is promising for future PrEP implementation that 43% of participants endorsed few barriers to PrEP use. However, 45% of participants perceived PrEP attributes, including cost and side-effects, as barriers to PrEP use, while 12% perceived multiple barriers to PrEP use. Although our LCA was exploratory, our findings provide important insight on how PrEP programs might be developed to best serve the needs of MSM in Tijuana. More specifically, our results suggest that a range of comprehensive HIV prevention packages may be needed to enhance PrEP uptake and adherence across subgroups of MSM in this setting.</p>
