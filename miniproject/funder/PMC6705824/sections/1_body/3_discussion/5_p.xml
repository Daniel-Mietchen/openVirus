<p>Our findings should be considered in the context of several limitations. First, our analysis was based on cross-sectional data, which limits our ability to make causal inferences. Second, participants were recruited using non-probability sampling methods, thus our findings may not be generalizable to all MSM in Tijuana or other settings. However, MSM experience significant levels of stigma and discrimination related to being sexual minorities, therefore using VBS and RDS may have increased our ability to access this hard-to-reach population. Third, this study is based on self-reported data, which may have been under-reported due to recall or social desirability bias. Participants may have also overstated their willingness to use PrEP given interviewers had just informed them of its potential benefits. However, interviewers were trained to encourage honest reporting of sensitive information. Fourth, we report on perceived barriers to PrEP use among MSM in Tijuana, which may differ from the actual barriers they may face once PrEP is implemented in Tijuana. Finally, because we were unable to identify ML solutions for models with more than three classes, our findings should be examined further in future research with a larger sample of MSM in the context of a confirmatory LCA.</p>
