<p>Based on the item-response probabilities for each of the perceived barriers (i.e., indicators) across classes identified by our final model (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221558.s002">S2 Table</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0221558.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we labelled the classes (1) high level of perceived barriers (12%), (2) low level of perceived barriers (43%), and (3) perceived PrEP attribute barriers (45%). Participants in the “high level of perceived barriers” class had a high probability (0.64–0.94) of perceiving all of the measured barriers as barriers to PrEP use, while those in the “low level of perceived barriers” class had a low probability (0.007–0.288) of perceiving any of the measured barriers as barriers to PrEP use. Participants in the “perceived PrEP attribute barriers” class had a moderately high probability of perceiving cost (0.61) and side-effects (0.57) as barriers to PrEP use.
