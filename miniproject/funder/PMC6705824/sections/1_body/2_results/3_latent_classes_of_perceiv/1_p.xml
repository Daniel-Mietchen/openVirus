<p>Of the three identified models, the AIC and BIC values were lowest for the three-class model (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221558.s001">S1 Table</xref>), we re-fit the two- and three-class models with direct effects between indicators with BVRs &gt;3.84 to account for the relationships between those indicators, which improved the AIC and BIC values for both models relative to those without direct effects. We then considered item-response probabilities from the two models with direct effects and found that the three-class model had better within class homogeneity and between class separation relative to the two-class model and also identified more meaningful classes than the two-class model (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0221558.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Thus, we selected the three-class model with direct effects as our final model.
