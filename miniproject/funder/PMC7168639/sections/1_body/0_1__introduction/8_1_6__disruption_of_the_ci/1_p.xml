<p>Viral infection may also alter circadian gene expression as reported in different studies. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in monkeys caused changes in amplitude and values of body temperature and locomotor activity circadian rhythmicity after the acute retroviral syndrome stage. These changes were not linked to modifications detected in the acute febrile response triggered by virus inoculation. On the other hand, hypothalamic microglia infiltration and macrophage accumulation were shown to occur in animals sacrificed upon appearance of strong circadian anomalies, hinting at analogously significant physiological and psycho-cognitive consequences in human subjects with HIV infection [

Moreover, in vitro experiments performed in a cell line (Bel-7404-HBx) stably transfected with the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx, involved in hepatocellular carcinogenesis) showed alterations in the mRNA expression levels for several core-clock genes, with upregulation of
