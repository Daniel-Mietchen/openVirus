<p>The rhythmic function of the immune system influences the appearance of pathological conditions, for instance, inflammatory lung disease and asthma, which show circadian fluctuations in symptoms and occurrence. In a recent study using both acute and chronic models of virus-induced airway disease (based on the Sendai virus (SeV)), disturbance of the 24-h periodicity negatively affected development, progression, and exacerbation of asthma [

This study reinforces the previous findings from Majumdar et al., who reported a role for BMAL1 as a regulator of innate immunity and showed that BMAL1-deficent cells are more susceptible to infection of the RNA viruses RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and PIV3 (parainfluenza virus type 3) [
