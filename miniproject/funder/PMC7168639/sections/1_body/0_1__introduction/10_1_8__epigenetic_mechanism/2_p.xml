<p>Previous studies report the existence of an interplay between the molecular clockwork, epigenetic modifications, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the liver, which affects ~3% of the population worldwide. Infection with HCV is considered one of the main risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [

Abundant evidence has demonstrated that HCV-related pathogenesis and its impact on liver disease is dependent on the genotype and that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlay viral interaction with cell processes and the molecular clockwork [
