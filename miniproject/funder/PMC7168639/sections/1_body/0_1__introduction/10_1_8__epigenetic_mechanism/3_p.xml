<p>In the in vitro model of Huh-7 cells transfected with HCV core protein of different genotypes (1b, 2a, 3a, 4h, and 5a) [
 <xref rid="B80-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], cellular DNMT1 and DNMT3b protein levels were increased in genotype 1b or 3a HCV core-expressing cells as compared to control cells [
 <xref rid="B75-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Changes in the balance of DNA methylation mediated by DNMTs has been directly linked to HCV-dependent increase in hepatocarcinogenesis and in particular in the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hallmarked by global DNA hypomethylation and local hypermethylation on the promoter of tumour suppressor genes [
 <xref rid="B74-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis showed that reduced E-cadherin (CDH1) expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients [
 <xref rid="B81-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. CDH1 promoter is massively hypermethylated in genotype 1b HCV core protein-positive Huh-7 cells, in turn leading to reduced levels of CDH1 protein and increased levels of SIRT1 [
 <xref rid="B76-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. HCV-dependent alterations in SIRT1 function/activity have been shown by several studies performed in different cellular models [
 <xref rid="B82-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In turn, SIRT1 is a well-established regulator of the circadian oscillation of clock-controlled genes in the liver, controlling fat metabolism, cell proliferation, and regeneration [
 <xref rid="B87-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. HCV has been shown to affect directly the circadian clock machinery. In Huh-7 cells expressing the HCV core protein genotype 1b, but not 3a, protein levels of PER2 and CRY2 were found decreased [
 <xref rid="B79-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Reciprocally, overexpression of PER2 led to a consistent decrease in the levels of HCV RNA undergoing replication [
 <xref rid="B79-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Furthermore, in liver biopsies from HCV genotype 1b-infected patients, PER2 was almost exclusively localized to the nucleus, which is suggestive of an auto-inhibitory transcriptional feedback loop [
 <xref rid="B79-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. More recently, it was shown that the core-clock components BMAL1 and REV-ERBα act upon more steps in the HCV life cycle, including the entry of viral particles into hepatocytes and the replication of the viral RNA [
 <xref rid="B89-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In fact, pharmacological activation of REV-ERB inhibited HCV entry, and genetic knockout of 
 <italic>Bmal1</italic> or overexpression/pharmacological activation of REV-ERB was able to counteract HCV replication by modulating the circadian expression of the liver-specific microRNA miR-122 with consequent derangements of signalling pathways involved in lipid metabolism [
 <xref rid="B89-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. A better understanding of circadian modulation of HCV life cycle and dynamic/rhythmic patterns of host–hosted interplay might lead to increased efficacy of therapies for HCV infection-related diseases.
