 <italic>circa dies</italic>, “approximately one day”, more or less the time length of day/night or light/dark cycles. Circadian rhythms, generated by the endogenous circadian clock, allow living beings to anticipate environmental daily changes and provide an evolutionary advantage that favours survival despite strong selective pressure. The circadian clock is evolutionary conserved and thought to be roughly 2.5 billion years old, tracing back to cyanobacteria, which started releasing vast amounts of oxygen during the Great Oxidation Event, prior (700 million years) to the divergence of plants, animals, and fungal lineages [
