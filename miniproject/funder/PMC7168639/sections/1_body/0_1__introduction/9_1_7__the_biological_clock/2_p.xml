<p>In a COPD/emphysema mouse model, influenza A virus (IAV) infection reworked lung clock gene expression and decreased the amplitude in the rhythms of locomotor activity. This effect was more prominent in C57BL/6J mice that were chronically exposed to cigarette smoke and was accompanied by decreased body weight and augmented mortality; likewise, 
 <italic>Bmal1</italic> knockout mice infected with IAV showed amplified lung inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses.
