<p>Another important interaction involves BMAL1 and the HSV transcriptional machinery. BMAL1 is able to associate with the regulatory protein ICP0 [
 <xref rid="B66-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; it forms heterodimers with the histone acetyltransferase CLOCK and localizes at ND10 nuclear bodies. Viral proteins stabilize the heterodimer and enzymatically activate CLOCK, which associates with the transcriptional complex (ICP4, ICP27, ICP22, and TFIID), linking the replicative cycle of the virus to the molecular clockwork [
