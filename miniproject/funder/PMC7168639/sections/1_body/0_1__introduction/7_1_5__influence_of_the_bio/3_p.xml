<p>Liver infection caused by hepatitis B and C viruses was also reported to be under circadian control. REV-ERBÎ± plays an indirect role in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection by negatively regulating miR122 [
 <xref rid="B61-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], a microRNA known for its essential role in HCV replication [
 <xref rid="B62-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, PER2 overexpression decreased HCV RNA replication in permissive hepatocyte-derived cells. Interestingly PER2 can influence interferon signalling, which is a known player in regulating both the innate and the adaptive antiviral response and viral replication [

Enhanced expression of interferon was also observed as a result of melatonin administration in a mouse model of VEE (Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis). Melatonin is a well-known component of the circadian system; this hormone is produced with 24-h rhythmicity by the pineal gland and has been associated with improved response against viruses. This study showed that melatonin administration results in decreased mortality upon VEE infection [

In addition, the administration of melatonin in the treatment of individuals who are infected with the Ebola virus was reported to reduce several pathological changes caused by the virus to the host, and thus melatonin seems to be an interesting nontoxic candidate for future studies on antagonists of viral infections [
