<p>In mammals, the system driving the generation of internal timing and ultimately the regulation of physiology and behaviour is formed by a hierarchical network of biological oscillators with two hubs in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The SCN clock (main pacemaker) is necessary for the maintenance of 24-h body rhythms [

 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and can restore [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or de novo establish circadian rhythms in gene expression when transplanted in genetically arrhythmic mice [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The circadian circuitry encompasses molecular clocks of the main pacemaker and additional cellular clocks in peripheral tissues [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These are driven by the SCN through neural and humoral outputs [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and, together with the main pacemaker, manage circadian timing of physiological processes and behaviour [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. One of the main external synchronizers (or zeitgeber) is light, a strong central pacemaker-tuning cue [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Light information is perceived by retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin and passed on to the SCN through retino-hypothalamic tract fibres [
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,

 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and to neighbouring and downstream oscillators via neurotransmitters such as glutamate, PACAP, VIP, GRP [
 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], VP [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and GABA [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Even though the oscillators in the SCN are capable of autonomous ticking, the oscillations become progressively dampened in peripheral oscillators in the absence of SCN-synchronizing signals [
