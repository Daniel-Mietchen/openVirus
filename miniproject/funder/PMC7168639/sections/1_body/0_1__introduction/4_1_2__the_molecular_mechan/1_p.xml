<p>The molecular clockworks generate rhythmic oscillations through “transcription-translation feedback loops” (TTFL), i.e., core-clock transcription factors positively turn on the expression of genes encoding circadian proteins that subsequently inhibit transcription via negative-feedback loops, with a time delay indispensable for the proper functioning of the biological clock [
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The TTFL is manoeuvred by several core-clock mRNAs and proteins, including activators (BMAL1, CLOCK, RORα, RORβ, and RORγ) and repressors (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, REV-ERBα, and REV-ERBβ), kinases (CKIα, CKIδ, and CKIε), and phosphatases (PP1 and PP5) that control protein stability and subcellular localization. CLOCK (or its paralogue NPAS2) and BMAL1 (alias ARNTL), as basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH–PAS) transcription factors [
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] heterodimerize and bind to E-boxes in the promoter regions of the genes encoding the period (PER1, PER2, and PER3) and cryptochrome (CRY1 and CRY2) proteins, which upon heterodimerization in the cytoplasm translocate back into the nucleus and repress CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription. Then, ubiquitination-dependent degradation of PER/CRY complexes takes place and a new round of CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription restarts [
