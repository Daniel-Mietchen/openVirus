<p>There are seventy national highway lines in China. We calculated the actual distance between any pair of adjacent prefecture-level cities along the national highways and assigned a unique number to each city. Two symmetric matrices (matrix 
 <bold>A</bold> and 
 <bold>D1</bold>) were constructed. Matrix 
 <bold>A</bold> is an adjacency matrix. If city i and j are adjacent along a national highway, then the value of element 
 <bold>A</bold> (i, j) is one, else it is zero. Matrix 
 <bold>D1</bold> is an adjacent distance matrix and element 
 <bold>D1</bold> (i, j) is the actual distance between city i and j if they are adjacent to each other along national highways (if not, 
 <bold>D1</bold> (i, j) equals zero). An unsymmetrical matrix 
 <bold>D2</bold> was generated from matrix 
 <bold>D1</bold> using the Floyd algorithm [
