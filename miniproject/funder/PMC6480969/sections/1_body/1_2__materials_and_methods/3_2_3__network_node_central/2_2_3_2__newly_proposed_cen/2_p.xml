<p>We propose another new node centrality measure called 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic>, which refers to the shortest distance along national highways from a certain city to one of the eight center cities (Chengdu, Jinan, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and Changsha city) where the epidemics arrived the earliest (before May 22, 2009). All the first cases in these eight cities were imported into China by planes from other countries. The spatial locations of the eight cities are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01223-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The 
 <italic>Multicenter Distance</italic> of city i (SD
 <sub>i</sub>) is calculated as follows. 
 <disp-formula>SD
  <sub>i</sub> = min {D
  <sub>ij</sub>, i = all cities, j = center cities},
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where i = 1, 2, 3, … , 
 <italic>n</italic>; 
 <italic>n</italic> is the total number of cities; j = 1, 2, 3, … , 
 <italic>m</italic>; 
 <italic>m</italic> indicates the number of central cities; and D
 <sub>ij</sub> is the distance along the national highways between a certain city i and a center city j.
