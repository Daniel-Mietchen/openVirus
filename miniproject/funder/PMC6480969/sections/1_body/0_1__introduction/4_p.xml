<p>In addition to ongoing urbanization which draws people from rural to urban areas, spatial heterogeneity [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and may lead to regional inequalities of disease progression and burdens [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-01223" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; another study suggested that, apart from domestic travel, population density was related to the spread of viruses at the county level [
