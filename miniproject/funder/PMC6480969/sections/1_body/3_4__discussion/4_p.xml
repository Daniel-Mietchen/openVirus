<p>We also suggest that the socioeconomic conditions themselves not only have direct impacts on the development of an influenza pandemic but also indirectly exert an influence by stimulating human domestic travel and by changing the patterns of human aggregation, which is congruent with previous research [

It has been reported that people in a wealthy region travel farther than people in a relatively poor region in China due to the difference in basic facilities or people’s living standard, and a pandemic emerging in less developed regions might diffuse more slowly [

Interestingly, health disparities of people in less developed and developed areas in China might be reduced by the interaction of epidemiological and socioeconomic factors in the face of a newly emerging influenza pandemic, especially in the early stages. For instance, although medical treatment in developed areas is better than that in less developed areas, the epidemic arrival time would be earlier in developed areas with a longer epidemic duration. With the reduction of airfares, the opening of more domestic airlines, and the promotion and popularization of high-speed trains in China, the time cost of the journey is greatly decreased in recent years, and passengers tend to think more about the attractiveness of certain places which are mostly determined by the places’ socioeconomic and environmental conditions and think less about the length of trip distance when they choose destinations for travel. Therefore, the impact of spatial distance on the diffusion of infectious diseases may become smaller in the future, while that of socioeconomic factors will be more and more important.
