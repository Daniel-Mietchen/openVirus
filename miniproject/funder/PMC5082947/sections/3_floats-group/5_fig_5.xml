  <title>Correlation between segment read abundance and segment svRNA abundance.</title>
  <p>The percentage of total influenza-specific reads attributed to each segment, as well as the percentage of total svRNA reads attributed to the segment, was calculated across all infected mouse reads. Each segment is represented numerically on the graph, with the line representing the linear regression of the data.</p>
