  <title>Read length distribution of mouse and influenza virus-specific small RNA reads.</title>
  <p>Adapter-trimmed small RNA reads from all samples were separated based on whether they originated from a mock-infected or infected mouse, and whether they mapped uniquely to the mouse genome or to the PR8 genome. For each of these categories, small RNA reads were combined and assessed for the distribution of their read lengths.</p>
