  <title>Segment-specific genome coverage of reads mapped to PR8.</title>
  <p>Influenza virus-specific reads were sorted by genomic coordinate. Strand-specific coverage of each base in the reference sequence was quantified and base coverage values for the seven infected mouse samples were normalized for the total number of PR8-specific reads in the respective sample and displayed as base coverage per thousand reads. For each position in the PR8 genome, the mean and 95% CI of the normalized coverage of the vRNA were calculated and are displayed as black and red, respectively. Nucleotide position is counted from the 5â€™ end of the vRNA.</p>
