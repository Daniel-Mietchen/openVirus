  <title>Evaluation of total and PR8-specific reads in infected and mock-infected mice.</title>
  <p>(A) Total small RNA reads detected in mock-infected and infected mouse lungs. Lung samples were taken at two days post infection with influenza A virus PR8. Small RNAs were purified and sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx system. The infected mouse group contained two replicates from each mouse strain (129, CAST, PWK, WSB) and the mock-infected group contained a single sample from each mouse strain. Groups were compared with a Mann-Whitney test. (B) Percentage of influenza virus-specific reads in each mouse group. Adaptor-trimmed reads mapping uniquely to the PR8 genome are shown as a percentage of total RNA reads. Mock-infected and infected groups were compared with a Mann-Whitney test. The data are presented in a box-and-whiskers plot that uses the centerline to indicate median, the box to indicate quartiles, and the whiskers to indicate range.</p>
