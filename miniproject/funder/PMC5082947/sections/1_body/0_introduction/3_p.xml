<p>The switch from translation to replication during infection is in part regulated by small viral RNAs (svRNAs) 22–27 nucleotides in length [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. svRNAs are derived from the 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of each influenza virus vRNA segment [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], highly conserved regions that also function in genome packaging [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and polyadenylation [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is composed of three subunits: the basic proteins PB1, involved in elongation, PB2, involved in cap binding, and the acidic protein, PA. svRNA biases the RdRp of the virus toward replication in a segment-specific manner by associating with the RNA-binding cleft of the polymerase acidic protein (PA) in the polymerase complex [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Once in the cleft, the svRNA interacts with the cRNA that matches its segment of origin, and this interaction allows the RdRp to synthesize complete vRNA copies of that segment [
