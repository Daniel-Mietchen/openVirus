<p>The influenza virus genome is organized into eight single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) segments of negative polarity that code for 11 genes [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After adsorption and entry into the nucleus of the host cell, the genomic viral ssRNA (vRNA) is used as a template to synthesize ssRNA of positive polarity: either messenger RNAs (mRNA) for translation, or full length complementary copies (cRNA) used as intermediates to produce more vRNA (3). The virus alternates between making mRNA and cRNA, ultimately generating either viral proteins or additional progeny virions.
