<p>Although the presence and function of svRNAs have been studied using multiple different influenza virus strains in cell lines [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], their generation has not yet been reported in an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Additionally, unlike other non-retroviral ssRNA viruses, the influenza virus replicates in the host nucleus and is exposed to host nuclear mRNA processing factors, potentially producing other small RNA species during the course of infection. Although the data necessary to explore the question of 
 <italic>viral</italic> miRNA production 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> have existed for years, transcriptome sequencing focused on 
 <italic>host</italic> miRNA responses to influenza infection. Here, we repurposed publically accessible small RNA transcriptome data from influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8)-infected mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to assess small RNA and svRNA produced by the influenza virus during infection. In addition to establishing that influenza-specific small RNA and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> production of svRNA could be detected amongst the mouse transcriptome reads, we also found strong support for the svRNA findings produced by cell culture models, as well as additional results apparently unique to the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> environment.
