<p>Although svRNA enrichment explained the 26 nt peak in the influenza small RNA profile, svRNA reads composed only 1.4% of the 23 nt reads, and therefore does not account for the second peak observed at 23 nt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165729.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Across all samples, 24.5% of the 23 nt reads mapped to a region corresponding to the terminal nucleotides in the 3’ UTR of the segment 3 (PA) vRNA strand; this particular sequence is dramatically overrepresented amongst 23 nt reads (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; chi square test). Its abundance is 33-fold higher than the next most represented sequence, and 42-fold higher than the most abundant svRNA sequence in the peak. Though sometimes mapped as a part of longer reads derived from the same region, the terminal 3’ end of the segment 3 vRNA strand was identified specifically as a 23 nt sequencing read approximately 40% of the time; a highly nonrandom occurrence (chi square test; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) that indicates a preference for cleavage to this particular length and region. Approximately 5% of the reads in the 23 nt peak are derived from the vRNA 3’ UTR from segments 2 and 6; these sequences are also overrepresented amongst 23 nt reads (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Whereas the 26 nt peak can be attributed to an overrepresentation of reads from the 5’ UTR of the vRNA, the 23 nt peak is derived from an abundance of reads from the 3’ UTR of the vRNA.
