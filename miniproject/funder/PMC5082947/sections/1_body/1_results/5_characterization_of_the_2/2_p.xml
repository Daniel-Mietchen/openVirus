<p>Although levels of 3’UTR vRNA from segment 3 are high, abundance of the specifically derived 23 nt species did not correlate with mouse infection susceptibility (p = 0.83). We hypothesized that this species could be a previously undetected short RNA that serves a function during influenza infection. Given that 23 nt is close to the ~22 nt size described for miRNA [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we speculate that this small RNA may modulate translational repression of specific and relevant host proteins. In order to understand what processes this small RNA might affect if it does in fact behave as a miRNA, we predicted miRNA targets for the 23 nt sequence using three methods: miRDB [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], TargetScan 5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and DIANA MR-microT [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thirty-three genes were agreed upon as targets by at least two of the three methods (

 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Considering that the part of the putative miRNA essential for binding to the target mRNA (the seed region) is highly dissimilar to the seed regions from equivalent 3’ UTR 23 nt sequences on the other vRNA segments (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0165729.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), the overrepresentation of segment 3 in particular indicates that specific downregulation of these genes may be beneficial to viral activity.
