<p>The read length distribution of the virus-specific small RNA reads (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165729.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) revealed two peaks at 23 and 26 nt, both of which fall within the 22â€“27 nt range for svRNA described in Perez 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast to the influenza-derived small RNA reads, the length distribution of mouse-derived small RNA reads from mock-infected mice revealed only a single peak at 22 nt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165729.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that the overall profiles of influenza and mouse small RNA species are distinct. The mouse-derived small RNA peak that we identified at 22 nt is consistent with the original analysis performed on these hosts (see S1 Fig of Peng 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2011) [
