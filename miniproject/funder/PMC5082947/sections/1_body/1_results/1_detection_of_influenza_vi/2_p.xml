<p>The dataset consisted of approximately 219 million adaptor-trimmed reads sized 15â€“53 nucleotides (nt), corresponding to an average of 18 million reads per sample. Strand information of the reads was preserved. The total number of small RNA reads did not differ significantly between the infected and mock-infected mice (Mann-Whitney test; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.42, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165729.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), indicating that preparation and isolation of small RNA was similarly efficient in all samples. We mapped the RNA reads for each sample to the mouse reference genome C57BL/6J and to the PR8 influenza virus genome. Reads mapping exclusively to the PR8 genome were considered high-confidence influenza virus reads and all subsequent analyses are based on these reads.
