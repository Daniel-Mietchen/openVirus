<p>To search for potential small RNAs produced by PR8 during infection, we obtained the small RNA transcriptome data produced by Peng

 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], with influenza virus strain PR8. Lungs from twelve mice in total were collected for small RNA transcriptome sequencing at two days post infection, producing data from two infected mice and one mock-infected mouse available per strain.
