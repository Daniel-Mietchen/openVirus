<p>The four mouse strains used in the experiments of Peng 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (129, CAST, PWK, WSB) were chosen because they represent a wide range of susceptibility to infection with PR8 [

 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We found that the percentage of svRNA in the PR8-specific reads correlated significantly to the Mouse Phenome Database "susceptibility" phenotype of the mouse strains to influenza virus infection (

 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with more resistant mouse strains having a higher svRNA fraction in their PR8-specific reads. The Pearson’s linear correlation of this relationship was 0.9565 [0.7273 to 0.9938; 95% confidence interval (CI)], with an associated coefficient of determination indicating that &gt;91% of the differences in svRNA burden amongst different mice can be linked to the susceptibility of the mouse strain to influenza virus infection. svRNA that is specifically 26 nt in length, and the main component of the influenza-derived read peak seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165729.g002">Fig 2</xref>, is also significantly correlated to susceptibility (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.70;

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.12; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.45). These data demonstrate that svRNA in particular, rather than influenza small RNA in general, exhibits a strong relationship with the influenza susceptibility phenotype.
