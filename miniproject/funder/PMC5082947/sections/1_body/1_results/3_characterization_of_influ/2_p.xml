<p>The vast majority of svRNA (96.7%) mapped to segments 1, 2, 3, and 6 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165729.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This result indicates that these reads are unlikely to be random breakdown fragments of longer RNAs from the same segment and that the overrepresentation of svRNA from certain segments is unlikely to be from the virion inocula.
