<p>RPRD1A, the second highest ranked target predicted by miRDB, binds to RNA polymerase II and participates in the dephosphorylation of key residues in its CTD region, thus allowing for the transition from transcription initiation to elongation [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. TCEA1, also known as TFIIS, not only independently facilitates transcription elongation but also directly binds and demonstrates synergy with PAF1, a known target of the influenza virus NS1 protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. CDC40 is responsible for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing, in which the 3â€™ splice site is cleaved and the exons are joined to create a mature mRNA [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Repression of this gene could mimic the effect of NS1 by targeting the catalytic step of pre-mRNA processing directly and causing the retention of cellular pre-mRNAs in the host cell nucleus.
