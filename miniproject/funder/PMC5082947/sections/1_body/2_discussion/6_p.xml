<p>Further study is necessary to determine whether this small 23 nt RNA behaves in a miRNA-like fashion, but computationally it is predicted to influence the host immune response by mimicking some of the actions of the viral NS1 protein. Amongst its diverse strategies for antagonizing host immunity, the NS1 protein inhibits transcriptional elongation by binding to PAF1, causing a PAF1 deficiency at transcriptional end sites and resulting in selective inhibition of antiviral gene expression [

Inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing is also accomplished by NS1 associating with the spliceosomes and blocking subsequent catalytic steps of splicing; cellular pre-mRNAs can then be accessed by the viral cap-dependent endonuclease to produce the capped primers required for viral mRNA synthesis [
