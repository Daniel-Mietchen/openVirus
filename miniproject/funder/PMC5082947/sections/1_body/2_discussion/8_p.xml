<p>Although the functions of this small RNA must remain speculative, a virally derived miRNA could affect multiple aspects of infection physiology. The sequencing protocol used to produce the data for this study was limited to RNAs &lt; 54 nt in length and with 3’OH and 5’ modifications such as those processed by Dicer and Drosha; we are thus unable to assess the relationship between the levels of the small 23 nt RNA and the expression of its putative targets. Pairing small RNA sequencing with an approach to capture host gene expression changes would be an important next step.</p>
