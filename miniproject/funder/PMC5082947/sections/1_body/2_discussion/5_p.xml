<p>In addition to providing an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> comparison for previous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, we also uncovered results unique to the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> environment. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data linked svRNA burden and host susceptibility, a relationship that could not be detected in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. This strong linear relationship may relate the timing and frequency of transcription to replication switching to the pressures exerted by the host immune system. Whether the host or the influenza virus is directly responsible for the mechanism producing the elevated svRNA levels is not known. Perhaps resistance of the specific mouse strain to viral infection drives extended viral replication to maintain its presence in the host leading to elevated svRNA levels. Though beyond the scope of the repurposed data, this possibility warrants further exploration. Furthermore, whereas Umbach 
 <italic>et al</italic>. noted a modest enrichment for reads originating from the 3’ end of the vRNA in the PR8 infection of cell culture [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the abundance of 23 nt reads derived from the 3’ UTR vRNA we found is apparently specific to the mouse infection environment.
