<p>Our findings support a number of hypotheses put forth based on previous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> work. First, the small RNA transcriptomes of infected 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> lung samples, harvested at a time point twelve hours later than any 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment, confirm that svRNA production continues late into the infection process. Curiously, the predominant length of svRNA detected 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, 26 nt, is different from the predominant lengths reported 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by Perez 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (25 nt and 27 nt) [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Umbach 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (19, 21, and 22 nt) [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In both these earlier reports, as well as ours, substantial variation in svRNA length within datasets is interpreted to indicate that svRNA production is a somewhat stochastic process. Stochasticity may also contribute to heterogeneity across datasets, although factors such as influenza virus strain [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and method used to determine svRNA length [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] seem to affect the reported length as well. In this particular case, the later time point in the infection process and the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> environment are also plausible explanations for the length differences.
