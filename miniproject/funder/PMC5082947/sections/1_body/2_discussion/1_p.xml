 <italic>In vitro</italic>, influenza virus svRNA is generated abundantly at the transition from viral transcription to replication [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Infection by multiple influenza A virus subtypes in cell lines derived from multiple mammalian species can produce svRNA [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ours is the first report of the production of influenza virus svRNA
