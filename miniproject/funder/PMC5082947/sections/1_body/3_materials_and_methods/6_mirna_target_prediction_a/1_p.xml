<p>miRNA target prediction was performed by miRDB [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], TargetScan 5 Custom [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and DIANA MR-microT [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Targets that were detected by at least two of the three prediction methods were considered to be of interest. For miRDB and DIANA MR-microT, which report reliability scores for the targets on a continuous scale, thresholds for detection were set as score &gt; 80 for miRDB (as recommended by the miRDB server), and as positive predictive value &gt; 0.8 for DIANA MR-microT. Hypergeometric gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the miRNA target predictions against Pathway Commons was performed by WebGestalt [
