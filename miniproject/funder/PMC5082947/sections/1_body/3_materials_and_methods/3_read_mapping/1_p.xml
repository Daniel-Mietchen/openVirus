<p>The remaining short RNA reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10, Dec 2011, GRCm38, reference strain C57BL/6J) with Bowtie2 v2.1.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] using the ‘—very-sensitive’ setting. Reads that did not align to the mouse reference genome were subsequently aligned to the influenza virus PR8 reference genome (GenBank accession no. AF389115 to AF389115), again using the ‘—very-sensitive’ setting to identify influenza virus-specific reads.
