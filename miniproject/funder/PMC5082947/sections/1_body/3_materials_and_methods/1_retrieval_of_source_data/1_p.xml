 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In summary, ten-week-old mice of four different strains (129, WSB, PWK, and CAST) were infected intranasally with either phosphate-buffered saline or with 500 PFU of influenza A virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1; PR8). The small RNA transcriptome was sequenced two days post-infection for twelve mice total; two PR8-infected lung samples from each mouse strain as well as one control mouse lung sample from each strain mock-infected with saline were processed. This sequencing process preserved the strand information of the resulting reads. Raw sra files of the small RNA transcriptomes obtained by Peng

 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession identifier GSE36971. Source data regarding influenza virus (H1N1; PR8) susceptibility values (based on multiple experimental findings) for the mouse strains used in the experiments were obtained though the Mouse Phenome Database [
