<p>Sam files of influenza virus-specific reads were converted to bam format and sorted by coordinate using the Picard tools package (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://picard.sourceforge.net</ext-link>). Strand-specific coverage of each base in the reference sequence was quantified using the BEDTools suite [
 <xref rid="pone.0165729.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Base coverage values for the infected mouse samples were normalized for the amount of total coverage in the respective sample. For each position in the PR8 genome, the mean and 95% CI of the normalized coverage were calculated using Prism 6 software.
