<p>In two time periods, cross-correlations were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation, with a time lag range of ± 30 weeks, with Bonferroni’s correction. Cross-correlation allows the time lag between two time series to be identified [

Time-series for ILI, Total INF, INF A, and INF B in the U.S. as reference were analyzed with the Total INF, Total INF, INF A, and INF B, respectively, in the comparison country using cross-correlation. For example, ILI in the U.S. was compared to Total INF in each comparison country. Moreover, cross-correlation analysis was also performed on the GT and temperature data. We selected countries with a time lag between -20 and -30 weeks and a correlation coefficient of 0.7 or more in
