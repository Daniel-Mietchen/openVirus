<p>Forecasting seasonal influenza after 26 weeks was defined as forecasting influenza pattern after six months (26 weeks) with data available only at the current point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220423.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Four seasons for 2015–2019 were selected to validate the prediction models for seasonal influenza patterns. This is done because the training set accounted for 50% of eight seasons in the whole dataset for 2010–2018. For example, the prediction model for the seasonal influenza pattern during 2015–2016 used the influenza surveillance data from the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2010 to the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2015 as the training set (
