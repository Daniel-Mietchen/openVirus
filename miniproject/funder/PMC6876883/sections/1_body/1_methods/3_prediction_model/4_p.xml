<p>Prediction models of LR were calculated to forecast influenza surveillance after 26 weeks in the U.S. per each year. The influenza time series is characterized by an autocorrelation, so we also employed the ARIMAX. The autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function is used to determine the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MR) order. An ARIMA model is notated as ARIMA (
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>q</italic>), where 
 <italic>p</italic> indicates the AR order, 
 <italic>d</italic> the differencing order and 
 <italic>q</italic> the MA order [
