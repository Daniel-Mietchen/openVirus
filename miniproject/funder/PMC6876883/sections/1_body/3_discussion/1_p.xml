<p>The aim of this study was to identify countries with seasonal patterns and influenza outbreaks that were similar to but preceded those of the United States. We used influenza activities in Australia and Chile, GT with the keyword “influenza A virus” in Australia and Chile, and temperature in the U.S. to forecast for seasonal influenza after 26 weeks in the U.S. The seasonal influenza patterns in Australia before 22 weeks and Chile before 28 weeks showed a high correlation with those of the U.S. In 
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, influenza surveillance and GT in Australia and Chile at present were more useful than previous seasonal influenza in the U.S. for forecasting next seasonal influenza in the U.S. ANN models showed better performance for forecasting influenza activities after 26 weeks in the U.S than previous season data. The LR and ARIMAX models also showed high performance which can be interpretable. Our prediction models forecast that the ILI for the U.S. in 2018–2019 may be later and less severe than that in 2017–2018.
