<p>A study of Bedford 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the less-frequent global movement of INF A/H1N1 and B viruses coincided with slower rates of antigenic evolution, lower ages of infection, and smaller, less-frequent epidemics than for A/H3N2 viruses [

 <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that differences in ages of infection could explain patterns of global circulation across a variety of human viruses [
