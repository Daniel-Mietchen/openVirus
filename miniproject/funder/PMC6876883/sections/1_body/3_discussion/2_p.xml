<p>The seasonal influenza patterns in the U.S. were highly correlated with those in Canada, Australia, Chile, and the United Kingdom. The correlation coefficients for these countries were higher than those for their neighboring countries or for other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, Mexico (0.412 for Total INF), Russia (0.329), Cuba (0.121), Spain (0.775), and Japan (0.600), which are not shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Moreover, the period of the primary influenza peak in the Southern Hemisphere countries was July and August [
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], so the absolute values of the time lag for the U.S. in the Southern Hemisphere countries were more than 20 weeks in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. However, the correlation coefficients for Argentina, Australia, Chile, and Uruguay with similar latitudes were different, at 0.516, 0.892, 0.778, and 0.303 for Total INF in the U.S., respectively, which are not shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220423.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For these reasons, the correlations for seasonal influenza between countries could be caused by characteristics of influenza, Economic Status, Educational Status, or Access to Health Care as well as by Season environmental factors in the Northern Hemisphere [

 <xref rid="pone.0220423.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, this study did not prove the causality of correlations for seasonal influenza between countries. Although we do not know the reasons, the patterns for seasonal influenza in the U.S., Australia, and Chile were similar, and influenza surveillance in Australia and Chile can be used to predict seasonal influenza outbreaks after 26 week in the U.S.
