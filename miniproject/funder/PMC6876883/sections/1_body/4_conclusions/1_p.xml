<p>Our study forecasts the 2018â€“2019 seasonal influenza after 26 weeks in the U.S. using the 2018 seasonal influenza in Australia and Chile. The correlation between the seasonal influenza patterns in the U.S., Australia, and Chile could be used to forecast the next seasonal influenza pattern, which can help to determine influenza vaccine strategy approximately six months ahead in the U.S. Our prediction model allows to estimate peak timing, peak intensity, and type-specific influenza activities for next season at 40
 <sup>th</sup> week.
