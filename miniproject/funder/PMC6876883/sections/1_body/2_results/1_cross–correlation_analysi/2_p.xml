<p>In the analysis of the ILI and Total INF, the correlation coefficients of Australia were 0.861 with a -22 week lag and 0.892 with a -22 week lag, respectively. Chile had the third highest correlation coefficient of 0.803 (p = 6.82 ⅹ 10
 <sup>−89</sup>) with a -28 week time lag for the INF A. However, the correlation coefficients of Australia for the INF B were 0.792 with a -25 week lag, which is much lower than that for the INF A. Moreover, the correlations for the INF B in such European countries as Norway, Sweden, Croatia, and the UK were higher than those of Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. We selected Australia and Chile to forecast ILI, Total INF and INF A after 26 weeks in the U.S., and Australia was selected for INF B.
