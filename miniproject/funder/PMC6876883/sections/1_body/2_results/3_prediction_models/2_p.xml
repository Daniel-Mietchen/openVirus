 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220423.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows the prediction of ANN for ILI, Total INF, INF A, and INF B from the 41
 <sup>st</sup> week in 2015 to the 14
 <sup>th</sup> week in 2019 in the U.S. using temperature in the U.S., surveillance data, and GT in Australia and Chile. Moreover, the forecast prediction by ARIMAX for type-specific influenza activities in the U.S. (blue line) and the 95% confidence interval (light blue bar) indicate the forecast uncertainty, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220423.g007">Fig 7</xref>. The pattern of peak timing and amplitude of influenza activity for the 2015–2016 season was different from the 2012–2015 season, but our models forecasted later and less severe influenza activity. Moreover, the predicted INF B activity for the 2018–2019 season was a better match than the increasing pattern for the 2013–2018 seasons.
