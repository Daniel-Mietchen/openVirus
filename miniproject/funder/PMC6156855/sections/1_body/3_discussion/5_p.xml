<p id="Par29">Unfortunately we were unable to sequence 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> DNA from any of the episodes of syphilis included. We were thus unable to establish genotypically if the repeat syphilis was due to reinfection or reactivation as has been done in other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Given the high rates of partner change, low rates of condom usage and high syphilis incidence in this cohort [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] it is however likely that most if not all the repeat episodes are due to reinfections. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the episodes of repeat syphilis are due to reactivation rather than reinfection. Relapse syphilis may be characterized by a different immunological response to reinfection syphilis and this may influence our results. This misclassification bias would however be expected to bias the results towards the null-hypothesis.
