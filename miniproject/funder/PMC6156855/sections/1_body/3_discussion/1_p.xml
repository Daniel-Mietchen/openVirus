<p id="Par25">A diagnosis of syphilis in humans and animal models is typically characterized by elevations in both plasma pro-inflammatory (TNFα, IFNγ, CCL4, IP-10) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This immunological profile however varies according to a number of parameters including stage of syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], HIV-infection status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and the number of previous episodes of syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our study is the first that we are aware of that has been able to assess the immune profile of the same individuals at the time of reinfection.
