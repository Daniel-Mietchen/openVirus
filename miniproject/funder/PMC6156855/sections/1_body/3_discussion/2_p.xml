<p id="Par26">Our study is weakened by the small number included and the fact that only one of the 11 baseline episodes of syphilis was a confirmed initial episode of syphilis. Larger studies would be required to be able to conduct multivariable analyses to control for the role of confounders such as stage of syphilis, number of episodes of syphilis, time between episodes of syphilis and HIV status. With a sample size of only 11 we deemed the risk of type II errors too large to warrant conducting multivariable analyses. As a result we cannot exclude the possibility that our results are due to confounding. Nonetheless our results are commensurate with the thesis that repeat syphilis presents with an attenuated immune response. The individual with an initial syphilis at study inclusion had a more pronounced elevation in IL-10, IFNÎ±, CCL4 and IP-10 than the individuals with repeat syphilis. His second episode of syphilis was also clinically less dramatic and characterized by little or no elevation in plasma cytokines (compared to his 6-month levels). Furthermore, shortly after completing the 24-month follow-up period (and therefore not included in this study) this individual had a third episode of syphilis which was asymptomatic.</p>
