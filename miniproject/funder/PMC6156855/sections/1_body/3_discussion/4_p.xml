<p id="Par28">In a similar vein, our study builds on the findings of other contemporary studies which suggest a need to rethink the syphilis staging system used in settings such as ours where repeat syphilis constitutes an increasing proportion of all syphilis infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In a study of individuals with four or more episodes of syphilis from our center, for example, we found a step-wise increase in the proportion diagnosed with latent (asymptomatic) syphilis with increasing numbers of episodes of syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similarly, in this study we found that 7 of the 11 episodes of repeat syphilis were latent syphilis. This classification was based on the fact that these 7 episodes were asymptomatic. The traditional staging system of syphilis typically depicts syphilis as progressing from primary to secondary and then early and late latent syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A large proportion of our patients with repeat syphilis do not develop symptoms of syphilis and thus classified as latent syphilis. This is likely due to the attenuated immune response to repeat syphilis and not reflective of a longer duration of infection as would be the case in initial episodes of latent syphilis. Future studies could explore this issue further by assessing if there are clinical, immunological, pathogen and pathological differences between individuals with early and late latent syphilis diagnosed during a first compared to a fourth (or higher) episode of syphilis. Consideration could be given to classifying latent syphilis in individuals with multiple previous episodes of syphilis as latent-repeat syphilis [
