<p id="Par15">A striking feature of the current epidemics of syphilis in high-income countries is the increasing proportion of cases of syphilis that are repeat episodes of syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These infections occur predominantly in men who have sex with men (MSM) with high rates of partner change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is growing recognition that part of the difficulty with controlling these epidemics is the fact that repeat syphilis is less likely to present with symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As a result, persons with repeat syphilis may have delayed diagnoses and be more likely to transmit syphilis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. At our medical centre in Antwerp, Belgium, reinfections now constitute approximately half of all syphilis infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In a study that followed up 120 patients with a new diagnosis of syphilis over a 12-month period we previously confirmed that repeat syphilis was not only less likely to be symptomatic than initial syphilis but also had an altered immune profile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These differences included variations in the magnitude and decay curves of rapid plasma reagin (RPR) as well as repeaters being less likely to have elevated plasma interleukin (IL)-10. These differences in plasma IL-10 persisted at 6-month follow-up such that those with initial but not those with repeat syphilis had higher levels of IL-10 than the control group. While following up this cohort for a 24-month period a total of 11 individuals had a further repeat episode of syphilis. This manuscript compares the immune responses of these 11 repeat episodes with the paired baseline episodes.
