<p id="Par23">Comparing to their baseline infections, paired analyses of the 11 individuals with reinfections during follow-up revealed that these reinfections had lower concentrations of IFNα (0.8 [IQR 0.8–0.8] vs. 12.2 [IQR 1.6–24.2], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) and CCL4 (0.9 [IQR 0.9–12.2 vs. 17.5 [IQR 4.9–32.8], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022]; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). These associations remained after excluding the individual whose baseline infection was his first (initial) episode of syphilis. In general, there was a decline in cyto- and chemokines between baseline and 6-month visit with little or no increase at the time of reinfection (Fig.
