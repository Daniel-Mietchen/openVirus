<p id="Par22">For 10 of these individuals, this represented at least their third episode of syphilis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The 11th individual was the only one to present with an initial episode of syphilis. His first episode of syphilis was characterized by a diffuse maculopapular rash and a RPR titre of 1/32. He had tested TPA and RPR negative 6 months prior. He received 2.4MU BPG via intramuscular injection and his RPR titre declined to 1/4 at 3 months. At nine months following condomless sex, he presented with a less pronounced maculopapular rash and an RPR titre rise to 1/32. Of the 11 individuals, his baseline syphilis contained the highest or second highest levels of IL-10, IFNα, CCL4 and IP-10 (Participant 11, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At the time of his reinfection his cytokine levels did not attain the levels of his initial infection (Fig.
