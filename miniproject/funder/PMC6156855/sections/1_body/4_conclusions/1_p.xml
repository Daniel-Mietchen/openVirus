<p id="Par30">This study makes a small contribution to the growing evidence that the clinical and immunological presentation of repeat syphilis is more attenuated than initial syphilis. This is of considerable clinical and public health consequence. It is important that both clinicians and patients are aware of this as it provides extra motivation for periodic serological screening in persons who have had a diagnosis of syphilis. These individuals are not only at a considerably higher risk of syphilis than the general population, their subsequent syphilis is also more likely to be asymptomatic and serological screening may be the only way to diagnose this syphilis episode in a timeous fashion.</p>
