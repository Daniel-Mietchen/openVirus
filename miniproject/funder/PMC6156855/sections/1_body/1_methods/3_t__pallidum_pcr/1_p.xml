<p id="Par18">An in-house real time PCR targeting 
 <italic>polA</italic> was used to detect 
 <italic>T. pallidum</italic> DNA in serum. DNA was extracted from 400 μL serum using the custom-plasma program of the Abbott m2000sp automated extraction platform (Abbott, Maidenhead, UK), according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The extracted DNA was eluated in 100 μL eluate solution. The 25 μL PCR mixture contained Platinum® Quantitative PCR SuperMix-Uracil DNA Glycosylase (Invitrogen by life technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) 0.9 μM forward primer TP-1, 0.9 μM reverse primer TP-2,0.14 μM probe TP-3 (Integrated DNA technologies, Leuven, Belgium) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 10 μL DNA extract. The amplifications were performed using the Rotor Gene 6000 (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) and included 45 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C followed by 45 s at 60 °C per cycle.
