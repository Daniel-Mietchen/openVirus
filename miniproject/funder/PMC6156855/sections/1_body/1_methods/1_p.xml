<p id="Par16">The Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine and the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Antwerp approved this study (13/44/426). All study participants provided written informed consent.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Repeat syphilis, which included syphilis repeat infections and reactivations, was defined as an episode in a person who had a ≥ 4 increase in RPR titre after a previous diagnosis of syphilis who exhibited an appropriate response to therapy, defined as a ≥ 4-fold decrease in RPR titre. All patients were assessed according to a standardized protocol that collected detailed information about sexual behavior, clinical features and laboratory tests. Patients were followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months and at any other time if they developed symptoms or signs of syphilis. Patient clinical and laboratory characteristics were recorded at each consultation. Blood was drawn into plain and EDTA-coated tubes (Sarstedt Monovette, Nümbrecht, Germany) and centrifuged at 2000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at ambient temperature. Serum and plasma was stored at − 20 °C (plain) and − 80 °C (plasma), respectively. Samples were processed and frozen within 3 h of acquisition.
