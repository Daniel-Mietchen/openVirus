<p>Although clients with low baseline CD4 counts are at increased risk of death, mortality rates have decreased in recent years of the ART programme in this and other studies.

 </sup> Overall mortality in South Africa has declined in recent years

  <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 </sup> and the gains in life expectancy have been largely attributed to a decline in HIV-related mortality rates.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
 </sup> This decline can be ascribed to improved accessibility to HIV services with the implementation of nurse-managed care,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
 </sup> as well as improved quality of care because of enhanced drug regimens. This study demonstrated significantly lower mortality among clients with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> who initiated ART in more recent years when an FDC was in use compared to those initiating treatment in previous years, with the highest mortality in years when guidelines recommended the use of stavudine which has a relatively unfavourable toxicity profile.

 </sup> Antiretroviral therapy using an FDC has been shown in a European study to improve both adherence and quality of life of HIV-infected patients, while maintaining virological and immunologic efficacy.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
 </sup> In general, the simplification of ART with an FDC is associated with improved adherence because of decreased pill burden, reduced risk of resistance owing to the inability of patients to take partial regimens, reduced risk of treatment or prescription errors and lower risk of hospitalisation,

  <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
  <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 </sup> supporting the assertion that FDCs may contribute to reduced mortality rates. However, in the context of overall ART programme performance, it is important to note that LTFU appears to be increasing in more recent years, possibly because of the expansion of treatment programmes in the absence of sufficient resources.
 <sup>

 </sup> It is important that overall programme performance is monitored in order to minimise LTFU and the knock-on effect that this could have on mortality.
