<p>Mortality was found to be significantly higher in clients with baseline CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> compared to those with higher CD4 counts, as has been well established in South Africa and other settings.

 </sup> Interestingly, it has been shown that standardised mortality rates which take background mortality into account are similar for all CD4 strata by 4 years after ART initiation, suggesting that baseline immunological status impacts mortality primarily at shorter durations of ART.

 </sup> It is specifically at these early time periods after ART initiation that there is a notably high mortality rate, as has been demonstrated in this study, specifically among clients with baseline CD4 counts &lt;200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>. Other studies in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa have similarly demonstrated high mortality rates in the first year after starting ART, with up to 26% of patients dying in the first year of treatment.

 </sup> There is a strong association between early mortality and the degree of immunodeficiency at ART start; therefore, strategies to reduce mortality must address ‘up-stream’ entry points into the treatment cascade, including earlier diagnosis of HIV and improved longitudinal care pre-ART.
