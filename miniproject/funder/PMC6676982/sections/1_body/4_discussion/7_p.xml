<p>This study demonstrated the rich source of data available in TIER.Net. The analysis was performed using data spanning over a decade during which there were substantial guideline changes in the ART programme, producing a robust and realistic analysis. On the other hand, this study has a number of limitations. Firstly, TIER.Net was introduced in South Africa in 2010, necessitating the back-capture of data from the ART programme prior to this time. There may have been challenges with the quality of the back-captured data, which may have led to an underestimation of the absolute numbers of clients on ART, including those who died, although we believe that the proportions are representative. Secondly, not all clients in TIER.Net could be included in the analysis because of missing baseline CD4 counts. Thirdly, the study was not designed to follow up clients who were LTFU from the ART programme and it is therefore unclear how many of these clients died. The Kaplanâ€“Meier analyses may therefore underestimate mortality. Finally, although these data are representative of urban and rural areas in South Africa, they should be generalised to other settings with caution, particularly because only two districts were included in the analysis.</p>
