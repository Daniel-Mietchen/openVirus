<p>This study of routine TIER.Net data demonstrates an increase in mean and median baseline CD4 counts over time, in line with South African guidelines that have repeatedly raised the CD4 cut-off for ART initiation

 </sup> However, the improvement in these population measures is masking a high-risk group of clients with low CD4 counts who only initiate treatment once they have advanced HIV disease. Although the proportion of clients initiating ART with CD4 counts &lt; 100 and &lt; 200 cell/mm
 <sup>3</sup> declined in the initial years of the ART programme, as has been previously demonstrated from 2001 to 2012,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
 </sup> there has been little change in recent years, with the proportion of clients with low baseline CD4 counts remaining concerningly high. This is unexpected in the context of UTT, but it confirms findings from a recent South African study of laboratory data which also noted little change in the proportion of adult clients initiating ART with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> between 2012 and 2016, ranging from 32.9% to 34.8% nationally.

 </sup> This is also a challenge in other low- and middle-income countries, with over 30% of clients initiating treatment with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> despite generally widespread availability of ART.

 </sup> These clients, who may either be ART-na√Øve or may have previously defaulted from the ART programme, represent a considerable burden of increased medical costs, risk of transmission and HIV morbidity.

 </sup> Interventions to address HIV incidence as well as barriers to entering care are essential.
