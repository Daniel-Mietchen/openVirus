<p>The urban and rural districts analysed in this study had comparable findings in terms of overall trends in population CD4 counts, the proportion of clients initiating ART with CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> in 2017 and characteristics of clients with low baseline CD4 counts. However, mortality was markedly higher in rural Mopani than in Johannesburg. This highlights the inferior quality of care in the rural district, likely because of poor access to doctors as has been previously described in rural settings, as well as the deficit in specialist medical care in rural provinces of South Africa.

 </sup> In addition, characteristics of rural settings, such as lower levels of formal education, are also known to be associated with higher mortality.

 </sup> efforts in rural settings need to focus on quality of care, perhaps by employing mobile units that are staffed by doctors or by providing training for primary healthcare staff.
