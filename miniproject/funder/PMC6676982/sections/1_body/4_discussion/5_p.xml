<p>An additional intervention to improve outcomes of the HIV programme is delivery of CPT to high-risk clients presenting for HIV care with low baseline CD4 counts, as recommended by the WHO.

 </sup> It has been well established that CPT significantly reduces mortality in clients with low baseline CD4 counts,

 </sup> and it is therefore concerning that delivery of this intervention appears to be declining over time, possibly reflecting competing demands on healthcare providers as the ART programme expands. Interestingly, a consistently higher proportion of clients with WHO stage III or IV disease received CPT compared to clients presenting with WHO stage I or II disease, indicating that healthcare providers are more likely to give CPT to clients who appear ill. This is concerning, as clients with immunosuppression who require CPT may not present with advanced disease, as seen in this and other studies,

 </sup> and delivery of CPT may therefore be missed in these clients. This is likely exacerbated in the era of UTT, as baseline CD4 counts which would alert healthcare providers to the need for CPT are not required at the time of ART initiation; delivery of CPT therefore relies on the healthcare provider later checking the CD4 results and subsequently initiating CPT if required, increasing the chance that CPT may be overlooked. Interventions to increase awareness of the importance of baseline CD4 testing and delivery of CPT to clients with low baseline CD4 counts and/or advanced clinical disease are warranted.
