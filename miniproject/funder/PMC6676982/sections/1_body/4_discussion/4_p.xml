<p>To improve outcomes of the HIV programme, interventions should focus on clients most likely to present late for HIV care, including, as expected, clients with advanced clinical stage of HIV disease and those in hospitals. Interventions such as community-based strategies or home-based HIV testing should also target men,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
  <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
 </sup> in agreement with previous studies in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries which demonstrate late presentation of men for both HIV diagnosis and treatment.

  <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
  <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
 </sup> This delayed health seeking may contribute to the growing gap between male and female life expectancy, which has doubled from 2003 to 2011.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
 </sup> Reasons for the disparity are likely to include reluctance of men to seek HIV care because of attitudinal barriers, HIV stigma, perceptions of masculinity and cultural practices,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
  <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
 </sup> as well as the scale-up of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
 </sup> which have increasingly engaged women in care. This study found that a higher proportion of pregnant women aged 15–50 years had baseline CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> compared to women who were not pregnant during ART initiation, suggesting that PMTCT services play a role in linking women to timely HIV treatment. This is supported by findings of an association between PMTCT services and higher cohort median CD4 count, as well as reduced risk of ART initiation with advanced disease.

  <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
 </sup> In addition, late presentation for ART initiation was found to be linked with older age in this study. Mixed findings regarding the association between age and late presentation for care have been reported in the literature, with one study finding no significant association,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
 </sup> others finding a decreased risk of late presentation for HIV care in older clients
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
  <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
 </sup> and yet others demonstrating an increased risk of initiating ART with low CD4 in older clients.

  <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
  <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
 </sup> The finding of this study that older age is linked to late presentation for care is supported by a recent study of South Africans aged over 50 years who reported seeking HIV testing only once they were symptomatic and referred by a provider or if a partner was diagnosed as infected.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
 </sup> Furthermore, older men in sub-Saharan Africa have been found to be less aware of and knowledgeable about HIV prevention compared to younger men, with increased risk behaviours in some settings.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
 </sup> Educational initiatives and HIV testing strategies that focus on men and the older population are thus required.
