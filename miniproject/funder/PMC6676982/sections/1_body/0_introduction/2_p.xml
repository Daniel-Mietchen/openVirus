<p>South Africa’s ART programme has evolved over time to accommodate increasing numbers of HIV-infected clients and to provide improved care and treatment services (

 </sup> This has encompassed expansion of the ART eligibility criteria from clients with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> in 2004
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
 </sup> to universal test and treat (UTT) in 2016,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
 </sup> as well as a shift from doctor- to nurse-managed care and decentralisation of ART services from hospitals to primary healthcare sites.

 </sup> Across all years, cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) has been recommended for clients with baseline CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> as a means of protecting against infections and thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.

 </sup> Triple-therapy antiretroviral drug regimens have also been updated over time, from combination single formulation regimens including stavudine in 2004

 </sup> and tenofovir in 2010
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 </sup> to a fixed-dose combination (FDC), a single tablet containing three antiretroviral drugs (tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz), in 2013.

 </sup> As the ART programme has evolved and expanded, it has become increasingly important to have an effective monitoring system, and in 2010 the Department of Health adopted an electronic monitoring and evaluation tool known as TIER.Net, which was developed by the University of Cape Town’s Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
 </sup> TIER.Net is used operationally to monitor baseline clinical care and client outcomes over time, providing a rich source of cross-sectional and longitudinal routine ART data.
