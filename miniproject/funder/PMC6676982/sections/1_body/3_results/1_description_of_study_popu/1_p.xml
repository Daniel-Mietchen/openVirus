<p>The Johannesburg data set comprised 340 023 records from adult clients aged 15–80 years initiating ART between 2004 and 2017. Records from 83 677 (25%) clients were excluded, as these individuals were not newly initiating ART. A further 53 178 (16%) records were excluded because of missing baseline CD4 counts. Among the remaining 203 168 records, 37 (&lt; 1%) had baseline CD4 counts above 2000 and thus were also excluded, leaving a Johannesburg data set of 203 131 records for analysis. The initial Mopani data set comprised 159 904 records from adults initiating ART between 2004 and 2017, of which 36 553 (23%) were excluded because of ART initiation in clients who were not treatment naïve and a further 21 517 (13%) were excluded because of missing baseline CD4 counts. Among the remaining 101 834 records, 20 (&lt; 1%) with baseline CD4 counts above 2000 were also excluded, leaving a Mopani data set of 101 814 records for analysis.</p>
