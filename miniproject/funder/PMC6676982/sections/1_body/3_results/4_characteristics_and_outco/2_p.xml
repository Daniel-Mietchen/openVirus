<p>Delivery of CPT at treatment initiation in 2017 was poor – in Johannesburg and Mopani, only 23% and 26% of clients with baseline CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> are documented as having received CPT, respectively (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, as expected, significantly more clients with low CD4 received CPT compared to clients with CD4 counts &gt; 200 in both districts (

 </sup> In the last 5 years (2013–2017), delivery of CPT to clients initiating ART with baseline CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> has declined in both Johannesburg and Mopani districts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, a consistently higher proportion of clients presenting with advanced disease (WHO stage III or IV) received CPT compared to those presenting with WHO stage I or II disease across all 5 years.
