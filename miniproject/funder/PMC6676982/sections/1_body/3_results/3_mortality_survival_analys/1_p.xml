<p>Mortality was significantly higher among clients who initiated ART with CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> compared to those with higher baseline CD4 counts, with 5-year death rates of 6%, 2% and 1% among clients with CD4 counts &lt; 200, 200–349 and ≥ 350 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively, in Johannesburg and 23%, 7% and 5%, respectively, for the same CD4 counts in Mopani (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">b</xref>). Early deaths immediately after ART initiation among clients with baseline CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> are clearly evident. Even in recent years (2016 and 2017), clients with baseline CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> had significantly higher mortality than those with higher CD4 counts (losses of 2.4% and 0.4% in Johannesburg and 9% and 2% in Mopani among clients with CD4 counts &lt; 200 and ≥ 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both districts)). Among clients with baseline CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, mortality was lower among those who initiated ART in recent years compared to those who initiated treatment in earlier years of the ART programme (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 for both Johannesburg and Mopani) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">d</xref>). When ART initiation years were grouped according to timing of drug changes in the South African guidelines, clients with baseline CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> who initiated treatment in years when stavudine was in use had the highest mortality in both districts, with 5-year losses of 13% in Johannesburg and 48% in Mopani (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3e</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">f</xref>). In both districts, clients who initiated treatment after tenofovir was introduced had lower mortality rates (5-year losses of 8% and 25%, respectively) and deaths were even lower after the introduction of an FDC (5-year losses of 4% and 17%, respectively).
