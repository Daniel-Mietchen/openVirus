<p>The mean and median baseline CD4 counts increased from 2004 to 2017 in both Johannesburg and Mopani districts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">b</xref>). The increase has been consistent in Johannesburg, but Mopani took a longer time to show this trend, with a consistent increase only being evident from 2009. Although the proportion of baseline CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> has decreased over time, particularly from 2009, there has been no decrease in the last 2 years, with percentage counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> remaining at ± 40% in Johannesburg and ± 35% in Mopani (
