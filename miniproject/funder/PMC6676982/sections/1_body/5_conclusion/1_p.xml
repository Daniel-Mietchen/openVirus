<p>In conclusion, this study of routine programme data demonstrates rapid expansion of South Africaâ€™s adult ART programme since 2004. Although median CD4 count has increased over time, this population measure is masking a high-risk group of clients who present late for HIV care with low baseline CD4 counts. Despite improvements in mortality over time, these clients are still at risk of increased mortality, particularly in rural settings. Therefore, targeted interventions are urgently warranted to improve early engagement in care and clinical management, with a specific focus on men, older clients and those presenting at hospitals. Ongoing monitoring of the routine programme coupled with targeted interventions will ensure continued improvements in the outcomes of these high-risk individuals.</p>
