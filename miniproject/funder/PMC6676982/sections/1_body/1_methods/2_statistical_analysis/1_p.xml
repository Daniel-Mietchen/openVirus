<p>Descriptive statistics were used to explore trends in ART initiation and baseline CD4 counts over time. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the probability of death over time in clients with low baseline CD4 counts (&lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>). Only clients known to have died and those active in care were included in the Kaplan–Meier analysis. Follow-up time, defined as the time between ART start and last ART visit, was censored at 5 years after ART initiation. Where clients died after the initiation visit (i.e. ART initiation date and last visit date were the same), a follow-up time of half a day (0.001 years) was assigned. Survival curves were compared using a Peto–Peto–Prentice test for equality of survivor functions, which is not affected by differences in censoring patterns across groups and is appropriate even when hazard functions are not proportional.
