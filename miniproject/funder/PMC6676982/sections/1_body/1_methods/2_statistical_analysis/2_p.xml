<p>To describe the population presenting late for HIV care in 2017, clients with baseline CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> were compared to those with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> using Mann–Whitney and chi-squared (χ
 <sup>2</sup>) or Fisher’s exact tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Viral load suppression was calculated using the last viral load test on record for each client and was defined as a last viral load result &lt; 1000 copies/mL as per South African guidelines, which use 1000 copies/mL as the cut-off for virological failure.

 </sup> Delivery of CPT to clients presenting for HIV care with baseline CD4 counts &lt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> was compared between clients with advanced clinical disease (World Health Organization [WHO] stage III or IV disease) and clients with WHO stage I or II disease using 95% confidence intervals over the last 5 years (2013–2017). Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). A 
 <italic>p-</italic>value of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
