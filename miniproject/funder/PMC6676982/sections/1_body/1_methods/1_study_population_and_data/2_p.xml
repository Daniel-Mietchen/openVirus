<p>In April 2018, data for Johannesburg and Mopani districts were extracted from TIER.Net. Records were included in the analysis from clients initiating ART between 2004 and 2017 (inclusive), where clients were 15–80 years of age, were newly initiating ART and had a baseline CD4 count on record. In order to exclude outlying CD4 counts that were likely data errors, records with baseline counts above 2000 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> were excluded. For the Kaplan–Meier analysis only, clients who were lost to follow-up (LTFU) or had transferred out of the ART programme were also excluded.
