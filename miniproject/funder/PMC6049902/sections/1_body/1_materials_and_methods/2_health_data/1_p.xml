<p>The surveillance unit of the Environmental Health Department in the Ministry of Health of Barbados is responsible for maintaining records on the incidence of dengue and other arboviral disease cases. As of January 2018, the surveillance unit liaises with the Leptospirosis lab (national reference lab) to record laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus. Specimens are tested for the dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen, dengue virus IgM/IgG, and chikungunya virus IgM/IgG using commercial ELISA kits. Since September 2016, the lab has also conducted real-time PCR using the CDC Trioplex assay for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus, and they conduct serotyping of positive dengue virus samples. National population estimates, obtained from the Barbados Population and Housing Census (1990, 2000, and 2010) [
