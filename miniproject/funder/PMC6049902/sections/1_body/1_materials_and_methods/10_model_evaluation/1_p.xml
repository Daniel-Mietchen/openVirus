<p>Dengue control programmes often monitor new cases against historical case data, which define a typical dengue transmission season [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While various methods for calculating epidemic thresholds are available, we chose the monthly moving thresholds of the upper quartile (75th percentile) of the distribution of observed dengue incidence. This is in line with the epidemic threshold methods described by the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Prediction models that can detect outbreaks are crucial because they provide information to public health decision-makers who can advocate for increased disease control interventions when necessary [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To assess the performance of the final model against current practice, we considered the ability of both the final model and the baseline model (a submodel of the final model based only on the seasonality term) to detect outbreaks in Barbados. An outbreak threshold was calculated as the 75th percentile of the distribution of dengue cases per month between June 1999 and May 2016, excluding the ‘dengue’ year for which the prediction was valid. The probability of exceeding the moving outbreak threshold was mapped and verified with actual exceedance data. To determine an optimum decision trigger threshold for issuing outbreak alerts, we calculated a relative (or receiver) operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the binary events of exceeding the moving outbreak threshold. The ROC is a graph of the hit rate against the false alarm rate for varying decision trigger thresholds [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The hit rate represents the proportion of events that occurred (i.e., outbreaks) that were correctly predicted (also known as the true positive rate or sensitivity). The false alarm rate represents the proportion of events that were predicted to occur but did not occur (also known as the false positive rate or 1-specificity). We calculated the curve using probabilistic out-of-sample predictions of exceeding the moving outbreak threshold compared with the observed binary outcome. We defined a trigger alert threshold as the point on the curve closest to the point of perfect discrimination (0, 1). Performance measures, including the hit rate (probability of detection), false alarm rate, and proportion of correct predictions, were then calculated for both the final model and the baseline model.
