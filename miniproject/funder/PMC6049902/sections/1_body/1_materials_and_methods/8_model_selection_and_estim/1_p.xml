<p>Model parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002613.s014">S1 Text</xref> for specification of prior and hyperprior distributions). The model was estimated in 'leave one out' cross-validation mode from June 1999 to May 2016, i.e., by excluding the month for which the prediction is valid when estimating model parameters [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Exploratory analysis and model selection criteria were used to select the final model, including the cross-validated (CV) log score [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the deviance information criterion (DIC) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], for which smaller values indicate better fitting models. An R

 <sub>LR</sub> statistic for mixed-effects models based on a likelihood ratio test between the candidate model, and an intercept-only model was also formulated [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], where 0 ≤ R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>LR</sub> ≤ 1, with R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>LR</sub> = 1 corresponding to a perfect fit and R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>LR</sub> ≥ 0 for any reasonable model specification. R
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>LR</sub> is useful as a measure of goodness-of-fit and provides an intuitive measure of the ability of the model to account for the variation in the dependent variable. The final model was selected by comparing models of increasing complexity, in terms of input variables and model structure, to the baseline model (including only the monthly random effect to account for seasonality).
