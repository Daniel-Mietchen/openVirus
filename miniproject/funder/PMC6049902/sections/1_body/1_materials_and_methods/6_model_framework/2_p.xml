<p>First, a baseline model was formulated by including a first-order random walk latent model for month β
 <sub>t'(t)</sub>, where t'(t) = 1, …, 12 and β
 <sub>1</sub> represents the parameter estimate for the month of June. This term helps to capture the seasonality in dengue, which is assumed to be stationary each year (monthly random effect). The first-order random walk prior allows dengue incidence rates in 1 month to depend on the previous month, to reflect both seasonality and the infectious nature of the disease. Next, exchangeable random effects for each year γ
 <sub>T'(t)</sub> (where T'(t) = 1, …, 17 and γ
 <sub>1</sub> represents the dengue year June 1999–May 2000) was included in the model to account for interannual variation in dengue over time (yearly random effect). This term potentially allows for changes in population immunity between outbreak years, lapses in vector control, and other slowly changing factors, such as changes in mosquito-control intensity and the introduction of new dengue virus serotypes or other viruses, which could be mistaken for dengue. Note that chikungunya and Zika viruses were introduced to Barbados in 2014 and at the end of 2015, respectively [
