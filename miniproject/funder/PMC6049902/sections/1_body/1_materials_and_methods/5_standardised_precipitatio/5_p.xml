 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the annual cycle of dengue incidence rates (per 100,000 population), the SPI-6, and Tmin in Barbados from June 1999 to May 2016. Dengue outbreaks occurred in the dengue seasons 2003–2004, 2007–2008, 2010–2011, 2013–2014, 2014–2015 and 2015–2016. Severe droughts (negative SPI-6 values) occurred in 2002–2003, 2009–2010, and 2015–2016, which coincided with El Niño events (see
