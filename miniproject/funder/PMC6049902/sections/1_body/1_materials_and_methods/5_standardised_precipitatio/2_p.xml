<p>SPI at different time scales are representative of different types of drought. Generally, the longer the meteorological drought persists and the more negative the SPI value, the greater the societal impact. The 1-month SPI (SPI-1) allows for early detection of meteorological droughts. Operationally, with the aim to enable drought early warning systems, the Caribbean Drought and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CDPMN)—coordinated by the CIMH—tracks drought using SPIs at 1 month, 3 months (SPI-3), 6 months (SPI-6), 12 months (SPI-12), and 24 months (SPI-24) [

However, in the Caribbean, agricultural drought (related to shortage of surface or soil moisture for optimal crop growth) manifests more significantly after 3 months [

Soil moisture and surface water reservoir depletion typically take at least 6 months to substantially impact water availability at the national level. Aquifer depletion and repletion typically occur at time scales of 9 to 12 months, affecting large groundwater reservoirs. Therefore, hydrological drought can be tracked with SPI-6 and SPI-12.
