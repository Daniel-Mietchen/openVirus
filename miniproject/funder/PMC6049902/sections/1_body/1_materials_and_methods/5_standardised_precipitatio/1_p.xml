<p>The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) is a drought index first developed by McKee et al. [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The SPI is a representation of rainfall totals in units of standard deviation following a gamma-fitted distribution. Positive values indicate greater than average rainfall totals or excess rainfall, while negative values indicate less than average rainfall or rainfall deficits—otherwise called meteorological drought. The SPI can best be interpreted as the severity of meteorological drought or excessive rainfall by the end of the period of interest and is based on monthly precipitation totals alone—the most commonly available climate variable from rainfall stations around the world. As such, wet or dry conditions can be monitored by the SPI at a variety of time horizons, from subseasonal to multi-annual time scales.
