<p>With drought being a slow-onset climate hazard, early warning (e.g., based on SPIs) with ample lead time is a realistic and effective option. This is especially the case when monitoring is combined with forecasting. Operationally, the Caribbean Climate Outlook Forum (CariCOF) provides drought forecasts using predictions of SPI-6 with a lead time of 3 months (i.e., 3 months in advance) and SPI-12 with lead times up to 6 months [

In contrast, while SPIs are used by the CDPMN to track periods of excess precipitation, flooding potential—the hydrometeorological hazard component of flood risk—is a compounded factor of both long-term rainfall accumulations (i.e., soil moisture saturation) and short-term wet spells. The original severity classes are shown in
