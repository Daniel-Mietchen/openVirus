<p>DLNMs [

This modelling approach is based on the definition of a cross-basis, obtained by the combination of 2 functions to flexibly model linear or nonlinear exposure–responses and the lag structure of the relationship [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A standard exposure–response function f(x) is defined to express the potentially nonlinear exposure–response curve along the dimension of the climate predictors. An additional lag–response function w(l) expresses instead the temporal dimension. Their combination in a bidimensional exposure–lag–response function f.w(x,l) through a cross-basis is defined to flexibly model both intensity and timing of past exposures. Meteorological variables—including monthly precipitation, minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures as well as the SPI at different time scales (1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month averages)—were tested in the model, in turn. Note that an El Niño index was not included in the model because it is highly correlated with the SPI in Barbados (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002613.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), and including both would have resulted in overfitting. Each variable was included as a linear term at individual lags and as a nonlinear exposure–lag–response function. The delayed effects of the climate indicators were assessed for up to 5 months, which was determined on the basis of exploratory analysis and previous studies [
