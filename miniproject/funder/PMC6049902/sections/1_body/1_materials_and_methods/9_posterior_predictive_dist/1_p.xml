<p>To test the predictive ability of the model, we refitted the model 17 times, removing 1 year at a time to produce out-of-sample predictions (i.e., 17-fold cross-validation). Note that the annual random-effect term was included in the model-fitting stage to better quantify the association between climate factors and variation in dengue incidence rates. However, when producing out-of-sample predictions, no effect was estimated for the year in which the prediction was valid, hence the term does not contribute to incidence rate estimates in prediction mode. Therefore, model predictions are based solely on exposure–lag–response functions of key climate variables and the seasonality term, meaning the model can be used to predict any year not included in the model-fitting process.</p>
