<p>To evaluate the output from the selected Bayesian hierarchical model, posterior predictive distributions of the response variable were simulated using samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters and hyperparameters in the model [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The posterior predictive distribution of dengue cases, y
 <sub>t</sub>, for each month (June 1999–May 2016) was estimated by drawing 1,000 random values from a negative binomial distribution with mean corresponding to the elements of μ
 <sub>t</sub> and scale parameter corresponding to the elements of the overdispersion parameter κ, estimated from the models, estimated in 17-fold cross-validation mode. This procedure allows for uncertainty in the response variable, given the model parameters. We therefore generated 204 (17 × 12) out-of-sample posterior predictive distributions and use these to evaluate the ability of the model to produce probabilistic dengue outbreak predictions given predefined epidemic thresholds.
