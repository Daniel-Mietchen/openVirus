<p>Prior studies in Barbados documented the seasonal linkages between climate and dengue (from 1980 to 2000), finding that epidemics occurred in the latter part of the year [

Other studies found that dengue was significantly associated with lagged climate variables, including rainfall at a 7-week lag and minimum temperature (Tmin) at a 12-week lag [

In a different study, investigators analysed a time series of dengue from 2004 to 2013 using generalised linear models, which were able to predict dengue cases with limited success using monthly rainfall, monthly number of rain days, and average temperature, after pre-adjusting for unmeasured cyclical and long-term trends [
