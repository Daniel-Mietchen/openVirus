<p>In recent years, the Caribbean region has experienced an unprecedented crisis of co-occurring epidemics of febrile illness due to dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. These diseases are transmitted principally by the female 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which is a mostly domestic, urban mosquito that lays its eggs in water-bearing containers in and around the home. Over a 5-year period (2012 to 2016), Barbados reported a total of 7,298 dengue cases [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with most cases reported in children up to 15 years of age [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Three outbreaks of dengue fever were reported during that period (2013, 2014, and 2016). Recent studies reported an upward trend in dengue transmission in Barbados from 2006 to 2015, with all 4 dengue serotypes (dengue virus [DENV]-1 through DENV-4) cocirculating in the population [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Illness due to dengue virus is estimated to cost $321.4 million USD per year in the Caribbean (excluding the costs of vector control and other prevention programmes) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With the recent emergence of chikungunya and Zika in the Caribbean, the cost of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases has increased dramatically. In a region with low economic growth and high public debt [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the burden of arboviruses is unsustainable, and new tools are urgently needed to support the public health sector.
