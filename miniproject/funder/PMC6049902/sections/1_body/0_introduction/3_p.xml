 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The effect of rainfall on dengue risk is more complex and depends on the local socioecological conditions that determine the type and abundance of larval habitat in the environment [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Rainfall can increase mosquito population densities by increasing the availability of larval habitat in abandoned rain-filled containers in the patio around the home. Drought conditions that result in household water scarcity can also potentially increase larval habitat by increasing the number of water storage containers around the home [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, few studies have examined the effects of prolonged drought on dengue transmission.
