<p>Before an effective disease forecast can be developed, it is important to identify the key climate drivers, lag periods, and appropriate model formulation that reflects the local disease transmission ecology and climatology. It takes time for anomalies in the climate to manifest and contribute to disease risk. The various components of the time lag include the period for mosquito larval habitat to increase, the development period of the mosquito, the time before the first blood meal in which the mosquito transmits the virus to a human host, and the time before the appearance of clinical manifestations of dengue [

Several studies have employed distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) to explore associations between meteorological variables and dengue incidence in several countries—primarily in Asia—that experience dengue epidemics, including Bangladesh [

A major advantage to using DLNM methodology is the possibility of describing the lag structure of either linear or nonlinear exposure–response relationships, through the choice of 2 functions that define the association along the dimensions of the predictor (e.g., climate variables) and lags [
