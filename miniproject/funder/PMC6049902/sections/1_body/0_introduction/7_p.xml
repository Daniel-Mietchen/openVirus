<p>This study aims to quantify the nonlinear and delayed effects of climate impacts, such as drought, extreme rainfall, and temperature variations, on dengue risk in the eastern Caribbean island of Barbados by coupling DLNMs with a Bayesian model estimation framework. The model is then used to produce out-of-sample predicted probabilities of exceeding island-specific outbreak thresholds. Barbados is an ideal case study due to high-quality historical climate and health data, a relatively high burden of disease, and prior experience in building projects on climate and health, paving the way for a sustainable collaboration to develop integrated early warning information to predict the risk of dengue and other mosquito-transmitted diseases in the Caribbean.</p>
