<p>The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major driver of regional year-to-year climate variability in the Caribbean [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ENSO is associated with a gradient in sea surface temperature anomalies between the eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean and the Tropical North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. During the early and mature stages of El Niño events, this gradient is often positive (i.e., the surface waters of the Tropical Pacific are anomalously warmer than the Tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea). Most periods of regional drought, weaker hurricane season activity, and warmer temperatures are associated with the El Niño–induced positive gradient. By contrast, wet episodes and more active hurricane seasons coincide with La Niña events [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], i.e., when the ocean gradient tends to be negative. Recent examples of El Niño–associated regional drought occurred in 1997–1998, 2009–2010, and 2014–2016, whereas La Niña events in 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 coincided with very wet conditions in large parts of the Caribbean [
