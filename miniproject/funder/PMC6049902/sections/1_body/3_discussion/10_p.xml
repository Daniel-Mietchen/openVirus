<p>Seasonal forecast models can contribute to reducing the risk of disease outbreaks by increasing preparation time to better allocate scarce resources. To date, there are few localised studies in this region that quantify the associations between subseasonal to seasonal forecasts of climate and dengue risk outcomes. In the absence of a robust evidence base, the operational use of climate information for predicting increased dengue risk remains an untapped opportunity to support climate-driven dengue early warning information systems. This is an area of further investigation, along with the transferability of this framework to model and predict the risk of dengue and other arboviruses in other Caribbean countries.</p>
