<p>The objective of this study was to select a model to infer delayed and nonlinear impacts of climate on dengue risk and predict the probability of exceeding an outbreak threshold relevant to the Ministry of Health in Barbados and other islands in the Caribbean. Forecasts of the probability of exceeding outbreak thresholds allow decision-makers to quantify the level of certainty of the model predictions. However, when using predefined outbreak and alarm trigger thresholds, the translation of probabilities into discrete warnings might not always reflect the predictive power of the model [
