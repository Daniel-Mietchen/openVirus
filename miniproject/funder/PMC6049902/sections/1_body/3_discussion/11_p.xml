<p>There are several limitations of the study. In Barbados, the absolute number of dengue cases across the island is relatively small, even in outbreak years (i.e., 1,140 confirmed cases in 2013, 488 confirmed cases in 2014, and 587 confirmed cases in 2016). The time series is relatively long compared with previously studied dengue records in other countries. However, it is still limited for statistical modelling purposes because our knowledge of outbreak dynamics is based on the behaviour of only a few outbreaks. Ideally, data on vector control activities and other interventions or policy changes would be included in the model. In the absence of such data, monthly and yearly random effects are included in the model to try and ensure that the variance in the predictions includes uncertainty that could be generated by these unknown features of the disease system. However, while yearly effects are useful to identify missing information and better quantify the contribution of explanatory variables to the relative risk, they cannot contribute to out-of-sample predictions unless prior assumptions about the year ahead can be made.</p>
