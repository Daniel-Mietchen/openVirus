<p>We hypothesise that the effect of excess rainfall and drought on dengue risk operated at different time scales due to different mechanisms associated with the availability of larval habitat and water storage in the urban environment. Following a rainfall event, the availability of larval habitat increases (e.g., rain-filled abandoned containers, rubbish), and within a relatively short period of time, eggs hatch and adult mosquito densities increase (i.e., approximately 2â€“3 weeks after rainfall, depending on ambient temperatures). Subsequently, the risk of arbovirus infections increases several weeks later, a lag associated with the intrinsic and extrinsic viral incubation periods.</p>
