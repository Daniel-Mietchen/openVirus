<p>The model failed to predict the peak and magnitude of the last 2 dengue transmission seasons, which coincided with the first epidemics of chikungunya and Zika. The emergence of these viruses, which are transmitted by the same mosquito vector, likely altered diagnostic, reporting, and healthcare-seeking practices, and we suspect that this might have affected the model performance for the last 2 dengue seasons in 2015 and 2016. This may also be true in other countries and territories across Latin America and the Caribbean during this time period. Dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus have a similar clinical presentation (e.g., mild febrile illness, rash, joint pain), and differential diagnosis is challenging without molecular diagnostics (e.g., PCR) due to cross-reactivity of the serological assays. Only after September 2016 was Barbados able to test suspected arbovirus infections using a triplex PCR; prior to then, a subset of samples was sent for confirmation to CARPHAâ€™s diagnostic laboratory in Trinidad and Tobago. The emergence of Zika virus may have also changed healthcare-seeking behaviour, with more women seeking diagnostics for mild febrile illness due to concerns about Zika congenital syndrome [

The cocirculation of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in the region poses a challenge for forecasting future risk, unless high-quality seroprevalence data can be incorporated in the model [
