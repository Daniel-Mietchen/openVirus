<p>In recent decades, the Caribbean has experienced several drought events. Notable events during our study period include 2002–2003, 2009–2010, and 2015–2016. Drought and water scarcity are projected to increase in the future due to climate change [

Although these measures were intended to increase the capacity of the country to adapt to climate change, they may have had the unintended consequence of increasing the overall risk of arboviral diseases during any time when rainfall is collected and stored. In response, the Ministry of Health has issued recommendations to adequately cover all water storage receptacles and, if necessary, apply screen mesh material to all entry sites for small and large cisterns. Presently, the Ministry of Health is working on producing Safe Water Storage Guidelines as a reference for the public to reduce the risk of mosquito-borne diseases. This example highlights the need for intersectoral collaboration to address the complexities of climate and health in Barbados and in other SIDS.
