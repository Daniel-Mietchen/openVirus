<p>To our knowledge, there is little known about the effects of prolonged drought on dengue transmission. Some studies have shown that rainfall shortages can increase dengue risk in regions where people store water [

However, entomological and epidemiological field studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms linking drought to dengue risk in Barbados. Ultimately, the effects of rainfall on dengue transmission depend on the local socioecological conditions that determine the types of larval habitat available in the environment, as well as water access and storage.
