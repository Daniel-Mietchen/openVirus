<p>In practice, the CIMH could run this dengue model using their seasonal climate forecast products. Results could be updated on a monthly basis as the target month is approached. This should reduce forecast uncertainty as one more month of climate observations becomes available and one fewer month of climate forecasts is needed. CariCOF’s SPI-6-based drought outlooks have a prediction lead time of 3 months. For example, CariCOF’s SPI-6-based drought outlook issued in July, which estimates the drought situation by the end of October, could be used to predict the dengue risk in October (target month). Observed SPI-6 data for May (i.e., calculated from the observed rainfall totals from December of the previous year to May of the current year) and June (i.e., 4 and 5 months before the target month, to capture the long-lag impacts on dengue risk) would be used along with forecast SPI-6 conditions from July to October (i.e., lags of 0–3 months with respect to the target month). This would produce a 3-month lead dengue forecast (see

In August, the dengue forecast for October could be updated—using the new observed SPI-6 value for July and updated SPI-6 forecasts for August (i.e., an SPI-6 calculated from the sum of observed rainfall totals from March to July and forecast rainfall totals for August) to October—to produce a 2-month-ahead dengue forecast for October (
