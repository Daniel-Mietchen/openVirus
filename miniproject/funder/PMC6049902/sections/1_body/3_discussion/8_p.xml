<p>Climate anomalies in the Caribbean are associated with tropical Atlantic and Pacific sea surface temperatures, which are usually well predictable at seasonal time scales [

This gives useful predictive skill to regional and seasonal climate forecast models, especially seasonal temperature and SPI-based outlooks with up to 6 months lead time. Previous studies have shown that seasonal climate forecasts combined with dengue risk prediction models can extend predictive lead time from a few months to nearly a year [
