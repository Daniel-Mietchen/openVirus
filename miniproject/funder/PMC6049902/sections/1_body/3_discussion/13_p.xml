<p>Overall, the final model had a lower false alarm rate and a lower miss rate than the baseline model. However, the model did result in false alarms 31% of the time. Repeatedly issuing false alarms can result in a lack of trust from the general public. However, in practice, false alarms (i.e., issuing a high probability alert of a dengue outbreak) can, in fact, result from effective interventions in response to the alert. Furthermore, when dealing with detrimental health events, such as disease outbreaks, false alarms are preferable to missed events.</p>
