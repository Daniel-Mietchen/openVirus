<p>Drought conditions were found to positively influence dengue incidence rates at longer lead times up to 5 months, while excess rainfall increased the risk at shorter lead times between 1 and 2 months. Therefore, the modelling results suggest that a drought period followed by intense rainfall 4 to 5 months later could provide optimum conditions for an imminent dengue outbreak. The use of the SPI-6, designed to monitor drought and extreme rainfall, better explained variations in dengue risk than summary statistics of measured precipitation. Tmin explained more variation in dengue incidence rates than mean or maximum temperature. Furthermore, including bidimensional exposure–lag–response functions of these indicators—rather than linear effects for individual lags—more appropriately described the climate–disease associations than traditional modelling approaches. To our knowledge, DLNM methodology has not previously been combined with a Bayesian hierarchical mixed-modelling framework to produce probabilistic predictions of exceeding dengue outbreak thresholds. To demonstrate the added value of our climate-driven dengue model, we formulated a baseline model to represent current practice (i.e., monitoring dengue cases throughout the year against historic seasonal averages). A probability trigger threshold was calculated by using the ROC curve to select an optimal cut-off value that maximised sensitivity and specificity for the moving outbreak threshold of the upper quartile of the observed dengue distribution per month. The model successfully distinguished outbreaks from nonoutbreaks, except in the last 2 dengue seasons (2014–2015, 2015–2016), with an overall proportion of correct predictions (hits and correct rejections) of 86% compared with 64% for the baseline model.</p>
