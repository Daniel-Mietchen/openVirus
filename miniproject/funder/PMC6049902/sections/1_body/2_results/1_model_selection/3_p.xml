 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows model adequacy statistics for a series of models of increasing complexity. Firstly, a baseline model was fitted including a monthly random effect (Model 1), which accounted for 23% of the variation in dengue relative risk. Next, a yearly random effect was included (Model 2), which explained an additional 31% of the variation in addition to the annual cycle term. Exposure–lag–response functions for the selected climate factors, SPI-6, and Tmin were then added to the baseline model (individually in Model 3 and 4 and together in Model 5). This showed that 24% of the interannual variation could be explained by the key selected climate variables. The final selected model included monthly and yearly random effects and exposure–lag–response functions for both the SPI-6 and Tmin (Model 6), explaining—overall—68% of the variation in dengue incidence rates. Therefore, in addition to climate factors, yearly random effects accounted for an extra 21% of the variation in dengue incidence rates.
