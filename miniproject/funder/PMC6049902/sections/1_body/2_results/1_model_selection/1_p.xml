<p>As part of the model selection procedure, a range of climate variables were tested, first as linear terms for individual lags from 0 to 5 months and second as exposure–lag functions for individual climate indicators (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002613.s013">S5 Table</xref>). Key variables were tested with and without the interannual term to understand the relative contribution of each term to dengue incidence rate variations. The best estimate of log(ρ
 <sub>t</sub>) comprised an intercept, α, monthly, β
 <sub>t'(t)</sub>, and yearly, γ
 <sub>T'(t)</sub>, random effects (to account for seasonality and unmeasured interannual variability) and nonlinear exposure–lag functions f.w(x

 <sub>1t</sub>, and Tmin, x
 <sub>2t</sub>, with lags, l, from 0 to 5 months.
