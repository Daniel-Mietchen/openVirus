 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows time series of observed and out-of-sample predicted dengue incidence rates (per 100,000 population) from May 1999 to June 2016. Posterior predictive mean and the upper 95% prediction (credible) interval from the final model (fitted 17 times in cross-validation mode, excluding 1 dengue year at a time), and the moving outbreak threshold (75th percentile of observed dengue incidence rates per month, excluding the year for which the prediction is valid) are also included (note, a scatter plot of observed versus posterior predictive mean dengue incidence rates from the final model is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002613.s007">S7 Fig</xref>; for comparison, posterior predictive mean dengue incidence rates from the baseline model are also shown). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the probability of exceeding the moving outbreak threshold. For each time step, the proportion of the 1,000 samples simulated from the final model that exceeded the moving outbreak threshold was calculated. The deeper the colour, the greater the predicted probability of exceeding the outbreak threshold. Observed exceedance events are marked with a cross. The model was able to correctly forecast peak months and distinguish between outbreak and nonoutbreak years, except in the last 2 dengue seasons (2014–2015, 2015–2016). The model simulated a high probability (expressed as deeper colours) of exceeding the threshold in 2007–2008 and 2010–2011, and also in 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g005">Fig 5</xref>) when peaks occurred either earlier or later than expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g004">Fig 4</xref>). For nonoutbreak years (e.g., 2004–2005 and 2005–2006), the model correctly predicted a very low probability of outbreaks (depicted by pale colours).
