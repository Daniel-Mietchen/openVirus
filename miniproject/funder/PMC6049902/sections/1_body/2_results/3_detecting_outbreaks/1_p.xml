<p>Moving outbreak thresholds were calculated as the 75th percentile of the distribution of dengue cases per month between June 1999 and May 2016, excluding the ‘dengue’ year for which the prediction was valid. We applied this moving threshold to produce out-of-sample probabilistic predictions of exceeding the outbreak threshold for all 17 years (June 1999–May 2016) as a demonstration.</p>
