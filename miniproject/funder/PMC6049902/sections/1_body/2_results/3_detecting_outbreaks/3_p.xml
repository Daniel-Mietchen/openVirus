<p>The outbreak detection performance of the model is summarised in 
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, which shows ROC and contingency table results for observed dengue cases exceeding the moving outbreak threshold. As an indicator of the quality of the forecasting system, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated as 0.90 for the final model. This indicates that the forecasting system performs significantly better than randomly guessing (AUC = 0.5). For the baseline model, AUC = 0.75 (see 
 <xref rid="pmed.1002613.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002613.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The ‘optimal’ cut-off value that maximised sensitivity and specificity for the moving outbreak threshold was 30% for the final model (27% for the baseline model). Using this trigger alert threshold, we looked at a binary classification of predicted and observed outbreaks. The final model produced more hits and fewer missed events than the baseline model, with a hit rate (probability of detection) of 90% (miss rate = 10%) for the final model, compared with 79% (miss rate = 21%) for the baseline model. The final model also had a lower false alarm rate of 31% compared with 57% for the baseline model. Overall, the proportion of correctly predicted outbreaks and nonoutbreaks was 86% (see
