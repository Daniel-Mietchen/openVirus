<p>Associations between the selected climate variables (SPI-6 and Tmin) and dengue relative risk are presented as three-dimensional graphs and two-dimensional contour plots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Lag–response associations for different scenarios are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The relative risk is displayed as differences from the relative risk when SPI-6 = 0 (i.e., normal category, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002613.s010">S2 Table</xref>) and Tmin = 20°C (e.g., the lowest Tmin observed over the time period). The relative risk of dengue is greatest at short lead times (between 1 and 2 months) for exceptionally wet conditions (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, exceptionally dry conditions are associated with increased dengue relative risk 5 months later. Dengue relative risk is greatest 2 to 3 months after higher Tmin values (i.e., 25.5°C) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002613.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The cumulative exposure–response association across all lags for SPI-6 and Tmin show that, overall, moderately dry and warmer conditions contribute more to the relative risk (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002613.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).
