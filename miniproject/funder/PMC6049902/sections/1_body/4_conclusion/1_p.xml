<p>We are working towards implementing a climate-based early warning system for arboviral diseases in all Caribbean islands and territories. Not only does this study contribute to enriching the knowledge base, it represents a considerable opportunity to translate investment in healthâ€“climate research into practice to improve national and regional health outcomes. The goal is to enhance the health warnings issued in the quarterly Caribbean Health-Climatic Bulletin with quantitative probabilistic forecasts of disease risk rather than expert statements on probable health outcomes. Integration of an early warning information product into national and sectoral planning and practice has the potential to reverse the upward trend of new infections of arboviral diseases, which currently undermines the productivity and sustainable development of SIDS in the Caribbean.</p>
