  <title>ROC curves to define alarm trigger threshold.</title>
  <p>ROC curve for binary event of dengue incidence rates exceeding the moving outbreak threshold (75th percentile of observed dengue incidence rates per month, excluding the year for which the prediction is valid) for (a) final model (without year effect contribution) and (b) baseline model. Numbers indicate values of probability thresholds along the curve, and the purple circle indicates the position of an ‘optimal’ ROC cut-off (alarm trigger threshold), defined as the point on the curve closest to the point of perfect discrimination (0, 1). Note: false alarms are a desired outcome when the predicted probability of threshold exceedance is very low. ROC, relative (receiver) operating characteristic.</p>
