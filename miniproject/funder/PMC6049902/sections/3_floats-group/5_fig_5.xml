  <title>Predicted probability of exceeding moving outbreak thresholds.</title>
  <p>Probability of exceeding the moving outbreak threshold (75th percentile of observed dengue cases per month, excluding the year for which the prediction is valid) from June 1999 to May 2016, using out-of-sample predictive distributions simulated from the final model. The graduated colour bar represents the predicted probability of observing an outbreak (ranging from 0, pale colours, to 1, deep colours). Months in which the moving outbreak threshold was exceeded are marked with a cross. Note: the ‘dengue season’ year runs from June to May.</p>
