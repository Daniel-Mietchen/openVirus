 <p>Advancements in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics have expanded our knowledge of the diversity of viruses (pathogens and non-pathogens) harbored by mosquitoes. Hubei reo-like virus 7 (HRLV 7) was recently detected by the virome analysis of fecal samples from migratory birds in Australia. We now report the detection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of HRLV 7 in pools of 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes species from the Brazilian Amazon forest. Phylogenetic inferences indicated that all HRLV 7 strains fall within the same independent clade. In addition, HRLV 7 shared a close ancestral lineage with the 
  <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> genus of the Reoviridae family. Our findings indicate that HRLV 7 is present in two species of mosquitoes.
