<p>The protocol used to perform deep sequencing was described previously by da Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Initially, each mosquito pool was homogenized in a 2-mL impact-resistant tube containing lysing matrix C (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA) added to 900 μL of Hanks’ buffered salt solution (HBSS). The homogenized sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and approximately 300 μL of the supernatant was then percolated through a 0.45-μm filter (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) in order to remove eukaryotic- and bacterial-cell-sized particles. Approximately 100 μL, roughly equivalent to one fourth of the volume of the tube, of cold PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was added to the obtained filtrate, and the contents of the tube were gently mixed then incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant (~350 μL) was discarded. The viral particle enriched pellet was treated with a mix of nuclease enzymes (7 µL of TURBO DNase and 3 µL RNase Cocktail Enzyme Mix-Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; 3 µL Baseline-ZERO DNase-Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA; 3 µL Benzonase-Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; and 3 µL RQ1 RNase-Free DNase and 3 µL DNase A Solution-Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in order to digest unprotected nucleic acids. The resulting mixture was subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Viral nucleic acids were then obtained using a ZR and ZR-96 Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and cDNA synthesis was performed using AMV reverse transcription (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A second strand of cDNA synthesis was obtained using DNA Polymerase I Large Fragment (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Then, DNA library analysis was performed using a Nextera XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, CA, USA). The library was deep-sequenced using the HiSeq 2500 Sequencer (Illumina, CA, USA) with 126 bp ends. Bioinformatic analysis was performed according to the protocol previously described by Deng et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The singlets and contigs were analyzed via BLAST (BLASTn and BLASTx) to identify similarity to viral sequences in the GenBank database.
