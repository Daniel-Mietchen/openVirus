<p>The Neighbor-Joining tree and the calculation of the mean evolutionary distance within were performed using the MEGA software version X [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 replications. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 69.85562761 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Jone-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) matrix-based method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 2.52). The best-fitted model was selected based on BIC scores (BIC score; 156640.583). Estimated amino acid frequencies were: A = 0.077; R = 0.051; N = 0.043; D = 0.051; C = 0.02; Q = 0.041; E = 0.062; G = 0.075; H = 0.023; I = 0.053; L = 0.091; K = 0.06; M = 0.023; F = 0.041; P = 0.051; S = 0.068; T = 0.059; W = 0.014; Y = 0.032; and V = 0.066. This analysis involved 31 amino acid sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 1964 positions in the final dataset.
