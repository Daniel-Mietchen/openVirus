<p>Estimates of average genetic distances over all sequence pairs were performed by the number of base substitutions per site from averaging over all sequence pairs. Standard error estimate(s) were obtained by a bootstrap procedure (500 replicates). Analyses were conducted using the Kimura 2-parameter model. The rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma distribution (shape parameter = 2.5). All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). There was a total of 5389 positions in the final dataset.</p>
