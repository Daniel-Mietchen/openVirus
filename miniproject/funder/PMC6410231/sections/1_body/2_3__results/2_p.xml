<p>Pairwise comparison of the RdRp amino acid sequence indicated that HRLV 7 sequences shared almost 40% amino acid identity with 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> prototype strains, followed by the cypoviruses and oryzaviruses with ~20% and ~18% identity similarity, respectively. We evaluated the amino acid differences in all HRLV 7 strains and found 42 residues out of 1212 of the RdRp. Particularly, we found some residues conserved in Brazilian HRLV 7 that were distinct from the Asian strain HB235771. These differences in the RdRp that may characterize HRLV 7 from South America are: (S180N), (I197V), (T299V), (S809N), (V829L), (K895G), (D898N), (K900E), (T936N), (I987V), (E994D), (N1021T), (S1031G), (S1037V), (H1210Y).
