<p>We processed a total of 191 pools of mosquitoes from Macapá and Santos that were submitted for NGS. In six pools we detected sequences (3372 nucleotide length on average) that were nearly identical to the RdRp segment of the mosHB235771 Hubei reo-like virus 7 strain (KX884635) (98% and 99% of nucleotide and amino acid identity, respectively). At the amino acid level, the Brazilian HRLV 7 sequences also showed from 39 to 43% identity similarity to 
 <italic>Aedes pseudoscutellaris</italic> reovirus (AAZ94069) and Fako virus (AIW39868), two insect-specific viruses that belong to a recently described genus, 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> (family Reoviridae). Five of these RdRp sequences of HRLV 7 (named F13, F73, F85, F91 and F99) were detected in Amapá and one in Santos (named S48). The sequences S48 and F13 were detected in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and the sequences F73, F85, F91 and F99 were detected in 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. The nucleotide sequences of this study have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MK133923–MK133928.
