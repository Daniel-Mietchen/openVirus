<p>A Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny based on RdRp sequences of representative members of the 
 <italic>Cypovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> genera and nucleotide sequences of HRLV 7 showed that all sequences of HRLV 7 are monophyletic; they form a unique clade with high branch support (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00147-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Besides, the HRLV 7 clade shares a common ancestry with the genus 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic>. To better illustrate the genetic diversity of HRLV 7 strains, we estimated evolutionary distances between sequences (pairwise distances) by computing the proportion of nucleotide differences between each pair of sequences. HRLV 7 and 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> strains had 47% genetic distance and the genetic distance of all HRLV 7 RdRp sequences was only 2% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00147-f002">Figure 2</xref>b), which suggests that they belong to a single replicating lineage. Futhermore, the genetic distances between the 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> clade plus the HRLV 7 clade and the 
 <italic>Cypovirus</italic> clade was 60%.
