<p>Here, we report the detection and phylogenetic characterization of HRLV 7 strains from two mosquito species (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>) in Brazil. Their phylogenetic relationship and detection in different mosquito species increases our knowledge of this recently identified virus.
