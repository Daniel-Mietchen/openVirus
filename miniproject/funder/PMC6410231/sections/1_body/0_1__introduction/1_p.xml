<p>Mosquitoes are well recognized arthropod vectors of viral pathogens worldwide [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, these insects are widely known to harbor a large diversity of seemingly non-pathogenic viruses [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Brazil, climatic and geographic conditions are very favorable for the proliferation and dissemination of mosquitoes and their viral microbiota: frequent rainfall, year-round high temperature and dense forests. In the last few years Brazil has faced multiple epidemics caused by mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue virus, Zika virus and yellow fever virus [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These factors highlight the need for the comprehensive surveillance of virus diversity in mosquitoes. Metagenomic analysis allows for the detection and genetic characterization of novel viruses using high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in China. Nucleotide sequences of HRLV 7 were also identified in fecal samples from Australian migratory birds with a postulated origin from eaten mosquitoes [
