<p>HRLV 7 was previously detected from a mixture of mosquito species comprised of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Armigeres subalbatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our study, nucleotide sequences of HRLV 7 strains were detected in one pool of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and five pools of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>¸ indicating that both mosquito species can be infected by HRLV 7. The detection of a single HRLV 7 lineage from multiple species, rather than a lineage adapted to each specific species, suggests that horizontal transmission between species may be occurring extensively, possibly through the infection of and feeding on common sources [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> are distributed worldwide, predominantly in tropical regions, suggesting that HRLV 7 may potentially be present in other tropical regions of the world. In this study, HRLV 7 was detected in Santos and Macapá, two regions that are nearly 2700 km apart. In addition, HRLV 7 has previously been detected in China and Australia [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our evolutionary analysis showed that HRLV 7 strains have low genetic distance (~2%) in their RdRp region [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. RNA viruses are more prone to mutations, due to low fidelity transcription of RNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, finding similarity values of nearly 100% in geographically distant HRLV 7 strains suggest that this virus is dispersed over long distances.
