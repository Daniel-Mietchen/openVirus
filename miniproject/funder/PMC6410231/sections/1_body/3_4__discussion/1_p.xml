<p>RdRp is the most conserved protein among reoviruses and is often used for phylogenetic analysis within this family. It has been suggested, as a rule, that a percentage of amino acid identity similarity greater than 30% of the RdRp region is needed for classification within a genus of the Reoviridae family [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our identity analysis and phylogenetic tree indicated that HRLV 7 is monophyletic and is related to the 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> genus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00147-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). The genus 
 <italic>Dinovernavirus</italic> includes the only reoviruses known that contain a nine-segment double-strand RNA genome. Other criteria are required for the classification of genera within the 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family, such as sequences of conserved terminal nucleotide motifs and structural genes [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00147" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that need full-length genomes for detection. Therefore, more phenotypic and genomic studies are necessary to confirm the taxonomic classification of HRLV 7.
