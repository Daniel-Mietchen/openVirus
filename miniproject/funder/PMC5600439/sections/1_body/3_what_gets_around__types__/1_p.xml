<p>Recently, the interplay between influenza transmission and evolution has been of particular interest in characterizing interspecies transmission, expansion of host range, and the diversity of viruses circulating. Cocirculation of different influenza virus strains contributes to the continued evolution of flu by increasing the possibility of segment exchange occurring between lineages within subtypes. Although influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have been cocirculating since 1977—with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain [
