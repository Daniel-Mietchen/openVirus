<p>Influenza A appears to be evolving under pressure to avoid CpG-containing oligonucleotides, possibly due to innate immune recognition, in a manner less present in influenza B evolution [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, influenza B lineages have been shown to have lower rates of antigenic drift when compared to influenza A subtypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, distinct patterns in the rate of antigenic drift between the subtypes of influenza A and lineages of influenza B have emerged. Influenza A H3N2 and influenza B Victoria lineage undergo a more rapid antigenic change; thus, old strains die out while new strains appear, lowering diversity [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, influenza A H1N1 and influenza B Yamagata lineage undergo a slower rate of antigenic drift, which allows for more lineages to cocirculate at one time with reduced competition [
