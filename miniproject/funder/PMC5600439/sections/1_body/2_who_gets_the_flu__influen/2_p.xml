<p>It is uncommon for humans to be directly infected with avian flu viruses; it typically requires the infection of an intermediate host in which the virus undergoes adaptation leading to variants that can subsequently more easily transmit to humans. These hosts are often referred to as “mixing vessels,” as seen for pigs, which can be infected with avian and human influenza viruses, producing a favorable environment for gene exchange between strains [
