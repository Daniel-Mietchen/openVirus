<p>Humans are not the only animals to get influenza infections. Influenza A has a variety of vertebrate hosts, including birds, horses, pigs, and bats [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In contrast, humans are almost the exclusive host for influenza B virusesâ€”with some surprising infections in seals that have been documented [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Subtypes of influenza A virus are named after the 2 glycoproteins found on the surface of the virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are respectively essential for entry into and release from the host cell. Aquatic birds are thought to be the primary reservoir for influenza A because they can be infected with nearly every subtype of the virus, except for the recently discovered subtypes H17N10 and H18N11 found in bats [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. With the rapid evolution of influenza, the increase of influenza host range remains a cause for concern, especially in mammals, because of the higher probability of a novel strain arising that can have devastating effects on the human population.
