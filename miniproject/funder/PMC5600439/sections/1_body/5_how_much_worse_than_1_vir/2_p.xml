<p>Clearly, influenza evolution is a multilayered process, and much work needs to be done to fully capture its richness. Such work requires mathematical tools and next-generation sequencing technologies to operate in concert to capture the full breadth of influenza transmission. Effective vaccination strategies would require a better understanding of the complex interplay of multivariant transmission dynamics, inter- and intrahost viral evolution, and the interaction of diverse strains with the host immune system. Only then will a full picture of influenzaâ€™s evolutionary dynamics emerge.</p>
