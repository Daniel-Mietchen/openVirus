<p>A recent study on H3N2 found that cooperation could clearly occur between 2 different H3N2 variants. With 1 variant excelling in cell entry and the other excelling in cell exit, the viral population had a higher replicative success when the 2 variants were mixed than when they were separate [

Although individual virions that lack a fundamental protein may appear noninfectious, when they are part of a viral population, they can contribute by complementation-dependent protein expression to increase the fitness of the population as a whole [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While cooperation is associated with the division of labor between variants (in the above example, between cellular entry and exit), competition occurs when multiple members of a population independently develop beneficial mutations. This scenario, amongst other things, can create an arms race between members of the population. Thus, the intrinsic diversity and loose transmission bottlenecks in circulating influenza populations can facilitate an increase in pathogenesis by allowing viral variants to cooperate with one another or by increasing the number of beneficial mutations appearing in cocirculating clones.
