<p>The segmented structure of the influenza genome facilitates gene exchange between different influenza strains that have infected the same cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006450.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Gene reassortment has been observed in both influenza A and B. Because of the large range of hosts that can get infected with influenza A, reassortment among influenza A viruses can lead to the introduction of subtypes that are antigenically novel for the human population. Intersubtype reassortment has the potential to cause a pandemic; this occurred in the pandemics of both 1957 and 1968 when a reassortment event took place between avian and human influenza viruses [

However, because of genetic dissimilarities and incompatibility between interacting proteins, intersubtype exchange may produce gene rearrangements that do not efficiently transmit among humans, therefore reducing the fitness of the virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Similarly, reassortment between lineages of the same subtype, or intrasubtype reassortment, is limited by genetic compatibilities between the segments of the viruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies measuring intrasubtype gene exchange found that reassortment between lineages of the same subtype is common and can lead to severe epidemics [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While both mutations and gene reassortments can produce antigenic variants, gene exchange produces a rapid change in a virus’s antigenicity (antigenic shift), whereas mutations cause a more gradual change (antigenic drift). However, the combination of mutations with gene reassortments can assist in segment exchange by allowing the gene to adapt to its new genetic environment [
