<p>The 2 main influenza types that infect humans, A and B, are part of the Orthomyxoviridae family, which is characterized by segmented negative-sense RNA genomes. These viruses replicate using an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that lacks proofreading capability. This means that errors that occur during replication produce a diversity of influenza mutants—also called variants—leading to populations of viruses that are often referred to as quasispecies [
