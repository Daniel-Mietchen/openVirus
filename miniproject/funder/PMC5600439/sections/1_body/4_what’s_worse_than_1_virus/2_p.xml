<p>When looking further at intrahost evolution of the flu, studies find that moderately deleterious mutations in influenza may remain in the population over several chains of transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006450.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although these mutations may not be systematically removed through purifying, or negative, selection, they also do not become fixed within the population [
