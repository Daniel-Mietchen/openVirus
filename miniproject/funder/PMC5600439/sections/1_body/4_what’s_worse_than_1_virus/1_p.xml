<p>Because of the error-prone RNA polymerase, influenza populations exist as a mixture of genetically diverse viral particles. Interactions among the variants could contribute to the overall success and fitness of the population. The high diversity seen within an infection leads to influenza adapting rapidly to a new environment. The analysis of deep sequencing data from infected individuals in chains of transmission has allowed the quantification of transmission events. It was observed that a genetic mix of viruses is transmitted to susceptible hosts, with minor variants tagging along with the dominant strain. It is thus feasible that while the influenza vaccine targets the dominant strain, minor variants continue to transmit, undergoing positive selection and becoming the dominant strain in subsequent transmissions [
