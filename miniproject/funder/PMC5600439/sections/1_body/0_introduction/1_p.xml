<p>The year 1918 saw the most famous influenza pandemic—a worldwide epidemic that caused nearly 50 million deaths—when an H1N1 influenza A virus of partial avian origin infected over one-third of the world’s population. Although its exact origins are still under debate, World War I and trade routes are thought to have aided in the circulation of the virus worldwide [

Within the last century, there have been 4 pandemics caused by influenza A, with the most recent in 2009 when a swine-like H1N1 subtype virus entered the human population. Increased whole genome sequencing and computational methods have accompanied improved surveillance of bird populations [

A better understanding of the dynamics of influenza A and B evolution will bring insight into flu transmission, adaptation to new hosts, and outbreak potential.
