<p>Subsequently in May 1985, the Ministers of Health of the region, through PAHO/WHO, announced the goal of eradication of the wild poliovirus from the Americas by 1990. LAC, as well as Canada and the United States, interrupted the indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus in 1991. The last case of poliomyelitis in the Americas occurred in Peru in 1991 and the Americas were certified polio-free in September 1994. In 1988, as a result of the progress made in the Americas, the WHA established the goal of eradicating polio by 2000 and in 2000 declared global polio eradication a public health emergency; at the time, it was endemic in 125 countries. Although the last case of polio in TTO was in 1972, in other continents, polio continued beyond 2000. This has forced the WHO to develop the Polio Eradication Endgame Strategic Plan 2013–2018 which inter alia recommended that by April 2016 the polio vaccine should be switched from the trivalent OPV (tOPV) to the bivalent OPV and the Inactivated Polio Vaccine against cVDP2. The Ministry of Health in TTO declared April 26, 2016 as the “National Switch Day,” an internationally synchronized event, where health workers in every health facility will conduct the switching of the vaccine, disposing of all tOPV2 vials.</p>
