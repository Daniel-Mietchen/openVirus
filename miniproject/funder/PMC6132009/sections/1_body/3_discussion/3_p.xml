<p>The other important finding was OPV was available well before the 1972 outbreak. It is well established that the development of vaccines to combat infectious diseases initiated over 200 years ago is the most significant discovery in the history of preventive medicine. However, did the balance between its cost, benefits, and risks all of which apply to the polio vaccine prevent its aggressive implementation. Trivalent OPV was introduced in 1963, i.e., 9 years before the 1972 outbreak and by the beginning of the 1970's polio was already eradicated from Cuba. The ease of oral administration of the OPV as opposed to intramuscular injection IPV, induction of mucosal immunity, and the public health benefit of the spread of live vaccine viruses from immunized to unimmunized contacts made the OPV popular. Following the 1972 outbreak 1 year later, the immunization of children became mandatory through the enactment of Public Health Nursery Schools and Primary Schools Immunization Act, Chapter 28:03 of 1973. The act prescribes that all children be immunized against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, measles, and yellow fever, as a legal requirement for school entry. In May 1974, the World Health Assembly (WHA) created the Expanded Program on Immunization, to achieve the goal of immunizing by 1990 all children under 5 years of age against six vaccine-preventable diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, tuberculosis, and polio.</p>
