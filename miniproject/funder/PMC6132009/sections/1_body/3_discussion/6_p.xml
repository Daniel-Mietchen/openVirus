<p>The limitations of this study are likely related to the sensitivity of AFP surveillance to detect cases, the potential of misclassification of cases, and underreporting of cases. Much has been learned about the virus that causes this dreaded disease; however, the end is not clearly in sight. If and when eradication of APM occurs, several important questions will arise. Do we need vaccination after wild poliovirus circulation has been stopped? If so, what vaccine is optimal for posteradication immunization programs? How could polio vaccines be improved and made more safe, efficacious, cheaper, and easier to deliver? These questions present a conundrum in that continued use OPV can lead to the emergence of vaccine-derived polioviruses that will inevitably lead to outbreaks. On the other hand, withdrawal of OPV will also cause immunologically susceptible populations to develop that can fuel the spread of outbreaks following reintroduction of the virus. Reintroduction can occur through accidental release from research or vaccine manufacturing facilities or acts of bioterrorism by synthetic virulent poliovirus.[
