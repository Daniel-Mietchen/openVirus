<p>The eradication of polio in the near future will not mean an end to the long-term consequences of the disease. These include continued support to those disabled and awareness of the postpolio syndrome (PPS).[
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] The exact prevalence of PPS worldwide is unknown, but it is estimated that it can affect as much as 25%â€“40% of all polio survivors. Clinically, after years or decades of stability (most commonly up to three decades after initial infection), polio victims begin to experience new or worsening disabling symptoms as they age. Although the cause of the denervation is unknown, common symptoms include muscle and joint weakness, pain, fatigue, muscle atrophy, difficulty breathing, and swallowing.
