<p>GPEI housed at the WHO aims to eradicate polio by 2019. It is one of the most ambitious and wide-reaching global health initiatives with an annual budget of US $ I billion and has reduced polio cases by 99% globally.[
 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] The GPEI includes the WHO, UNICEF, the US Centers for Disease Control, and Rotary International as spearheading partners which make all decisions about the polio program. If we look back to 1988, the WHA's original goal was to eradicate polio by 2000 and that milestone was missed and so were the next several although the cases decreased significantly. The GPEI was created after the resolution from WHA was approved.
