<p>The findings of this study confirm that in the history of Trinidad and Tobago there were three outbreaks of APM in the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century. Historical data, particularly in prevaccine periods without a high degree of human intervention, offer a unique glimpse into the ecology of infection.[
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Thus, an important finding was in earlier outbreaks the predominant age group was 0–4 years by 1972, the predominant age groups were 1–10 years and &gt;11–15 years. This finding supports the proposition that the emergence of epidemic poliomyelitis in the western world is interlinked with progressive urbanization and improving sanitary standards that delay the age of infection beyond infancy as well as the protection of passively acquired maternal antibodies.[

Reviews of cohorts of polio patients in the 1950s showed that people aged ≥15 years of age had an increased rate of bulbospinal paralysis, the most severe form of poliomyelitis.[
