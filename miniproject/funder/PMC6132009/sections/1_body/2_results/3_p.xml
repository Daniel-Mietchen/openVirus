<p>After a break of 16 years suddenly in 1971 poliomyelitis reemerged. The onset of the outbreak began with a case on November 4, 1971, and by January 1972 it reached its peak with 127 reported cases. Thereafter, it began to decline. A total of 181 cases were observed and there were 12 deaths, resulting in a case fatality rate of 6.6%. Eleven of these were in the age group 0–10 years, resulting in an age-specific mortality rate of 8/100,000 population and one was aged 21. The majority of cases (157, 87%) were aged 10 and under and 92% were under 15 years of age. The Type 1 virus was the organism responsible and this was confirmed by virus isolation in 97 (54%) cases. The overwhelming majority (93%) of the cases were inadequately immunized, while 7% gave dubious histories of immunization. Subsequently, a mass immunization drive was undertaken in January and February 1972, which succeeded in immunizing 81% of children 0–6 years and 84.9% of those 7–12 years of age. There were no cases reported from Tobago. In 1954, TTO recorded its highest birth rate ever 41.9/1000, while in 1972, the birth rate was 26.3/1000. The average birth rate between 1969 and 1971 was 24.5/1000.</p>
