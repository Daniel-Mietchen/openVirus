It held me 3 days. On the fourth, when they went to bathe me as usual, they discovered I had lost the power of my right leg.” In 1870, Charcot[

It is Charles Bell a Scottish physician attributed to be the first to record an epidemic of poliomyelitis depicting events in 1844 on the island of St. Helena.[

 <sup>th</sup> century. Beginning around 1880, an abrupt series of outbreaks of infantile paralysis were reported from several Scandinavian countries (Austria, Norway, and Sweden), Germany, England, and the United States but not in Canada, Cuba, or Brazil.
