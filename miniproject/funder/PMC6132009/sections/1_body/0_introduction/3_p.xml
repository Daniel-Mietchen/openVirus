<p>Acute poliomyelitis (APM) is an infection caused by the poliovirus, a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the enterovirus group of the Picornavirus family. The single-stranded RNA core is surrounded by a protein capsid without a lipid envelope, which makes poliovirus resistant to lipid solvents and stable at low pH. Three antigenically distinct strains are known, with Type I accounting for 85% of cases of paralytic illnesses. Infection with one type does not protect from the other types; however, immunity to each of the three strains is lifelong. Transmission occurs by close personal contact through the fecal–oral route. In the gastrointestinal tract, the virus is able of penetrating the mucosa through specialized microfold cells and replicate in underlying submucosal lymphoid tissues during the 1–3 weeks of the incubation period.[
