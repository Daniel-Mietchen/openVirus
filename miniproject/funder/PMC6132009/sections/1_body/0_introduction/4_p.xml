<p>The virus may be secreted in saliva and feces during this period, causing most host-to-host transmission. After the initial alimentary phase, the virus drains into the cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes and then into the bloodstream to invade the central nervous system. Most poliovirus infections result in no illness or produce only self-limited symptoms, however, in approximately 5% of infected patients, the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord can be affected causing flaccid paralysis involving a single extremity to complete quadriplegia. The most serious complication of paralytic poliomyelitis is a respiratory failure from paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles due to the involvement of the motor centers of the brainstem (bulbar polio) and the spinal cord, which can lead to death.</p>
