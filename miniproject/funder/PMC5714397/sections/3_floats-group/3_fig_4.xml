  <title>Cost effectiveness analysis showing the vaccine cost by reduction in mortality under two vaccination scenarios, taking into account uncertainty in vaccine cost, influenza incidence and death risk.</title>
  <p>The colours represent the uncertainty around the different scenarios. The lines represent two potential thresholds: (1) for a cost of up to 1000 for each life saved both programmes are not cost effective, (2) for a cost up to 10,000 per life saved both programmes are likely to be cost effective. The parameter values used in this figure (cost of vaccine: 17 ± 2.5 and mortality risk: 0.0025 ± 0.0005) were chosen for illustrative purposes only and should not be taken as realistic values.</p>
