<p>The package defines vaccination scenarios as a combination of the effectiveness of the vaccine against the dominant strain and the coverage over time. The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine is highly dependent on the match between the vaccine strain and the dominant strain circulating in the population. Influenza vaccine effectiveness is also age dependent, with the vaccine generally being less effective for the older age groups (e.g. because of immunosenescence). Vaccine coverage is determined by the vaccination programme. In most countries influenza vaccination is aimed at individuals aged 65 years and above, and at the high risk groups. In the United States and, more recently, in the UK the seasonal influenza vaccination programme was extended to include healthy children [
