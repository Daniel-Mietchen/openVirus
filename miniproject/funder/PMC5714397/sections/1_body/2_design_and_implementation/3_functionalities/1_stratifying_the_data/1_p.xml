<p>General functions are provided as part of the package to stratify the data and convert them to a suitable formatting for model fitting (e.g 
 <monospace>stratify_by_age(â€¦)</monospace>) and easily stratify the data into different user-specified age and risk groups. The choice of age groups and risk groups is flexible and depends on the data provided and the goal of the user. For example, for the UK the influenza occurrence data are separated into 5 age groups, while the vaccination data are divided into 7 different age groups, so it was decided to model 7 different age groups, but transform them into 5 before performing the fitting [
