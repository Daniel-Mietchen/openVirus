<p>The use of the hypergeometric distribution and the resulting computational complexity of the likelihood function above is due to the fact that the source of data on influenza incidence is dual, composed of the ILI data, which is an umbrella for several respiratory infections and virology testing which indicates which of these diseases is circulating. The actual incidence of one particular pathogen can thus only be inferred by combining these two sources. When direct data on disease prevalence are available the 
 <monospace>fluEvidenceSynthesis</monospace> package can still be used, by replacing the above likelihood function with a simplified likelihood function. The vignettes of the package provide in-depth information on how to replace the likelihood function, with a user-specified function.
