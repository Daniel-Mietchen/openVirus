<p>The resulting posterior samples of the parameters can be used to model alternative interventions and explore the changes in the resulting outbreak size. This is generally done by adapting the previously fitted epidemiological model to account for the new intervention strategy. This model is then run using the posterior parameter samples and the final disease burden can be compared under the current scenario and/or under alternative scenarios. The disease burden can also be used to calculate the cost and benefits of the alternative scenarios.</p>
