<p>The package provides a number of functions to aid with calculating the cost effectiveness. Based on existing mortality rate and data on hospitalised cases, the incidence number is transformed into the number of consultations, hospitalisations and deaths using the function 
 <monospace>public_health_outcome(…)</monospace>. These numbers can then be converted into the costs and the benefits in reduced consultations, hospitalisations and mortality due to alternative intervention methods. It is also possible to calculate the number of vaccine doses needed using the 
 <monospace>vaccine_doses(…)</monospace> function. Some of the rates and associated costs are country-specific as they depend on the healthcare system and therefore not included in the package.
