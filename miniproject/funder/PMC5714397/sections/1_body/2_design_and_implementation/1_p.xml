 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005838.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates the general workflow of the package. The package takes data on the influenza outbreak and related data, such as contact rates and demographic structure, as its input, which can then be organised into different age and risk groups. Given a set of parameters and considering the underlying model, we calculate the likelihood of observing these data. Given the data and the likelihood function, the package uses an adaptive MCMC algorithm to derive the posterior distribution of parameter values of the underlying epidemiological model. These posterior parameter values can be used to explore alternative intervention strategies, and for the cost-benefit analysis by using the functionalities of the forward modelling.
