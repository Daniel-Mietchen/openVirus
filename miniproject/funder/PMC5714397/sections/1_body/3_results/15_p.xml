<p>Performing the cost effectiveness analysis requires calculating the costs and benefits of the proposed intervention. The main cost in increasing vaccination stems from administering additional vaccine doses, which can be calculated with the 
 <monospace>vaccine_doses(â€¦)</monospace> function. Resulting benefits will mostly come from associated decreases in the number of consultations, reduced hospital admissions and finally reduced mortality. Generally, these values are calculated as the proportion of influenza cases that result in consultations, hospital admissions etc. The pseudocode below shows how to calculate the cost associated with a new vaccine calendar, assuming that 7% of infected people visit the GP and 0.2% and 2% of infected individuals are hospitalised for the low risk and high risk groups respectively.
