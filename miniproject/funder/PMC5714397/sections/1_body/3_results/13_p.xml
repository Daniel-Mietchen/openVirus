<p>The inference step results in a number of posterior samples for the parameters and contact data. We can now use these samples and model the outcome of our alternative vaccination scenario. Then we calculate the difference in influenza burden between the original and our alternative vaccination scenarios. This is done by taking samples from each season and strain combination and calculating the disease burden over all the seasons/strains of the new scenario relative to the original scenario (using the 
 <monospace>vaccination_scenario(â€¦)</monospace> function). The results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005838.g003">Fig 3</xref>, showing a reduction of influenza cases in both the low and high risk groups under the new scenario. The magnitude of the reduction is dependent on the level of vaccine coverage. The higher coverage (80%) results in a reduction of around 5.9 million, while lower coverage (40%) results in a reduction of influenza cases of approximately 3.5 million (
