<p>Another important aspect of cost effectiveness calculations is the reduction of mortality due to incidence reduction. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005838.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the cost of different vaccination scenarios as a function of reduction in mortality. More sophisticated cost effectiveness analysis could also take into account the risk and cost of hospitalisation as well as indirect effects due to increased vaccine-induced immunity in the population.
