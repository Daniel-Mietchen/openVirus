<p>The 
 <monospace>inference(â€¦)</monospace> function is a high level function that implements the whole inference part of the workflow. This function takes all the data (as described earlier in this manuscript) and returns posterior samples of the parameters. The documentation of the package also shows how to adapt parts of the inference function for use with a different underlying epidemiological model, or different likelihood function. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005838.g002">Fig 2</xref> highlights the difference between our prior distribution of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the posterior distribution of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> following parameter inference. In the 2007/08 season the posterior is very similar to the prior. This is probably because in that season the incidence of H3N2 was very low compared to the other two seasons shown here.
