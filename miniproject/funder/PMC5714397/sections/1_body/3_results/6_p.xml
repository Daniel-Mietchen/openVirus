<p>Performing the default parameter inference implemented in this package (see [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) using user-specified data is straightforward by running the analysis using the 
 <monospace>inference(â€¦)</monospace> function, that needs to be run for each season and strain (as illustrated in the R (pseudo)code example below). Note that for performance reasons it is advised to adapt this pseudocode to run in parallel for each season and strain.
