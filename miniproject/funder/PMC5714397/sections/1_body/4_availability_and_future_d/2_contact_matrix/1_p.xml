<p>Currently no explicit model of contact rates is included and inference of the contact matrix is performed by bootstrapping the available contact data [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One model we are working on is to use demographic data to inform contact inference, similar to the approach explored by [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Another simplification in the current approach is the assumption that the contact matrix is constant throughout the season. Indeed, contact matrices are dependent on behaviour and this can change during the year [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], either due to external drivers (e.g. school vacation) or in response to influenza (e.g. staying at home when sick [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). These changes in behaviour could then be incorporated into the contact model. Due to the modularity of the package it is possible to plug-in such a contact model and explore its effect on intervention strategies.
