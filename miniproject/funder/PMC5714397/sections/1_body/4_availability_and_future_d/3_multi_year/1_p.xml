<p>The package simulates each strain and season independently. An interesting possible addition would be to implement multi-year models, i.e. models where the current state is influenced by the previous years results. One possible approach would be to use the posterior of the previous season as a prior for the next season, but that would not capture dynamic effects of alternative vaccination strategies. Capturing long-term dynamic effects requires an explicit multi-year epidemiological model, which introduces challenges of modelling antigenic evolution of antigenic strains as well as waning of immunity [
