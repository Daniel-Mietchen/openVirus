<p>The R package we presented here was developed to make advanced analysis of disease dynamics more approachable for data analysts and scientists interested in public health related questions. The package implemented the whole process of preparing the data, running the model, inferring posterior parameter distributions and performing cost effectiveness analysis. The approach implemented is based on the method by [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The package is modular in design, such that the method can be adapted by, for example, changing the underlying epidemiological model and/or likelihood function. While advanced methods such as implemented in this package are inherently complex and traditionally applied by specialised researchers, the package is designed to make the analysis accessible to a wider group of researchers. The package is freely available under the GPL-3.0 license on github at
