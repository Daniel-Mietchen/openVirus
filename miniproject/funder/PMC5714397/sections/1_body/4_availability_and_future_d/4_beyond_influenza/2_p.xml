<p>The likelihood function is suitable for any disease where most of the data on disease occurrence is a proxy for the actual occurrence, augmented with a smaller source of direct data (virological). If more direct data are available then it might be appropriate to replace the current likelihood function with a (simplified) likelihood that is only based on the direct data.</p>
