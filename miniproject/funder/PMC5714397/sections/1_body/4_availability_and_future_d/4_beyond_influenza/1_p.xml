<p>The package has been developed with a focus on influenza data, but could potentially be adapted to predict the impact and cost effectiveness for a range of interventions for other infectious diseases. The parts that are disease specific are the likelihood function and the transmission model. The transmission model is an SEIR model which can be used to capture a wide variety of diseases. If this model is not suitable for your analysis then it is of course possible to replace it with another model while still using the other parts of the package.</p>
