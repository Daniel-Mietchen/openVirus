<p>In-depth cost effectiveness analysis of disease intervention strategies has been difficult to perform due to a variety of reasons, including the inherent complexity of disease dynamics, lack of data and difficulty in predicting the success of the proposed interventions. Currently available tools for analysing epidemiological data mainly focus on statistical analyses and simple regression models [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which is not sufficient to model the population wide effects of proposed interventions, which include both direct and indirect effects. The exception here is amei, an R package for optimising vaccination strategies in using an adaptive management framework while evaluating costs of an underlying stochastic epidemiological model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005838.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but this package mainly relies on the use of a single (high quality) source of information. Synthesising information from different sources of data and performing a detailed cost effectiveness analysis of control strategies is not supported by the currently available packages.
