<p>The package is particularly suitable for modelling and evaluating intervention strategies for directly transmissible diseases that use proxy data for incidence, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI) counts for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The package deals with the whole pipeline, starting from re-organising usersâ€™ different data sources to standardise their format to be compatible with the package, to modelling, Bayesian inference, analysing vaccination scenarios and cost effectiveness. Crucially, it includes a number of high level functions that can do a particular analysis, and also provides access to the low level functions that are needed if the user wants to adapt the analysis and tailor it to their specific needs (e.g. user-provided data may be different than the data we have accessible).</p>
