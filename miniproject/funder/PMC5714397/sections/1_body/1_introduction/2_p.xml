<p>In an effort to fill this gap and make sophisticated cost effectiveness analysis methods more accessible and standardised we have developed an R package that simplifies the process. Focusing on influenza, we present a package that offers detailed cost effectiveness analyses of intervention strategies in a Bayesian inference framework that applies evidence synthesis techniques to combine the available evidence from multiple data sources that can be stratified by age and risk status and combined with age-stratified mixing patterns. The implementation is based on a Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) model previously developed for pandemic influenza [
