<p>The model is an agent-based, stochastic simulation of dengue transmission in the Mexican state of Yucat√°n; the model represents the state-wide population (approximately 1.82 million people) in households, with daily movement to workplaces and schools. Each location has a local mosquito population, infectious mosquitoes may migrate between adjacent locations, and all mosquito populations are modulated by seasonal forces (see Fig A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>). General details of the model remain the same as in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with detailed updates discussed in the SI, namely updated empirical data (Section 1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>), more realistic human aging (Section 2.1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>), serotype introduction (Section 2.2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>), and mosquito age-at-infection and lifespan models (Sections 2.4, 2.5 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>), and refined fitting procedure (Section 3 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>). For all analyses, we sampled across the 1000 best parameter combinations from the fitting results. We match each intervention result to a baseline non-intervention result using the same parameter combination. We report median values from the sampled results.
