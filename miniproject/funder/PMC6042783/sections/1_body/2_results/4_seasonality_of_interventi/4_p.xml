<p>Changing either campaign rollout period or IRS durability shifts the optimal start date. For example, the 1-day rollout curve lags roughly 45 days after the 90-day curve, or approximately half of the treatment window. However, if we compare campaigns’ “insecticide active” windows (the sum of the campaign rollout period and IRS durability) instead of start date, all optimal interventions share the same midpoint (late August to early September; see Fig D,E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>). This trend means that all optimal campaign options build coverage while
