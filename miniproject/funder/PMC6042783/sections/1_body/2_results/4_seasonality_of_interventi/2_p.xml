<p>Increasing IRS coverage (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., treating additional houses) increases the maximum 10-year cumulative effectiveness, as does increasing delivery speed (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., decreasing the number of days to rollout the intervention) and increasing IRS durability (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., how long IRS is active at a treated location after application) and efficacy (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., how much the IRS decreases the local mosquito population). Increasing coverage, durability, and efficacy also increase minimum effectiveness. In those cases, the maximum increases more than minimum, meaning the absolute gain by deploying optimally is also higher. However, by examining the ratio of max and min, we observe a pattern of diminishing returns for both coverage and durability, but not for efficacy. Rollout speed has a different effect: in addition to more precisely targeting the best day for treatment, it appears also possible to more precisely target the worst day.
