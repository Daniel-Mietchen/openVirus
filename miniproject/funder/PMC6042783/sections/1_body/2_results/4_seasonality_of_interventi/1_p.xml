<p>We considered different annual campaign start dates for several sensitivity dimensions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006570.g001">Fig 1dâ€“1f</xref>) and calculated the cumulative effectiveness over the first 10 years of active intervention,

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The efficacy response is qualitatively similar to the response to changes in coverage. We maintained a consistent reference scenario for each study, a 90 day campaign at 75% coverage with 90 day IRS durability and 80% IRS efficacy, and for each analysis only changed one of the features from that reference. For each feature, we considered three levels.
