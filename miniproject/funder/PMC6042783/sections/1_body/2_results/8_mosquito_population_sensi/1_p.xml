<p>To investigate the applicability of these results to settings with other levels of dengue burden, we considered larger and smaller baseline mosquito populations (

 </sub>); see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for summary results. Changing the mosquito population varies the exposure rate that people in the model experience (also known as the force of infection). Several other parameters contribute to the exposure rate, but of the fitted parameters, the mosquito population has the most direct effect on exposure rate.
