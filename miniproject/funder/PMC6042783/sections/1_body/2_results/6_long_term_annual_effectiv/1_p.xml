<p>Effectiveness wanes over time, even for optimal proactive timing, as naturally acquired immunity declines (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006570.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). Initially, the 75% coverage, proactive intervention prevents nearly 90% of cases (0.87 effectiveness in the first year). However, within 10 years, this benefit is cut in half, and to less than a quarter by 20 years, as the population seroprevalence also declines (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006570.g002">Fig 2c</xref>, black lines). Effectiveness continues to dip further (see Fig G in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref> for the time series out to 40 years), though it eventually rebounds to settle around 0.23 (roughly a quarter of the original value). A similar pattern emerges for the other coverage levels, though shifted earlier and more pronounced: 50% coverage drops from its initial 0.75 effectiveness to less than a quarter of that before year 15, ultimately settling around 0.14 (a fifth of its initial value), and 25% coverage drops from initial 0.49 to less than a quarter of that before year 10, and ultimately settles around 0.07 (a seventh its initial value). All coverage levels see a dip in seroprevalence, corresponding to both the peak population benefit (in prevented cases) and risk (due to lack of immunizing infections). Seroprevalence ultimately rises as effectiveness declines, though not back to the initial levels, and this is what leads to the later observed increase in effectiveness.
