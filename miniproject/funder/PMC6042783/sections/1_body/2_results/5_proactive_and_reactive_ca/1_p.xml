<p>The maximal and minimal effectiveness respectively correspond to campaigns that are proactive—
 <italic>i.e</italic>., applied when transmission first becomes likely, but before many cases are observed—and reactive—
 <italic>i.e</italic>., applied in response to peak cases, when other factors are already driving down transmission probability. In the real world, there would likely be a public health organization response to dengue-related observations (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., a certain number of cases), triggered at different times from year-to-year. Since seasonal drivers in our model do not vary year-to-year, however, we approximate these proactive and reactive responses with fixed dates. We use May 27 (proactive) and November 18 (reactive) as general approximations of the best and worst timing, respectively, for campaigns with 90-day rollouts and 90-day durabilities; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006570.g001">Fig 1c and 1d</xref>. Proactive campaigns directly reduce transmission by substantially curtailing what would otherwise be large populations of mosquitoes (due to increased precipitation) that have shorter incubation periods (due to warmer weather). As reactive campaigns tend to start after epidemics have peaked, they have little direct impact during epidemics; instead, they increase the likelihood of extinction for off-season transmission chains (Fig I in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006570.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Fewer off-season transmission chains means outbreaks in subsequent years must be initiated by random introductions, rather than beginning immediately from chains that have survived the off-season. Although proactive campaigns are better, the delay in epidemic onset achieved by reactive campaigns results in substantial effectiveness, despite there being no control during most of the epidemic. Our more detailed model agrees with previous work that used more homogeneous assumptions (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., without age structure or explicit households) on space-spraying-based dengue control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], as well as IRS-based control of malaria [
