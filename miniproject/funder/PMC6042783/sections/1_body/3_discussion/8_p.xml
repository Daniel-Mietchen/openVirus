<p>Though we specifically modeled dengue, the qualitative aspects of our results are useful for understanding dynamics of other similarly infectious, immunizing vector-borne diseases like chikungunya and Zika [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Because these viruses were novel in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], there was no widespread population immunity to them, unlike what we see with dengue and which is required to obtain effectiveness in our model. Without pre-existing immunity, our model predicts very low effectiveness even with high vector control coverage. As such, achieving high effectiveness against emerging chikungunya and Zika with vector control likely would have required much more ambitious interventions than we consider here. As such, we should not have expected ongoing vector control efforts—short of eradication of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>—to prevent those outbreaks. However, vector control targeting dengue will reduce cases of these and other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> transmitted arboviruses, especially in regions where these diseases have become endemic.
