<p>Our model results indicate that an IRS-like approach that increases mosquito mortality in households can be effective at preventing dengue cases. Exact benefits will vary with local ecological and epidemiological factors, but we expect two main qualitative outcomes will apply when any efficacious, semi-durable vector control like IRS is introduced to an endemic region. First, proactive interventions will typically outperform reactive interventions. Second, these interventions will have effectiveness that wanes over a period of years (as observed in Singapore [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) similar to the “honeymoon” effect predicted in some vaccine scenarios (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., measles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]), and may be dangerous (as predicted for other vector control interventions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) to stop abruptly. We believe these conclusions would be broadly applicable in any discussion about IRS strategy, and that our modeling approach could be tuned to other locations and provide useful estimates of expected performance.
