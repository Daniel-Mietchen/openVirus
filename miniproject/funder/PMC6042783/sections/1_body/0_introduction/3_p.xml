<p>Existing control activities have focused on the primary vectors, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with approaches directed against both immature aquatic stages and adult mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. History indicates that vector-control approaches can work—the near-elimination of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Latin America is a well-documented example of thorough, well-funded, and successful vector control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]—however, recent efforts have failed to prevent the resurgence and expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and subsequent regional expansion and intensification of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Cost is certainly a factor. Vector control using insecticides (
 <italic>e.g</italic>. space-spraying, larvicides) requires skilled staff and stable funding, and even then some approaches may be ineffective for controlling dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Some approaches, like mitigating potential breeding sites, only work with widespread community participation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and are not sustainable as implemented in many locations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Modern vector control activities are not sufficient to control dengue, and because epidemiological assessments are typically neglected, we lack data on the potential effectiveness of these activities on dengue or any of the other arborviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While new and old vector control interventions have some promise, the data challenges prevent public health officials from estimating how successful interventions are likely to be, and what options they have to ensure effective control efforts.
