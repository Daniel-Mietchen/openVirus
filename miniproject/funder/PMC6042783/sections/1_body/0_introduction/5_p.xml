<p>IRS appears to have a large impact on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mortality. IRS campaigns to eradicate malaria in the Mediterranean region appear to have led to the elimination of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], contributed to the elimination of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Guyana and the Cayman islands, respectively. Work in Iquitos, Peru, indicates that treating household surfaces with IRS reduces the likelihood of observing adult mosquitoes by &gt;70% up to 12 weeks post spraying [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All of these results indicate high IRS efficacy. Regarding durability, current IRS insecticides last an estimated three months, but new formulations might last as long as five to eight months [
