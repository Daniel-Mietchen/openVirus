<p>Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is an example of a well-understood approach with potentially under-exploited promise for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> control. IRS is the treatment of common mosquito resting surfaces inside houses with a long-lasting insecticide. Because 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strongly prefer feeding on humans and rest primarily indoors, they are more likely to be reached by IRS than by space sprays, especially outdoor treatment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Like other insecticide-based approaches, IRS necessitates specialized training, is time-consuming to deliver, may require a campaign to garner public acceptance, and must be tailored to region-specific factors, such as the insecticide resistance of local mosquitoes. Before making these investments, public health officials will likely require information on optimal deployment, scalability, and the long-term effectiveness of IRS. Large scale empirical studies to answer these questions are costly and take many years, but mathematical models–calibrated by real epidemic data and parametrized based on small-scale empirical studies on IRS entomological efficacy (
 <italic>i.e</italic>., effect on mosquito mortality) and durability–can provide a reasonable basis for action.
