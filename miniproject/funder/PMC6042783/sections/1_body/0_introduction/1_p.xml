<p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral pathogen resulting in an estimated annual global economic burden of 9 billion USD [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dengue incidence has trended upward the last several decades due to a combination of increased urbanization, human mobility and trade, irregular water supplies, climatological changes, and ineffective or unsustainable vector control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The complex human immune response to dengue—particularly the temporary cross-protection between the four known serotypes, which fades and potentially enhances disease-risk—complicates public health responses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Vaccine development has focused on creating vaccines efficacious against all four serotypes, and several such vaccines are currently in clinical trials [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Sanofi-Pasteur produced a vaccine (known as CYD-TDV or Dengvaxia) that has been licensed in several countries, but trial results indicate that its efficacy depends on past dengue exposure [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], leading some to hypothesize that the vaccine may act like a natural infection, providing temporary protection but increasing the disease risk for recipients with no infection history [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on these results, the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine may not in practice be effective in regions with low or moderate seroprevalence [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As more trial data has become available, Sanofi-Pasteur has advised national health organizations and medical professionals to only vaccinate patients with likely prior dengue infection [
