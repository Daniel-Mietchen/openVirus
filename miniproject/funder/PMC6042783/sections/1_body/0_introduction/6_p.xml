<p>Regarding the potential evolution of insecticide resistance in the vector, recent work in MÃ©rida, Mexico, showed that high resistance to pyrethroids in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> can be controlled when implementing IRS using alternative formulations, such as bendiocarb [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006570.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], suggest a practical insecticide management plan for IRS where various formulations are rotated to counter the evolution of resistance [
