 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has strong ecological plasticity, which allows it to adapt rapidly to a wide range of habitats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For instance, although 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> originated in Asian forests, it has now adapted to a range of rural and urban human environments. Females of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are opportunistic feeders and can take their bloodÂ meal from most groups of vertebrates, from cold- to warm-blooded animals, including reptiles, birds and amphibians, although they display a marked biting preference for mammals, including humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This broad spectrum of host preferences contributes to the invasion and settlement of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in diverse environments, from natural ones to densely populated urban areas. At the interface between natural and anthropogenic environments, its zoophilic behaviour can transfer enzootic arboviruses from animals to humans. To assess this possibility, we determined the oral susceptibility of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from CAR to enzootic CHIKV strain isolated in the country.
