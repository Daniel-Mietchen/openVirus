<p>The growing epidemic role of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Central Africa is, however, not restricted to CHIKV: the species was also involved in the transmission of dengue virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Zika virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], suggesting that this vector has strongly affected the epidemiology of a number of arboviruses in the region. This species was introduced in 2000 in Cameroon and spread quickly to most countries of Central Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], where it has outcompeted the native vector 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to become dominant in some urban locations in Cameroon, CAR and Gabon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Molecular studies of East/Central/South African viral strains circulating in areas where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was the primary vector have shown a specific change in the amino acid composition of the membrane fusion glycoprotein (change E1-A226V), which was interpreted as an adaptation of the virus for enhanced transmission by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Genetic comparisons of CHIKV strains circulating recently in Central Africa with strains isolated between 1975 and 1984 in CAR showed significant differences compatible with rapid adaptation to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, as observed previously in other countries in the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was reported for the first time in CAR in 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and became the most prevalent 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species, outcompeting the native 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].
