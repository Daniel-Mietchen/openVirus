<p>The chikungunya virus (CHIKV, Togaviridae, 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) is an 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne virus maintained primarily in African enzootic forest cycles involving monkeys and arboreal mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The virus has spilled over secondarily to humans, from whom it was first isolated in Tanzania in 1952 during an epidemic of dengue-like illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Chikungunya outbreaks were subsequently recorded in rural areas throughout Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the virus also spread in Asia during the 1950s and 1960s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Three distinct genotypes of CHIKV have been recognized: Asian, West African and East/Central/South African [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the 2000s, the virus induced major epidemiological changes by extending its geographical range to new continents, causing epidemic urban waves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Asian lineage spread in the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and the South Pacific region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the East/Central/South African lineage to the south-west Indian Ocean, including La Réunion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and to Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Central Africa, the virus was previously observed only during rural epidemics, but it has resurged, causing major urban outbreaks in Cameroon, Congo and Gabon between 2006 and 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Gabon, the main vector species was 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], even in remote villages in the heart of the rainforest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
