<p>Both local 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations can transmit an enzootic CHIKV. The risk of emergence of arbovirus diseases such as chikungunya should therefore be considered for several reasons, including the abundance of the main anthropogenic vectors (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>), the movement of populations that are immunologically na√Øve and the diversity of wild fauna. In order to prevent the emergence of chikungunya in CAR, entomological and virological monitoring must be strengthened.
