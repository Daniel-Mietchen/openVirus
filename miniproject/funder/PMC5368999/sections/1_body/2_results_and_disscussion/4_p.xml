<p>The CHIKV strain used in our study was isolated from a sylvatic vector, 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>. Desdouits and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] showed that this strain differs from the East/Central/South African strain responsible for the recent chikungunya outbreaks reported in numerous Central African countries. The ability of these major vectors to transmit arboviruses has not previously been assessed in CAR, although many important viral strains, including CHIKV, are endemic and despite the risk of imminent outbreaks of arboviral infections such as chikungunya in the country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our finding that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, which are the main vectors involved in the transmission of dengue virus and CHIKV in urban environments, can also transmit a local CHIKV strain suggests that both vectors can serve as a bridge between non-human primates and humans and that there is a risk for the emergence of this type of virus, as suggested by Paupy et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, if the virus is transferred to a human-dominated environment (city or village), inter-human transmission might occur, leading to outbreaks.
