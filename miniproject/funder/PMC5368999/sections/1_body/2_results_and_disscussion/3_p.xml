<p>Since the outbreak of chikungunya in La Réunion due to a viral strain harbouring substitution of an alanine to a valine at position 226 (E1-A226V) of the E1 glycoprotein, which enhanced the transmissibility of CHIKV by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], numerous studies have been conducted worldwide on the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, only a few have been conducted in Cameroon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and more recently in Senegal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], providing information on Africa. In our study, the dissemination rates were higher (≥ 80%) at 14 dpi, and mosquitoes were susceptible to transmitting CHIKV only 14 days after they had taken the infected meal. In a study by Vega-Rua and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the dissemination rates increased to 100% at 6 dpi in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> infected with two CHIKV strains, one of which was isolated from imported cases (CHIKV 2010–1630) and the second in France (CHIKV 2010–1909); the titre of the blood meal used was 10
 <sup>7.3</sup> plaque-forming units per ml. Other studies have shown efficient dissemination of the E1-226 V variant, which was detectable in the salivary glands of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from 2 dpi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. More recently, Vega-Rua and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] showed that around 80% of both species can transmit CHIKV at 6 dpi, but the dissemination rate decreased progressively to day 14. The extrinsic incubation periods observed in the present study are different from that observed by Diagne et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] using local CHIKV strains, which was 5 days for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.
