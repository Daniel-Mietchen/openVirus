<p>We analysed 75 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 66 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> engorged females. For 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 16 of 75 engorged females were analysed at 7 dpi and the rest (
 <italic>n</italic> = 59) at 14 dpi, and, for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 22 of 66 were tested at 7 dpi and 44 at 14 dpi. At 7 dpi, the infection rates were comparable (Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.32, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), whereas, at 14 dpi, the infection rate was more than twice as high in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (27%) than in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (11%), although the difference was not significant (Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.08, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At 7 dpi, the dissemination rates were 87% in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 42% in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, but with no statistically significant difference (Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.11, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At 14 dpi, the dissemination rates were similar in the two species, at 87 and 80%. No positive saliva samples were found at 7 dpi in either species, but at 14 dpi CHIKV was detected in the saliva of four 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (28%) and three 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (75%) mosquitos, with comparable transmission rates (Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.24, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All pools (unexposed) included in the experiment were negative. The low infection rates found in both species may be due to the origin of the CHIKV strain in the sylvan mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic>.
