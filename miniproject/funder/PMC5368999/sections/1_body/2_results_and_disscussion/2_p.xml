<p>Emerging and re-emerging 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika are major threats in the tropics and also in temperate countries. Global changes have played an important role in the spread of these arboviruses from their original niches to most parts of the world. Yellow fever, which is an arbovirus disease that can be prevented by vaccination, recently reappeared in Angola before spreading to Kenya and to China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], this region is considered an area of active circulation of different arboviruses and consequently represents a source of viruses that are “concealed” in other parts of the world by human displacement. Our findings show that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> can transmit the CHIKV strain of enzootic origin, as viral particles were detected in saliva at 14 dpi, with 5.4 ± 0.8 log

 <sub>10</sub> particles from 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, respectively.
