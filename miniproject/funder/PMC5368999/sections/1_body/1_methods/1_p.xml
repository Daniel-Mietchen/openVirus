 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were sampled in 2014 in Bangui (04°21'N, 18°33'E), the capital of CAR. For each species, larvae and pupae were collected in several peri-domestic containers and reared to adulthood in the insectary of the Institut Pasteur de Bangui under controlled conditions (70–80% humidity, 28 ± 1 °C). Once identified as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, adults were pooled according to species in separate cages with free access to a 10% sucrose solution until experimental infection with CHIKV.
