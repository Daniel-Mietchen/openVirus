<p>The CHIKV strain used for experimental infection of mosquitos was an enzootic strain (ArB10262) isolated in CAR in 1978 from 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> in forested environments in Bozo (5°7'60"N, 10°28'60"E)
 <italic>.</italic> The virus was stored at the Institut Pasteur de Bangui in a lyophilized form in sealed glass vials at room temperature. This strain is one of 15 CHIKV strains sequenced and analysed recently by Desdouits and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The virus was suspended in 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline and inoculated into an approximately 80% confluent Vero E6 cell line (two passages) until strong cytopathic effects were seen. Cells and supernatant were recovered from the second passage and stored at -80 °C until experimental mosquito infections.
