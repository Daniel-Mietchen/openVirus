<p>Mosquito tissue was ground in 600 μl of sterile phosphate buffered saline 1×. RNA was extracted with a mini QIAamp RNA Viral kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, eluted in 50 μl elution buffer and stored at -80 °C until analysis. RNA retro-transcription was performed with 25 μl of the RNA template and random hexamer primers in the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA), according to the manufacturers’ instructions. qRT-PCR was conducted in an ABI 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System and the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 5 μl cDNA, 12.5 μl 2× Master Mix, 1 μl of each primer (10 mmol/l) and 4.5 μl of sterile water. The primers and probe sequences used have been described by Pastorino and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], as follows: forward primer: 5′-AAG CTY CGC GTC CTT TAC CAA G-3′, reverse primer: 5′-CCA AAT TGT CCY GGT CTT CCT-3′, and probe 5′ FAM-CCA ATG TCY TCM GCC TGG ACA CCT TT-TAMRA 3′. The thermocycling conditions were: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 10 min.
