<p>Another interesting ZIKV protein that appears to have both conserved and unique cellular interactors across flaviviruses and plays a central role in virusâ€“host adaptation, is the non-structural protein NS4B. Indeed, ZIKV-NS4B associates with subunits of the ATP synthase (ATP1A1, 1A2, 1A3, 1B and 6V1H), voltage-dependent anion selective channel proteins (VDAC1,2,3) and calcium-binding mitochondrial proteins (e.g., SLC25A, SLC38A1), as well as several components of the cytochrome C oxidase complex (COX15, MT-CO2, NDUFA4) (

These interactors argue for a conserved association between flavivirus NS4Bs and mitochondria in virus-infected cells, eventually leading to a profound alteration of mitochondria morphodynamics. Since mitochondria are central to regulate antiviral immune responses, these interactions may contribute to perturbation of innate immune mechanisms through mitochondria elongation as proposed recently [

In addition to mitochondrial proteins, ZIKV NS4B appears to bind cellular proteins involved in protein stability and quality control in both SK-N-BE2 and HEK293T cells. For instance, STT3B, is involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, ICMT, mediating targeting of isoprenylated proteins to the cell membrane, and the autophagosome-associated protein SQSTM1 (p62), which is in line with a general and conserved role of autophagy in flavivirus infections [
