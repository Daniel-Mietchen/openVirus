<p>In addition to capsid and NS4B, several novel ZIKV NS5 binders were recently identified in these proteomics surveys. Among these, multiple members of the PAF1C complex (Leo1, CDC73, CTR9 and PAF1), confirming similar observations previously made on DENV-NS5 by the Gamarnik group [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Importantly, while these interactions appear highly conserved among DENV, ZIKV, JEV and WNV-NS5s, a moderate and reciprocal effect on viral replication was observed upon gene silencing (2-fold increase and 2-fold decrease for ZIKV and JEV infectivity, respectively) [

Interestingly, NS5 has also been associated with modulation of alternative splicing, as reported by earlier studies on the DENV-NS5 interactome revealing an association of NS5 with the U5 snRNP particle, CD2BP2 and DDX23, providing evidence of viral interference with alternative splicing events, eventually leading to changes in the abundance of specific mRNA isoforms of known antiviral factors [
