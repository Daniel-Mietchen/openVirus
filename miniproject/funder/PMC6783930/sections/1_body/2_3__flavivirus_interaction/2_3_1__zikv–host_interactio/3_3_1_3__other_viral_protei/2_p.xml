<p>Furthermore, among the novel cellular targets identified in the ZIKV NS4A interactome is ANKLE2, a protein previously shown to cause autosomal recessive microcephaly in humans [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, in an ANKLE2-heterozygous mutant drosophila model, expression of NS4A reduced brain size, suggesting that NS4A might induce neurotoxic effects, at least under limiting amounts of functional ANKLE2.
