<p>In addition to PPI, flaviviruses were also shown to exploit their own genomic RNA (gRNA) or subgenomic derivatives, such as the subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), to “sponge” critical RNA-binding host proteins out of the cellular pool, or to specifically inhibit or redirect their homeostatic regulatory functions [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this respect, recent studies have tried to chart systematically these interactions using different MS-based approaches. For instance, using a TUX-MS-based method (thiouracil cross-linking mass-spectrometry), Viktorovskaya and colleagues reported the identification of 79 proteins specifically associated with the DENV gRNA [

Among these, proteins earlier involved in PPI or associated with flavivirus replication were consistently identified (e.g., PAF1 and multiple hnRNPs), as well as novel host factors previously not associated with flavivirus infections (e.g., RBMX, RNA-binding motif protein X chromosome; NONO, non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein; and HMCES, embryonic stem cell-specific 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-binding protein). Importantly, depletion of RBMX and NONO by RNAi significantly reduced DENV titers, confirming their functional relevance in DENV replication. Similar studies were also performed using an alternative cross-linking approach based on the use of 5′-end biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides specific to the DENV gRNA and very stringent cut-off criteria. Interestingly this approach identified only 12 host proteins specifically associated with the gRNA and further validated as bona fide interactors in RNA-IP-WB experiments. Among these, depletion of CSDE1 (cold-shock domain-containing protein E1) and hnRNPC (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2) reduced ~50% of infectious titers [
