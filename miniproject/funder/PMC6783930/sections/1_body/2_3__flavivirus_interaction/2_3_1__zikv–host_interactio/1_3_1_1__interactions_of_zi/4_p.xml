<p>Altogether, flavivirus capsids evidently evolved evasive mechanisms through binding/sequestration of ZC3HAV1 and other RNA-binding proteins (e.g., UPF1, LARP7, NGDN). Capsid proteins are apparently exploiting their versatile subcellular localization (both nuclear and cytoplasmic) and their intrinsic hydrophobic character to simultaneously highjack and diverge regulation or expression of specific transcripts.</p>
