<p>Some members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family are considered highly pathogenic infectious agents and knowledge on their interactions is pivotal to understand these pathogens in order to identify new forms of therapy. This is particularly true for epidemic viruses such as Zika virus, which since 2016 has left a devastating impact on large populations in southern America. In an effort to understand the pathogenicity of this virus, a number of laboratories employed systems analysis to elucidate the functions of individual proteins and the virus as a whole.
