<p>Several studies systematically investigated the impact of flavivirus infections on protein abundance on a global scale [

This approach revealed 199 downregulated proteins and 259 upregulated proteins, including proteins with functions in arrest of cell cycle progression (e.g., CDK2, ERBB2) and neural differentiation (e.g., HDAC7 and NeuroD1) or previously associated with viral replication (e.g., MAP4K4, TLR4 and DDX6). Importantly, this approach also revealed an activation of the DNA repair machinery, as inferred by an upregulation of proteins such as FANCD1, BRCA1 or MRE11A. Interestingly, these observations were later complemented by the identification of several hyperphosphorylation events across the DNA damage signaling pathway (see
