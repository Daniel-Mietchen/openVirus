<p>Recently, additional reports investigated further the impact of ZIKV infection on human mesenchymal stem cells using the MudPIT method (multidimensional protein identification technology). This identified a profound downregulation of PI3K/AKT and mTOR, as well as dysregulation of several components of the phosphatidylinositol pathway [

Alternative studies using shotgun proteomics and TMT (tandem mass tag) labeling confirmed and expanded the observed impairment of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis previously observed in 2D- and 3D-models of ZIKV-infected NPC, also to neurons and neural stem cells [

Using this method to systematically compare African and Asian ZIKV isolate representatives, revealed differential responses especially in the context of neurospheres. Among these, HSPB1 emerged as one of the most downregulated proteins in neurospheres, while DCX was profoundly upregulated in NPC, confirming the existence of significant viral isolate- and cellular background-dependent specificities on proteins that are relevant for neuron-specific functions.
