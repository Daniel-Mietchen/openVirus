<p>Collectively, the analysis of PTMs in flavivirus-infected cells starts to unravel unappreciated cellular activities. Development of techniques to study PTMs as well as development in bioinformatic tools allowing better interpretation of PTM activities, hold promise to dramatically accelerate our understanding of virusâ€“host interactions and to appreciate additional important pathways engaged during virus infections.</p>
