<p>Another important PTM is ubiquitination, which becomes more and more accessible to proteomics analysis and has recently been studied in the context of flavivirus infections [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. For instance, Zhang and colleagues recently reported the use of an elegant hydrolysis-resistant ubiquitin variant (HA-UbL73*) in a functional proteomic screen. This work identified several host proteins differentially mono-ubiquitylated upon DENV infection, unraveling the ER-resident protein AUP1 as differentially ubiquitin-modified in DENV-infected cells. AUP1, a lipid droplet-localized type-III membrane protein existing predominantly in the mono-ubiquitylated form, appears to be the main trigger of DENV-induced lipophagy, and the newly identified NS4Aâ€“AUP1 interaction is sufficient to trigger its acyltransferase activity.
