<p>Furthermore, a profound upregulation of the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)/ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) DNA-damage pathway, was observed at multiple levels (e.g., hyperphosphorylation of several substrates of ATR, DNAPK and downstream effector proteins) including a number of proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation and DNA damage checkpoint (TOP2B, CDK1). Altogether, these effects provide possible explanations for the observed ZIKV-induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], suggesting an important role in cell death of neuronal progenitors. Phosphoproteomic analysis also supports a prominent role of Zika virus on neurogenesis. p38 MAPK and downstream targets (HSPBI and ATF7), MARCKS (one of the main PKC substrates) and DPSYL2, all of which positively modulate neurite outgrowth and brain development [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] are differentially phosphorylated in cells infected with ZIKA virus. However, at this stage only a relatively limited number of phosphorylation events can be linked to a given function in a protein. In light of the abundance of differentially phosphorylated residues that have not been reported previously, such datasets constitute a largely unexplored treasure that will reveal its enormous potential only in light of mechanistic functional studies on individual phosphorylation sites.
