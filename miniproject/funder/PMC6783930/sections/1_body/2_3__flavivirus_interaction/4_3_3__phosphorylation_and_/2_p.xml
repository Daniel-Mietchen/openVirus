<p>In the case of ZIKV, only one study so far reported a time-resolved phosphoproteomic analysis of ZIKV-infected cells [

Similarly, to JEV and WNV, 1216 proteins were modulated upon ZIKV infection, and analysis of enriched cellular functions affected by ZIKV infection identified cellular assembly and organization, cell-cycle regulation, as well as nervous system (NS) development and neurological diseases. In line with earlier reports, also in case of ZIKV the ATM, AKT/mTOR and ERK/MAPK signaling cascades were significantly regulated, as inferred by dephosphorylation of multiple AKT1 substrates (e.g., DNMT1, TBC1D4, LARP6), mTOR targets (e.g., ANKRD17, LARP1, BAG3, EEF2K, WNK1), the central kinase RPS6KB1 and its main effector protein RPS6. Similarly, several downstream substrates of the ERK1/2 map kinases (e.g., EIF4EBP1, BAZ1B, TWIST) were significantly dephosphorylated upon ZIKV infection. In this respect, these data complement on a different level of earlier observations reporting a downregulation of the AKT/mTOR pathway in ZIKV-infected hNPC and neurospheres [
