<p>The recent technological revolution allows acquiring knowledge on biological processes at incredible speed. Several systematic and unbiased genetic approaches to identify host factors involved in flavivirus replication have been conducted to date [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For instance, next generation sequencing (NGS) became an affordable and widely used technology to unearth underrepresented sequences or estimate the abundance of RNA transcripts in complex mixtures. This made possible the identification of newly emerging viruses and virus variants. Illustrative examples in this direction are efforts during public health responses as recently shown by ZIKV and Ebola virus epidemics [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, NGS can be used to study widespread transcriptional changes occurring upon virus infection, including expression of cytokines and antiviral response patterns. Deconvolution of such data using bioinformatics techniques offers a global overview of transcriptional responses and allows identifying viral activities to perturb signaling cascades. However, viruses modulate gene expression in a post-transcriptional manner by affecting mRNA processing, transport, translation, protein maturation and stability and therefore information on mRNA abundance is only partially reflecting the expression on protein level [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Comparisons between mRNA and protein expression patterns in virus-infected cells revealed dramatic differences, indicating that protein abundance does not necessarily follow expression levels on transcript level [

Labeling proteins of a subcellular compartment (e.g., the cell surface) or combining fractionation techniques with mass spectrometry, allows assigning subcellular localization patterns to individual proteins and also monitor their translocation between compartments in a systematic manner [

MS can also identify post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as differential phosphorylation, ubiquitination or acetylation patterns. Such approaches, however, often require elaborative enrichment of modified peptides and mostly provide descriptive insights into PTMs, and functional consequences of individual modifications remain often elusive. In addition to alterations in protein expression patterns and protein quality, MS puts proteins into context. Isolation of protein complexes through affinity purification (AP) followed by MS analysis (AP-MS) gives insights into proteinâ€“protein interactions and engagement of cellular machineries. AP-MS has successfully been used to identify protein complexes and can put proteins in functional context (
