<p>Large-scale approaches allowing the accurate assessment of virus–host interactions have revolutionized the way we investigate and deconvolute the complex cellular changes triggered by virus infections. While central linear pathways were the main research focus in the past, it becomes more evident that innate immune signaling, and cellular responses in general, engage many interconnected pathways in parallel. The knowledge of these pathways is paramount to holistically understand how viral pathogens interact with their hosts. Certainly more work on viral–host interactions, protein turnover as well as post-translational modifications is required to further expand our understanding of the intracellular landscape of flavivirus-infected cells. This requires well-controlled comparative studies in relevant cell culture systems of multiple members of this highly diverse arbovirus family. Similarly, rigorous validation methods by alternative approaches (e.g., co-IP-WB or proximity ligation assays), robust and transparent cut-off criteria, and functional assays on selected candidates are increasingly needed to pinpoint physiologically relevant host factors. In this respect, further efforts are required to integrate and standardize data generated by mass spectrometry based surveys in easy-to-mine databases, ideally providing critical annotations on virus isolates and cell culture systems as well as integration with other -omics data [
