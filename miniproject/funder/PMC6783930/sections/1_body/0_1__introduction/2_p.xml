<p>One such pathogen is the Zika virus, a positive stranded RNA virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, causing the first large unexpected outbreak in Asia and French Polynesia in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2016, a sudden raise in incidence rates of microcephaly in newborns in southern America could be linked to the ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in this otherwise naïve population [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In adults, ZIKV is predominantly asymptomatic or causes mild, flu-like symptoms, although recent studies report visual impairment and infertility [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Following vertical transmission upon maternal infection, ZIKV can cause fetal demise or Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neuro-inflammatory disease of the peripheral nervous system [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00878" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the limited knowledge on ZIKV pathogenesis and the sudden spread of this pathogen sparked a number of independent laboratories to characterize the virus–host interactions on a molecular level. These studies are of particular interest, since ZIKV combines many unique features of flaviviruses that are normally limited to individual species. Indeed, similarly to other members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family like Dengue (DENV), Yellow fever (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and West Nile virus (WNV), ZIKV is also transmitted by mosquitoes. Furthermore, analogously to JEV, WNV and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Zika virus infections are associated with neurological diseases, although ZIKV is the only 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> member with documented ability to cross the placental barrier and be sexually transmitted [
