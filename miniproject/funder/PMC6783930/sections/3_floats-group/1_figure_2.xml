  <p>â€“ Recently identified cellular interactors of flavivirus capsids and NS4Bs. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of flavivirus viral proteins and respective membrane topology. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Capsid interactors reported to bind exclusively to Zika virus (ZIKV)-C are surrounded by the light blue circle, while those within the orange circle were reported as shared interactors of ZIKV, West Nile virus (WNV) and Dengue (DENV)-C. The respective sub-cellular localization is indicated. (
   <bold>c</bold>) NS4B interactors reported to bind exclusively to ZIKV-NS4B are shown in blue, while those shared with DENV-NS4B are shown in green. Mitochondrial- and endoplasmic-reticulum-resident proteins are surrounded by green and orange circles, respectively. Proteins with functions associated to ZIKV-related pathologies are surrounded by the blue circle. All gene names and corresponding full protein names are listed in
