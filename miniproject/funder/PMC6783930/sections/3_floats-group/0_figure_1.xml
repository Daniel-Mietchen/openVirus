  <p>â€“ Omics methods to study virus-induced cellular perturbations. The key advantages of Interaction proteomics (affinity purification mass spectrometry, AP-MS), expression proteomics and next generation sequencing (NGS) in studying flavivirus-induced perturbations are listed within each square. Colors indicate the respective step(s) of the viral replication cycles predominantly targeted by each method. Abbreviations: PTMs, post-translational modifications.</p>
