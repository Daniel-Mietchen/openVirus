<p>Light intensity also affected plant defenses. First, higher light intensity reduced resistance to UK1-TuMV and increased that to JPN1-TuMV. Interestingly, it has been nicely shown that both isolates induce different responses in Arabidopsis, including differential expression of genes involved in the immune and defense responses [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, sequence comparison of the UK1- and JPN1-TuMV genomes revealed that the P3 protein, which is involved in host resistance, is the most divergent region at the amino acid level [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These differences between UK1- and JPN1-TuMV infection in Arabidopsis may explain the differential effect of light intensity on plant resistance. Higher light intensity also increased plant resistance to LS-CMV, which is in agreement with previous observations [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Second, light intensity also modulated Arabidopsis fecundity and mortality tolerance to virus infection. Higher light intensity increased fecundity tolerance to UK1-TuMV, and reduced that to JPN1-TuMV and LS-CMV. Arabidopsis fecundity tolerance to UK1-TuMV has been associated with modifications of the plant developmental schedule: The larger the life period, the higher the fecundity tolerance [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In agreement, our results indicate that higher light intensity increases the life period of plants infected by UK1-TuMV of both allometric groups. Moreover, this increase is smaller in Group 2 than in Group 1 plants, which is accompanied by a lesser effect of light on plant fecundity tolerance in the latter group of accessions. On the other hand, fecundity tolerance to JPN1-TuMV and LS-CMV has been associated with resource reallocation from growth to reproduction. This resource reallocation was denoted by a higher effect of infection on 
 <italic>RW</italic> than on 
 <italic>SW</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Our results indicate that higher light intensity prevents such resource reallocation (i.e., the effect of infection on 
 <italic>SW</italic> becomes greater than on 
 <italic>RW</italic>). This could explain the reduction of fecundity tolerance to JPN1-TuMV and LS-CMV at higher light intensity. These observations are at odds with previous analyses in the same plant-virus interaction showing that higher light intensity promotes fecundity tolerance [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, these authors used only four Arabidopsis genotypes (two per allometric group). More importantly, they estimated point fecundity tolerance (the effect of infection at a given pathogen load), rather than range fecundity tolerance (the slope of a regression of host fitness against pathogen load) as measured here; and it has been shown that these two measures may lead to different conclusions [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast with fecundity tolerance, both TuMV isolates showed increased mortality tolerance under high light conditions. Note that plants infected by TuMV, but not by CMV, generally increased 
 <italic>GP</italic> and 
 <italic>RP</italic> in high light conditions, which would explain the increase in mortality tolerance to TuMV.
