<p>In summary, our results show that light intensity affects the efficiency of seed transmission, a mode of dispersal that is common to more than a quarter of all known plant viruses. We also present evidence that increased efficiency of virus seed transmission at high light intensity is associated with environment-related modifications of plant resistance and tolerance. Hence, this work provides novel insights on the potential of climate change conditions to promote the dispersal of plant viruses by modifying the outcome of plant-virus interactions, and contributes to understand the underlying processes.</p>
