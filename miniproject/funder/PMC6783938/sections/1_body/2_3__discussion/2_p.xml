<p>Our results indicate that higher light intensity increases the efficiency of TuMV seed transmission in Arabidopsis. Virus seed transmission has a high impact in plant virus epidemiology [

However, perhaps the most important epidemiological effect of seed transmission is that it represents an important source of primary inoculum: Many viruses with this mode of transmission can be also horizontally transmitted, such that viruses that infect plants through seeds can be disseminated afterwards via plant-to-plant contact or by insect vectors [

 <xref rid="B51-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, our results would be compatible with higher light intensity acting as a factor that favor virus epidemics. This is in line with analyses of the effect of changes in other environmental factors that entails climate change. For instance, it has been shown that higher temperature often promotes virus seed transmission [reviewed by 35]. At odds, CMV seed transmission was not affected by light intensity. Interestingly, to our knowledge the only other analysis of how climatic conditions affect CMV vertical transmission showed that drought (another predicted consequence of global warming) decreased seed transmission in lupin [
