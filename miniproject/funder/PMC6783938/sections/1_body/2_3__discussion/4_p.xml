<p>Our analyses on how light intensity modifies plant defenses may offer a potential mechanism for the differential effect of light intensity on TuMV and CMV seed transmission. PCA analyses showed that the main PC differentiating the performance of TuMV-infected plants under high and low light conditions (PC1) contained seed transmission efficiency, virus accumulation and mortality tolerance as the main contributors. These three traits loaded positively onto the PC, meaning that high light conditions increased their values. In accordance, high and low light conditions were clearly differentiated into the positive and negative regions of PC1, respectively. The loading of seed transmission efficiency, virus accumulation and mortality tolerance into the same PC indicated that these variables were correlated. Therefore, higher efficiency of seed transmission at high light intensity was associated with higher virus multiplication and plant mortality tolerance. It has been proposed that higher virus multiplication in the plant reproductive structures favors embryo/gametophytes invasion by promoting the virus crossing of the boundary between the maternal and progeny tissues [

The association between increasing virus multiplication at high light intensity and higher per cent of infected seeds is in line with this prediction, and is also in agreement with previous analyses that identified within-host virus multiplication as a key determinant of seed transmission [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, our analyses provide support for the hypothesis that higher (mortality) tolerance to TuMV infection promotes seed transmission. Interestingly, the effect of infection on 
 <italic>RP</italic> and 
 <italic>LP</italic>, both associated with mortality tolerance, also loaded positively onto PC1, indicating that these traits are also positively associated with seed transmission efficiency. We have recently identified the speed of within-host movement as a major determinant of the efficiency of seed transmission [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]: Faster within-host movement increases the virus chances for reaching the plant reproductive structures, which in turn favors seed transmission [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Similarly, larger 
 <italic>RP</italic> associated with higher mortality tolerance may expand the time span for the virus to reach reproductive organs. Note that high light intensity did not increase JPN1-TuMV multiplication, which suggest that mortality tolerance is the predominant factor explaining the interplay between light and seed transmission. Accordingly, for plants infected with both TuMV isolates mortality tolerance had the highest contribution to PC1. In contrast to TuMV, PCA of CMV-infected plants showed that virus accumulation, efficiency of seed transmission and plant tolerance loaded each on a different PC, indicating the lack of correlation between these three traits. In this case, seed transmission loaded into PC3, which could not discriminate between plant performance at high and low light intensity. This is in agreement with the lack of effect on this environmental condition on CMV seed transmission, and with the negative effect of high light on virus multiplication and plant tolerance.
