<p>Accelerating rates of climate change are predicted to have an enormous impact on the relationships between organisms [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], including those established by causal agents of plant infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this context, understanding how environmental conditions affect parasite transmission is key to understand the emergence of plant disease epidemics, as the ability to spread to new susceptible hosts is a major determinant of parasite fitness [

 <xref rid="B47-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Notably, very little is known about how environmental cues affect plant parasite transmission, particularly for plant viruses. Moreover, most of the work on this subject focused on horizontal transmission through vectors [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], largely neglecting other major modes of virus dispersal such as vertical transmission through seeds [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence that light intensity (one of the environmental factors predicted to change due to climate change) affects the efficiency of virus seed transmission in a species-dependent manner, and that this change is associated with modifications of plant defenses.
