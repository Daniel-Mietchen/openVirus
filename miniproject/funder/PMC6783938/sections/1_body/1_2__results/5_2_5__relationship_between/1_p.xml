<p>The analyses above indicated that light intensity modulates the efficiency of seed transmission, as well as virus multiplication, virulence and plant tolerance to infection. Thus, we analyzed the interplay between these virus, host and environmental traits. To do so, we performed Principal Component Analyses (PCA) using all the measured traits in order to explain the variance in the outcome of virus infection observed at different light intensities. These PCA analyses were done for each virus isolate separately, and considered mean values of all accessions together as in general light similarly affect the performance of both allometric groups (
