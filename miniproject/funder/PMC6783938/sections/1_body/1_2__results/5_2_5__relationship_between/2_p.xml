<p>For UK1-TuMV, the PCA yielded two major Principal Components (PCs) that together explained about half of the total variance (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00304">Table S2</xref>). Virus accumulation and efficiency of seed transmission, plant mortality tolerance, and the effect of infection on 
 <italic>RP</italic> and 
 <italic>LP</italic> loaded into PC1 (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.66 to 0.73; 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.008), whereas the effect of infection on 
 <italic>GP</italic>, 
 <italic>RW</italic> and 
 <italic>IW</italic>, and fecundity tolerance loaded into PC2 (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.77 to 0.73; 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.029). Interestingly, PC1 separated the performance of accessions at low and at high light intensity upon virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, the difference in the outcome of UK1-TuMV infection can be explained by the joint effect of seed transmission efficiency, virus accumulation and mortality tolerance. Note that the loading of these traits into the same PC indicates that they are associated. Moreover, the three variables loaded with the same sign into the PC, meaning that higher virus accumulation and mortality tolerance is associated with increasing efficiency of seed transmission. The PCA for JPN1-TuMV-infected plants yielded again two major PCs jointly explaining 53% of the total variance (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00304">Table S2</xref>). The effect of infection on 
 <italic>IW</italic>, 
 <italic>RP</italic> and 
 <italic>LP</italic>, plus virus accumulation and efficiency of seed transmission, and plant mortality tolerance loaded into PC1 (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.71 to 0.82; 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.021). Virus virulence, effect of infection on 
 <italic>GP</italic> and plant fecundity tolerance loaded into PC2 (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.63 to 0.76; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Again, PC1 allowed distinguishing between plant performance at low and high light intensity, indicating that this difference can be explained by the joint effect of seed transmission efficiency, virus accumulation and mortality tolerance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Finally, the PCA using the data of LS-CMV-infected plants yielded two main PCs that explained 40% of the total variance (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00304">Table S2</xref>). Virus accumulation and virulence, plant fecundity tolerance, and the effect of virus infection on 
 <italic>RW</italic> and 
 <italic>IW</italic> loaded into PC1 (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.76 to 0.76; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Plant mortality tolerance and the effect of infection on 
 <italic>GP</italic> loaded into PC2 (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.71 to 0.84; 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.029). In this case, the efficiency of seed transmission loaded into PC3 (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.57; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), which explained 15% of the total variance. The highest discriminative power of the plant performance according to light intensity was achieved combining PCs 1 and 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f004">Figure 4</xref>C), with PC3 having little discriminative power (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00304">Table S2</xref>). Therefore, for LS-CMV-infected plants tolerance and virus multiplication are not associated with seed transmission, the latest trait having no role in explaining plant performance at different light intensities.
