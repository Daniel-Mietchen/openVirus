<p>The level of UK1-TuMV, JPN1-TuMV and LS-CMV RNA accumulation was used to evaluate Arabidopsis resistance to virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Generalized linear mixed models using virus isolate, Arabidopsis accession and light condition as factors indicated that virus accumulation varied according to the three factors (Wald

 <sup>−3</sup>), and to the interaction between virus and light intensity (Wald

 <sub>1,855</sub> = 11.94, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). Thus, we analyzed the effect of light and allometric group on virus accumulation for each virus isolate separately. Light intensity affected the level of accumulation of the three viruses and in both allometric groups (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 21.47, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>): Higher light intensity increased UK1-TuMV accumulation, and reduced that of JPN1-TuMV and LS-CMV (

 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,106</sub> = 2.28, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.131). On the other hand, no significant differences between allometric groups were observed in the accumulation of any of the three viruses at any light intensity (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,281</sub> ≤ 1.29, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.256). Hence, light intensity affects one of the main infection traits associated with virus seed transmission [
