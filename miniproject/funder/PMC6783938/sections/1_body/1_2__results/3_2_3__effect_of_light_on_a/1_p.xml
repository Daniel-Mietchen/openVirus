<p>Next, we analyzed if light intensity modulated how virus infection affected plant growth, reproduction and developmental schedule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00304">Table S1</xref>). For all three viruses, higher light intensity generally reduced the effect of virus infection on plant growth (effect of infection on rosette weight:

 </italic>/
 <italic>RW
  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>) and reproduction (effect of infection on inflorescence weight:

 <sup>−4</sup>). Similar results were obtained when each allometric group was analyzed separately (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 7.55, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 6 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>). At both light intensities, and for all viruses, the effect of infection on 
 <italic>RW</italic> was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 4.17, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.041). Similar trends were observed for the effect of UK1-TuMV on 
 <italic>IW</italic> (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 2.88,

 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 3.73,

 <italic>IW</italic> at low light intensity was higher in Group 1 plants, and the opposite was observed at high light intensity (Wald

 <sup>−4</sup>) (

  <sub>m</sub>

 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,281</sub> ≤ 3.78, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.066). However, when each allometric group was analyzed separately, higher light reduced UK1-TuMV virulence (higher

 <italic>SW
  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>) in Group 1 plants (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,106</sub> = 4.88,

 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 7.55, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 6 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>). At both light intensities, UK1-TuMV virulence was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 5.70, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.017), the opposite was observed for LS-CMV infected plants (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 8.36, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.004), and no differences between allometric groups were found in JPN1-TuMV-infected plants (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.25,
