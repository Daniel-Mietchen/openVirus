<p>Per cent of seed transmission varied according to virus isolate, plant allometric group and light intensity (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 11.81, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Overall, the efficiency of seed transmission was higher in JPN1-TuMV and lower in LS-CMV, with UK1-TuMV showing intermediate values (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-08-00304">Table S1</xref>). Hence, data for each virus isolate was also analyzed separately. UK1-TuMV seed transmission was higher at high light intensity (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,287</sub> = 13.48, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Indeed, in both allometric groups, higher light intensity resulted in greater UK1-TuMV seed transmission (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 7.41, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.006) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Also, UK1-TuMV seed transmission was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 at both light intensities (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 7.901, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). This difference was due to virus-induced plant castration of most Group 1 plants, as previously shown [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which resulted in no seed production at low light intensity (and therefore no seed transmission) and very little at high light intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). JPN1-TuMV seed transmission was also generally higher at high light intensity (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,290</sub> = 57.69, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Again, light intensity increased seed transmission in accessions of both allometric groups (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 6.71, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.010). JPN1-TuMV seed transmission was again higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 accessions at both light intensities (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 8.46, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.003). Finally, LS-CMV seed transmission was not affected by light intensity either when all accessions were analyzed together (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,281</sub> = 2.52, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.113), or when each allometric group was considered separately (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.42, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.515). Seed transmission was also similar in both allometric groups at both light conditions (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,281</sub> = 1.47, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.224) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). In summary, high light intensity increases TuMV, but not CMV, seed transmission.
