<p>Fecundity and mortality tolerances (slopes of the 
 <italic>SW</italic> and 
 <italic>LP</italic> to virus accumulation regression, respectively) differed depending on the virus isolate, the Arabidopsis accession and the light condition (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 4.51, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.032), the interaction between virus and the other two factors being significant (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 8.21, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 4 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the effect of light on plant tolerance for each virus isolate separately. Light intensity increased (shallowed slope of the regression) Arabidopsis fecundity tolerance to UK1-TuMV (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,34</sub> = 10.72, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), which was due to the effect on Group 1 accessions (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,12</sub> = 80.75, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). At low light intensity, fecundity tolerance to UK1-TuMV infection was higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 accessions (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,18</sub> = 36.303, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Light intensity decreased (steeper slope of the regression) Arabidopsis fecundity tolerance to JPN1-TuMV (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,34</sub> = 4.22, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.040). Here, this was due to the effect on Group 2 accessions (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>
 <sub>1,21</sub> = 5.19, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.022). Similar results were obtained for fecundity tolerance to LS-CMV (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 5.36, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.027). For both JPN1-TuMV and LS-CMV, fecundity tolerance was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 accessions at both light intensities (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 5.41, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.020). Mortality tolerance to both TuMV isolates was higher at higher light intensity either when all accessions were considered together (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 17.58, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), and when each allometric group was analyzed separately (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 11.67, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). For LS-CMV, the effect of viral load on plant mortality was minimal, as none of the LP to virus accumulation slopes significantly differed from zero (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.48, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.489). These near-zero slopes were observed at both light intensities, indicating that this factor did not affect mortality tolerance to LS-CMV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00304-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, light intensity changed fecundity tolerance to the three viruses but only affected mortality tolerance to TuMV.
