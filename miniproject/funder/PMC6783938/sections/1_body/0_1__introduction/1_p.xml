<p>Climate change is a multi-faceted phenomenon that entails increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (particularly CO
 <sub>2</sub>), rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and higher light intensity [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the last decades, the rate at which climate change occurs has accelerated. Indeed, atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> is predicted to reach 730–1000 ppm by the year 2100, contributing to expected increases in global average surface temperature of 1.0–3.7 °C during this same time [

 <xref rid="B1-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since these climatic factors influence most (if not all) biological processes, climate change is expected to have a huge impact in the reproductive success of living organisms and in the relationships that they establish e.g., [
