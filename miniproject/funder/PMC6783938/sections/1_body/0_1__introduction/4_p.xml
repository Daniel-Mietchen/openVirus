<p>To test the hypothesis that higher light intensity enhances virus seed transmission through modifications of plant tolerance, we utilized 
 <italic>Turnip mosaic virus</italic> (TuMV, 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic>) and 
 <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic> (CMV, 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic>), and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (from here on “Arabidopsis”, Brassicaceae). Both viruses are commonly found in wild populations of Arabidopsis at up to 80% prevalence [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], indicating that the Arabidopsis–TuMV and Arabidopsis–CMV interactions are significant in nature. Tolerance to CMV and to TuMV varies across Arabidopsis accessions as a quantitative trait; and long-lived accessions with low seed production to total biomass ratio (Group 1 accessions) are generally more tolerant to CMV, but less tolerant to TuMV, than short-lived accessions that have high seed to biomass ratio (Group 2 accessions) [

 <xref rid="B44-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Upon CMV infection, increasing light intensity has been shown to favor Arabidopsis tolerance, but this conclusion was based on analyses in a reduced number of plant accessions [

 <xref rid="B46-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and TuMV [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have been shown to be vertically-transmitted in Arabidopsis, the efficiency of seed transmission being associated with higher virus load in the plant inflorescence and with reduced virulence [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, the selected experimental system provides an ideal opportunity to analyze the interaction between light intensity, plant tolerance to virus infection and the efficiency of seed transmission.
