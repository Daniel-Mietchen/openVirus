<p>Herein, we quantify tolerance, considering both the effect of infection on plant progeny production (fecundity tolerance) and survival (mortality tolerance), and resistance of 18 Arabidopsis accessions to one CMV and two TuMV isolates at low and high light intensity. In these Arabidopsis accessions, and at both light conditions, we also measure the efficiency of seed transmission of the three virus isolates. Using this information, we address the following questions: (i) If light intensity modulates the efficiency of CMV and TuMV seed transmission, (ii) if light intensity affects Arabidopsis resistance and tolerance to CMV and TuMV, (iii) if plant resistance/tolerance is associated with the efficiency of virus seed transmission, and (iv) if these associations depend on light intensity.</p>
