<p>Upon virus infection, plant defenses are the main determinant of host fitness [

 <xref rid="B9-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The two main host defenses against parasites are resistance, i.e., the host’s ability to limit parasite multiplication [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and tolerance, i.e., the host’s ability to reduce the effect of infection on its fitness at a given parasite load [

 <xref rid="B13-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Climate change conditions have been shown to affect plant resistance to viruses. For instance, elevated CO

 <xref rid="B18-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] viral load. Similarly, light intensity and drought can also regulate the plant ability to control virus multiplication [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Comparatively much less is known on the effect of climatic factors on plant tolerance to viruses. Theoretical models on the evolution of tolerance predict that this defense strategy will be favored in environments with high resource availability, as there would be no limitation of the amount of nutrient/energy uptake needed to compensate fitness losses due to infection [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A critical resource for plants is light, which determines energy availability and controls central process such as germination, leaf proliferation, photosynthesis, bud and flower initiation, and cell division [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Many of these processes are linked to plant tolerance to viruses [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, higher light intensity predicted by climate change models would promote plant tolerance to viruses. This hypothesis has been seldom experimentally tested [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and how light intensity modulates plant tolerance to viruses remains largely unexplored.
