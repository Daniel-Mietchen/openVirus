Therefore, differences in each trait between light intensities, viruses and allometric groups were analyzed by Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GzLMMs). The transformed and the rest of untransformed traits were fitted to a Log-normal distribution according to Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC), with the exception of
