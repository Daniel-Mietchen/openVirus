<p>Virus isolates UK1-TuMV (Acc.N. AB194802), JPN1-TuMV (Acc.N. KM094174), Fny-CMV (Acc.N. NC_002034, NC_002035 and NC_001440, LS-CMV (Acc.N. AF416899, AF416900 and AF127976) and De72-CMV (not sequenced) were used. JPN1-TuMV was obtained from a field-infected plant of 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> (Brassicaceae) [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and De72-CMV from a field-infected plant of 
 <italic>Diplotaxis erucoides</italic> (Brassicaceae) [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and both were propagated in 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants. UK1-TuMV, Fny-CMV and LS-CMV were derived from biologically active clones [

 <xref rid="B61-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA), and transcripts were used to infect 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants for virus multiplication.
