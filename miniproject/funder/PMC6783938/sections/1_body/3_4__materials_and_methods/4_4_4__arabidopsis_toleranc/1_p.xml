<p>Fecundity and mortality tolerances of each Arabidopsis genotype were calculated as the slope of the linear regression of 
 <italic>SW</italic> and 
 <italic>LP</italic>, respectively, to virus accumulation considering both infected and mock-inoculated plants [

 <xref rid="B13-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Importantly, seed viability, estimated as per cent germination, did not significantly differ between mock-inoculated and infected plants (
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 3.12; 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.102). Also, virus infection did not affect the weight of a single seed (Wald 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 1.21; 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.137). Thus, 
 <italic>SW</italic> similarly reflects the number of viable seeds in both mock-inoculated and infected plants.
