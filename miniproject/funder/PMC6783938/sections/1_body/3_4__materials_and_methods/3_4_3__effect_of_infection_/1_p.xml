<p>Aboveground plant structures were harvested at complete senescence and dry weight was determined after maintaining plants at 65 Â°C until constant weight. The weights of the rosette (
 <italic>RW</italic>), inflorescence (
 <italic>IW</italic>), and seeds (
 <italic>SW</italic>), were obtained. 
 <italic>RW</italic> was used as an estimate of plant resources dedicated to growth, and 
 <italic>IW</italic> was taken as an estimate of plant resources dedicated to reproduction [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-08-00304" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The effect of virus infection on these traits was quantified by calculating infected to mock-inoculated plants ratios for each of them, dividing the value of each infected plant by the mean value of the mock-inoculated plants of the same genotype (
