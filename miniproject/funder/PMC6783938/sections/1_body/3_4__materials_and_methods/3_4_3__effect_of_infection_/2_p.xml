<p>Three plant life-history traits were recorded: Growth period (
 <italic>GP</italic>), as days from inoculation to the opening of the first flower; and reproductive period (
 <italic>RP</italic>), as days from the opening of the first flower to the shattering of the first silique. In Arabidopsis, the opening of the first flower co-occurs with the end of the rosette growth, and the shattering of the first silique co-occurs with the end of flower production [

 <italic>LP</italic>), as time to plant senescence, was also quantified.
