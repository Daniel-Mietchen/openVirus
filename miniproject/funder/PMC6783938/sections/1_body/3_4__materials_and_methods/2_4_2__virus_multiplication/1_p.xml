<p>TuMV and CMV multiplication were quantified as viral RNA accumulation via qRT-PCR in each individual plant. Virus accumulation was quantified from three disks of 4 mm in diameter collected from different systemically infected leaves. Form these plant samples, total RNA extracts were obtained using TRIzol
 <sup>®</sup> reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 10 ng of total RNA were added to the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green qRT-PCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Specific primers were used to amplify a 70 nt fragment of the TuMV, and a 106 nt fragment of the CMV, coat protein (CP) gene, respectively [

Absolute viral RNA accumulation was quantified as ng of viral RNA per μg of total RNA utilizing internal standards. For TuMV, internal standards consisted in ten-fold dilution series of plasmid-derived RNA transcripts of the same 70nt CP fragment from UK1-TuMV. For CMV, ten-fold dilution series were prepared using purified viral RNA. All internal standards ranged from 2 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> ng to 2 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> ng.
