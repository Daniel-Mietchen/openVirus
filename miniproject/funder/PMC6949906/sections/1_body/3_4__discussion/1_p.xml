<p>Despite the intensification of vector control programs as a measure to reduce the levels of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and the transmission of arboviruses in Brazil, it has been shown that this vector is still widely spread nationwide, and in Maranhão, was found in the four cities studied, with a predominance in the municipality of Codó. This result reinforces other entomological studies carried out in the state, such as those in the municipalities of Caxias and São Luís, which have already registered the presence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> throughout the year, with variations in its population indices [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, being the predominant climatic factors, mainly due to the occurrence of rain [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> occurs even in the months of low rainfall, due to the residents’ habit to store water for domestic activities in large deposits, such as tanks and barrels, providing continuous availability of breeding sites. This vector’s behavior has been reported in other studies performed in the municipalities of the interior of Maranhão [
