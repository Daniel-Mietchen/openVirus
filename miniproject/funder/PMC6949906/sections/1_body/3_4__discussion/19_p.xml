<p>In this study, the Asian/American DENV-2 genotype was characterized in the mosquitoes and corroborates the findings from human cases occurring in several other states, such as Piauí, bordering Maranhão [
 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], and in the states of Rio de Janeiro [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] and São Paulo, both located in the Southeast region of the country [
 <xref rid="B104-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Investigations on the circulation of the arboviruses’ serotypes and genotypes per locality are greatly important, since it is known that some viruses may cause more severe clinical manifestations, especially in areas with simultaneous circulation of different viral species.
