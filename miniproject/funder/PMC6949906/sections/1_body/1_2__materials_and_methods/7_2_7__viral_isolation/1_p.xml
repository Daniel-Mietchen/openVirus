<p>Positive samples by RT-qPCR assay were inoculated into 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> clone C6/36 (ATCC: CRL-1660) cell culture to confirm infection and increase viral load for subsequent sequencing. C6/36 cells were seeded in 10 mL culture tubes containing 1.5 mL glutamine modified Leibowitz medium (L-15) with 2.95% tryptose phosphate, non-essential amino acids, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), and 2% fetal bovine serum. After three days, the culture medium was discarded and 100 µL of sample supernatant was inoculated into the cell monolayers and the tubes were kept in an incubator at 28 °C for one hour for adsorption and carefully homogenized every 15 min. Then, 1.5 mL of maintenance medium previously prepared with glutamine-modified Leibowitz medium (L-15), with 2.95% tryptose phosphate, non-essential amino acids, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), and 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were added, according to an adapted protocol [

Inoculated cell cultures were kept at 28 °C and were observed daily for 7 days using an inverted binocular microscope to verify the occurrence of the cytopathic effect (CPE). After that, the tubes with 100 µL of supernatant were passaged into new tubes as described previously. Each sample was submitted to three serial passages. Positive and negative controls were used to give reliability to the test.
