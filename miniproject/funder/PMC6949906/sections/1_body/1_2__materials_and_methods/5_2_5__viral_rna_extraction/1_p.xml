<p>After centrifugation for 10 minutes, 10,000 rpm, at 4 °C, the macerate´s supernatant was collected and viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA
 <sup>®</sup> kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s guidelines. To validate the extraction process, we used a non-competitive internal control, genomic RNA of bacteriophage MS2 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), which was added to the sample during extraction and, as negative control, nuclease-free water was used. Two microliters of internal control, diluted 1:1000 in nuclease-free water, were added to each sample. The extraction was validated by monitoring the amplification during the RT-qPCR using primers and probes for the MS2 target, as described previously [
