<p>The genome assembly was carried out using the 
 <italic>De Novo Assembler</italic> methodology in the IDBA-UD program [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. All the contigs were aligned and compared to the virus protein 
 <italic>RefSeq</italic> database available in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) through DIAMOND [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The result was visualized in Megan6 software [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and the inspection and annotations of putative open reading frames (ORF) genes were performed using Geneious v. 9.1.6 software (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand).
