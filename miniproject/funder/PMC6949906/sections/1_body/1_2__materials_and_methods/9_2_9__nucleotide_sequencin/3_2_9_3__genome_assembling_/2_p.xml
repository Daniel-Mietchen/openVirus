<p>A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using the Mafft v. 7 program [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Before phylogenetic analysis, the ProtTest was applied to select the best-fit models of amino acid substitution [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees was performed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] implemented in RaxML v. 8.2.4 [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. For determination of the reliability of the tree topology, a bootstrap analysis [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-01126" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] was carried out on 1000 replicates.
