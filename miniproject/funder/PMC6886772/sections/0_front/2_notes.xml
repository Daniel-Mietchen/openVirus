 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>The authors’ study protocol does not allow them to share the qualitative data beyond the research team in order to protect the participants’ confidentiality. When completing the consent forms specific to the qualitative sub-study reported here, the participants did not provide consent for their transcripts to be made available to individuals outside of the study team, and providing this data publicly would violate the ethics approvals received for the study. Relevant excerpts of the data may be requested from the HPTN 068 publication committee 
  <email>068PubCommittee@hptn.org</email> (the contact person is Erica Hamilton [
