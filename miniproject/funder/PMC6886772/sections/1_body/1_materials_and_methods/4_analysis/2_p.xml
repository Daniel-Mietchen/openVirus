Theme areas were allocated to an individual member of the team for analysis but we collectively discussed our findings and interpretations of the data at multiple points. Team members summarized each participant’s or CAT’s transcripts by creating analytic matrices with participants on the x-axis and time on the y-axis (both at the individual level and reported community level). Thereafter further matrices were constructed to consolidate patterns for each thematic area (main study outcomes) and for each type of participant included in the analysis (i.e. community member, mobiliser or CAT). Given that we were most interested in the process of changes associated with participation in the community mobilization, we limited our analysis to data from individuals who had completed at least one follow-up interview.
