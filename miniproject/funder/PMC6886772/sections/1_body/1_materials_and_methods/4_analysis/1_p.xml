<p>Transcripts were checked for accuracy and completeness by NK, who read through each transcript and returned to the original recording for clarity where information did not make sense or was documented as not being audible. The transcript was returned to the interviewer to clarify and correct. Transcripts were then imported into Atlas.ti for coding and identification of dominant themes using a framework analysis approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0225694.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] in which the research team works through five main analytical steps. The steps include: familiarisation with the raw data; identifying a thematic framework that draws of a priori issues and questions; indexing; charting; and mapping and interpretation of the data. The code frame was developed by two of the study team (CM and NK), with further codes added inductively as the first interviews were coded. The final code frame included 107 codes across ten main thematic areas. Coding was completed by two members of the study team (NK and ST-K) after achieving adequate intercoder reliability with kappa values of above 0.70 during initial coding of the first ten transcripts [
