We purposively selected five participants per village, three men (n = 12) and two women (n = 8) and focused on individuals who OMC staff had identified as participants who shared their thoughts freely during initial intervention workshops. These individuals were considered likely to be good sources of information about their communities. Additionally, we invited all community mobilisers (n = 17) and CATs to participate in interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs), respectively. Data collection was conducted from October 2012 to May 2014.
