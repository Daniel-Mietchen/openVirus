At each follow-up interview/FGD participants were asked to discuss events and experiences since the last time they had been interviewed and whether there had been changes in their experiences of the intervention, mobilization or personal/community attitudes towards HIV or gender equity since their last interview. Interviews and FGDs were digitally recorded and then translated and transcribed into English by the same interviewer who conducted each interview. Summary notes were also taken during the interview in case of recording failure.
