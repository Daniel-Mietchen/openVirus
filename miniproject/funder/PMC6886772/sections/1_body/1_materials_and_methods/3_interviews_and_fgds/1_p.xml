<p>Community members were interviewed three times, at 6, 12 and 18 months into the intervention. The community mobilisers (staff of OMC) were interviewed at two time points and CATs (one CAT in each of 11 villages) participated in FGDs twice, both at 6 and 18 months. Participants provided written consent in the first interview and were verbally re-consented at each subsequent interview. A team of four female qualitatively-trained, XiTsonga speaking fieldworkers with high school qualifications completed data collection alone with each participant or group. Each fieldworker was allocated specific participants for relational continuity over the duration of the study. Interviews took approximately 1–2 hours and were conducted at participants’ homes or other locations of their choosing. FGDs were conducted in local schools.</p>
