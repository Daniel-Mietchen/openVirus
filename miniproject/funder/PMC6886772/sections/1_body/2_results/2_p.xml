<p>Our analysis of the participants’ reflections on their engagement with the intervention pointed to three significant thematic areas relating to gender equitable transformation: respect, communication, and empathy. The participants made frequent reference to these elements as being significant for a ‘better life’ in their communities; they associated them with the OMC intervention and with their attempts to change behaviours related to the intervention outcomes. We focus our discussion on these elements before making remarks about the process of change more generally in the context of this intervention.</p>
