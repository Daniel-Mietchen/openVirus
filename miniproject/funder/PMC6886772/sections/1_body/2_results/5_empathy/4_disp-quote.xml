 <p>When I was growing up I didnâ€™t know that my brother can help me with other household chores like cooking or cleaning. So One Man Can helped me, because even men can do things that were supposed to be done by women. We grew up knowing that men have to find job and work for their families and women do household chores. So in One Man Can we learn that men can do things that should be done by women.</p>
