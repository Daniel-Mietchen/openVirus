<p>Our final sample included community mobilisers (13 of 17), community members (19 of 25) and all 11 CATs across 78 individual interviews (52 with community members) and 22 FGDs (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0225694.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Quotes included in the paper originate from 9, 9 and 13 CATS, community mobilisers and community members respectively. During data collection, five participants chose to withdraw from participation due to increased work commitments and were replaced by a sex-matched individual from the same village. This explains the additional community members beyond the original 20 recruited for the study. There was no difference by sex or age in terms of participation in data collection, although community participants from village B were less likely to have completed all three interviews than participants from other villages. Community members ranged in age from 20 to 44 years and included almost equal numbers of men (n = 10) and women (n = 9). There were five community participants each from villages A, C and D; and four participants from village B. Community mobilisers were largely aged 18–25 years, equally distributed by sex and represented 10 of the 11 intervention villages. The number of individuals participating in each of the CAT FGDs differed between villages and time points; a minimum of three and maximum ten participants. Participants were largely within the intervention target age range (18–35 years), although we did not limit participation by age.
