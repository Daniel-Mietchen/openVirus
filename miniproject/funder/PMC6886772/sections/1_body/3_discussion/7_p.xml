<p>We have found little in the literature about the role of empathy in accounting for changes in gendered and HIV risk behaviours, as empathy is not often theorized at the community level. However, empathy is a building block and individual-level analogue of one of our framework domains—social cohesion. Cohesion, or a sense that there is a ‘glue’ that holds people together in public health has been at the centre of community empowerment projects, most successfully with populations such as sex workers where collective identities help promote empowerment towards community health [

Collective efficacy theorists hypothesize that for communities to tackle social problems, some level of baseline social cohesion, based on working trust and mutual expectation to intervene for shared interests, should exist among community members [

While building empathy was not a purposeful focus of the OMC work, building shared interests and trust as well as visioning others in the communities as allies was a focus—and seems to have translated at a basic, individual level more so than on a community level in this data. Empathy was discussed in terms of gender equality (men) and in terms of changing violent behaviour towards children (women). Specifically, men discussed beginning to understand the unequal burden of domestic responsibilities on women and how this understanding encouraged them to participate in housework and childcare. Such changes are significant, as pervasive attitudes towards gender division of labour in the domestic and care economies limit women’s participation in the economy and educational attainment, and heighten gender inequalities. There are significant short- and long-term advantages to men and children for greater male involvement in the care economy [
