<p>At a community level, felt and demonstrated respect for others was associated with the community mobilizing domains of shared concerns–generating a sense that issues, such as violence, HIV prevention, and even domestic work, are collective and need to be addressed collectively—as well as the development of social cohesion. Although respect was discussed as a positive impact of OMC on the community as a whole, respect was also the concept around which participants expressed the most tensions, implying the zero-sum vision of power, in which female gains in power can only eventuate if men lose power [

Participants’ discussions of respect in the context of gender equality showed that changes in attitudes and behaviour were not always easily achieved. Previous research in gender equitable interventions has shown an ‘ongoing tension between the rights-based discourse of gender equality and local cultural discourses of masculinity and social power’ [

It seemed that among our participants this tension was particularly felt within the domestic sphere, as it was here that men deployed respect as a patriarchal tactic by specifically articulating the need for women to continue to respect their male partners, despite broader social changes. Given the significant advances in women’s rights entrenched in the South African constitution [
 <xref rid="pone.0225694.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the domestic sphere possibly represents the final frontier in which men might grapple with maintaining their power over women. Respect in the context of this intervention was often actioned through increased male sharing of domestic responsibilities. While this represents a limited way in which gender inequalities need to be addressed in South Africa, it does offer an opportunity to open dialogue about social constructions of gendered roles and may be the start to initiating more complex conversations about other gendered issues. Such dialogues are the start of a process of changing social environments and take time to achieve [
