<p>In this paper, rather than focusing on behaviour change outcomes (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0225694.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] for outcomes), we were interested in understanding the process that participants went through and relating this to the domains of community mobilization that we have previously developed. While we have discussed ‘change’ in this paper as a result of participation in the community mobilization intervention, this should not be viewed as a clear timeline of incremental changes from the first interview to the last. During the interviews, participants meandered through discussions of their involvement in the intervention and discussed the same issues at multiple time points. Participants spoke about a ‘before’ and ‘after’ the intervention rather than reflecting on incremental changes aligned to the timing of the data collection.
