Our community mobilization framework included a focus on the need for dialogue to generate critical consciousness and ‘shared concerns’ in the community in order for community mobilization to be effective. The majority of participants noted that communication was a skill they perceived to have learned from OMC and that it had improved the quality of their own and their families’ lives. At the individual level, it seemed that learning to communicate changed relationship dynamics and created space in which topics such as gender and HIV might be discussed. Further, consistent with the critical consciousness domain, the type of communication being discussed by our research participants went beyond individual level communication. Participants reported that communities were talking about HIV more often and that issues relating to gender inequalities, such as the need for men to share domestic work, had gained greater prominence in community discussions and dialogue in private and public spheres. Participants also cited the way that opening lines of communication brought new understanding and respect and empathy for others’ experiences.
