<p>We attempted to maintain a distance between the intervention and the qualitative data collection teams to encourage participants to feel that they could openly discuss problems and failures of the intervention. However, there remains the potential for participants to have exaggerated the impact of the intervention due to a desire for the intervention, and their role in it, to be viewed positively. We also sampled participants from villages that were perceived by OMC staff to be both challenging and easy to work with, to ensure that we did not only present perspectives from villages in which the intervention was well-accepted. One of the challenges of interventions aimed at structural issues such as gender is that change is slow and that the duration of the data collection process may not have allowed participants to reflect on gradual processes that may extend well beyond study duration.</p>
