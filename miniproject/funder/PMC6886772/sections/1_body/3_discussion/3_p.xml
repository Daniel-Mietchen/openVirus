Communication is a significant component of the development of critical consciousness, while empathy and respect feed into the development of shared concerns and social cohesion. This mutual and shared view of common interests maps onto the mobilization domain of building community cohesion, though participants seemed to mostly internalize this aspect in direct relation to their families before widening empathetic responses to the community more broadly. We have previously shown in this community that among the domains, critical consciousness seems to be the first ‘achievable’ domain followed by social cohesion [
