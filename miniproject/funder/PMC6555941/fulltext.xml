Accumulating evidence for a critical role of type I interferon (IFN-I) in protecting hosts from ZIKV infection lies in the findings that ZIKV has evolved various strategies to subvert the host defense line by counteracting the early IFN induction or subsequent IFN signaling. Yet, mechanisms underlying the counter-IFN capability of ZIKV and its proteins, which might contribute to the well-recognized broad cellular tropisms and persistence of ZIKV, remain incompletely understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Using RNA sequencing-based transcriptional profiling of whole blood cells isolated from patients acutely infected by ZIKV, we found that transcriptional signature programs of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes and innate immune sensors in ZIKV-infected patients remained inactive as compared to those of healthy donors, suggesting that ZIKV was able to suppress the induction of IFN-I during the natural infection process in humans. Furthermore, by analyzing the molecular interaction in a ZIKV NS4A-overexpression system, or in the context of actual ZIKV infection, we identified that ZIKV NS4A directly bound MAVS and thereby interrupted the RIG-I/MAVS interaction through the CARD-TM domains, leading to attenuated production of IFN-I.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">Our findings collectively revealed that ZIKV NS4A targeted MAVS and contributed to ZIKV immune evasion through abrogating MAVS-mediated IFN production.

While ZIKV was originally identified in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947 and the first human infection case was documented in 1954, the most serious Zika pandemic to date began in the Americas in 2013&#x02013;2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As of December 2018, over 86 countries and territories have reported cases of active ZIKV transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Clinically, although most Zika cases are asymptomatic or only manifest as an influenza-like illness, severe forms of ZIKV infection such as microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities in newborns and Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, meningoencephalitis, multi-organ failure or thrombocytopenia in adults are seen in the clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus far, no clinically approved vaccines or specific anti-ZIKV drugs are available for the control of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hence, understanding the molecular basis and host immune mechanisms based on which severe diseases develop as a result of ZIKV infection is key to developing strategies against ZIKV-associated conditions.</p><p id="Par31">While it is beginning to be revealed that mutations in the prM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and NS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] proteins might enable ZIKV to become more virulent and/or transmissible, mounting evidence suggests that innate immunity is involved in the governance of ZIKV replication and pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The interferon (IFN) system, being an essential component of innate immunity, constitutes the first line of defense against viral infection, including ZIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A vital role for the IFN system in abrogating ZIKV infection in the host was revealed by the fact that ZIKV is pathogenic in IFN receptor knockout mice but not in immunocompetent mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, Smith et al. demonstrated the neuropathogenesis of ZIKV in a highly susceptible immunocompetent mouse model after the function of type I interferon was blocked by an antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These findings, together with several other lines of evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], support a notion that in order for a pathogenic infection to be established, ZIKV needs to attenuate the production of IFNs or the anti-viral effects of the IFN system.</p><p id="Par32">As is widely acknowledged, activation of IFN signaling is initiated by recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) have been identified as two of the most important PRRs for the detection of ZIKV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. RIG-I recognizes cytosolic viral RNA of ZIKV, which triggers a RIG-I conformational change to expose the caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD), subsequently triggering the downstream signaling cascades by interacting with the N-terminal CARD-containing mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)&#x000a0;adaptor protein, resulting in the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) via TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I&#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b5; (IKK&#x003b5;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. cGAS is mainly known as a critical sensor for DNA viruses, and yet recent findings indicate that the cGAS-STING pathway might also be involved in responding to infection of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, including ZIKV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. STING has also been found to interact with MAVS, most likely at the mitochondrion or mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which is followed by recruitment of TBK1 and IRF3, leading to the production of type I IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">It is well established that viruses have co-evolved with their hosts, accompanied by development of multiple strategies to evade and antagonize the host IFN system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that most flaviviruses have evolved diverse strategies to abrogate the induction of IFN and the downstream signaling pathways. Currently available data suggest that ZIKV infection can inhibit type I IFN responses in dendritic cells (DCs) through downregulation of IFN-stimulated genes and impair DC function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], yet the interferon response in other cell types remains unknown. ZIKV genome codes for a single polyprotein that is post-translationally, proteolytically processed by viral and host proteases to produce ten proteins, including three structural proteins (capsid, membrane precursor, and envelope), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The ZIKV nonstructural proteins NS1, NS2B3, NS4B, and NS5 have been implicated to be engaged in ZIKV immuno pathogenicity through diverse strategies. For example, NS1 and NS4B of ZIKV inhibit RLR-induced IFN-&#x003b2; production via interacting with TBK1 and thereby blocking TBK1 oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. NS2B3 impairs the IFN signaling pathway by facilitating proteasomal degradation of Jak1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and STING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, ZIKV NS5 has been found to bind and degrade host STAT2 and consequently block the IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It remains to&#x000a0;be determined whether other viral factors also contribute to the evasion of the innate immune response by ZIKV.</p><p id="Par34">Since MAVS signaling is essential for inducing an IFN production during ZIKV infection, it is plausible that viruses may hijack this important host response to facilitate infection of the host. Our previous findings revealed that DENV NS4A protein played an important role in suppressing interferon production through binding MAVS and disrupting the RIG-I&#x02013;MAVS interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Based on the possible functional similarities but mechanistic diversities by which the NS4A of the well-known flaviviruses DENV1-4 inhibits IFN signaling, we asked whether this paradigm applies to another member of the flavivirus group, ZIKV. This current study found that ZIKV interfered with the RIG-I&#x02013;MAVS signaling to attenuate type I IFN production. More specifically, our results suggest that ZIKV NS4A targets MAVS and interrupts the RLR&#x02013;MAVS interaction, leading to reduced induction of type I IFNs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>ZIKV suppresses type I interferon production in human subjects and in host cells</title><p id="Par35">To assess whether ZIKV infection influences the production of type I IFN in patients, we collected whole blood cells from ZIKV-infected human subjects and conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptional profiling experiments to characterize the expression of type I IFN genes and their downstream ISGs. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, whole blood cells were obtained from three ZIKV-infected patients, whose clinical features were reported in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The clinical characteristics of three individuals with ZIKV infection and the background of three healthy donors are summarized and compared in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. Upon analyzing the global transcriptional profiling data obtained from the whole blood cells of the ZIKV-infected individuals, we found that in consistence with other observations, 92.75% of the genes listed in a pre-defined genes list of type I IFN and ISGs (69 genes) with known antiviral activity against flavivirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] showed no or little change when comparing ZIKV-infected patients and uninfected controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2), with only two genes (NFIL3 and IGF1R) down-regulated and one (IFI27) up-regulated (<italic>p&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), and two undetected (TREX1 and DCP1A). To further investigate the ability of ZIKV to block IFN production in response to general viral attack in cultured human cells, we infected HFF-1 and SV-HUC-1 cells with ZIKV and then used SeV or poly(I:C)&#x000a0;to secondarily infect the cells. SeV or poly(I:C) was used in this experiment as it represents a well-recognized potent inducer of type I IFN. ELISA analysis showed that while SeV or poly(I:C) treatment alone induced drastic production of IFN-&#x003b2;, pre-infection of the cells with ZIKV robustly lowered the level of IFN-&#x003b2; produced in response to secondary SeV infection or poly(I:C) treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b&#x02013;e). SeV infection in HFF-1 and SV-HUC-1 was validated by real time RT-PCR&#x000a0;to detect the SeV&#x000a0;RNA genome (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f, g), which clearly shows the same RNA expression level of SeV in each group. ZIKV infection in HFF-1 and SV-HUC-1 was validated by western blotting analysis to detect the ZIKV envelope protein (E) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h, i). These data demonstrated that ZIKV could actively suppress the type-I IFN response in host cells and patients, warranting further investigation of how ZIKV suppresses IFN production in human host cells.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>ZIKV abrogates the activation of type I IFN signaling. <bold>a</bold> Heatmap of a pre-defined gene list of type I IFN and ISGs that are differentially expressed (DEGs), generated from comparative RNA-seq data among three ZIKV-infected patients (ZIKV patients <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold>) and three healthy donors.

To this end, mammalian two-hybrid analysis was performed to identify possible molecular interactions between ZIKV NS4A and components along the RIG-I signaling pathway. Specifically, we used ZIKV NS4A to transfect 293T cells, together with, respectively, one of the four key RLR signaling proteins, namely, RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1 and IKK&#x003b5;, whose expression was verified by Western blotting (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1, A&#x02013;D).

The rapidly emerging health crisis associated with ZIKV infection highlights a growing need to understand the mechanisms by which ZIKV accesses human hosts. Evidence for a crucial role of the type I IFN response in preventing infection lies in the fact that ZIKV has evolved a variety of strategies to subvert the host defense by counteracting early infection-triggered IFN induction or subsequent IFN-triggered signaling. In the present study, we demonstrated that by utilizing its NS4A protein, ZIKV could suppress IFN production through disrupting the RIG-I&#x02013;MAVS signaling pathway. This finding broadens and deepens our knowledge of how ZIKV has developed diverse strategies to evade the action of IFN.</p><p id="Par46">It has been suggested that flaviviruses have evolved complex mechanisms to evade host anti-viral mechanisms, including RLR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our previous work revealed that NS4A proteins derived from various serotypes of DENV blocked type I IFN production through targeting MAVS-mediated signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recently, Ma et al. reported that ZIKV NS4A in particular as a suppressor of the RLR pathway by interrupting RLR&#x02013;MAVS interaction, preventing induction of type I IFNs and inhibiting ZIKV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Toward understanding the counter-IFN capability of ZIKV in depth, our current work is featured in several aspects that are worth highlighting. Firstly, by employing surface plasmon resonance technology we here provide the first and direct evidence demonstrating that ZIKV NS4A directly binds MAVS protein and there by impair IFN production. Secondly, we have documented that ZIKV is a weak inducer of type I interferon in ZIKV-infected humans and in cultured human cell lines and primary cells as well. Lastly, while overexpression of ectopic NS4A was employed in our study, serial experiments in the context of actual ZIKV infection were performed, and clearly demonstrated that NS4A inhibited IFN induction through an NS4A-MAVS interaction.</p><p id="Par47">At the molecular level, while antagonism of IFN-mediated signal transduction by ZIKV NS4A shares multiple similarities with that of DENV NS4A, our findings revealed that ZIKV NS4A bound MAVS through specifically interacting with both the CARD and TM domains of MAVS. As reported, the CARD-like domain of MAVS is responsible for interacting with RIG-I, and the TM domain-containing region of MAVS has been found to mediate oligomerization and interaction with other adaptor proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and TRAF6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It remains possible that NS4A also disrupts MAVS oligomerization or complexes with other adaptor proteins, which is an issue worth further investigation. Interestingly, type III IFN has been shown to protect barrier cells of the human placenta called trophoblasts from ZIKV infection. Type III IFN utilizes different cell-surface receptors than type I IFN but utilizes the same MAVS signaling machinery to regulate its production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, it is highly likely that ZIKV can also evade type III IFN signaling through targeting MAVS by NS4A, which may contribute to the ability of ZIKV to cross the placenta during pregnancy and consequently cause neuronal disorders in the developing fetus. Additionally, it would be of great interest to further identify the amino acids of MAVS responsible for the interaction between NS4A and MAVS. Since there is no three-dimensional structural information for NS4A, it is in fact very difficult to perform molecular docking experiments and identify the high-affinity binding sites between two proteins. Ding et al. revealed residues critical for ZIKV NS2B3-mediated cleavage to R78 and G79 in the cytoplasmic loop of human STING, but not mouse STING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This finding needs to be further verified as residues R78 and G79 are only weakly conserved in the murine ortholog of STING. Human MAVS shares 51.8% amino acid identity with mouse MAVS, and thus, it may be of interest to further investigate whether NS4A can disrupt the interaction between mouse MAVS and its usual binding partners. Moreover, it might be equally important to further map the amino acids of ZIKV NS4A involved in IFN antagonism, which should allow generation of mutant ZIKVs that are attenuated due to their inability to prevent IFN signaling.</p><p id="Par48">It is currently not known what has triggered the surge of recent epidemics of ZIKV and the associated severe diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Mechanistically, aberrant suppression of the antiviral property of IFNs might facilitate infection of ZIKV as well as viral spreading in human populations. ZIKV is largely a mosquito-borne virus and can also be transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and potentially via urine or saliva as well. Moreover, ZIKV may be transmitted from pregnant women to fetuses by a transplacental route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In consistence with such a dynamic transmission pattern, ZIKV exhibits a broad tropism and ability to persist in multiple types of tissues/organs and in body fluids, including the eyes, blood, testis and semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

Moreover, it has been well documented that nonstructural proteins of ZIKV play important roles in the life cycle of ZIKV and that several of them, including NS1, NS2B/3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, interact with innate immune molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that in addition to mediating the effects of putative entry receptors on host cells being a key ZIKV infection mechanism, the ability of ZIKV to defeat the host IFN system, possibly through expressing multiple viral factors that interfere with multiple steps and nodes along the IFN signaling cascade, may also represent a key contributor to its broad cellular tropism and intracellular persistence. Hence, collaborative actions among different ZIKV nonstructural proteins need to be better understood, and further investigation of how the effect of NS4A, as identified in our current study, cooperates with other counter-IFN effects of ZIKV, such as NS1, NS2B/3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par49">In summary, the current findings revealed an innate immunity evasion by ZIKV and the possible underlying molecular mechanisms.
