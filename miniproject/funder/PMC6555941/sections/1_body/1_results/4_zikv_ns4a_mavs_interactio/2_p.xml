<p id="Par43">To further examine the effect of ZIKV NS4A on IFN-β production induced by viral infection, we used SeV or poly(I:C) as an IFN stimulus and found that expression of ZIKV NS4A, DENV NS4A or influenza PB1-F2, but not ZIKV prM, markedly inhibited the activities of IFN-β reporters upon induction by SeV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b) or poly(I:C)(Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c). Furthermore, ELISA analysis was applied to measure the expression level of IFN-I produced in infected cells, and we found that ectopic expression of ZIKV NS4A reduced IFN-β production stimulated by SeV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d)or poly(I:C) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e) in 293T cells, and also in primary PBMC stimulated by poly(I:C) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>f). Taken together, these data indicated that ZIKV can efficiently blocked the type-I IFN response, and that NS4A blocked the RNA-level expression of endogenous human
