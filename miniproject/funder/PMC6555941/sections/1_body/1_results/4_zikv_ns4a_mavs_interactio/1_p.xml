<p id="Par42">As the aforementioned data showed that ZIKV NS4A interacts with MAVS, we next sought to determine whether such an interaction effects on type I IFN production. We co-transfected 293T cells with RIG-I(N), which is well known to stimulate IFN-β production, together with increasing amounts of the expression vector containing ZIKV NS4A plus the IFN-β luciferase reporter cassette. Our results demonstrated that when ZIKV prM was used as a negative control and the PB1-F2 protein of influenza virus and DENV NS4A were used as a positive control, overexpression of ZIKV NS4A indeed inhibited the reporter luciferase activity driven by RIG-I(N) (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S4 A–C). Furthermore, PB1-F2 or DENV NS4A, but not prM, significantly decreased the IFN-β reporter luciferase activity driven by RIG-I(N) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), indicating that NS4A was capable of interfering with the promoter activity of IFN-β.
