<p id="Par41">Notably, previous studies suggested that MAVS transduced signals from RIG-I through their CARD–CARD domain interaction, leading to activation of IRF3 and IFN induction [

Interestingly, our current data also showed that NS4A interacted with the CARD-like domain of MAVS, thereby prompting us to investigate whether NS4A affects the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. To address this question, we examined the formation of the RIG-I–MAVS complex in the presence or absence, respectively, of NS4A. 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged RIG-I together with Myc-tagged NS4A or control vector. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MAVS antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-MAVS antibody or anti-RIG-1 antibody. We found that RIG-I strongly interacted with MAVS in the absence of NS4A, whereas cells expressing NS4A exhibited a significant decrease in the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). Furthermore, when using poly(I:C) as a stimulus for MAVS signaling, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay by using an antibody against MAVS for the pull-down of TRAF6 or TBK1 proteins and an antibody against TRAF6 or TBK1 for the blotting detection. We found that overexpression of NS4A exhibited a significant decrease in the interaction between MAVS and its downstream effectors TRAF6 or TBK1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, e). In summary, these data suggested that NS4A bound MAVS, which subsequently prevented its interaction with RIG-I, modulated the downstream signaling, and consequently suppressed IFN production.
