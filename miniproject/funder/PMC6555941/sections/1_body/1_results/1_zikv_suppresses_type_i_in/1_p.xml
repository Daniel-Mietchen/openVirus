<p id="Par35">To assess whether ZIKV infection influences the production of type I IFN in patients, we collected whole blood cells from ZIKV-infected human subjects and conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptional profiling experiments to characterize the expression of type I IFN genes and their downstream ISGs. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, whole blood cells were obtained from three ZIKV-infected patients, whose clinical features were reported in our previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The clinical characteristics of three individuals with ZIKV infection and the background of three healthy donors are summarized and compared in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. Upon analyzing the global transcriptional profiling data obtained from the whole blood cells of the ZIKV-infected individuals, we found that in consistence with other observations, 92.75% of the genes listed in a pre-defined genes list of type I IFN and ISGs (69 genes) with known antiviral activity against flavivirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] showed no or little change when comparing ZIKV-infected patients and uninfected controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2), with only two genes (NFIL3 and IGF1R) down-regulated and one (IFI27) up-regulated (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05), and two undetected (TREX1 and DCP1A). To further investigate the ability of ZIKV to block IFN production in response to general viral attack in cultured human cells, we infected HFF-1 and SV-HUC-1 cells with ZIKV and then used SeV or poly(I:C) to secondarily infect the cells. SeV or poly(I:C) was used in this experiment as it represents a well-recognized potent inducer of type I IFN. ELISA analysis showed that while SeV or poly(I:C) treatment alone induced drastic production of IFN-β, pre-infection of the cells with ZIKV robustly lowered the level of IFN-β produced in response to secondary SeV infection or poly(I:C) treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b–e). SeV infection in HFF-1 and SV-HUC-1 was validated by real time RT-PCR to detect the SeV RNA genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f, g), which clearly shows the same RNA expression level of SeV in each group. ZIKV infection in HFF-1 and SV-HUC-1 was validated by western blotting analysis to detect the ZIKV envelope protein (E) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h, i). These data demonstrated that ZIKV could actively suppress the type-I IFN response in host cells and patients, warranting further investigation of how ZIKV suppresses IFN production in human host cells.
