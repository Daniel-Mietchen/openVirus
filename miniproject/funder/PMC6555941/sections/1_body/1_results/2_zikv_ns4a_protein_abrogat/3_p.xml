<p id="Par38">Furthermore, a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay was performed to reveal a physical interaction between ZIKV NS4A and MAVS. 293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged MAVS and Flag-tagged NS4A, and cell lysates were precipitated with anti-Flag antibody or control mouse IgG. Our results showed that Myc-tagged MAVS was detected in the precipitate pulled down by the anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Reverse immunoprecipitation, using an anti-Myc antibody to precipitate ectopic NS4A followed by using an anti-Flag antibody for western blotting analysis also confirmed that NS4A and MAVS were present in the immunocomplexes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). To include a vector control, 293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged MAVS and pcDNA3.1 vector, and cell lysates were precipitated with anti-Myc antibody or control mouse IgG. Furthermore, 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged NS4A and pcDNA3.1 vector, and cell lysates were precipitated with anti-Flag antibody or control mouse IgG. The results showed that there were not specific bands present in the immunoprecipitates pulled down by the anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibody in the vector control group (Additional file

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). To further elucidate the physical interaction between NS4A and MAVS, we also performed an endogenous IP assay upon ZIKV infection. When HFF-1 cells were infected with ZIKV and the cell lysates were subsequently precipitated using an antibody against MAVS to pull down its interacting proteins, our results revealed that an antibody against MAVS could pull down ZIKV NS4A (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e), suggesting that NS4A and MAVS were complexed in ZIKV-infected cells.
