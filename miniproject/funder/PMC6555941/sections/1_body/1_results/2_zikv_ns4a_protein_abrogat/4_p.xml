<p id="Par39">The binding affinity of NS4A and MAVS were then analyzed by the Biacore surface plasmon resonance technology. In brief, the reference surface of the CM5 sensor chip was immobilized with MAVS, followed by injection of various concentrations of purified recombinant NS4A protein, or prM, or blank control sample for response measurement. As shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3, our data showed no binding affinity between blank control sample and MAVS protein. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, a significantly increased binding affinity between NS4A and MAVS was demonstrated, strongly suggesting that NS4A directly bound MAVS.
