<p id="Par57">Cells were harvested and lysed in sample buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.4), 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol, 6% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol and 0.1% bromophenol blue), and the protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Briefly, protein bands separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were transferred to a PVDF membrane and then blocked with blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline). Specific protein bands were detected using the following primary antibodies: anti-ZIKV E (Gene Tex Inc, Alton Pkwy Irvine, CA), anti-ZIKV NS4A (Gene Tex Inc, Alton Pkwy Irvine, CA), anti-MAVS (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), anti-TRAF6, anti-HA, anti-Flag M2, anti-c-Myc, anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and anti-TBK1/NAK (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) antibodies. Further incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercial kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol.</p>
