<p id="Par55">293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. One hundred nanograms of pFN11A (BIND) vector expressing GAL4-BD fused with each individual Zika virus protein, and plasmid pFN10A (ACT) expressing the transcriptional activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 (VP16-AD) fused to RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1 or IKKε protein, were cotransfected with 250 ng of the pGL4.31 reporter plasmid. Empty pBIND and pACT plasmids were used as negative controls, and the pBIND-Id and pACT-MyoD plasmids were used as positive controls. The transfected cells were harvested for the dual-luciferase reporter assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA) at 48 h following transfection.
