<p id="Par59">293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and whole-cell lysates were prepared after transfection with protein lysis buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2% glycerol, 1% NP40, and a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies (anti-Flag M2, anti-Myc antibody anti-NS4A, anti-MAVS, or IgG antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, lysates were incubated with Dynabeads protein A (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. The precipitates were washed with wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2% glycerol and 0.1% NP40) for five times, resuspended in sample buffer, and assessed with Western blotting analysis.</p>
