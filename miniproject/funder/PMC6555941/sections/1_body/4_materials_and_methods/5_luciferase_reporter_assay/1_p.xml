<p id="Par54">293T cells were co-transfected in a 24-well plate (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well) with 100 ng of IFN-β promoter reporter plasmid, pRL-TK (5 ng), the plasmid coding for RIG-I (100 ng) together with a plasmid expressing ZIKV NS4A, ZIKV prM, DENV NS4A or IVA PB1-F2. Empty pcDNA3 vector was used as a transfection control. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the total cell lysate was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA). When using SeV or poly(I:C) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as a stimulus, 293T cells transfected with IFN-β reporter, pRL-TK, together with ZIKV NS4A, ZIKV prM, DENV NS4A or IVA PB1-F2, were infected with or without SeV at 100 HAU/ml for 16 h, or transfected with 20 μg/ml of poly(I:C) for 16 h, followed by analysis of cell lysates for luciferase activity.
