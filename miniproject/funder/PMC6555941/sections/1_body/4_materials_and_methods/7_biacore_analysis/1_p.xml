<p id="Par56">Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed in a Biacore T100 device (Biacore Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) using research grade CM5 sensor chips (General Electric Company, GE) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For SPR analysis, recombinant Zika virus NS4A protein was purified using a Ni–NTA affinity column (The QIA expressionist™, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) followed by Superdex 200 (GE) gel filtration chromatography, as previously described [

Briefly, recombinant human MAVS protein (purchased from OriGene, TP308175) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip after activation with 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide and

Different concentrations (0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 nM) of purified ZIKV NS4A or prM protein, or 100 microliters of blank control samples were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 3 min. Subsequently, data were collected for a 3-min association followed by a 20-min dissociation. The chip was regenerated by injecting 10 μl of 15 mM NaOH for 20 s. All procedures were run with HBS (HEPES buffered saline; GE) as a running buffer. Binding curves were determined using BIA evaluation 3.1 software and its equation for 1:1 Langmuir binding. The K
 <sub>D</sub> was calculated as previously described [
