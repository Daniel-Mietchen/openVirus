<p id="Par60">Total RNA from cells was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The RNA concentration was determined in a spectrophotometer at 260 nm, and 500 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers, and qPCR was carried out using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Expression levels for individual mRNAs were calculated and normalized based on their CT values using housekeeping genes (GAPDH) to normalize the data. Primers sets used for qPCR are shown in Additional file
