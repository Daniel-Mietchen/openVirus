Primary monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from health donor 2 by using Monocyte Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The background of healthy donor 2 is summarized and compared in Additional file
