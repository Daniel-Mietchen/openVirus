<p id="Par32">As is widely acknowledged, activation of IFN signaling is initiated by recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) have been identified as two of the most important PRRs for the detection of ZIKV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. RIG-I recognizes cytosolic viral RNA of ZIKV, which triggers a RIG-I conformational change to expose the caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD), subsequently triggering the downstream signaling cascades by interacting with the N-terminal CARD-containing mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) adaptor protein, resulting in the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) via TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase ε (IKKε) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. cGAS is mainly known as a critical sensor for DNA viruses, and yet recent findings indicate that the cGAS-STING pathway might also be involved in responding to infection of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, including ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. STING has also been found to interact with MAVS, most likely at the mitochondrion or mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which is followed by recruitment of TBK1 and IRF3, leading to the production of type I IFN [
