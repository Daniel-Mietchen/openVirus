<p id="Par45">The recent extensive epidemic out breaks of ZIKV infection and its dissemination to various regions of the world, as well as its link to severe complications, particularly microcephaly in the newborns, have created a serious threat to global health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The rapidly emerging health crisis associated with ZIKV infection highlights a growing need to understand the mechanisms by which ZIKV accesses human hosts. Evidence for a crucial role of the type I IFN response in preventing infection lies in the fact that ZIKV has evolved a variety of strategies to subvert the host defense by counteracting early infection-triggered IFN induction or subsequent IFN-triggered signaling. In the present study, we demonstrated that by utilizing its NS4A protein, ZIKV could suppress IFN production through disrupting the RIG-Iâ€“MAVS signaling pathway. This finding broadens and deepens our knowledge of how ZIKV has developed diverse strategies to evade the action of IFN.
