<p id="Par46">It has been suggested that flaviviruses have evolved complex mechanisms to evade host anti-viral mechanisms, including RLR signaling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Toward understanding the counter-IFN capability of ZIKV in depth, our current work is featured in several aspects that are worth highlighting. Firstly, by employing surface plasmon resonance technology we here provide the first and direct evidence demonstrating that ZIKV NS4A directly binds MAVS protein and there by impair IFN production. Secondly, we have documented that ZIKV is a weak inducer of type I interferon in ZIKV-infected humans and in cultured human cell lines and primary cells as well. Lastly, while overexpression of ectopic NS4A was employed in our study, serial experiments in the context of actual ZIKV infection were performed, and clearly demonstrated that NS4A inhibited IFN induction through an NS4A-MAVS interaction.
