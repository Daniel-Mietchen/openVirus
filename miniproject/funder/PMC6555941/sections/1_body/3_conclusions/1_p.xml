<p id="Par49">In summary, the current findings revealed an innate immunity evasion by ZIKV and the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that the ZIKV NS4A protein plays an important role in suppressing interferon production through binding MAVS and disrupting the RIG-Iâ€“MAVS interaction in host cells. The identified function of ZIKV NS4A as an IFN antagonist might enable it to play an important role in the pathogenesis and spread of ZIKV in humans. This work has not only found a viral protein that participates in immune evasion, but also unveiled weaknesses in host defenses, thereby providing fundamental knowledge for the future development of anti-Zika drugs or vaccines.</p>
