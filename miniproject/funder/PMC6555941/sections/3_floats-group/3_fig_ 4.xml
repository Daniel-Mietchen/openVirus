  <p>ZIKV NS4A interacts with both the CL and TM domains of MAVS and prevents RIG-I from binding MAVS. 
   <bold>a</bold> A schematic diagram of the MAVS protein and functional domains: CARD-like domain (aa 10 to 77), proline-rich domain (aa 103 to 173) and transmembrane domain (aa 514 to 535). 
   <bold>b</bold> Co-IP and western blotting analysis of 293T cells transfected with Myc-tagged NS4A along with vectors expressing the indicated Flag-tagged MAVS truncation forms or full-length MAVS. Empty vector was used as a negative control. 
   <bold>c</bold> 293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged RIG-I and Myc-tagged NS4A or an empty vector control for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-MAVS antibody and analyzed by western blotting for RIG-I (
   <bold>c</bold>). 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged NS4A or an empty vector control for 24 h later, transfected with 20 μg/ml of poly(I:C). Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-MAVS antibody and analyzed by western blotting for TRAF6 (
   <bold>d</bold>), or TBK1 (
   <bold>e</bold>). The expression of precipitated proteins was determined by western blotting analysis using the indicated antibodies (lower panel). The data shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results
