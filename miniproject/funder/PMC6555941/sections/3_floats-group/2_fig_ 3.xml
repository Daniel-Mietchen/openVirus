  <p>ZIKV NS4A co-localizes and interacts with MAVS. 
   <bold>a</bold> HeLa cells transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-tagged NS4A, Flag-tagged ZIKV prM or influenza Flag-tagged PB1-F2 were stained with anti-Flag and anti-MAVS antibodies as well as DAPI. Secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine and FITC dye were used to visualize the indicated proteins. Images are representative of three independent experiments. 293T cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged MAVS and Flag-tagged NS4A were used in a co-IP assay to address whether ZIKV NS4A protein physically interacts with MAVS. Cell lysates were precipitated with an anti-Flag antibody (
   <bold>b</bold>), anti-Myc antibody (
   <bold>c</bold>), or control mouse IgG, and immunocomplexes were analyzed with the indicated antibodies by western blotting. 
   <bold>d</bold> 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-tagged NS4A, followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibody or control IgG. The immunocomplexes were analyzed with anti-MAVS antibody by Western blotting. 
   <bold>e</bold> HFF-1 cells were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 5 followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-MAVS antibody or control mouse IgG. The immunocomplexes that were captured by the protein G Dynabeads were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NS4A, or anti-MAVS antibodies. 
   <bold>f</bold> SPR analysis of the interactions between MAVS and NS4A. Direct binding was measured by Biacore assays. MAVS was immobilized on a CM5 chip. The analytes consisted of serial dilutions of NS4A proteins ranging between 0 and 2000 nM. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments with similar results
