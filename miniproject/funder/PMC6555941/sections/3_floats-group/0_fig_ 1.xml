  <p>ZIKV abrogates the activation of type I IFN signaling. 
   <bold>a</bold> Heatmap of a pre-defined gene list of type I IFN and ISGs that are differentially expressed (DEGs), generated from comparative RNA-seq data among three ZIKV-infected patients (ZIKV patients 
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold>) and three healthy donors. The expression of read-mapped genes normalized across the entire dataset was analyzed based on the RPKM value, and 
   <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 and log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change ≥ 1.5 relative to the control cohort were set as the threshold to assess the statistical significance of the differential gene expression. 
   <bold>b</bold>–
   <bold>e</bold> Infection with ZIKV reduces type I IFN production after a secondary infection. HFF-1 and SV-HUC-1 cells were infected with mock or ZIKV at an MOI of 1, and 24 h later, respectively, infected with SeV at 100 HAU/ml (
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold>) or transfected with 20 μg/ml of poly(I:C) (
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold>). IFN-β protein levels were measured using specific ELISA in the supernatants collected at 36 h after secondary-infection from the two cell lines, and cell lysates were harvested for real time RT-PCR to determine the RNA level of SeV (
   <bold>f</bold>, 
   <bold>g</bold>), and for Western blotting analysis to determine the levels of ZIKV envelope protein (E) and GAPDH protein (
   <bold>h, i</bold>). Data are shown as the mean ± SD derived from three repeatedexperiments. *
