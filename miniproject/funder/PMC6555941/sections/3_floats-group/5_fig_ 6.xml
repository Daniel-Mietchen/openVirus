  <p>ZIKV NS4A blocks VSV-induced IFN production. 
   <bold>a</bold> 293T cells transfected with IFN-β reporter together with ZIKV-NS4A, DENV-NS4A, ZIKV-prM and IVA-PB1-F2 (500 ng/well) were infected with VSV-GFP for 24 h, and cell lysates were then analyzed for reporter luciferase activity. The data are shown as the mean ± SD derived from three repeat experiments. **

   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> 293T cells were transfected with empty vector, and a ZIKV-NS4A-, DENV-NS4A-, ZIKV-prM- or IVA-PB1-F2-expressing plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were infected with SeV, and the supernatants were UV-treated and used to overlay 293T cells. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were infected with VSV-GFP for 24 h, followed by scoring of the number of GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry (
