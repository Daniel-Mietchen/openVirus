<p>In neglecting the issue of preprints, Kraemer 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also missed some interesting observations. Consideration of preprint dates makes clearer that three types of findings (geographic origin, geographic spread, number of cases) were all reported relatively close to one another during fairly early stages of three of the epidemics (Zika, Ebola, MERS). In the other epidemic (yellow fever), all three peer-reviewed publications lagged well behind the epidemic, although two were published soon enough that preprint sharing could have potentially made their findings available while the epidemic was still ongoing. Publication of integrated analyses lagged behind all three of the other analysis types by no less than 10 months. This dichotomy illustrates that the integrated analyses advocated by Kraemer 
 <italic>et al</italic>. are the ones that struggle the most with timely publication, although all four integrated analyses did make preprints available months in advance of their peer-reviewed form.
