<p>The importance of preprints and other forms of information sharing in the context of disease epidemics has been formally recognised by numerous funders and publishers of scientific research [

 <italic>et al</italic>., only five published their findings as preprints in advance of final publication in a peer-reviewed journal (
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Doing so accelerated the availability of those findings by 111â€“222 days. Three others published their findings in 
 <italic>PLOS Currents Outbreaks</italic>, a now defunct outlet that involved peer review but was otherwise known for its expeditious publication of research during disease epidemics. The other eight withheld their findings from the public domain during critical times when that information could have proven useful for public health officials and other researchers. It is worth noting though that as the use of preprints during disease epidemics grows, so too do challenges associated with their use and the need for solutions to enhance their adoption and impact [
