<p>The article by Kraemer 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], ‘Reconstruction and prediction of viral disease epidemics,’ provides a nice review of several tools used in the analysis of viral disease epidemics and calls for increased, and timelier, integration of these tools. One interesting feature of this paper is the presentation of publication dates for key papers alongside incidence time series for each of four epidemics. I am writing because this presentation neglects a crucial consideration about the publication of scientific research during disease epidemics: the use of preprints.
