We recently found that vascular leak can be triggered by dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) via the disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL). However, the molecular determinants of NS1 required to trigger EGL disruption and the cellular pathway(s) involved remain unknown. Here we report that mutation of a single glycosylated residue of NS1 (N207Q) abolishes the ability of NS1 to trigger EGL disruption and induce endothelial hyperpermeability. Intriguingly, while this mutant bound to the surface of endothelial cells comparably to wild-type NS1, it was no longer internalized, suggesting that NS1 binding and internalization are distinct steps. Using endocytic pathway inhibitors and gene-specific siRNAs, we determined that NS1 was endocytosed into endothelial cells in a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent manner, which was required to trigger endothelial dysfunction <italic>in vitro</italic> and vascular leak <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we found that the N207 glycosylation site is highly conserved among flaviviruses and is also essential for West Nile and Zika virus NS1 to trigger endothelial hyperpermeability via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These data provide critical mechanistic insight into flavivirus NS1-induced pathogenesis, presenting novel therapeutic and vaccine targets for flaviviral diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Vascular leak is a hallmark of severe dengue disease. Recently, our group revealed a critical role for NS1 in induction of endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leakage in an endothelial cell-intrinsic manner. However, the upstream pathway triggered by NS1, as well as the molecular determinants of NS1 required for this phenomenon, remain obscure. Gaining insight into this endothelial cell-intrinsic pathway is critical for understanding dengue pathogenesis, developing novel antiviral therapies, and developing NS1-based vaccine approaches that pose a minimal risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. Our current study expands our knowledge of this novel pathway not only by identifying the requirement of internalization of secreted NS1 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but also by pinpointing the NS1 molecular determinant (N207) required to trigger vascular leak. Further, our work identifies N207 as a residue conserved among multiple flaviviruses (Zika virus and West Nile virus, in addition to DENV), which is critical for NS1-mediated vascular leak in biologically relevant human endothelial cells modeling interstitial compartments in the lung or the blood-brain barrier. Thus, our study identifies endocytosis and a single amino acid (N207) of the NS1 viral toxin as critical for pan-flavivirus pathogenesis, representing a novel target for anti-flaviviral therapy and vaccine development.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>NIAID/NIH</institution></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI24493</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7238-4037</contrib-id><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIAID/NIH grant R01 AI24493 (E.H.).

West Nile virus (WNV) is a related flavivirus that causes encephalitis [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and Zika virus (ZIKV), which recently emerged and generated large epidemics across the Americas, can cause Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome in adults and microcephaly and other congenital birth defects in babies born to women infected during pregnancy [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The 10.7-kb RNA genome of flaviviruses encodes three structural and seven non-structural (NS) proteins, including NS1. We recently described a novel cell-intrinsic role for DENV NS1 in increasing permeability of human endothelial cell monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic> and systemic vascular leak <italic>in vivo</italic> via disruption of components of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL) [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This EGL pathway is distinct from the cytokine-mediated pathway involving activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The NS1-mediated degradation of the EGL involves activation of the protease cathepsin L, heparanase, and sialidases, which in turn disrupt the EGL. However, the upstream pathway initiated by NS1, resulting in cathepsin L activation, EGL degradation, and therefore vascular leak, as well as the molecular determinants of NS1 required for inducing endothelial hyperpermeability, have not yet been identified.</p><p>All flavivirus NS1 genes are highly homologous and encode a 352-amino acid polypeptide with slight variation in glycosylation status that results in a molecular weight of 46&#x02013;55 kDa [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. High-resolution structures of the C-terminal half [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and full-length [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] DENV NS1, as well as the closely related WNV NS1, revealed dimers containing distinct domains for membrane association and interactions with the immune system and provided structural insights into flavivirus NS1 assembly and antibody recognition [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In flavivirus-infected cells, NS1 dimers are found intracellularly and also on the cell surface, while secreted forms are comprised of atypical barrel-shaped hexamers containing lipid cargo [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>DENV NS1 contains two conserved N-linked glycans (N-glycans) at Asn-130 (N130) and Asn-207 (N207), and NS1 proteins derived from different cells/species exhibit distinct types of N-glycosylation [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previous studies investigating the importance of the N-glycans on NS1 found that DENV2 deglycosylated at either site exhibited significant attenuation of neurovirulence in mice compared to the wild-type (WT) virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the mechanism of this attenuated virulence has never been elucidated, due in part to the fact that NS1 N-glycosylation mutant viruses are unstable, with significant defects in viral replication and proliferation that prevent further conclusive mechanistic study [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This has been a major roadblock in efforts to study the dual role of NS1 in viral replication and pathogenesis. In mammalian cell-derived DENV NS1, complex glycans are attached at Asn-130 and high-mannose glycans are attached at Asn-207 [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; these N-glycans are involved in NS1 dimer stability and secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In this study, to investigate the role of these N-glycosylation sites directly on NS1-induced vascular leak independently from their roles in viral replication, we generated recombinant NS1 in a mammalian expression system, which incorporates human glycosylation patterns. We sought to investigate whether the glycosylation status of NS1 may contribute to its ability to induce endothelial hyperpermeability. Using both transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with confocal microscopy, we show that the NS1-N207Q mutant does not induce endothelial barrier dysfunction or degradation of the EGL of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC). Further, we demonstrate that there are no differences in cell binding <italic>per se</italic> between DENV WT NS1 and the NS1-N207Q mutant, but the latter is not efficiently internalized by endothelial cells, indicating that internalization of NS1 is required for endothelial cell-intrinsic pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that endothelial cells internalize NS1 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and that its inhibition by either small molecule inhibitors or siRNA knock-down prevents NS1-induced hyperpermeability and EGL degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> and vascular leak <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we identify N207 as a conserved residue of NS1 among multiple flaviviruses (such as DENV, ZIKV, and WNV) that is critical for NS1 internalization and endothelial hyperpermeability in biologically relevant human cells.

Since the peak of NS1-induced cathepsin L activation occurs as early as 30 minutes post-treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we conducted an internalization time-course experiment to monitor the lifespan of NS1 within cells to determine whether internalization kinetics correlate with cathepsin L activation. WT NS1 (DENV NS1+) was incubated with HPMEC for 45 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C to allow NS1 to bind to cells. Afterwards, cells were washed with cold PBS to remove any unbound NS1 and were then allowed to incubate at 37&#x000b0;C for varying times. Upon temperature shift to 37&#x000b0;C, NS1 accumulated rapidly in HPMEC, reaching a maximum at 15 minutes post-temperature shift, and then rapidly decreased until dropping to near undetectable levels at 3 hours post-temperature shift (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s010">S9A&#x02013;S9C Fig</xref>).

In our system, the N-glycan at position 130 was required for protein secretion while the N-glycan at position 207 was dispensable for protein secretion and stability, in contrast to Somnuke et al. These differences could be explained by the methods used to produce and purify NS1 proteins between the two studies (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., a different signal sequence mediating secretion and a different strategy and methodology utilized for protein purification). In our current mammalian protein expression system utilizing 293F suspension cells, the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant was efficiently secreted; however, neither the DENV NS1-N130Q mutant nor the double mutant N130Q+N207Q was efficiently secreted, suggesting that the N130 N-glycan site is essential for NS1 secretion. These observations are supported by a previous study that demonstrated that ablation of the homologous glycosylation sites in yellow fever virus NS1 resulted in viral mutants with impaired NS1 secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Due to this technical limitation, the N130Q and N130Q+N207Q constructs were not further characterized in this study. However, based on the significant homology at NS1-N130 across all flaviviruses, it is possible that NS1-N130 may also carry out important pathological functions, which urge further investigation.</p><p>We have previously shown that NS1 activates key endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways, including the sialidase and cathepsin L/heparanase pathways, and that these contribute to NS1-induced hyperpermeability of human endothelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, how these enzymes become activated remain unknown [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our results here provide evidence that internalization of NS1 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for the activation of these pathogenic processes and demonstrate that NS1 localization in endosomes and lysosomes, where cathepsin L is localized, correlates with cathepsin L activation. Further studies defining the biochemical interactions required for this activation are needed and are an area of active investigation.</p><p>Our data suggest that NS1 binding and internalization are distinct steps in triggering endothelial hyperpermeability. Because both WT DENV NS1 and DENV NS1-N207Q are able to bind to HPMEC, but only WT DENV NS1 is internalized, we hypothesize that NS1 initially binds to heparan sulfate moieties on endothelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], independently of the N207 N-glycan. DENV NS1 may then interact with an additional binding partner(s) in a manner dependent on the N207 N-glycan, which leads to internalization, endosomal trafficking, and activation of cathepsin L and/or sialidases. Why is the N207 N-glycosylation site critical for internalization of DENV NS1? First, the N207 N-glycan may be required for engaging a specific receptor on endothelial cells, either directly through a physical interaction or indirectly through a conformational change. Based on the available crystal structure of NS1, amino acid 207 is not predicted to be surface-exposed [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This observation favors a model where a conformational change of NS1 allows this N-glycan to be exposed and mediate an interaction required for internalization or where the N-glycan itself mediates a conformational change of NS1 that allows another domain to mediate an interaction required for internalization. Second, glycosylation patterns have been shown to be important for lateral diffusion of proteins on the plasma membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, an alternate possibility is that the N207 N-glycan is required for NS1 to migrate to the proper microdomain to interact with functional components on the lipid membrane required for internalization. Furthermore, NS1 is secreted from DENV-infected cells predominantly as a soluble hexameric barrel-shaped, high-density lipoprotein with a hydrophobic core containing lipid cargos such as triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The functional importance, if any, of these lipid cargos is yet to be determined. A third possibility for the role of the N207 N-glycan in NS1 internalization is that this sugar moiety may be important for acquisition of specific lipid cargos that play a role during NS1 binding to endothelial cells or even internalization; thus, further investigation of the lipid contents of the mutant NS1 is needed to uncover a potential role of the N207 N-glycan in lipid cargo acquisition as well as a possible role of these lipid cargos in NS1-mediated pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Intriguingly, the NS1-N207Q mutant binds to cells and even recruits clathrin to the cell surface, but fails to be internalized and traffic into early endosomes. Because of these observations, an important remaining question is at what stage of the internalization process is the NS1-N207Q mutant blocked? Cell binding of NS1-N207Q alone may be sufficient to trigger the proper signaling pathway(s) to recruit clathrin to the cell surface but may not be sufficient to trigger the next stage of internalization, perhaps mediated through the engagement of the N207 N-glycan to a receptor. Previous reports of stalled clathrin-coated pits suggest that recruitment of additional factors, such as the clathrin-interacting protein epsin, are required for full maturation and budding of the endosome into the cell [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, another potential explanation may be that the N207 N-glycan is required to recruit additional factors to the clathrin-coated pits that promote internalization. An understanding of the role that other cellular factors, like epsins, play in the maturation of NS1-containing clathrin-coated pits and subsequent internalization is needed to fully elucidate the internalization defect of NS1-N207Q.</p><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NS1 may have implications beyond NS1-triggered endothelial hyperpermeability. It is known that DENV invades cells via endocytosis [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and pharmacologically blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis retards DENV replication [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Further, a recent study demonstrated that DENV NS1 interacts with DENV structural proteins, which modulates infectious viral particle production [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In light of our finding that NS1 is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, NS1 could potentially play a role in mediating clathrin-mediated endocytosis of flavivirus virions. Further studies are needed to elucidate, and potentially differentiate, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of virions via the E protein and/or NS1.</p><p>Regarding overall pathogenic mechanisms, our investigation specifically focuses on a cell-intrinsic pathway by which NS1 mediates the disruption of the EGL, but flavivirus-induced vascular dysfunction is a complex and multifactorial process.

Our data indicate that the cell-intrinsic endothelial dysfunction pathway is triggered not only by DENV NS1, but also by neurotropic WNV and ZIKV NS1 in HBMEC. Our previous study demonstrates that NS1 from multiple flaviviruses (including DENV, WNV, and ZIKV) mediates endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak in a tissue-specific manner reflecting viral tropism [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We speculate that this conserved NS1-mediated cell-intrinsic endothelial dysfunction pathway mediates virus dissemination of different flaviviruses into an appropriate tissue, promoting viral replication.</p><p>In summary, our current study not only identifies the mechanism of internalization of secreted NS1 by human endothelial cells via a dynamin- and clathrin-mediated, caveolin-independent endocytosis pathway, but also pinpoints a single amino acid, the N207 glycosylation site of NS1, as a key determinant of NS1-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability. Mutation of N207 prevents NS1 internalization by human endothelial cells and inhibits disruption of the EGL and endothelial barrier function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, our work identifies N207 of NS1 as a conserved functional residue among multiple flaviviruses (ZIKV and WNV, in addition to DENV) that is essential for flavivirus NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. This new molecular insight into the mechanism of flavivirus NS1-triggered endothelial hyperpermeability is crucial for understanding pan-flaviviral pathogenesis, as well as for developing antiviral therapies and NS1-based vaccine approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Cloning of recombinant NS1 constructs</title><p>A panel of recombinant DENV2 (strain 16681), WNV (NY99), and ZIKV (Nica1-16) NS1 proteins was generated, including wild-type (WT) and site-specific mutant constructs, and the primers utilized are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s001">S1 Table</xref>.

The amount of spatial overlap between the two signals (NS1, red, and Clathrin, Caveolin, Rab5, green) was obtained using four different frames from the maximum projections of two RGB images based on the object-based approach (JACoP) and defined by the Manders&#x02019; Coefficient as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Antibodies and inhibitors for endocytosis experiments</title><p>Primary antibodies against clathrin heavy chain (Clathrin Heavy Chain [D3C6] XP Rabbit mAb [4796S], Cell Signaling), caveolin (Caveolin-1 (D46G3) XP Rabbit mAb #3267, Cell Signaling and Anti-Caveolin-2 antibody EPR5471 [ab133484], Abcam), Rab5 (Anti-Rab5 antibody&#x02014;Early Endosome Marker [ab18211], Abcam), EEA1-early endosome marker (AB2900, Abcam), cathepsin L (BMS166, eBioscience), LAMP1 (ab25630, Abcam), mouse anti-6xHis (MA1-21315, Thermo Scientific), and rabbit anti-6xHis (ab232492, Abcam), together with the secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 647 (ab150115, Abcam), goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (ab150117, Abcam), donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 (ab175470, Abcam) were used in IFA experiments. An anti-6xHis-tag mAb (HIS.H8) conjugated to DyLight 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for NS1 protein binding assays. Additionally, cells were infected with a baculovirus Rab5-GFP overexpression system (CellLight Early Endosomes-GFP, BacMam 2.0, C10586, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, to visualize colocalization of NS1 with Rab5. Selective inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Pitstop 2, Abcam) and dynamin (Dynasore, Sigma) were used in IFA experiments and/or TEER assays at concentrations that do not affect cell viability. Cell viability was determined using the Promega CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The internalization of human transferrin, an iron-binding protein well-known to be internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was used as a control to examine the effectiveness of clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors. Briefly, 30 minutes post-treatment with Pitstop 2 (25 &#x003bc;M) and Dynasore (50 &#x003bc;M) at 37&#x000b0;C, transferrin conjugated to Alexa 568 (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) (T23365, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to HPMEC monolayers cultured on cover slips and incubated for 10 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Then, plates were immediately transferred to an ice-bed; the transferrin inoculum was removed and cell monolayers were washed twice with cold PBS, and then washed twice with pre-chilled acid wash buffer (glycine 100 mM, and 150mM NaCl, pH 2.5) to remove cell-surface associated but non-internalized transferrin [<xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. After this, coverslips were processed as described above for imaging after fixation with 4% PFA.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>siRNA knock-down analysis</title><p>For transient knock-down analysis of clathrin heavy chain (HC), dynamin I/II, and caveolin-1, the siRNA-mediated knock-down system from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used.

HPMEC were then transfected with siRNAs using siRNA Transfection Reagent (sc-29528) in siRNA Transfection Medium (sc-36868) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, cells were assayed for knock-down efficiency by Western blot analysis and used for further experiments. Primary antibodies used for Western blot were as follows: clathrin HC (ab172958, Abcam), Dynamin I/II (2342S, Cell Signaling), caveolin-1 (D46G3) XP Rabbit mAb #3267 (Cell Signaling), and &#x003b1;-tubulin (ab4074, Abcam). Additionally, HPMEC monolayers transiently transfected with distinct siRNAs were analyzed for internalization of fluorescently labeled-transferrin-A568 (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) (T23365, Thermo Scientific) and albumin-FITC (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) (GTX28030, GeneTex) after incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and 1.5 hours, respectively.

Briefly, the dorsal area of 6-week old female WT C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) was depilated 3&#x02013;4 days prior to each experiment. Hair was initially trimmed using hair clippers and then removed using Nair (Church &#x00026; Dwight). Excess Nair was thoroughly wiped off using 70% ethanol and water. On the day of the experiment, DENV2 NS1 (15 &#x003bc;g) was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml Pitstop 2 (abcam) and 0.5 mg/ml Dynasore (abcam). NS1-inhibitor mixtures and controls were then were injected intradermally (ID) into distinct sites in the depilated dorsal skin of mice. Then, 150 &#x003bc;l of 10-kDa dextran conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 (1 mg/ml; Sigma) was delivered by retro-orbital (RO) injection. Two hours after injection, mice were euthanized using isoflurane, and the dorsal skin was removed and placed in Petri dishes. Tissues were then visualized and scanned using a fluorescent detection system (LI-COR Odyssey CLx Imaging System) at a wavelength of 700 nm, and leakage surrounding the injection sites was quantified using Image Studio software (LI-COR Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software, and all graphs were generated using Prism 6.
