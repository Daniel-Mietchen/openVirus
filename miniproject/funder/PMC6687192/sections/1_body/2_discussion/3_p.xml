<p>We have previously shown that NS1 activates key endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways, including the sialidase and cathepsin L/heparanase pathways, and that these contribute to NS1-induced hyperpermeability of human endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our results here provide evidence that internalization of NS1 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for the activation of these pathogenic processes and demonstrate that NS1 localization in endosomes and lysosomes, where cathepsin L is localized, correlates with cathepsin L activation. Further studies defining the biochemical interactions required for this activation are needed and are an area of active investigation.
