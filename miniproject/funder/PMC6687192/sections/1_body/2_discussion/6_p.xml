<p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NS1 may have implications beyond NS1-triggered endothelial hyperpermeability. It is known that DENV invades cells via endocytosis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and pharmacologically blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis retards DENV replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Further, a recent study demonstrated that DENV NS1 interacts with DENV structural proteins, which modulates infectious viral particle production [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In light of our finding that NS1 is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, NS1 could potentially play a role in mediating clathrin-mediated endocytosis of flavivirus virions. Further studies are needed to elucidate, and potentially differentiate, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of virions via the E protein and/or NS1.
