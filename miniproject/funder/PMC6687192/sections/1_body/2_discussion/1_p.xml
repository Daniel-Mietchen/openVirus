<p>In this study, we demonstrate that the N207 glycosylation site of DENV NS1 is essential for inducing EGL degradation and hyperpermeability of human endothelial cells. We found that the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant binds to cells at similar levels as WT DENV NS1 but is retained on the cell surface, in contrast to WT DENV NS1, which is rapidly internalized. Additionally, internalization of WT DENV NS1 was dynamin- and clathrin-dependent, but independent of caveolin. Further, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of WT DENV, WNV, and ZIKV NS1 was required for endothelial hyperpermeability and EGL disruption. Taken together, these results indicate that the N207 glycosylation site is required for endothelial cell internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking of NS1, which is necessary for the activation of enzymes such as cathepsin L that lead to EGL degradation and increased endothelial permeability (
