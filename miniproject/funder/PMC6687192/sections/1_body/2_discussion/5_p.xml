<p>Intriguingly, the NS1-N207Q mutant binds to cells and even recruits clathrin to the cell surface, but fails to be internalized and traffic into early endosomes. Because of these observations, an important remaining question is at what stage of the internalization process is the NS1-N207Q mutant blocked? Cell binding of NS1-N207Q alone may be sufficient to trigger the proper signaling pathway(s) to recruit clathrin to the cell surface but may not be sufficient to trigger the next stage of internalization, perhaps mediated through the engagement of the N207 N-glycan to a receptor. Previous reports of stalled clathrin-coated pits suggest that recruitment of additional factors, such as the clathrin-interacting protein epsin, are required for full maturation and budding of the endosome into the cell [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, another potential explanation may be that the N207 N-glycan is required to recruit additional factors to the clathrin-coated pits that promote internalization. An understanding of the role that other cellular factors, like epsins, play in the maturation of NS1-containing clathrin-coated pits and subsequent internalization is needed to fully elucidate the internalization defect of NS1-N207Q.
