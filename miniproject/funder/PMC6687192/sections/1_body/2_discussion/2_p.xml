<p>Using a transgenic expression system, it was previously shown that the N130 glycan of DENV NS1 was required for stabilization of the secreted NS1 hexamer whereas the N207 glycan facilitated secretion and extracellular protein stability [

In our system, the N-glycan at position 130 was required for protein secretion while the N-glycan at position 207 was dispensable for protein secretion and stability, in contrast to Somnuke et al. These differences could be explained by the methods used to produce and purify NS1 proteins between the two studies (

In our current mammalian protein expression system utilizing 293F suspension cells, the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant was efficiently secreted; however, neither the DENV NS1-N130Q mutant nor the double mutant N130Q+N207Q was efficiently secreted, suggesting that the N130 N-glycan site is essential for NS1 secretion. These observations are supported by a previous study that demonstrated that ablation of the homologous glycosylation sites in yellow fever virus NS1 resulted in viral mutants with impaired NS1 secretion [

However, based on the significant homology at NS1-N130 across all flaviviruses, it is possible that NS1-N130 may also carry out important pathological functions, which urge further investigation.
