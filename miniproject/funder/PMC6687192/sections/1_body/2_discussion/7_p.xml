<p>Regarding overall pathogenic mechanisms, our investigation specifically focuses on a cell-intrinsic pathway by which NS1 mediates the disruption of the EGL, but flavivirus-induced vascular dysfunction is a complex and multifactorial process. It can be mediated through the NS1 endothelial cell-intrinsic pathway [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], through production of proinflammatory cytokines by immune cells induced by either the virus or NS1 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], through NS1-activated platelets [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], or even potentially through direct viral infection leading to apoptosis of endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Though endothelial cells can be infected 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by DENV, findings from autopsy studies suggest that this does not occur 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. ZIKV infects human endothelial cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and fetal endothelial cells in a mouse model [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], suggesting another pathway by which ZIKV may trigger endothelial dysfunction. Dissecting the relative contributions of each of these pathways in flavivirus-induced pathology 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is critical for designing appropriate therapeutics that could be used to treat flavivirus-induced vascular dysfunction.
