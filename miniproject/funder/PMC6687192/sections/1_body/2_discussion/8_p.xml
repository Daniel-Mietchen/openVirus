<p>All flaviviruses must disseminate from the blood into specific tissues, where they replicate to high levels. They can do this by infecting migrating immune cells, direct infection of endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our data indicate that the cell-intrinsic endothelial dysfunction pathway is triggered not only by DENV NS1, but also by neurotropic WNV and ZIKV NS1 in HBMEC. Our previous study demonstrates that NS1 from multiple flaviviruses (including DENV, WNV, and ZIKV) mediates endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak in a tissue-specific manner reflecting viral tropism [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We speculate that this conserved NS1-mediated cell-intrinsic endothelial dysfunction pathway mediates virus dissemination of different flaviviruses into an appropriate tissue, promoting viral replication.
