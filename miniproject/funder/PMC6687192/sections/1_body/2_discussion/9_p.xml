<p>In summary, our current study not only identifies the mechanism of internalization of secreted NS1 by human endothelial cells via a dynamin- and clathrin-mediated, caveolin-independent endocytosis pathway, but also pinpoints a single amino acid, the N207 glycosylation site of NS1, as a key determinant of NS1-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability. Mutation of N207 prevents NS1 internalization by human endothelial cells and inhibits disruption of the EGL and endothelial barrier function

Further, our work identifies N207 of NS1 as a conserved functional residue among multiple flaviviruses (ZIKV and WNV, in addition to DENV) that is essential for flavivirus NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. This new molecular insight into the mechanism of flavivirus NS1-triggered endothelial hyperpermeability is crucial for understanding pan-flaviviral pathogenesis, as well as for developing antiviral therapies and NS1-based vaccine approaches.
