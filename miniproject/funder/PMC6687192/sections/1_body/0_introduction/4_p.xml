<p>In this study, to investigate the role of these N-glycosylation sites directly on NS1-induced vascular leak independently from their roles in viral replication, we generated recombinant NS1 in a mammalian expression system, which incorporates human glycosylation patterns. We sought to investigate whether the glycosylation status of NS1 may contribute to its ability to induce endothelial hyperpermeability. Using both transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with confocal microscopy, we show that the NS1-N207Q mutant does not induce endothelial barrier dysfunction or degradation of the EGL of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC). Further, we demonstrate that there are no differences in cell binding 
 <italic>per se</italic> between DENV WT NS1 and the NS1-N207Q mutant, but the latter is not efficiently internalized by endothelial cells, indicating that internalization of NS1 is required for endothelial cell-intrinsic pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that endothelial cells internalize NS1 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and that its inhibition by either small molecule inhibitors or siRNA knock-down prevents NS1-induced hyperpermeability and EGL degradation 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and vascular leak 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, we identify N207 as a conserved residue of NS1 among multiple flaviviruses (such as DENV, ZIKV, and WNV) that is critical for NS1 internalization and endothelial hyperpermeability in biologically relevant human cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the N207 glycosylation site is required for NS1 internalization by endothelial cells and that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a key step in the pathway leading to flavivirus NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability and barrier dysfunction.
