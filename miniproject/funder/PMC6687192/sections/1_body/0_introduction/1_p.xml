<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and infection with any of its four serotypes (DENV1-4) can result in inapparent infection, classic dengue fever, or dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome–severe manifestations characterized by vascular leak that can lead to shock and death [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and Zika virus (ZIKV), which recently emerged and generated large epidemics across the Americas, can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults and microcephaly and other congenital birth defects in babies born to women infected during pregnancy [

We recently described a novel cell-intrinsic role for DENV NS1 in increasing permeability of human endothelial cell monolayers

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This EGL pathway is distinct from the cytokine-mediated pathway involving activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) previously described [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The NS1-mediated degradation of the EGL involves activation of the protease cathepsin L, heparanase, and sialidases, which in turn disrupt the EGL. However, the upstream pathway initiated by NS1, resulting in cathepsin L activation, EGL degradation, and therefore vascular leak, as well as the molecular determinants of NS1 required for inducing endothelial hyperpermeability, have not yet been identified.
