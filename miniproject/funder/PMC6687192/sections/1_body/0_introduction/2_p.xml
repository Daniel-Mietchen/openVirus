<p>All flavivirus NS1 genes are highly homologous and encode a 352-amino acid polypeptide with slight variation in glycosylation status that results in a molecular weight of 46â€“55 kDa [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] DENV NS1, as well as the closely related WNV NS1, revealed dimers containing distinct domains for membrane association and interactions with the immune system and provided structural insights into flavivirus NS1 assembly and antibody recognition [
