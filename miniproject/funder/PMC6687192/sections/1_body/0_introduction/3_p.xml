<p>DENV NS1 contains two conserved N-linked glycans (N-glycans) at Asn-130 (N130) and Asn-207 (N207), and NS1 proteins derived from different cells/species exhibit distinct types of N-glycosylation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previous studies investigating the importance of the N-glycans on NS1 found that DENV2 deglycosylated at either site exhibited significant attenuation of neurovirulence in mice compared to the wild-type (WT) virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the mechanism of this attenuated virulence has never been elucidated, due in part to the fact that NS1 N-glycosylation mutant viruses are unstable, with significant defects in viral replication and proliferation that prevent further conclusive mechanistic study [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This has been a major roadblock in efforts to study the dual role of NS1 in viral replication and pathogenesis. In mammalian cell-derived DENV NS1, complex glycans are attached at Asn-130 and high-mannose glycans are attached at Asn-207 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; these N-glycans are involved in NS1 dimer stability and secretion [
