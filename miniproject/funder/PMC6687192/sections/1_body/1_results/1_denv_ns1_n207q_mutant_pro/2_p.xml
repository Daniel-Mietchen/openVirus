<p>We next compared the size and stability of the NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q proteins. When subjected to size-exclusion chromatography, both our in-house produced NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q eluted at similar fractions, suggesting they are of comparable size and conformation (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], to further confirm that NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q were in a comparable conformation. Indeed, we found that 9NS1 recognized WT NS1 (both commercial and in-house produced) comparably to NS1-N207Q in native conditions but did not detect any of the three under denaturing conditions. This confirms both that 9NS1 functions as a conformational antibody and that the conformation of NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q is comparable (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s004">S3A Fig</xref>). As expected, several additional NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies that are not conformation-dependent, as well as an antibody targeting the 6xHis-tag, recognized all NS1 proteins comparably in native and denaturing conditions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s004">S3A Fig</xref>). Next, to confirm that our purified and dialyzed NS1 proteins were stable at 37°C over the time-frame relevant for our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture-based assays, we diluted the NS1 proteins in our standard cell culture medium and incubated these proteins at 37°C for varying times. We found that both NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q are stable under these conditions both at time-points relevant for our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (7 hours) and even at longer time-points (48 hours) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s004">S3B–S3D Fig</xref>). As expected, in these experiments, the addition of SDS or proteinase K degraded NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s004">S3B–S3D Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that our purified NS1 proteins (both NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q) are comparable in size, conformation, and stability.
