<p>To examine the role of NS1 glycosylation status on endothelial barrier dysfunction, we generated several NS1 constructs targeting glycosylation sites in DENV2 NS1 (henceforth referred to as DENV NS1), including WT, the single N-glycosylation mutants N130Q and N207Q, and the double mutant N130Q+N207Q (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s001">S1 Table</xref>). DENV NS1-WT and DENV NS1-N207Q were successfully secreted and purified as oligomers (MW: &gt;250 kDa) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s002">S1A Fig</xref>); the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant (monomer ~43 kDa) was slightly smaller than the NS1-WT monomer (~48 kDa) due to loss of the N207 glycosylation site (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast, the N130Q mutant was not efficiently secreted, nor was the double mutant N130Q+N207Q (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s002">S1B Fig</xref>); thus, these two constructs were not further characterized. 6xHis-tagged recombinant DENV NS1 proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin agarose beads and subjected to dialysis; the resulting purified DENV NS1 proteins (WT and N207Q) were visualized by silver stain and found to exhibit purity similar to commercially available NS1 (&gt;95%), as previously described [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To confirm the successful removal of an N-glycan at position 207, we digested WT NS1 (both commercial and in-house produced) and the NS1-N207Q mutant with endoglycosidase H (Endo H; removes high mannose glycans) or PNGase F (removes complex glycans and high mannose glycans), and measured their digestion sensitivity through observation of a gel shift by Western blot. The commercial and in-house produced WT NS1 proteins were sensitive to digestion by both Endo H and PNGase F, suggesting they possessed both the high mannose glycan at position 207 as well as the complex glycan at position 130. In contrast, the NS1-N207Q mutant was sensitive to digestion with PNGase F but not Endo H, suggesting that it retained the complex glycan at position 130 but no longer possessed the high mannose N-glycan at position 207, confirming its removal by the N207Q mutation (
