<p>To investigate the functional role of NS1 glycosylation on NS1-mediated pathogenesis, we first studied the effects of the proteins on endothelial barrier function by measuring the TEER of HPMEC, since a major site of vascular leak in severe dengue occurs in the lungs [

In contrast, the relative TEER of the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant was similar to that of mock-treated cells, demonstrating that mutation of the N207 glycosylation site in DENV NS1 completely prevents induction of endothelial hyperpermeability in HPMEC (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s005">S4B Fig</xref>); these cells model barrier function of the blood-brain barrier, which is relevant due to cases of dengue encephalitis and reports of DENV detected in the brain in autopsies of dengue shock cases [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Together, these data suggest that the N207 glycosylation site is a critical molecular determinant of DENV NS1-mediated pathogenesis.
