<p>Given the importance of the N207 glycosylation site for DENV NS1-mediated endothelial hyperpermeability, we investigated its prevalence among related viruses and found a high level of conservation of this site in multiple flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). We then expanded our study to examine the role of the N207 glycosylation site of NS1 on the endothelial permeability of HBMEC in two closely related neurotropic flaviviruses–WNV and ZIKV. We first generated the WNV and ZIKV NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q mutant recombinant proteins

All proteins were secreted equivalently and appeared stable throughout the purification/dialysis procedure; further, all proteins were determined to be pure by silver staining and in a hexameric/oligomeric structure by native gels (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s014">S13A–S13F Fig</xref>). We found that WT WNV and ZIKV NS1 (commercial or produced in-house) triggered endothelial hyperpermeability as measured by TEER, indicating that WT NS1 proteins are capable of inducing endothelial hyperpermeability in HBMEC [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s015">S14A and 14B Fig</xref>). In contrast to the WT NS1 proteins, both the WNV NS1-N207Q and ZIKV NS1-N207Q mutants failed to trigger endothelial hyperpermeability of HBMEC, suggesting that the N207 glycosylation site is a critical determinant for endothelial hyperpermeability induced by NS1 from multiple flaviviruses (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s015">S14A and S14B Fig</xref>). To determine whether the N207 residue is also required for internalization of NS1 from related flavivirus such as WNV and ZIKV, as it is for DENV NS1, we conducted a binding/internalization assay of NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q from DENV, WNV, and ZIKV using HPMEC and HBMEC. In this internalization assay, we measured colocalization of NS1 with Rab5 and interpreted Rab5-positive NS1 puncta to represent binding and internalization while Rab5-negative puncta represent binding only. As observed previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], DENV NS1-WT bound well to both HPMEC and HBMEC while WNV and ZIKV NS1 only efficiently bound to HBMEC, and this was also the case for the NS1-N207Q mutants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s016">S15A–S15C Fig</xref>). Further, within HBMEC, to which ZIKV and WNV NS1 efficiently bound, the NS1-WT proteins but not the NS1-N207Q mutants of DENV, WNV, and ZIKV were efficiently internalized (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s016">S15A–S15C Fig</xref>). These data suggest that like DENV NS1, the N207-glycosylation site is critical for internalization of WNV and ZIKV NS1 proteins. We next investigated whether clathrin-mediated endocytosis was a common pathway for flavivirus NS1-mediated pathogenesis. We found that Pitstop 2 blocked heparan sulfate shedding on HBMEC induced by WT WNV NS1 and WT ZIKV NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g008">Fig 8D–8E</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that internalization of NS1 via a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway is a conserved mechanism for NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability for multiple flaviviruses.
