<p>To test whether DENV NS1 internalization is required for EGL disruption, we evaluated the effect of Pitstop 2 treatment on cathepsin L activation and heparan sulfate degradation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Pretreatment of HPMEC with Pitstop 2 prevented the activation of cathepsin L and subsequent EGL degradation by WT DENV NS1, as demonstrated by decreased cathepsin L activity and reduced heparan sulfate on the surface of HPMEC, respectively (

 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dynasore, a common inhibitor of endocytosis, antagonizes the small GTPase dynamin, which is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Pretreatment of HPMEC with either Dynasore or Pitstop 2 abolished DENV NS1-triggered endothelial hyperpermeability as measured by TEER (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). To confirm that these inhibitors blocked clathrin-mediated endocytosis in our system, we measured the capacity of both Pitstop 2 and Dynasore to block internalization of transferrin, a protein well appreciated to be taken up via clathrin-mediated endocytosis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As expected, Pitstop2 and Dynasore, but not the DMSO vehicle control, blocked internalization of transferrin into HPMEC (
