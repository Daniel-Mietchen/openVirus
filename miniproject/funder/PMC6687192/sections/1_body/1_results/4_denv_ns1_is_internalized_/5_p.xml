<p>Because chemical inhibitors can have off-target effects, we genetically knocked down clathrin, dynamin, and caveolin to confirm the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in DENV NS1 EGL disruption. Utilization of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting either the clathrin heavy chain, dynamin I and II (I/II), or caveolin-1 mRNA enabled us to knock down expression of the proteins encoded by these transcripts. Knocking down clathrin and dynamin, but not caveolin, abolished NS1-mediated EGL disruption, as determined by heparan sulfate surface expression (

To confirm that our siRNA knock-down experiments successfully blocked clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis in our system, we conducted internalization assays in these cells using transferrin as well as human serum albumin, which is known to be internalized via caveolin-mediated endocytosis [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s013">S12</xref> Figs), confirming the specificity of our siRNA system. These results indicate that NS1 is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is critical for NS1-induced hyperpermeability and EGL degradation.
