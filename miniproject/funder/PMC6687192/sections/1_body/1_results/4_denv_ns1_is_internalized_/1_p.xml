<p>Endocytosis is a major route for transporting molecules into cells to regulate many cellular signaling processes and is commonly facilitated by two main endocytic molecules: clathrin and caveolin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To interrogate the mechanism by which DENV NS1 is internalized by human endothelial cells, we incubated DENV NS1 with HPMEC and examined localization of internalized NS1 with clathrin and caveolin. We detected colocalization of WT DENV NS1 (both commercial and in-house-produced) with clathrin (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>), only WT DENV NS1 colocalized with the early endosome marker Rab5 (
