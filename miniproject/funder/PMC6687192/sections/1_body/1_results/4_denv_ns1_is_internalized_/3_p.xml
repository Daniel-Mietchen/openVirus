<p>Cathepsin L and downstream cellular enzymes are activated in endothelial cells treated with NS1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; as such, we hypothesized that internalized NS1 would colocalize with cathepsin L. Since the peak of NS1-induced cathepsin L activation occurs as early as 30 minutes post-treatment [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we conducted an internalization time-course experiment to monitor the lifespan of NS1 within cells to determine whether internalization kinetics correlate with cathepsin L activation. WT NS1 (DENV NS1+) was incubated with HPMEC for 45 minutes at 4°C to allow NS1 to bind to cells. Afterwards, cells were washed with cold PBS to remove any unbound NS1 and were then allowed to incubate at 37°C for varying times. Upon temperature shift to 37°C, NS1 accumulated rapidly in HPMEC, reaching a maximum at 15 minutes post-temperature shift, and then rapidly decreased until dropping to near undetectable levels at 3 hours post-temperature shift (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s010">S9D and S9E Fig</xref>). These data indicate that NS1 rapidly and transiently internalizes into cells and localizes to compartments where cathepsin L is present, suggesting that internalization of NS1 may be required for activation of cathepsin L, and thus downstream disruption of the EGL.
