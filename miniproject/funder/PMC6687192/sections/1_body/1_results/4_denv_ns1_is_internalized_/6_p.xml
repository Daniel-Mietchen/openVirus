<p>To determine whether clathrin-mediated endocytosis is required for NS1 to trigger vascular leak 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we utilized a mouse model of localized leak in the dermis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this assay, NS1 or control proteins are injected intradermally (ID) into the depilated backs of mice; up to four different conditions can be tested per mouse. Fluorescently labeled soluble dextran (Alexa Fluor 680-dextran) is then administered intravenously, and accumulation of Alexa Fluor 680-dextran in the backs of mice (where ID injections of NS1 or controls occurred) is monitored at 2 hours post-dextran injection. We injected mice with NS1 or PBS mixed with a vehicle control or with a cocktail of Pitstop 2 and Dynasore to antagonize clathrin-mediated endocytosis locally (4 conditions total). Injection with NS1 mixed with a vehicle control showed significantly greater fluorescent signal (i.e., leakage) compared to the PBS conditions or NS1 mixed with the clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor cocktail, suggesting that this cocktail blocked NS1-mediated leak in the dermis. These data suggest that NS1-triggered leakage 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the mouse dermis, requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis (
