<p>We previously demonstrated that DENV NS1 binds to endothelial cells and activates cathepsin L, which then activates heparanase, leading to cleavage of heparan sulfate from proteoglycans on the cell surface [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Together, these events contribute to NS1-induced degradation of the EGL, leading to endothelial barrier dysfunction [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To mechanistically determine why the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant no longer triggers hyperpermeability of HPMEC, we first asked whether the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant was still able to bind to the surface of endothelial cells. We found that both the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant and WT DENV NS1 (both commercial and in-house-produced) bound to the surface of HPMEC as visualized by IFA (

However, the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant did not trigger EGL disruption, as determined by disruption of sialic acid, activation of cathepsin L, and cleavage of heparan sulfate, visualized by IFA at 1 and 6 hours post-treatment (hpt) with NS1 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s006">S5A and S5C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the N-glycosylation of DENV NS1 at residue 207 plays a role in the activation of the endothelial cell-intrinsic mechanisms leading to disruption of the EGL.
