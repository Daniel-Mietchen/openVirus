<p>Our previous observations, and the observations of others, support the concept of NS1 internalization by endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To further support the notion that the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant has a defect in internalization, we incubated WT DENV NS1 and DENV NS1-N207Q with HPMEC at 37°C and compared levels of NS1 after stripping surface-bound NS1 from HPMEC; the remaining NS1 is presumed to have been internalized. We found that WT DENV NS1 (both commercial and in-house-produced) appeared at higher levels than the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant in the HPMEC cell lysate at 1 hpt following trypsin-mediated removal of surface-bound NS1, as measured by Western blot, supporting our hypothesis that the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant has an internalization defect (

To visualize intracellular WT NS1, we incubated NS1 with HPMEC at 37°C for 1 hour and examined permeabilized cells by IFA for colocalization of WT DENV NS1-WT with Rab5, a regulatory GTPase associated with early endosomes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Both WT NS1 and NS1-N207Q proteins were detected; however, only WT DENV NS1, but not DENV NS1-N207Q, colocalized with Rab5 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s008">S7B Fig</xref>). This pattern can also be visualized in an animated single 2D projection of NS1 internalization in HPMEC created using multiple confocal Z-stack images (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s018">S2</xref> Movies). After binding to the cell surface, the WT NS1 protein (in 
 <italic>red</italic>, indicated by white arrowheads) moves inside the cell, where it encounters Rab5 (in 
 <italic>green</italic>), which results in a coalescence signal (in 
 <italic>yellow</italic>), suggesting their spatial colocalization in the cell. Interestingly, as the Z stack images move into a deeper Z axial space, this colocalizing signal disappears, and only the red signal for NS1 persists, suggesting its mobilization into a different intracellular compartment (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s017">S1 Movie</xref>). This process does not occur with the NS1-N207Q mutant protein, where most of the NS1 (in 
 <italic>red</italic>) seems to remain on the cell surface, as little to no signal appears to colocalize with Rab5, suggesting a lack of internalized protein (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s018">S2 Movie</xref>). To further demonstrate the localization of NS1 in the early endosome, we show that NS1 also colocalizes with overexpressed Rab5-GFP as well as an additional early endosome marker (EEA1) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s008">S7C and S7D Fig</xref>) Collectively, these data demonstrate that while both WT DENV NS1 and DENV NS1-N207Q bind comparably to endothelial cells, only WT DENV NS1 is internalized, suggesting that endothelial cell binding and internalization may be distinct stages of NS1-induced cell-intrinsic endothelial hyperpermeability. Based on these results, we hypothesized that DENV NS1 internalization by endothelial cells is a critical step in the activation of EGL disruption and endothelial hyperpermeability.
