<p>Though the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant was still able to bind to the surface of endothelial cells without leading to disruption of the EGL, it surprisingly appeared to bind to the surface of HPMEC at substantially higher levels than WT DENV NS1 (both commercial and in-house-produced) after 6 hours at 37°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). To further investigate this finding, we evaluated NS1 levels on the surface of HPMEC at 4°C, a temperature at which internalization via endocytosis should be greatly reduced [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This examines whether the apparent enhanced binding of DENV NS1-N207Q at 37°C was due to an intrinsically enhanced ability of the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant to bind to endothelial cells or through some other mechanism, such as deficient endocytosis. We found that the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant bound to HPMEC at similar levels as both commercial and in-house-produced WT DENV NS1 when incubated at 4°C for 1 hour, suggesting the DENV NS1-N207Q does not intrinsically bind more to HPMEC compared to WT DENV NS1 (

Instead, when NS1 proteins were incubated with HPMEC at 37°C (allowing for protein internalization) for 1 hour, the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant again bound at higher levels compared to WT NS1, suggesting that it remained on the cell surface, while both commercial and in-house-produced WT NS1 proteins were internalized (
