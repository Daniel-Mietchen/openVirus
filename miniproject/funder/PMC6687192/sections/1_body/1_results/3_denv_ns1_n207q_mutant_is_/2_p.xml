<p>NS1 is known to bind to heparan sulfate moieties on the surface of endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To determine whether the NS1-N207Q mutant still required heparan sulfate moieties to bind to the surface of endothelial cells, we pretreated cells with recombinant heparanase to selectively remove heparan sulfate from the cell surface, and then compared the ability of NS1-WT and the NS1-N207Q mutant to bind to these cells. As expected, the in-house produced NS1-WT exhibited a significant decrease in binding to heparanase-treated cells compared to untreated cells. Similarly, the NS1-N207Q mutant also exhibited a significant decrease in binding to heparanase-treated cells compared to the untreated cells, suggesting that the NS1-N207Q mutant still requires heparan sulfate to bind to the endothelial cell surface (
