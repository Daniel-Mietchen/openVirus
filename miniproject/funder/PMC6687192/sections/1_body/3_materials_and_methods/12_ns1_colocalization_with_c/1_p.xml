<p>IFA was used to determine whether clathrin-mediated endocytosis or caveolin-mediated uptake contribute to internalization of NS1 by endothelial cells. HPMEC or HBMEC were grown and imaged as described above. Briefly, after 45 minutes at 4°C (to normalize protein adsorption), plates were transferred to 37°C for 30 minutes to facilitate protein internalization. After fixation with 4% PFA, samples were processed by IFA and confocal microscopy imaging. A colocalization plugin analysis in ImageJ software was used to define the colocalizing spots between NS1 and clathrin or caveolin in each experimental condition. The amount of spatial overlap between the two signals (NS1, red, and Clathrin, Caveolin, Rab5, green) was obtained using four different frames from the maximum projections of two RGB images based on the object-based approach (JACoP) and defined by the Manders’ Coefficient as previously described [
