<p>NS1 capture ELISA: MaxiSorp ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific Nunc) were coated with 50 μl of an anti-NS1 specific monoclonal antibody (7E11) (5 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The next day the plate was blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 hour then washed twice with 1X PBS. Then 50 ul of NS1 containing supernatant was added to wells and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed 3 times in PBS + 0.1% Tween20 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with another NS1-specific monoclonal antibody (2B7). After an additional three washes in PBS + 0.1% Tween20 a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 0.5 μg/ml in 1% BSA-PBS was added to the wells and incubated for an additional hour. After 3 additional washing steps, the assay was developed using an ABTS-HRP substrate kit (KPL), according to the manufacturer’s specifications.</p>
