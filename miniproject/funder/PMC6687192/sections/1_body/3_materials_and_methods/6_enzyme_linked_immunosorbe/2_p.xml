<p>NS1 direct ELISA: To examine the conformational status of the recombinant NS1 proteins used in this study, we performed a NS1 direct ELISA using a panel of recombinant NS1 proteins (NS1+, NS1-WT, and NS1-N207Q) and anti-NS1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that interacts with the soluble NS1 protein in a conformational-dependent manner. Briefly, ELISA plates (Nunc, Thermo Scientific) were coated overnight at 4°C with a single concentration of NS1 (200 ng/mL) diluted in sterile DPBS (1X, Gibco) under two conditions: native (no SDS) or denaturing (SDS 0.1%, boiling at 99°C for 5 minutes). The next day, plates were washed twice using wash buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween-20) and blocked using blocking buffer (3% bovine albumin, BSA in washing buffer) for 45 minutes at room temperature (RT). Then, plates were probed individually with anti-NS1 mAbs (0.25 μg/mL) which bind NS1 proteins under denaturing conditions (e.g. 7E11 and 2B7) or native conditions (e.g. 9NS1). All recombinant NS1 proteins in this study contain a 6xHis-tag. The anti-6xHis-tag mAb (0.25 μg/mL, Thermo Scientific) was used as positive control for NS1 detection. A peroxidase conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Inc.,)(1:5000) and TMB (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine, Sigma) were used to develop the assay. Plates were allowed to develop for 30 minutes at room temperature and were then stopped with a solution of sulfuric acid (H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, 2N). Plates were read at a 450 nm wavelength using a microplate reader.
