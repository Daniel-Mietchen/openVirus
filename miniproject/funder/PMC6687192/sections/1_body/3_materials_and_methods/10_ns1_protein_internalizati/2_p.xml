<p>Additionally, internalized NS1 (10 μg/ml) was visualized by IFA by co-staining NS1 and Rab5. Briefly, after 45 minutes at 4°C (to normalize protein adsorption), cultures were transferred to 37°C for 1 hour (or the time indicated in the figure for the kinetic analysis) to facilitate protein internalization. For the internalization kinetic experiments, cells were washed twice with PBS before transfer to 37°C, to remove any unbound NS1. Before fixation of samples within the kinetic analysis, cell supernatants were removed, and cell monolayers were rinsed 3X with PBS and then 2X with pre-chilled acid wash buffer (glycine 100 mM, and 150mM NaCl, pH 2.5), removing surface-bound NS1. After fixation with 4% PFA, samples were processed by indirect IFA and confocal microscopy imaging. For experiments using inhibitors, compounds were added to wells 30 minutes before the addition of DENV NS1 protein. Initially, a co-localization plugin analysis in ImageJ software was used to define the co-localizing spots between NS1 and Rab5 in each experimental condition. The amount of spatial overlap between the two signals (NS1 “red” and Rab5 “green”) was obtained using four different frames from the maximum projections of two RGB images based on the object-based approach (JACoP) and defined by the Manders’ Coefficient, as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As an additional analysis to quantify the amount of internalized NS1 protein in HBMEC and HPMEC monolayers by IFA, the number of NS1-positive (NS1
 <sup>+</sup>) puncta per cell (n = 200 cells) and those co-stained with the early endosome marker Rab5 (NS1
 <sup>+</sup>Rab5
 <sup>+</sup>) were manually counted using the multi-point tool in ImageJ.
