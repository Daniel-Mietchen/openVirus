<p>Primary antibodies against clathrin heavy chain (Clathrin Heavy Chain [D3C6] XP Rabbit mAb [4796S], Cell Signaling), caveolin (Caveolin-1 (D46G3) XP Rabbit mAb #3267, Cell Signaling and Anti-Caveolin-2 antibody EPR5471 [ab133484], Abcam), Rab5 (Anti-Rab5 antibody—Early Endosome Marker [ab18211], Abcam), EEA1-early endosome marker (AB2900, Abcam), cathepsin L (BMS166, eBioscience), LAMP1 (ab25630, Abcam), mouse anti-6xHis (MA1-21315, Thermo Scientific), and rabbit anti-6xHis (ab232492, Abcam), together with the secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 647 (ab150115, Abcam), goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 (ab150117, Abcam), donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 (ab175470, Abcam) were used in IFA experiments. An anti-6xHis-tag mAb (HIS.H8) conjugated to DyLight 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for NS1 protein binding assays. Additionally, cells were infected with a baculovirus Rab5-GFP overexpression system (CellLight Early Endosomes-GFP, BacMam 2.0, C10586, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, to visualize colocalization of NS1 with Rab5. Selective inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Pitstop 2, Abcam) and dynamin (Dynasore, Sigma) were used in IFA experiments and/or TEER assays at concentrations that do not affect cell viability. Cell viability was determined using the Promega CellTox Green Cytotoxicity Assay following the manufacturer’s instructions. The internalization of human transferrin, an iron-binding protein well-known to be internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was used as a control to examine the effectiveness of clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors. Briefly, 30 minutes post-treatment with Pitstop 2 (25 μM) and Dynasore (50 μM) at 37°C, transferrin conjugated to Alexa 568 (20 μg/ml) (T23365, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to HPMEC monolayers cultured on cover slips and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. Then, plates were immediately transferred to an ice-bed; the transferrin inoculum was removed and cell monolayers were washed twice with cold PBS, and then washed twice with pre-chilled acid wash buffer (glycine 100 mM, and 150mM NaCl, pH 2.5) to remove cell-surface associated but non-internalized transferrin [
