<p>An animated single 2D projection of NS1 internalization in HPMEC was created by collapsing multiple image-sections (maximum projections) obtained from confocal Z-stack acquisition analyses. Briefly, HPMEC monolayers grown on glass coverslips were treated with DENV NS1 (WT), and the glycosylation mutant (DENV NS1-N207Q) for 1 hour at 37°C. Cell monolayers were processed for immunofluorescence assay as described above co-staining for NS1 protein and the early endosome marker Rab5. Z-stacks were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope (CRL Molecular Imaging Center, UC Berkeley) using a Plan-Apochromat 40X dry objective. Projections of multiple Z-stack sections (20 μm range: 20 slices; 1 μm interval) were performed and animated using Z stack reconstruction plugin in Image J, then saved as Audio Video Interleave (AVI) format. Scale bar, 1 μm.</p>
