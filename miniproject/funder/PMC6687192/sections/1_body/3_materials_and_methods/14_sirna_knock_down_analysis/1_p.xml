<p>For transient knock-down analysis of clathrin heavy chain (HC), dynamin I/II, and caveolin-1, the siRNA-mediated knock-down system from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used. In brief, Control siRNA-A (sc-37007), Clathrin HC siRNA (h) (sc-35067), Dynamin I/II (sc-43736), and caveolin-1 siRNA (h) (sc-29241) were resuspended in siRNA Dilution Buffer (sc-29527) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HPMEC were then transfected with siRNAs using siRNA Transfection Reagent (sc-29528) in siRNA Transfection Medium (sc-36868) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Seventy-two hours post-transfection, cells were assayed for knock-down efficiency by Western blot analysis and used for further experiments. Primary antibodies used for Western blot were as follows: clathrin HC (ab172958, Abcam), Dynamin I/II (2342S, Cell Signaling), caveolin-1 (D46G3) XP Rabbit mAb #3267 (Cell Signaling), and α-tubulin (ab4074, Abcam). Additionally, HPMEC monolayers transiently transfected with distinct siRNAs were analyzed for internalization of fluorescently labeled-transferrin-A568 (20 μg/ml) (T23365, Thermo Scientific) and albumin-FITC (100 μg/ml) (GTX28030, GeneTex) after incubation at 37°C for 10 minutes and 1.5 hours, respectively. The amount of internalized proteins was evaluated by IFA analyses using the same acid wash buffer method described above.</p>
