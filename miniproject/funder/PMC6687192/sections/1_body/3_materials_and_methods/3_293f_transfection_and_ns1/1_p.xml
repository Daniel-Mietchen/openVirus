<p>Transfections were performed using FreeStyle 293F suspension cells and FreeStyle MAX transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and supernatant containing NS1 were collected 48 hours post-transfection. To prevent protein degradation, a tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Life Sciences) was added to every 150 ml of supernatant collected. Cell supernatants were stored at -80°C prior to purification. NS1-containing supernatants were then thawed and concentrated in an Amicon filter with a 100-KDa size cutoff (UFC9100, Millipore). The 6xHis-tagged recombinant DENV NS1 proteins were purified by batch method using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In brief, Ni-NTA resin agarose beads were first equilibrated in binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4), and then supernatants containing NS1 were diluted 1:2 in 2X binding buffer and added to the previously equilibrated Ni-NTA resin agarose beads. NS1-containing supernatants were allowed to bind to the Ni-NTA resin for 30 minutes at 4°C rocking end-over-end. Once binding was completed, the resin was washed 4X in wash buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride, 30 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). Concentrated NS1 was eluted from the Ni-NTA resin using an imidazole-containing elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride, and 200 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). This purified NS1 stock was then subjected to dialysis against 1X PBS for 48 hours at 4°C. Typical concentrations of NS1 stocks obtained ranged from 0.1–0.5 mg/ml. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to quantify the purified recombinant proteins.</p>
