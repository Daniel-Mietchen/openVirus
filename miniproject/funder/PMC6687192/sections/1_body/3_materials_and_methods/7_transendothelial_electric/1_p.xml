<p>To measure the functional effects of the recombinant NS1 proteins, HPMEC and HBMEC were cultured in duplicate wells (80,000 cells in 0.3 ml) in the apical chamber of 24-well Transwell polycarbonate membrane inserts (Transwell permeable support, 0.4 μm, 6.5 mm insert; Corning Inc.) and incubated with 5 μg/ml NS1 protein (WT or mutants, 1.5 μg total protein). TEER was measured as previously described [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Resistance values were measured in Ohms (Ω) at sequential 2-hour time-points following the addition of test proteins using an Epithelial Volt Ohm Meter (EVOM) with “chopstick” electrodes (World Precision Instruments). Untreated endothelial cells grown on Transwell inserts were used as negative untreated controls, and inserts with medium alone were used for blank resistance measurements. Relative TEER represents a ratio of resistance values (Ω) as follows: (Ω experimental condition-Ω medium alone)/(Ω non-treated endothelial cells-Ω medium alone).
