<p>For all other Western blots, SDS-PAGE gels were transferred semi-dry onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane for 7 minutes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] at 25V. The membrane was blocked and incubated with primary anti-6xHis-tag antibody overnight. After washing, a goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added at a dilution of 1:5,000 for 1 hour, and blots were imaged using the LI-COR Odyssey imaging system. Anti-NS1 mAb 7E11 (generously donated by R. Putnak at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) was used for detection of DENV NS1.
