 <italic>In vivo</italic> NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability was measured using a rodent model of localized vascular leak, as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Briefly, the dorsal area of 6-week old female WT C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) was depilated 3–4 days prior to each experiment. Hair was initially trimmed using hair clippers and then removed using Nair (Church &amp; Dwight). Excess Nair was thoroughly wiped off using 70% ethanol and water. On the day of the experiment, DENV2 NS1 (15 μg) was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml Pitstop 2 (abcam) and 0.5 mg/ml Dynasore (abcam). NS1-inhibitor mixtures and controls were then were injected intradermally (ID) into distinct sites in the depilated dorsal skin of mice. Then, 150 μl of 10-kDa dextran conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 (1 mg/ml; Sigma) was delivered by retro-orbital (RO) injection. Two hours after injection, mice were euthanized using isoflurane, and the dorsal skin was removed and placed in Petri dishes. Tissues were then visualized and scanned using a fluorescent detection system (LI-COR Odyssey CLx Imaging System) at a wavelength of 700 nm, and leakage surrounding the injection sites was quantified using Image Studio software (LI-COR Biosciences).
