<p>HPMEC were grown and imaged as described above. To assess the effect of flavivirus NS1 on the integrity of EGL components such as sialic acid and heparan sulfate, HPMEC monolayers were treated with DENV WT (Native Antigen or produced in-house) or NS1-N207Q mutant proteins (5 μg/ml) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at different time-points (1, 6 hpt). A primary antibody against heparan sulfate (clone F58-10E4, Amsbio) was incubated overnight at 4°C, and detection was performed using a secondary goat anti-mouse IgM antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cell surface expression of sialic acid was visualized using the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) [

Untreated cells were used as a control for basal sialic acid and heparan sulfate expression and cathepsin L activity. Images were acquired using the Zen 2010 software (Zeiss) and analyzed with ImageJ software. For representative pictures, an area of ~1.8 μm
 <sup>2</sup> (1.25x1.40 μm) containing ~28–30 cells was used. MFI quantification was performed as described above.
