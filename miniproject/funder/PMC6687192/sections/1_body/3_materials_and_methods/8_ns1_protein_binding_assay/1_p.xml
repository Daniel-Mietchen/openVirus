<p>Confluent HPMEC monolayers grown on gelatin-coated coverslips (0.2%, Sigma) were treated with 5 μg/ml of DENV2 NS1+ from the Native Antigen Company (Oxfordshire, UK) as a positive control, WT DENV NS1 produced in-house, or the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C/4°C or for 6 hours at 37°C, depending on the experiment. To remove heparan sulfate from the cell surface, HPMEC were treated for 24 hours, prior to NS1 treatment with 0.5 units of recombinant heparanase (H3917-50 UN, Sigma). An anti-6xHis-tag antibody conjugated to DyLight 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to detect NS1 protein bound to the cell surface. Untreated cells were used as a negative control. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 AxioObserver-34-channel spectral detector confocal microscope and processed using ImageJ software. For MFI quantification, the threshold for each individual channel (RGB) was adjusted and converted to grayscale. Then, mean grayscale values and integrated density from selected areas were obtained, along with adjacent background readings, and plotted as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).</p>
