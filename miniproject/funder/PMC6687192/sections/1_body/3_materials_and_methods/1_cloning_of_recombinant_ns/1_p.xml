<p>A panel of recombinant DENV2 (strain 16681), WNV (NY99), and ZIKV (Nica1-16) NS1 proteins was generated, including wild-type (WT) and site-specific mutant constructs, and the primers utilized are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Amplicons consisting of the WT DENV or WNV NS1 gene preceded by the CD33 signal sequence and followed by a 6xHis-tag were a gift from M.S. Diamond (Washington University in St. Louis), along with the pmab vector. The WT ZIKV NS1 gene fragment was designed according to the ZIKV Nica1-16 strain sequence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and synthesized by Bio Basic Inc. To introduce mutations, the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs; NEB) was used to perform overlap-extension PCR according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. XbaI and MluI-HF restriction endonucleases (NEB) were used to digest the PCR amplicons and the pmab vector. A Quick Ligation (NEB) was performed to ligate the inserts with the vector, and 5-alpha Competent
