  <p>Internalization of 
   <bold>(A-D)</bold> transferrin-Alexa 568 and 
   <bold>(C, D)</bold> albumin-FITC in HPMEC monolayers grown on coverslips and 
   <bold>(A, B)</bold> treated with chemical inhibitors (30 minutes at 37°C; Pitstop 2 = 25 μM; Dynasore = 50 μM) or 
   <bold>(C, D)</bold> transfected with distinct siRNAs. Internalization of 
   <bold>(A-D)</bold> transferrin conjugated to Alexa-568 (20 μg/ml), to control for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and 
   <bold>(C, D)</bold> albumin-FITC (100 μg/ml), to control for caveolin-mediated endocytosis, was determined after 10 minutes and 1.5 hours at 37°C, respectively. After this time, cell monolayers were washed (4X) with an acid buffer to remove bound-non-internalized proteins. The amount of internalized transferrin and albumin was determined by confocal microscopy imaging (images: 20X; scale bars, 25 μm) and expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The means ± SEM of two (B, D right) or three (D left) individual experiments run in duplicate are shown. ns, not significant; *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.
