  <title>Related to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g008">Fig 8</xref>. Flavivirus NS1 residue N207 plays a conserved role in NS1 internalization.
  </title>
  <p>HPMEC (
   <bold>A top, B</bold>) and HBMEC (
   <bold>A bottom, C</bold>) monolayers grown on coverslips were treated with three different flavivirus NS1 proteins (DENV, ZIKV and WNV: 10 μg/ml) including NS1-WT and the NS1-N207Q mutant. NS1 binding and internalization were examined after 1.5 hours of incubation at 37°C using confocal microscopy to detect the co-staining of NS1 protein (red) and the early endosomal marker Rab5 (green). Nuclei were stained using Hoechst (blue). Images (40X; scale bars, 5 μm) are representative of 2 independent experiments. 
   <bold>(B, C)</bold> The amount of total NS1 in each endothelial cell (red staining in 
   <bold>A</bold>) was expressed as NS1
   <sup>+</sup>, total puncta per cell (light blue open circles), and NS1 puncta colocalized with Rab5 (yellow staining in 
   <bold>A</bold>) was expressed as NS1
   <sup>+</sup> Rab5
   <sup>+</sup> puncta, indicating NS1 colocalization and therefore internalization (dark blue open squares). NS1
   <sup>+</sup> puncta were counted from a total of 200 cells collected from two independent experiments and analyzed using ImageJ. Dashed lines (light grey) and solid lines (black) represent the mean values for NS1
   <sup>+</sup> total puncta and NS1
   <sup>+</sup>Rab5
   <sup>+</sup> puncta, respectively.
