  <title>Mutation of the N-glycosylation site 207 prevents DENV NS1-induced cathepsin L and sialidase activation and EGL disruption on endothelial cells.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> NS1 protein binding (green, top row) to HPMEC 6 hpt at 37°C was visualized via IFA. The integrity of the EGL was assessed by the presence of sialic acid (Sia) surface expression, stained with WGA-A647 (red, 2
   <sup>nd</sup> row; merge of NS1 and Sia), as well as cathepsin L (CTSL) activity (red, 3
   <sup>rd</sup> row) and heparan sulfate [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] surface expression (green, bottom row), in HPMEC 6 hpt with NS1 at 37°C, as visualized via IFA. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (20X; scale bars, 50 μm) are representative of 2 independent experiments. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) was used to quantify the amount of NS1 binding to the cell surface, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> sialic acid surface expression, 
   <bold>(D)</bold> cathepsin L activity, and 
   <bold>(E)</bold> heparan sulfate expression on HPMEC in 
   <bold>Fig 2A</bold>. The means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of two individual experiments run in duplicate are shown. ns = not significant; *, p&lt;0.05; ***, p&lt;0.001; ****, p&lt;0.0001.
