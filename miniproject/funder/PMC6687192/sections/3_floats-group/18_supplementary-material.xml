  <title>Related to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g004">Fig 4</xref>. NS1 rapidly and transiently accumulates inside HPMEC, where it colocalizes with the lysosomal marker Lamp1 and cathepsin L.

  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Internalization of NS1 (10 μg/ml) into HPMEC was measured at the indicated time-points after allowing NS1 to adsorb to the cell surface at 4°C. After NS1 adsorption, cells were washed twice in cold PBS to remove unbound NS1 and were moved to 37°C for the indicated times. At the indicated time-points, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and visualized by IFA. Before fixation, cells were washed in a glycine-acid buffer to remove NS1 that is bound to the surface but not yet internalized. NS1 is visualized by an anti-6xHis-tag antibody (green), and nuclei of cells are stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (20X; scale bars, 50 μm) are representative of two independent experiments. (
   <bold>B</bold>) MFI quantification of internalized NS1 in A. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Same as A, except cells were collected in protein sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Before cell lysis, cells were washed in a glycine-acid buffer to remove NS1 that is bound to the surface but not yet internalized. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> NS1 was allowed to internalize into HPMEC for 90 minutes (unbound NS1 was not washed away), cells were then fixed and permeabilized, and colocalization of NS1 and cellular markers was visualized by IFA. NS1 was detected with an anti-6xHis-tag antibody (green, the secondary antibody was conjugated to AF488). Lamp1 (red, the secondary antibody was conjugated to AF568); CTSL, cathepsin L (red, the secondary antibody was conjugated to AF647). Images (20X; scale bars, 25 μm) are representative of two independent experiments.
