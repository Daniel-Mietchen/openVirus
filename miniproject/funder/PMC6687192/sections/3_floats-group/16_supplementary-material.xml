  <title>Related to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g003">Fig 3</xref>. NS1-WT but not NS1-N207Q are internalized into HPMEC and localize to the early endosome.

   <bold>(A)</bold> Western blot analysis of HPMEC from 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g003">Fig 3C</xref> treated with 10 μg/ml of the indicated NS1 and incubated at 37°C for 1.5 hours. Cells were not trypsinized to demonstrate the addition of equivalent NS1 levels to cells. NS1 was detected using an NS1-specific monoclonal antibody (7E11). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> IFA analysis of HPMEC from 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g003">Fig 3E</xref> not treated with NS1. NS1 signal (red) is the first panel from the left and Rab5 signal (green) is the second panel from the left. Colocalization is shown in yellow in the merged image or white in the colocalization panel (ImageJ). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> IFA analysis of HPMEC cells overexpressing Rab5 (CellLight-Rab5-GFP) (green) treated with NS1 (10 μg/ml) (red). Colocalization is shown in yellow in the merged image. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> IFA analysis of HPMEC treated with NS1 (10 μg/ml) (red) and stained for the early-endosome marker EEA1 (green). Colocalization is shown in yellow in the merged image. For all images, nuclei are stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (40X; scale bars, 10 μm) are representative of 2 individual experiments run in duplicate. NS1+, NS1 from the Native Antigen Company.
