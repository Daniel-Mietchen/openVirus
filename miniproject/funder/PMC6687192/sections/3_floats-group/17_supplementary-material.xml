  <title>Related to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g004">Fig 4</xref>. WT DENV NS1 colocalizes with clathrin but not with caveolin on the surface of HBMEC.
  </title>
  <p>Colocalization of DENV NS1 proteins with either clathrin 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or caveolin 
   <bold>(B)</bold> in HBMEC was performed as described in the legend for 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, except HBMEC were plated instead of HPMEC. Images are 40X; scale bars, 5 μm. Quantification of the amount of spatial overlap between the two signals, NS1 and clathrin 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, or NS1 and caveolin 
   <bold>(D)</bold> in S8A Fig and S8B Fig, respectively. The means ± SEM of two individual experiments run in duplicate are shown.
