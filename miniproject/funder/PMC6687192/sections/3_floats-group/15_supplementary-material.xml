  <title>Related to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g003">Fig 3</xref>. NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q both require heparan sulfate to bind to the surface of HPMEC.

  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The binding of in-house-produced NS1-WT and the NS1-N207Q mutant (10 μg/ml) (red) to HPMEC was visualized via IFA 24 hpt with 0.5 units of recombinant heparanase; untreated cells were used as a control. The nuclei of cells are stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (20X; scale bars, 50μm) are representative of three independent experiments. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantitation of cell binding in A. **, p&lt;0.01. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Heparan sulfate surface expression (green) in HPMEC 24 hpt with 0.5 units of recombinant heparanase at 37°C, as visualized via IFA. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (20X; scale bars, 50 μm) are representative of 3 independent experiments.
