  <title>DENV NS1 colocalizes with clathrin but not caveolin on the surface of HPMEC, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitors prevent colocalization of NS1 and Rab5.</title>
  <p>Confluent HPMEC monolayers were exposed to 10 μg/ml of different NS1 proteins and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. Colocalization of NS1 proteins (red, left column), as indicated, with either 
   <bold>(A)</bold> clathrin or 
   <bold>(B)</bold> caveolin (green, second column) in HPMEC. Colocalization is shown in yellow in merge images (third column) or white in colocalization panels (fourth column; JACoP, ImageJ). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (40X; scale bars, 5 μm) are representative of 2 independent experiments performed in duplicate. 
   <bold>(C-D)</bold> Quantification of the amount of spatial overlap between the two signals, NS1 and clathrin 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, or NS1 and caveolin 
   <bold>(D)</bold> in 
   <bold>Fig 4A</bold> and 
   <bold>4B</bold>, respectively. The means ± SEM of two individual experiments run in duplicate are shown. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor Pitstop 2 prevents colocalization of WT DENV NS1 with Rab5 in HPMEC. Colocalization of NS1 proteins (red, first column) on HPMEC treated with either DMSO (top row) or Pitstop 2 (bottom row) with Rab5 (green, second column) 1.5 hpt with NS1. Colocalization is shown in yellow in merge images (third column) or white in colocalization panels (fourth column; JACoP, ImageJ). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (40X; scale bars, 5 μm) are representative of 2 independent experiments performed in duplicate. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Quantification of the amount of spatial overlap between the two signals, NS1 and Rab5 in 
   <bold>Fig 4E</bold>. The means ± SEM of two individual experiments run in duplicate are shown. ns = not significant; **, p&lt;0.01.
