  <title>A single N-glycosylation mutant (N207Q) abrogates clathrin mediated-endocytosis of different flavivirus NS1 proteins in human endothelial cells, which is required to trigger EGL disruption and vascular leakage.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> The flavivirus NS1 proteins are secreted as hexamers and contain two glycosylation sites (DENV, ZIKV, JEV, and YFV; aa 130 and 207) or three glycosylation sites (WNV; aa 130, 175, and 207). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Overview of NS1 effects on endothelial cells. 
   <bold>(B1)</bold> Both NS1-WT and the NS1-N207Q mutant bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs; e.g., heparan sulfate) on endothelial cells (ECs), decorating the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) and the cell surface. 
   <bold>(B2)</bold> Both WT and the N207Q mutant of NS1 trigger recruitment of clathrin triskelion proteins to the plasma membrane. However, only the WT protein can induce maturation and scission of the clathrin-coated pit in a dynamin-dependent manner, while the N207Q mutant appears to remain sequestered on the cell surface. The use of specific chemical inhibitors for clathrin (i.e., Pitstop2) and dynamin (i.e. Dynasore) and siRNA transfection with siClathrin and siDynamin prevent NS1 internalization into HPMEC. 
   <bold>(B3)</bold> This internalization process results in NS1 colocalization with an early endosome marker, Rab5. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NS1 (WT) triggers remodeling of the EGL after activation of endosomal-resident proteases such as cathepsin L, which induces activation of the endoglycosidase heparanase, inducing degradation of heparan sulfate on the EGL, leading to endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leakage.
