  <title>Related to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g001">Fig 1</xref>. DENV WT NS1 and N-glycosylation site mutant N207Q are efficiently secreted, and the NS1-N207Q mutant lacks a high mannose N-glycan.

   <bold>(A)</bold> Supernatants from 293F cells transfected with WT DENV NS1 or N-glycosylation mutant NS1-N207Q were concentrated using Amicon Ultra filters (100-kDa), and the concentrated top fraction (Top) and flow-through (FT) were both collected. NS1 monomers were detected via Western Blot of SDS-PAGE, using an anti-6xHis-tag antibody. (
   <bold>B)</bold> Western blot of SDS-PAGE showing the expression and secretion of WT DENV NS1, NS1 glycosylation mutant (N130Q), and double mutant (N130Q+N207Q). Anti-6xHis-tag antibody was used for detection of the NS1 monomer. S/N, supernatant; CL, cell lysate; NS1+, DENV2 NS1 (Native Antigen Company); Neg, gel loading buffer only. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Western blot of purified NS1 proteins treated with Endo H or PNGase F (NEB) for 1 hour at 37Â°C, using an anti-6xHis-tag antibody and demonstrating absence of the high mannose N-glycan at position 207 of the NS1-N207Q mutant. -, untreated; +E, Endo H-treated; +P, PNGase F-treated; arrows indicate which N-glycan species are present for each band.
