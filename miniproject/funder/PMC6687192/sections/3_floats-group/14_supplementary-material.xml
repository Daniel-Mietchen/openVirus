  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The binding of DENV NS1 (NS1+, Native Antigen Company), the in-house-produced DENV NS1-WT, and NS1-N207Q mutant (green) to HPMEC 1 hour post-treatment (hpt) was visualized via immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The integrity of the EGL component sialic acid (Sia) was assessed after 1 hpt at 37°C. Sia, stained with WGA-A647 (red); nuclei, stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (20X; scale bars, 50μm) are representative of two independent experiments run in duplicate. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Quantitation of A (top, NS1 binding). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Quantitation of A (bottom, sialic acid). The means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of two individual experiments run in duplicate are shown. ns, not significant; *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.
