   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g003">Fig 3</xref>: DENV NS1-WT but not the DENV NS1-N207Q mutant are internalized into endothelial cells where they colocalize with Rab5.
  </title>
  <p>An animated single 2D projection of NS1 internalization in HPMEC created using multiple confocal z-stack images. (
   <bold>S1 Movie</bold>) After binding to the cell surface, the WT NS1 protein (in 
   <italic>red</italic>, indicated by white arrowheads) moves inside the cell, where it encounters Rab5 (in 
   <italic>green</italic>), which results in a coalescence signal (in 
   <italic>yellow</italic>), suggesting spatial colocalization. As the Z stack images move into a deeper Z axial space, this colocalizing signal disappears, and only the red signal for NS1 persists, suggesting its mobilization into a different intracellular compartment. (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007938.s018">S2 Movie</xref>) This process does not occur with the NS1-N207Q mutant protein, where most of the NS1 (in 
   <italic>red</italic>) remain at a higher Z axial space, as little to no signal appears to colocalize with Rab5, suggesting this mutant NS1 protein is retained on the cell surface.
