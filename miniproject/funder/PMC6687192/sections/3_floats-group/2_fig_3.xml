  <title>Mutation of the N-glycosylation site 207 of DENV NS1 results in defective NS1 internalization.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> NS1 protein binding (green) to HPMEC 1 hpt at 4°C (top row) or 37°C (bottom row) was visualized via IFA. Images (20X; scale bars, 50 μm) are representative of 2 independent experiments. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> MFI was used to quantify the amount of NS1 binding to the cell surface 1 hpt at 4°C and 37°C in 
   <bold>Fig 3A</bold>. The means ± SEM of two individual experiments run in duplicate are shown. ns = not significant; ****, p&lt;0.0001. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Confluent HPMEC monolayers were exposed to 10 μg/ml of different NS1 proteins and incubated at 37°C for 1 hours. Trypsin was used to remove surface-bound NS1, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot. Western blot shows detection of the internalized DENV NS1 protein, GAPDH (loading control), and Rab5, an early endosome marker. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Quantitation of C. Each bar represents the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of densitometry values normalized to the control protein α-tubulin from two independent experiments. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Co-localization of NS1 proteins (red), as indicated, with Rab5 (green) in HPMEC. Co-localization is shown in yellow in merge image or white in co-localization panel (JACoP, ImageJ). Nuclei are stained with Hoechst (blue). Images (40X; scale bars, 10 μm) are representative of 2 individual experiments run in duplicate. NS1+, NS1 from Native Antigen Company. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Quantification of DENV NS1 and Rab5 colocalization in HPMEC in 
   <bold>Fig 3E</bold>. Quantification of the amount of spatial overlap between the two signals (NS1 in red and Rab5 in green) in 
   <bold>Fig 3E</bold> was obtained using four different frames from the maximum projections of two RGB images based on the object-based approach (JACoP) and defined by the Manders’ Coefficient as previously described [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007938.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The colocalization coefficient was normalized taking into account the signal obtained from 300 cells per image. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of MFI values in the colocalization analyses obtained from two independent experiments. NS1+, NS1 from Native Antigen Company. ns = not significant; ***, p&lt;0.001.
