  <title>Related to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007938.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Purified NS1-WT and NS1-N207Q exist in a comparable conformation and are equally stable over time.

   <bold>(A)</bold> NS1 direct ELISA comparing binding of three non-conformational mouse monoclonal antibodies (7E11, 2B7, and anti-6xHis) and one conformational mouse monoclonal antibody (9NS1) to NS1+, NS1-WT, or NS1-N207Q at a concentration of 200 ng/ml in native conditions (PBS) or denaturing conditions (PBS + 0.1% SDS with boiling for 5 minutes). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> NS1 capture-ELISA comparing stability of 100 ng of NS1+, NS1-WT, or NS1-N207Q over time. One hundred ng of the indicated NS1 was diluted in EGM-2 tissue culture medium, mixed with 0.1% SDS or 200 ug/ml Proteinase K when indicated, and placed in a tissue culture incubator (37Â°C with 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>) for the indicated times. The NS1-specific monoclonal antibody (7E11) was used to capture NS1 in the medium and another NS1-specific monoclonal antibody (2B7) was used to detect the captured NS1 proteins. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Western blot analysis of the indicated samples from panel B from an SDS-PAGE gel. NS1 was detected with a mouse anti-6xHis-tag monoclonal antibody. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Same experimental setup and Western blot analysis as Panel C but measuring the later time points indicated.
