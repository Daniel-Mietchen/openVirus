 <p>Vascular leak is a hallmark of severe dengue disease. Recently, our group revealed a critical role for NS1 in induction of endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leakage in an endothelial cell-intrinsic manner. However, the upstream pathway triggered by NS1, as well as the molecular determinants of NS1 required for this phenomenon, remain obscure. Gaining insight into this endothelial cell-intrinsic pathway is critical for understanding dengue pathogenesis, developing novel antiviral therapies, and developing NS1-based vaccine approaches that pose a minimal risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. Our current study expands our knowledge of this novel pathway not only by identifying the requirement of internalization of secreted NS1 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but also by pinpointing the NS1 molecular determinant (N207) required to trigger vascular leak. Further, our work identifies N207 as a residue conserved among multiple flaviviruses (Zika virus and West Nile virus, in addition to DENV), which is critical for NS1-mediated vascular leak in biologically relevant human endothelial cells modeling interstitial compartments in the lung or the blood-brain barrier. Thus, our study identifies endocytosis and a single amino acid (N207) of the NS1 viral toxin as critical for pan-flavivirus pathogenesis, representing a novel target for anti-flaviviral therapy and vaccine development.</p>
