 <p>Although dogs are known to be the primary reservoir and vector of human rabies in African and Asian countries, the spatial epidemiology of rabies virus (RABV) spread in developing regions is still unclear. Using 17 years of genomic and epidemiological data, we reconstruct the recent dispersal history of RABV in domestic dogs in Yunnan, a rural province of China, and estimate RABV transmission rate between dogs and from dogs to humans. Using a phylogeographic approach, we also evaluated the potential impact of several environmental factors on the mode and tempo of virus lineage dispersal. Our findings have implications for rabies prevention and control in Asian countries.</p>
