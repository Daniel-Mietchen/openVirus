  <title>The current wave of human rabies in Yunnan Province from 1999 to 2015.</title>
  <p>(A) RABV transmission from dogs to humans. The black points represent observed human rabies cases. The blue line represents the deterministic prediction from the SEI model and the corresponding dotted light blue lines indicate the 95% credible interval endpoints of the model fit. Green lines show the simulation of intervention aimed at dogs with vaccination coverage of 10%, 15%, and 70% of dog population. (B) RABV transmission among dogs. The solid orange line is the posterior mean effective population size from the skygrid analysis inferred from the sequence data, and the surrounding dashed orange lines bound the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) region of that estimate. The solid black line is number of rabid dogs per square kilometre, and the dashed line is the 95% credible intervals. The vertical black line represents the earliest time point of sequence in study area.</p>
