  <title>Maximum clade credibility trees of South-East Asian (SEA) RABV based on N and G gene sequences.</title>
  <p>Branches are coloured according to their most probable geographic location: Yunnan Province in China (magenta); Hebei, Beijing, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, Hubei and Chongqing in North China (green); Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, Guangxi, Shanghai and Zhejiang in South China (blue); China Taiwan and the Philippines (Island area-1, in red); Indonesia (Island-2, in yellow); Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia in Southeast Asia (purple). The dominant lineages in Yunnan are labelled with YN-A1 and YN-A2, along with the posterior probabilities for their ancestral nodes. The grey arrows mark single Yunnan lineages while the black arrows point to Yunnan clusters.</p>
