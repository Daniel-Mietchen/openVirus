  <title>Impact of several environmental factors on RABV dispersal velocity.</title>
  <p>The results are based on 100 trees sampled in each posterior distribution. “C” and “R” indicate if the considered environmental raster was considered as a conductance ("C") or resistance factor ("R"), and 
   <italic>k</italic> is the rescaling parameter used to transform the initial raster (see the Appendix S2 in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s001">S1 Text</xref> for further details). For regression coefficients and 
   <italic>Q</italic> values we report both the median estimate and the 95% HPD interval. The Bayes factor (BF) supports based on the randomisation procedure is only reported when 
   <italic>p</italic>(
   <italic>Q</italic> &gt; 0) is at least 90%. Following Kass &amp; Raftery (1995) we consider a Bayes factor (BF) &gt;3 as positive support for a significant correlation between the environmental distances and dispersal durations.
