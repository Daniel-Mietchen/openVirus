<p>Statistics of spatial dispersal estimated from continuous phylogeographic analyses are reported in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Estimation of diffusion coefficients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] allows different outbreaks to be directly and quantitatively compared [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, we found that the diffusion coefficient of RABV in Yunnan (
 <italic>D</italic> = 1733 km
 <sup>2</sup>/year; 95% HPD = 1082–2928) is on average substantially lower than that previously estimated for RABV among North African dogs (
 <italic>D</italic> = 2874 km
 <sup>2</sup>/year; 95% HPD = 1900–5420) [
