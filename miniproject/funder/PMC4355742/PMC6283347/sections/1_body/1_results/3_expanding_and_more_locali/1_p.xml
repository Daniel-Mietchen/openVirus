<p>We next performed separate continuous phylogeographic reconstructions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for the YN-A1 and YN-A2 clades that were identified above in the discrete phylogeographic analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007392.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the inferred RABV diffusion histories estimated from the N and G gene alignments are consistent with each other. The YN-A1 clade underwent a larger spatial expansion and is more widely distributed within dog populations, while the YN-A2 clade appears to be geographically more limited. We compared the amino acid and nucleotide sites that vary between the YN-A1 and YN-A2 clades. There were no amino acid sites changes between these clades, suggesting that the differences in lineage distributions are not associated with pathobiological features, but rather over-representation of local area induced by stochastic founder events or by potential sampling bias (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007392.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).
