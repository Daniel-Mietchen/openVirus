<p>We used mathematical transmission models and data from human and dog surveillance of RABV outbreaks in Yunnan Province to quantify rabies spread in a rural area of China. Dog demography and human rabies data were collected by the Yunnan Institute of Endemic Disease Control and Prevention. Our model-based simulation of dog-to-human RABV transmission captures the rapid increase in human rabies at the end of the year 2000, reaching a peak around 2010, before rapidly declining from 2011 onwards (

 </sub>) is 0.0004/year, [95% CI: 0.0002–0.0006/year]. The average basic reproductive number (

 </sub>) of the most recent wave of infection is estimated at 1.05 during the early stages of the outbreak. High values for the transmission parameters and initial conditions are positively correlated with a high peak of human rabies infections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s009">S4 Table</xref>), and the simulations are sensitive to these parameters. Our precise field measures are crucial for reliable model simulations, in particular the dog-to-human transmission rate and dog population size.
