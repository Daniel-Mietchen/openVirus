<p>We then used a GLM (generalised linear model) implementation, also available in BEAST 1.8, to measure the correlation between viral effective population size and RABV cases counts in Yunnan. This analysis estimated a GLM coefficient of 0.021 for the association between case counts and the trajectory of log effective population size of clade YN-A1 (which is the main RABV clade identified in Yunnan). The credible interval associated with this GLM coefficient estimate excludes zero (95% HPD: [0.005, 0.036]), and therefore indicates a significant association. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) estimates of the YN-A2 clade in the N and G gene largely overlap (N gene: 2007.8, 95% HPD: 2006.1–2009.2; G gene: 2008.3, 95% HPD: 2007.0–2009.4). The G gene estimate of the tMRCA of the YN-A1 lineage predates the N gene estimate (N gene: 1999.2, 95% HPD: 1996.6–2008.2; G gene: 1994.7, 95% HPD: 1992.5–1996.6).</p>
