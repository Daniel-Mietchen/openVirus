<p>Dogs are the primary reservoir and vector of human rabies throughout most of Africa and Asia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and are responsible for more than 99% of human rabies cases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the dispersal dynamics of rabies in dogs is essential for quantifying dog-to-human transmissions and for disease prevention. Previous studies have documented “traveling waves” of rabies among wildlife populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and uncovered the genetic signature of spatial expansion in RABV genomes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Recent studies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have attempted to combine epidemiological and genomic data to study the transmission dynamics of RABV. However, rabies spread in rural areas of China, like Yunnan Province, remains poorly documented despite an increasing incidence of human rabies. Yunnan Province in Southwest China first reported human rabies in 1956 and eliminated the disease by integrated dog management and control measures (including dog registration and the use of dog enclosures, dog vaccination, and culling of rabid/suspected rabid dogs and stray dogs) in the late 1990s. However, a re-emergence of rabies in this province was reported in 1999.
