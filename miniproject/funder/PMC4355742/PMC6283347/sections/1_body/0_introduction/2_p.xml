<p>China is second only to India [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in terms of the national number of human rabies cases, and in recent years the prevalence of rabies has increased in some areas of China [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More than 90% of human rabies cases in China occur in rural regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] where the proportion of vaccinated dogs is very low [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, China has a growing population of dogs, currently estimated at 80â€“200 million animals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the breeding, management, and vaccination of dogs in the country is uncontrolled [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A better quantitative understanding of rabies epidemiology in dogs is needed to help predict future vaccine demand in China and other developing countries.
