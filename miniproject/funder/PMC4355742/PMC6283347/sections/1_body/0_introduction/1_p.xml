<p>Rabies remains a significant threat to public health in the 21st century [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], causing around 60,000 human fatalities worldwide each year [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Rabies control in the developing world is currently hindered by a lack of timely and accurate data about rabies cases in both humans and animals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is thought that the number of human deaths due to rabies virus (RABV) infections is underestimated, and that the dynamics of the virus in dog populations is poorly understood. These uncertainties inevitably hamper improvements in disease control strategies and the evaluation of control measures.
