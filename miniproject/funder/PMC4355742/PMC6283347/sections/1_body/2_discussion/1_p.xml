<p>Human rabies is one of the biggest public health risks facing China. While current rabies surveillance mostly reflects the RABV prevalence in humans, very little is known about its prevalence in dogs. In most of mainland China, diagnosis of dog rabies is currently effectively impossible in rural areas [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], because dogs are not leashed, can move freely and have a low vaccination coverage [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Because of this, rural dog populations are at increased risk of exposure and are crucial to rabies prevention and control efforts as they are the main reservoir for zoonoses [
