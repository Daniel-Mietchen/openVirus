<p>The potential importance of forest coverage was further indicated by comparing environmental conditions at branch termination locations. This analysis mainly revealed that viral lineages did not tend to spread towards forest areas. However, this result could also reflect, to some extent, the impact of a potential sampling bias arising if there were a lower sampling probability in less densely human-populated regions, such as forest areas. Furthermore, even under the assumption that viral lineages would be less likely to spread towards forest areas, our analysis based on dispersal velocity revealed that these areas do not act as barriers decreasing lineages dispersal velocity among infected areas.</p>
