<p>Our dynamic model provides estimates of epidemiological parameters for dog rabies in Yunnan. The simulated dog population indicated a low level of RABV transmission, different from the oscillations observed in N’Djamena, Africa [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We also obtained an estimate of the transmission rate among dogs (

 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub>), and from dogs to humans (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>dh</italic>
 </sub>); key epidemiological parameters for assessment of rabies outbreaks and incidence among dogs. The estimate (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub>) of 6.62/year was higher than the 4.20/year estimated in N’Djamena, Chad [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and lower than 14.68/year estimated in Machakos District, Kenya [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The transmission rate from dogs to humans (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>dh</italic>
 </sub>) was estimated to be 0.0004/year, which is consistent with our field investigation of dog bites (0.0004/year) in the study area [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but much lower than the 0.0107/year estimated in N’Djamena [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, the estimated carrying capacity (13.59 dogs/km
 <sup>2</sup>, 95% CI: 7.80–19.37 dogs/km
 <sup>2</sup>) was also lower than 33.6 dogs/km
 <sup>2</sup> estimated in N’Djamena, Chad, but was similar to the value estimated in Tamil Nadu, India (12.69 dogs/km
 <sup>2</sup>, estimated using livestock census data) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We suspect these may result from socio-economic differences, e.g. human population density [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
