<p>Continuous phylogeographic analyses yield a lower diffusion coefficient than that previously estimated for dog RABV in northern Africa [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Previous analysis of the northern Africa data set also revealed the importance of human-related environmental factors (human population density, accessibility to nearest major cities) as explanatory factors for the heterogeneity in RABV lineage dispersal velocity in Africa [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The higher diffusion coefficient of the northern African RABV data set was thus suspected to be related to human-based connectivity and/or mobility. Consequently, the lower diffusion coefficient estimated for the Yunnan data set could, in turn, indicate that human-related movements are less important contributors to the spatial dissemination of RABV in Yunnan, although we note that this is only one possible interpretation. Here, we also investigated the potential impact of several environmental factors and found a significant but weak effect of forest coverage acting (directly or indirectly) as a factor favouring RABV lineage dispersal velocity in Yunnan. One potential interpretation of this result is that in sparsely populated forest areas a few rapid (and potentially human-related) movements of infected dogs may have occurred. Such lineage dispersal movements could have happened via the road network crossing forest areas. However, even if identified as a significant conductance factor, the forest coverage in itself is not necessarily the causal factor and could instead be correlated with the true causal factor that is not included in the present analysis.
