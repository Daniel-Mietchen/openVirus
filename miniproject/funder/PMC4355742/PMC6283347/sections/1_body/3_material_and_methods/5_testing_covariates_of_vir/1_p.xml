<p>We used the GLM (generalised linear model) extension of the skygrid coalescent model [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], implemented in BEAST 1.8, to simultaneously infer viral effective population sizes and measure the association between estimated effective population size and cases counts. For this analysis, we focused only on sequences associated with the largest Yunnan clade identified by the discrete phylogeographic analysis (clade YN-A1, see the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Results</xref> section). Furthermore, we considered the N and G genes as two independent markers (see Appendix S1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s001">S1 Text</xref> for the detailed procedure).
