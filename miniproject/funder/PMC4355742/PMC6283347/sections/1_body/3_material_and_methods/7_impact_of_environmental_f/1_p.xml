<p>We next sought to investigate the impact of environmental factors on lineage dispersal velocity. These analyses followed a similar structure to those used in previous studies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. All scripts for these analyses are available in the R package “seraphim” [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we investigated the impact of the following environmental variables (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s002">S1 Fig</xref>): elevation, annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, key land cover variables (e.g. “grasslands”, “savannas”, “forests”, “croplands”, “urban areas”; land cover categorised according to the International Geosphere Biosphere Program, IGBP), human population density, human footprint, major roads, and inaccessibility (quantified as the time it takes to travel to the nearest major city of &gt;50,000 inhabitants). The sources of the data in the original raster files are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s008">S3 Table</xref>. All factors were tested as potential conductance factors (i.e. factors facilitating movement) and as potential resistance factors (i.e. factors impeding movement). Correlations between phylogenetic branch durations and environmentally-scaled distances were quantified as a statistic 
 <italic>Q</italic>, which represents the difference between two coefficients of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>): (i) the R
 <sup>2</sup> obtained when branch durations are regressed against environmentally-scaled distances, and (ii) the R
 <sup>2</sup> obtained when branch durations are regressed against distances computed on a “null” raster, i.e. a raster with a value of “1” assigned to every cell. An environmental factor was only considered as potentially explanatory if both its distribution of regression coefficients and its associated distribution of 
 <italic>Q</italic> values were positive [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In a positive distribution of estimated 
 <italic>Q</italic> values (i.e. with at least 90% of positive values), statistical support was then evaluated against a null distribution generated by a randomisation procedure and formalised using a Bayes factor (BF) value [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (see Appendix S2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s001">S1 Text</xref> for the full procedure). Due to computational limits, this analysis was based on 100 trees subsampled from each post-burn-in posterior distribution obtained by continuous phylogeographic inference.
