<p>Addition to the analyses based on lineage dispersal 
 <italic>velocity</italic>, we also used a new analytical procedure to investigate the impact of several environmental factors on dispersal 
 <italic>tendency</italic>. In order words, this procedure aims at testing if virus lineages tend to disperse towards particular environmental conditions. In this framework, environmental conditions are compared between the locations of the two nodes connected by a phylogeny branch. For each branch and environmental factor, we computed the difference in raster cell values between the start (oldest node) location and at the end (youngest node) location. These differences were then averaged within each sampled tree and evaluated against a null distribution generated by the same randomisation procedure used for the analyses of the impact on dispersal velocity (see Appendix S3 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s001">S1 Text</xref> for the detailed procedure).
