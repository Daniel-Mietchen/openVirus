<p>All brain specimens were tested using direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA) and RABV nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody (Rabies DFA Reagent; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). Total RNA was extracted from the original brain samples with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. PCR products were purified by using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Complete nucleoprotein gene (N gene; 1 cow, 84 dog and 6 human isolates) and glycoprotein gene (G gene; 2 cow, 110 dog and 8 human isolates) sequences were obtained by using previously described primers [

Newly generated RABV sequence data were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers KP072009–KP072030, KP202418- KP202448, KT932670-KT932698 and KX096992-KX097000 for N gene, and JF819597-JF819602, JQ040570-JQ040581, JX276383-JX276404, KP072031-KP072052, KP202402-KP202417, KT861554-KT861586 and KX096983–KX096991 for G gene). An overview of the newly sequenced isolates is provided in
