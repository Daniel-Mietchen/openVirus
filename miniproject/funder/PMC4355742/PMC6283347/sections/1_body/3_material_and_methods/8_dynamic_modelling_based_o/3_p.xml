<p>Sensitivity analysis was performed using latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) techniques [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Two criteria were retained as outputs for the analysis: the intensity of the peak of the human rabies infections and the date of the peak. Uniform distributions were used for all parameters and the same ranges as for the prior distributions were used. A total of 1,000 parameter sets were sampled with LHS and PRCC was estimated using the MATLAB code provided by Marino et al. [
