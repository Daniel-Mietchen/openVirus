  <p>Propagation is composed of three distinct sub-processes; 
   <underline>Radiation</underline> refers to the process with which an actor translates a change in state into an outgoing signal, 
   <underline>Transmission</underline> to the process by which this signal is transferred (via a tie) towards the alter(s), and 
   <underline>Reception</underline> to the process by which alters respond to the incoming signal and may change state accordingly.
