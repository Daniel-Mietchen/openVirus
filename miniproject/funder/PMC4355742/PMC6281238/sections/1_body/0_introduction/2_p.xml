<p>Adopting a network lens has contributed to highlighting the role of the network structure in driving the dynamics of propagating processes. For example, this body of work has better informed us on the relevance of characteristic path length [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], clustering [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and network topologies [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In particular it has been found that most social systems contain degree distributions with long tails or scale-free structures [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and that nodes with high degree facilitate spread [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our social systems, combining these two features, are prone to be affected by large propagating events, or cascades (of failure) [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, due to increasing globalization and growing interconnectedness of our society, such cascades are likely to become more profound and frequent in the future. The 2014 Ebola outbreak, the 2010 Arab Spring, or the 2008 financial crisis, are but a handful of recent high profile examples that reveal the potential impact such propagating cascades can have, and these events signal the high societal and scientific need for understanding how cascading dynamics come about.
