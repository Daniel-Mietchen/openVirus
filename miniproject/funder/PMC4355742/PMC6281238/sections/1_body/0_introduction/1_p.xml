<p>Propagating processes underlie many phenomena we observe in our daily lives; we are constantly influenced socially, form opinions based on those with whom we interact, process information from various sources to shape our view of our world, and are fighting off viral threats in our environment. Academia has long recognized the value of using a network lens to study such phenomena. Consequently, network analysis has been a cornerstone in domains such as epidemiology [
