<p>In studies on propagation phenomena, the mechanism has generally been implemented as a single rate or probability which summarizes the success rate of the propagation process. Yet many theories, e.g. social exchange theory [

 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and biological systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have suggested that the mechanism of propagation in reality can be much more complicated. For example, recent marketing studies have incorporated individual level characteristics that describe how likely someone is to spread or how susceptible one is to marketing, highlighting how the mechanism can be different depending on the pair of agents that is considered, making it locally bound. Note that propagation literature has painted a relatively clear picture on the impact of network structure, and based on this has developed various targeting strategies, yet it remains largely unclear how (variations in) the propagation mechanism would affect propagation dynamics and thus our knowledge of how cascades occur and can be influenced.
