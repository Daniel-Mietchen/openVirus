<p>To address this gap, in this paper we propose a new framework for propagation which incorporates a more nuanced notion of the propagation mechanism. Based on a framework from communication theory [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] we consider the propagation mechanism to be composed of three different sub-processes; 
 <bold>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </bold>adiation, the process by which an agent sends out a signal, 
 <bold>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </bold>ransmission, the process by which that signal reaches the alter, and 
 <bold>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </bold>eception, the process by which the signal is processed by the alter. We will show that decomposing the mechanism in this way not only provides a more realistic way of capturing the propagation process and aligns with existing intervention strategies, but also that it provides new insight into 
 <italic>how</italic> to more effectively intervene in propagation phenomena once they occur.
