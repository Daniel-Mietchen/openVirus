<p>We modify the communication-theoretical framework in two ways. First, given our goal of describing propagation phenomena that go far beyond the communication setting, we step away from communication-specific terminology, and use the labels Radiation, Transmission and Reception (RTR) for describing the sub-processes during propagation. 
 <italic>Radiation</italic> refers to the process by which a change in the state or behavior of an actor results in that actor sending out signals to its outgoing ties. 
 <italic>Transmission</italic> refers to the process by which a signal is transferred from the sender to the receiver (via a tie). 
 <italic>Reception</italic> refers to the process by which actors respond to the incoming signal(s) and change their behavior or state accordingly. Like in communication theory, these processes are sequential, meaning that radiation is required for transmission and transmission is required for reception. Only when all three sub-processes have taken place successfully one can speak of propagation.
