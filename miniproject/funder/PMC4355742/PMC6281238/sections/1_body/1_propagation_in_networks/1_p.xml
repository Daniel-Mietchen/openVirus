<p>The definition of propagation describes it as dyadic process of influence between two agents (
 <italic>‘a process by which the behavior or state of an agent (A) will result in a change of behavior or state of connected neighbor (B)’</italic>). It highlights the initial shock at one agent that puts in motion the consequent effect at another agent, making propagation effectively a process that should be considered on the agent level. Note that the definition of propagation stays void of any reference to a propagation mechanism. Therefore we leverage a perspective from communication theory to infer the propagation mechanism. Communication itself is an instance of propagation that describes the exchange of information between agents. However, whereas for propagation processes the mechanism is obscured, for the communication process the mechanisms has been made explicit and often been the focus of study. For decades communication theory [
