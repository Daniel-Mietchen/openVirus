<p>In describing the information exchange process, communication literature identifies a mechanism of exchange using three entities, each with their own role; 1) a sender that encodes information, 2) a medium that transports this information (from sender to receiver), and 3) the receiver that decodes the information. It highlights the agency of each of these entities, and the potential of loss of information during each of their actions. As such, the communication perspective considers the propagation mechanism as an agent-driven process consisting of three consecutive steps. Applying this lens to other propagation phenomena allows one to identify these steps across the complete spectrum of propagation phenomena (e.g. [
