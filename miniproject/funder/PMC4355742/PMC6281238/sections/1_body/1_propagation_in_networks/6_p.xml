<p>Revisiting the literature on propagation with the RTR framework in mind provides some interesting insights (
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). First, to our knowledge, there are no studies that cover all three sub-processes simultaneously. Second, each of the sub-processes is grounded in literature, examples of each of them individually can be found in previous work. Third, as an integrated framework for sub-processes has been missing, the labeling in current literature has proven to be inconsistent. A single term has been used to refer to different parts of the mechanism in different articles, and different terms are used across articles for parts of the mechanisms that are in fact identical. Fourth, propagation is often considered a one-sided process (rather than a dyadic one). It is mostly described as a process by which agents change state/behavior, and thus resembles the reception sub-process. Lastly, lessons learned and conclusions drawn in propagation literature are generally assumed to translate across settings, disregarding the potential impact of the propagation mechanism adopted, as such sub-processes have effectively been considered to be inter-changeable.
