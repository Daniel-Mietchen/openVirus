<p>The RTR-model for propagation, in line with the RTR-framework, specifies the propagation mechanism using three sub-processes, each using the own function. Each of them can be tailored depending on the needs of a specific setting and phenomena. For simple scenarios these functions can be reduced into three single parameters (one for each sub-process) that capture the success of the specific sub-process; 
 <italic>Radiation</italic> (
 <italic>α</italic>), 
 <italic>Transmission</italic> (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>), and 
 <italic>Reception</italic> (
 <italic>η</italic>), making the composite transmission likelihood (λ) equal to 
 <italic>α</italic> × 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> × 
 <italic>η</italic>. For more complex scenarios these function can be extended to include memory effects [
