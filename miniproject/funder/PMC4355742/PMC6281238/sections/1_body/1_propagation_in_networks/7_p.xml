<p>Our exploration of the literature indicates that the propagation mechanism, the process that describes how propagation between two (or more) agents occurs, has received relatively little attention in propagation literature. In most studies, the mechanism of propagation adopted is a direct consequence of the model type being used. Most commonly adopted types of models are (variation or extensions of) of SIS/SIR model [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], threshold models [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], cascade models [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], or Bass(-like) models [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Each of these models has a slightly different mechanism of propagation, yet all of them are unified in their assumption that propagation is a monolithic process.
