<p>Leveraging the experimental setup we will take the following steps during our analysis. First, to support the validity of decomposing the propagation mechanism, we will compare the behaviors of various decompositions in the RTR model without interventions. Second, to show how RTR behaves differently compared to traditional models, we will introduce interventions into the model. Third, to highlight the extent to which misspecification of the mechanism can have an impact on propagation dynamics under interventions, we will simulate interventions in a set of extreme scenarios. And lastly, to show the impact of the decomposition has on intervention strategies, we compare the effects of interventions of different sizes and at different targets.</p>
