<p>Note that, due to the size of the experimental design, only a subset of results will be presented in the main text. We will use the synthetic network with random seeding and the scenario of an intervention in the Radiation process to illustrate our results throughout the main text. The remainder of the results, e.g. those for interventions in Transmission and Reception, and robustness checks with different seeding strategies, and the Facebook and AS-733 network structures, are included as part of the supplementary information (
