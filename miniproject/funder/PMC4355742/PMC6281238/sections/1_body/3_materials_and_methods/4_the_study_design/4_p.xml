<p>The experimental setup is as follows: four scenarios with the same exact composite propagation rate/probability (λ = 
 <italic>α</italic> × 
 <italic>η</italic> × 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) are selected. One among them will be a scenario in which sub-processes are indistinguishable, meaning that each sub-process has the exact same parameter value. This operationalization can be reduced to a single parameter mechanism which captures the traditional SIS behavior, and will be considered the baseline to which behavior is compared. The other three scenarios use different decompositions in sub-processes, while still maintaining the exact same composite propagation rate (λ) as the baseline process with identical sub-processes. The decomposition of the four scenarios in our experiment can be found in
