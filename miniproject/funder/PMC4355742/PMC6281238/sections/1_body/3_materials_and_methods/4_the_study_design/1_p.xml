<p>The generic RTR model allows for capturing the full range of propagation mechanisms and thus provides much more flexibility compared to traditional propagation models. Note that such flexibility comes at the cost of a more complex model, a tradeoff that is generally hard to balance. Rather than making a statistical argument for more (or less) complex models of propagation, our approach is to show the value of decomposing the propagation process (in RTR) from an intervention perspective as this highlights the different affordances of the RTR model. We do so for a relatively simple well-studied mechanism, the mechanism that is traditionally used in SIS models in epidemiology.</p>
