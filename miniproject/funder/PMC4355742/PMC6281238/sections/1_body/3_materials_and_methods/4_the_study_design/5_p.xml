<p>The RTR model describes the propagation mechanism on the agent level and is therefore implemented as an Agent-Based Model (ABM). It has been shown [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that, due to the discrete nature of Agent-based models (ABMs), these models yield slightly different behavior compared differential equation models (DEMs) traditionally used to describe SIS spreading dynamics. In particular, small infection sizes can be affected by the discrete nature of an ABM, yielding extinction events in ABMs that will not occur in DEMs. To avoid the effect of premature extinction events the recovery rate in our simulations is set such that

 <sub>0</sub> is well above 1 (
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.2 → 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 2.88), which makes extinction highly unlikely. Consequently our scenarios are expected to yield widespread cascades of infections. Additionally, should any early extinction event occur, their results are excluded from the analysis.
