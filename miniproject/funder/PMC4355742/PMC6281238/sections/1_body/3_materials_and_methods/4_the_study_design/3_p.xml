<p>Note that the only difference between traditional SIS model and this version of the RTR model is the that traditional model assumes the sub-processes to be inter-changeable (and thus the same), whereas the RTR model allows them to be independent. A comparative simulation experiment with the above-stated SIS version of the RTR model is done to explore the implications of this assumption under various interventions.</p>
