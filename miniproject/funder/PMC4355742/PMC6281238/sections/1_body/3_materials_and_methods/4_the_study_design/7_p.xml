<p>We control for the impact of network structure by keeping it constant across simulations. While this does not erase the impact of network structure, it does keep its effects constant across simulations, and thus allows variations in dynamics to be attributed to variations in the mechanism of propagation. Additionally, to make sure our results are generalizable, we run our experiments on three network structures.</p>
