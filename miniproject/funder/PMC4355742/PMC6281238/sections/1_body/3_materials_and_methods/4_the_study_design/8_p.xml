<p>The first network, which will be used throughout this paper as the setting in which to present results, is an undirected, non-weighted, scale-free network synthetically generated based on the Barabasi-Albert approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has has 10.000 nodes (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10.000) and an average degree of 3 (
 <italic>m</italic> = 3). The second network used is a Facebook Ego-network [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. It covers a giant component of friendship ties, based on the social circles on Facebook platform, with 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4.039 and 
 <italic>e</italic> = 88.234, and is thus denser than the original synthetic network. The Third network is the Autonomous systems AS-733 network [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It describes the communication among a set of autonomous systems, and is based on BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) logs. This network consists of 6.474 nodes and 12.572 edges and is thus sparser then our synthetic network.
