<p>Following the mapping of interventions onto sub-processes in the RTR-model, the experimental setup implements interventions as perturbations in a single sub-process. It is assumed agents are homogenous, hence these perturbations will affect all agents equally and at the same time. The SIS mechanism adopted in our model is generally associated with disease spread, therefore we align our intervention logic to this setting. In a disease spreading setting, an intervention could be to provide antibiotics (this would reduce their viral load and thus make the population less infectious). Assuming this would reduce infectiousness by 20%, such an intervention would result in a reduction of radiation by 20% (
