<p>We control for the impact of the seeding strategy by considering two seeding strategies. We will use random seeding as the default strategy, in this strategy a single seed is randomly selected for each simulation. To control for the impact of seeding we also adopt a second strategy which we label the betweenness strategy, in this strategy seeding is ‘optimized’ by selecting the actor with the highest betweenness centrality as the seed in each simulation. To further increase the reliability of our results, each setting will be bootstrapped 10000 times, and the mean behavior across this set of bootstrapped iterations is then used in our analysis.</p>
