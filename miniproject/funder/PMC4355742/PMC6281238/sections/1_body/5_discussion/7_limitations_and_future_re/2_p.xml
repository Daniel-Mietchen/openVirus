<p>Furthermore, the applied model makes some simplifying assumptions which need to be further explored. For example it is currently assumed that all actors are homogeneous, and thus behave the same. While such assumptions reduce the noise in the results, it is known that in most real world systems actors in fact do differ in terms of their contagiousness, transmission medium, and susceptibility, making the inclusion of heterogeneity crucial extension to our model. Similarly, the effects of network structure and network seeding as a key drivers of propagation dynamics remains somewhat under explored. Exploring how the network structure and the mechanism of propagation interact and have a combined effect on the propagation dynamics, and exploring the interactions between seeding strategies and the mechanism will be fruitful avenues of future research.</p>
