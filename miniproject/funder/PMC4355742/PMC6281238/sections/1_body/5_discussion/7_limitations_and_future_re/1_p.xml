<p>The simulation methodology adopted in this paper has its limitations, while we designed our mechanism of propagation to fit our goals of showing the potential impact of decomposing the propagation process, applying our model to specific context will require substantial effort. As understanding the details of the propagation mechanism is likely hard, and our model is more detailed in describing such mechanism, the need expert domain knowledge, or data, is substantially increased, which puts additional constraints on the requirements for effective modeling efforts.</p>
