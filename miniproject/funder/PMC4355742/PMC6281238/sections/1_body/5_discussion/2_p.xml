 <xref rid="pone.0207865.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) show that the effectiveness of interventions, which conceptually map onto changes in sub-processes, depend greatly on how the underlying propagation process is decomposed; even with composite rate of propagation (Î») constant, one single intervention can have effects that differ two orders of magnitude depending on the values for Radiation, Transmission and Reception (see

 <xref rid="pone.0207865.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and that intervention effectiveness can differ roughly by a factor eight from the traditional single parameter models in extreme settings. The findings indicate that without decomposition of the mechanism of propagation, substantial over- or underestimation of intervention effectiveness can occur.
