<p>In the setting where more complex information needs to be exchanged, such as knowledge transfer about best practices between business units in a multinational organization, the RTR model can help to decide on the right intervention(s). For instance, [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] showed the difficulty of knowledge transfer to depend, among other things, on the relationship between the knowledge source and knowledge recipient (hinting at the relevance of the Transmission sub-process) and the absorptive capacity of the knowledge recipient (hinting at the Reception sub-process). Moreover, [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] investigated the effectiveness of a number of knowledge transfer methods (i.e. radiation mechanisms) and found that some methods such as best practice manuals, newsletters and company video films are mostly effective in the initial phases of knowledge transfer. Conversely, other methods such as personnel rotation and physical visits from the knowledge source to the knowledge recipient (emphasizing Transmission and Reception) were mostly effective during the later phases of knowledge transfer. The RTR model provides a framework for studying such complex knowledge transfer methods by linking the methods to specific sub-processes, which in turn allows such lessons to be adopted in other domains.
