<p>Various settings can be mentioned that could leverage this approach. For example in the context of HIV prevention, understanding the mechanism responsible for HIV transmission allows one to better target interventions strategies. In this specific setting various interventions strategies are available; Anti-retro-viral drug treatment (ART) allow for viral suppression and thus can lower radiation, Transmission can be reduced by safer sex and thus can be affected by making sure condoms are being used, and recently developed Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) allows for greatly reducing susceptibility to HIV and thus affects reception. While each of these interventions is effective from a clinical standpoint and can reduce HIV incidence, understanding the how to implement such intervention effectively requires a detailed understanding of the propagation mechanism.</p>
