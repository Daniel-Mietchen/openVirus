<p>For many propagation phenomena, understanding what drives dynamics is only a first step. Generally, one wants to affect and steer the outcomes of the propagation process using oneâ€™s knowledge of the process. For example, we want to understand disease spread so we can prevent it, we want to understand opinion dynamics so we can influence them, and we want to understand word-of-mouth so we can market our products better. There are various streams of literature aimed at understanding propagation dynamics. Some have focused on identifying the controllability of network structures [

 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Each of these streams has focused on a different dimension of understanding propagation dynamics, yet all strive towards the goal of increasing our knowledge of propagation dynamics in the hopes of improving our ability to intervene and more effectively steer such dynamics. As such, understanding dynamics goes hand in hand with intervening in them.
