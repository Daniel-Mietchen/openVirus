<p>The monolithic mechanism that is adopted traditionally in propagation literature and models allows for only a single type of interventionâ€”a change of the rate (or success) of propagation. While relevant lessons have been learned from studying such interventions, e.g. that the epidemic threshold varies based on network topology [

 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], it leaves little room for exploring how to best intervene, and thus provides little insight in how to best devise intervention strategies. Comparing various types of interventions and devising intervention strategies requires a framework in which effects of different types of interventions can be disentangled and distinguished. The RTR framework of propagation, by decomposing the mechanism into three sub-processes, does exactly this.
