<p>From a practical perspective, the three sub-processes identified in the RTR-model of propagation align naturally with interventions. An overview of interventions made in practice to improve/reduce spreading in various contexts (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207865.s002">S2 File</xref>) shows that such interventions can be easily translated into changes within specific single sub-process. Interventions thus seem to map directly to changes in the mechanism. Combining this with the notion that propagation dynamics are driven by the propagation mechanism (in combination with the network structure), this makes effective intervening a question of understanding how interventions change the mechanism, and how this consequently translates into changed propagation dynamics. This question can only be addressed when a model of propagation is adopted that incorporates a more detailed view of the mechanism of propagation.
