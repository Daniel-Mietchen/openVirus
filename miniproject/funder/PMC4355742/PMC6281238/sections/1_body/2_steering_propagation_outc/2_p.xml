<p>Valente [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] provides an overview of network interventions, and classifies four distinct categories of interventions in networks: Individuals, Segmentation, Induction, and Alteration. Interventions focused on individuals revolve around identifying key individuals as targets for intervention, these can either be individuals who are very efficient in getting a message out, or low-threshold change agents, those who will easily change their behavior/state, or those in favorable network positions. Segmentation interventions aim to leverage the partitioning of a system in clusters in order to facilitate maximum reach, and thus selects key individuals based on system-level structure. Induction interventions highlight the relevance of the multiplex nature of networks and aim to leverage existing structure beyond their normal use, ie. use word-of-mouth (WOM) in social networks to facilitate product adoption. Alteration interventions aim to change network structure, by adding or removing links or agents, in such a way that spreading will become more (or less) likely. Based on this classification, three factors that affect the impact of interventions can be identified; 1) agent level characteristics that affect the mechanism by which propagation occurs, 2) the network structure, and 3) the location within the network that is being affected. These three factors seem to address 
 <italic>where</italic> to target interventions, yet leave the question 
 <italic>how</italic> to (most effectively) intervene largely unanswered. Valente recognized this and states 
 <italic>“because network interventions are based on accelerating social influence, they require a deeper understanding of the social mechanisms driving behavior change”</italic> ([
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], page 52), suggesting that understanding impact of the mechanism of propagation might provide an avenue to address how to best intervene.
