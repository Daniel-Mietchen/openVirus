<p>Interventions in traditional propagation models, which are generally monolithic, do not allow for specific parts of the mechanism to be targeted. Consequently, in such setting the various types of interventions are hard to be distinguished and are generally considered to be inter-changeable. The fact that the sub-processes are conceptually different, and can be associated to specific interventions, suggests that there are conceptual differences in intervention that cannot be captured using traditional models, and are therefore overlooked in current propagation research. For this reasons we argue that models incorporating a more nuanced view of the propagation mechanism—like the RTR model presented in this paper—are required for effectively studying network intervention effectiveness and intervention strategies.</p>
