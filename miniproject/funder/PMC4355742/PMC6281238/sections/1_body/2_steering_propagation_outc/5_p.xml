<p>Similarly, from a conceptual standpoint, we find that the classification of network interventions [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] aligns well with the RTR framework of propagation. Individual type of interventions based on individual characteristics can be directly linked to specific sub-processes; selecting individuals who are able to communicate well is an intervention that aims to leverage the strong capacity for sending out signals, and thus can be considered a radiation-based intervention. Selecting low-threshold agents who easily change their state or behavior would be a reception-based intervention, and both induction and alteration type interventions (which focus on enabling spread by improving the structure that underlies transfer) can be considered transmission-based an intervention. The RTR framework thus provides a structured way to distinguish between these network interventions. It should be noted that segmentation type interventions are an outlier in this aspect. As such interventions consider system-wide network structural properties (rather than anything mechanism related) such effects are nearly impossible to capture using an agent-level description of the propagation mechanism.
