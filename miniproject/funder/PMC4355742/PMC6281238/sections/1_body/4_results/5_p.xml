<p>To further explore the effect of incorrect specification, we extend the radiation intervention setting (in network 1 with random seeding) with two additional scenarios to investigate how large the variation in effectiveness of a given intervention can be when the mis-specification of the propagation process is substantial. We generated two additional scenarios that keep the composite propagation likelihood the same (λ = 0.192), but differ in their resilience to the proposed intervention. Building on the notion of that the net effect on the composite λ drives the intervention effectiveness the first additional scenario (scenario 5) we will maximize the radiation parameter pre-intervention (
 <italic>α</italic> = 1.0, 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> = 1.0 and 
 <italic>η</italic> = 0.192). We assume this to be the most resilient scenario as the intervention has the smallest impact relative to the size of the radiation parameter. In the second additional scenario (scenario 6) the radiation parameter is set equal to the intervention size (
 <italic>α</italic> = 0.2, 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> = 1.0 and 
 <italic>η</italic> = 0.96), this will be the least resilient scenario as the intervention effectively reduces the radiation to 0. The results of simulations with these additional scenarios (
