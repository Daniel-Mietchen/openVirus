<p>Existing propagation literature suggests that, because of their similar composite propagation likelihoods, these scenarios will behave the same. This assumption is supported by results from the unperturbed setting, in which behavior is shown to be independent of decomposition. However, when perturbations are included in the model, this logic breaks down. We find that applying a single intervention (20% reduction in radiation) to the four scenarios results different prevalence curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207865.g003">Fig 3</xref>). While the curves for the baseline and second scenario are very similar and lie nearly on top of one another, the first and thirds scenarios show clearly identifiable differential behavior. 
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, presenting the same results in numeric terms, more clearly shows the effective reduction of prevalence obtained by intervening for each of the scenarios. These findings indicate that scenarios do behave differently when perturbed, and that for intervention purposes these scenarios are fundamentally different. As scenarios differ only in decomposition, it becomes evident that the decomposition is the driver of these differences and what determines the effectiveness of interventions in propagation.
