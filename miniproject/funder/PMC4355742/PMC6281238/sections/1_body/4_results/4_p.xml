<p>Our intervention results highlight significant variation in intervention effectiveness stemming from variations in the decomposition of the propagation mechanism. This should not come as a surprise when one considers the decomposition of the propagation rate (λ = 
 <italic>α</italic> × 
 <italic>η</italic> × 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>). From the decomposition itself we can deduce that the net effect of an intervention (an absolute change in one of the parameters of the sub-processes) on the composite propagation rate (λ) will be a multiplication of the intervention size and parameters for the remaining sub-processes. While this net effect determines the observed intervention effectiveness in our simulations, it becomes evident that the effective reduction of λ achieved by an intervention is conditional upon the decomposition. Therefore, only when we know the decomposition we can make informed decisions regarding the effects of an intervention strategy.
