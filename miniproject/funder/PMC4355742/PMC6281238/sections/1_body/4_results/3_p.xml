<p>Note that while only a subset of results are presented in the main manuscript, these results to be robust across intervention targets, network structures and seeding strategies. The radiation intervention results are consistent with those from Transmission and Reception (see Figs A and B, in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207865.s004">S4 File</xref>). Similarly, (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207865.s005">S5 File</xref>) shows that that the seeding strategy has no impact on our results, and we find that while different overall prevalence levels across network structures (and thereby different intervention effects in an absolute sense) occurs, the relative impact of the decomposition (the extent that different decomposition scenarios differ from the baseline scenario) remains constant across networks.
