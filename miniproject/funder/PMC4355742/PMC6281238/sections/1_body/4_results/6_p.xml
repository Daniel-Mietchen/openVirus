<p>Thus far, the presented results have assumed intervention size to be fixed, and while this has been useful exercise for showing the relevance of correct specification, it might not be the most realistic representation of interventions in practical settings. In practice a policy maker faces a given propagation phenomenon, and thus a given mechanism of propagation, for which the policy maker wants to intervene most effectively. As an illustration, assume a policy maker is faced with a phenomenon that is accurately described by scenario3 (for similar analysis for the other scenarios see Figs A and B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207865.s006">S6 File</xref>) one wants to know the potential impact of a given intervention, or how much one should intervene to obtain the desired impact. So rather than assuming an intervention of fixed size the assumption is that intervention sizes can vary. To incorporate this in our model we allow intervention sizes to span the full range (0% to 100%, with increments of 1%) for all three targetable sub-processes and explore the impact. Similar to the results presented in the previous tables, for each such intervention we calculate the effect on the prevalence (unperturbed prevalenceâ€”prevalence after intervention), and plot these values. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207865.g005">Fig 5</xref>) indicate three things. First, in line with previous observations, it shows that for an intervention of a given size (i.e. the vertical yellow dashed line corresponds with the previously discussed intervention of size 0.2), the effectiveness of that interventions varies strongly depending on which sub-process is targeted. Second, it shows that for a given mechanism there seems to be a single most effective target for intervention. For this specific scenario, the interventions in the transmission sub-process are particularly impactful. Comparing these results across various mechanisms (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207865.s006">S6 File</xref>), however reveals that the best targeted sub-process varies across scenarios, and that the most effective target for interventions (Radiation, Transmission or Reception) depends on the decomposition of the propagation mechanism. More specifically, we find that the most effective target for intervention is the sub-process that has the smallest parameter value. This is somewhat counter intuitive, as this means that the most noticeable sub-process (the one that has the highest likelihood of being observed) is in fact the least efficient target of intervention. Third, we observe a non-linear effect of intervention size, meaning each additional 1% that can be added to size of the intervention becomes increasingly effective (up until the point where that sub-process is effectively eradicated).
