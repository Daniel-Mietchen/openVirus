<p>The RTR framework, and the accompanying model, present a more detailed way of modeling propagation, as with any new model its behavior needs to be verified prior to being adopted in experiments. We do so by numerical comparing the prevalence numbers (% of the network affected) across the various decomposition scenarios (described in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The four scenarios are shown to achieve both propagation curves and dynamic equilibria levels that are graphically identical (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207865.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A formal test of the resemblance of the equilibrium states reveals that the prevalence for each of these processes are statistically indistinguishable (
 <italic>F</italic> = 1.512 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.219), confirming that the differently decomposed scenarios are behaving identical. Note that our baseline scenario matches the traditional SIS model of propagation directly and behaves the same as all other decompositions, this indicates the SIS model is indeed a special case of the RTR model. This in turn validates the choice of using RTR implemented scenarios to compare to traditional SIS models.
