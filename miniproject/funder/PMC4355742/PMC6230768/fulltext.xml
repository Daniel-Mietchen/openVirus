H1N1 and H3N2 are the presently circulating virus subtypes that cause yearly epidemics in humans. The receptor-binding surface molecule haemagglutinin (HA) forms homotrimers [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule HA<sub>0</sub> and proteolytically processed into the subunits HA<sub>1</sub> and HA<sub>2</sub> that are connected by a disulfide bond. Activation of HA is important for its fusion potential with the endosome including a conformational change to release the viral genome into the cytoplasm (reviewed in [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref>]). Depending on the protease recognition motif, several proteases have been identified to cleave HA (reviewed in [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref>]). The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to cleave H1- and monobasic H7-HA <italic>in vitro</italic> at the cleavage sites PSIQSR&#x02193;G and PEIPKR&#x02193;G, respectively [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4, 9</xref>]. Furthermore, in mouse knock-out (KO) mutants, it was shown that <italic>Tmprss2-</italic>deficient <italic>(Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>)</italic> mice are highly resistant to infections with H1N1 and monobasic H7N9, but only weakly to H3N2 [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>]. In resistant <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, H1- and H7-HA are not efficiently cleaved and subsequently the virus fails to spread in infected lungs and therefore does not cause pathology [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>]. On the other hand, H3N2 is able to replicate in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and cause mortality [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10, 13</xref>]. In <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Tmprss4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> double KO mice, replication of H3N2 is still occurring although at a strongly reduced level resulting in low mortality [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, the H3-HA motif PEKQTR&#x02193;G is not only processed by TMPRSS2, but also by TMPRSS4 and at least one more, yet unknown protease [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to investigate the differences between H1- and H3-HA amino acid sequences that are required for virus replication and pathology in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.

For this, we generated several reassortants and mutant viruses based on A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) and A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) (HK). Plasmids were generated by sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 to rescue viruses. We first generated two reassorted viruses, HK_HA(PR8) carrying the entire HA segment of H1 on the backbone of HK, and PR8_HA(HK) carrying the entire HA segment of H3 on the backbone of PR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, we generated a recombinant virus [PR8_HA(MVEKT)] in which we replaced the HA cleavage site and neighbouring amino acids of H1-HA with the amino acid sequence of H3-HA (region from amino acids 320 to 329, at the C-terminus of HA<sub>1</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). We refer to this HA region as the &#x02018;HA-loop&#x02019; which is predicted to interact with cellular proteases and in which HA cleavage occurs between amino acids R329 and G330 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Additionally, we produced a virus in which we also exchanged a more distant amino acid from the H1-HA to the H3-HA sequence that is predicted to interact with amino acids in the loop (see below for more details) either by itself or in combination with the loop exchange. In these viruses, referred to as PR8_HA(D) or PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), respectively, the glutamate at position 31 was replaced by aspartate from H3 (E31 to D31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Of note, we could not rescue recombinant virus with single amino acid exchange in the H1-HA-loop (predicted protease recognition sequence: H1-PSIQSR to H3-PEKQTR) suggesting that the entire H1-HA-loop or H3-HA-loop sequence is required for a functional HA. The replaced and mutated HA segments (segment 4) were incorporated into viruses with an isogenic PR8 backbone for all other segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Scheme of recombinant viruses.

However, after serial passages in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, this virus acquired a mutation in the HA stalk which led to replication and pathology in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Tmprss4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> double knock-out mice, replication and pathology after infection with our H3N2 isolate was strongly diminished and infected mice survived. These observations suggest that H3 viruses are able to replicate in a <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> background whereas H1 viruses cannot. Here, we investigated in detail the differences in the HA sequence that are responsible for the different behaviour of H1 and H3 viruses in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. For this, we generated a series of reassorted and mutated IAV and analysed body weight loss, survival, viral replication in lung, lung epithelial cell damage, and cleavage of the HA protein in WT and <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>We first established that the exchange of only the HA segment of H3-HA for H1 in a virus that contained all other segments from PR8 (H1N1) resulted in 100&#x0200a;% lethality in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice [virus PR8_HA(HK)]. <italic>Vice versa</italic>, replacement of the H3-HA by the H1-HA in an H3N2 background completely protected infected <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice from body weight loss and mortality [virus HK_HA(PR8)]. These studies confirmed that the resistance phenotype in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice to H1N1 IAV only resides in the HA protein. This important aspect had not been addressed in any of the previous studies [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref>].</p><p>The replacement of only the HA-loop was not sufficient to overcome the resistant phenotype of <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. However, replacement of the HA-loop and additional replacement of a distant amino acid, E31 by aspartic acid from H3-HA, strongly increased mortality of <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice after infection [virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. The increase in pathology was due to a higher viral replication and increased lung epithelial damage which was comparable to WT mice infected with this virus. E31 is predicted to interact with R321 of the HA-loop in H1-HA. The exchange of E31 and accompanied changes of the HA protease recognition site could lead to an altered accessibility of the HA-loop for other proteases than TMPRSS2 in [PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies also suggested that the exchange of the HA-loop itself does not necessarily lead to productive HA processed by matriptase protease [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, when the cleavage site of an H1-HA was exchanged by the amino acid sequence RSSR, matriptase was still unable to cleave the HA-loop. Similarly, an H9-HA carrying the minimal furin cleavage motif was not cleaved by furin [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further studies are thus needed to address the role of additional proteases and requirements for a fully functional HA processing. The importance of a distant amino acid on the pathogenicity of an H3 virus had been shown before by exchanging amino acid 8 in HA resulting in the loss of a glycosylation site and increased pathogenicity [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13, 20</xref>]. In addition, it was shown that cleavage by TMPRSS2 results in a less glycosylated HA<sub>1</sub> compared to cleavage by trypsin or TMPRSS4 [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, our <italic>in vivo</italic> study confirms previous <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses demonstrating the role of loop and distant amino acids for viral replication.</p><p>However, it should be noted that the above changes were still not sufficient to completely restore the high virulence of a virus with a complete H3-HA [PR8_HA(HK)], suggesting that further distant amino acids might be important as well.</p><p>Also, it should be noted that any change in the amino acid sequence, which was introduced in this study, may have an influence on viral fitness and thus replication rate and pathogenicity. This can be clearly seen when the replication of different viruses was compared in WT mice. However, in this study, we did not seek to investigate the effect of these amino acid exchanges on viral fitness in WT mice but our study aimed to understand the role of specific amino acids in the loop and potentially interacting amino acids on the dependency of virus replication and pathogenicity for the TMPRSS2 protease. Thus, our main conclusions relate to the difference of virus pathogenicity and replication between WT and <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. We showed that amino acids of the loop together with a distant amino acid are important for cleavage by proteases other than TMPRSS2.</p><p>Many studies performed in the mouse model system demonstrated that virus replication in the lung and associated tissue damage or functional impairment of infected cells is the main cause for severe pathology [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21, 22</xref>]. In other studies, the degree of the inflammatory response and the resulting immunopathology has also been described as a major contributor to disease severity [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21, 23</xref>]. In this study, histopathological analysis showed that tissue damage was the major correlate for disease severity. It also correlated well with replication (between WT and mutant mice for a given virus) whereas tissue inflammation was not significantly correlated. We thus hypothesize that virus replication and subsequent tissue damage is the main cause for disease severity. This conclusion is well in line with the interpretation that the absence or presence of specific proteases is the main driver for virus maturation, and subsequently its replication and spread in the infected lung and eventually severity of the disease. A similar result was obtained from patients infected with pandemic 2009&#x02009;H1N1 or H7N9. Patients whose genome carried a higher-expression variant of TMPRSS2 were more severely ill than patients expressing less TMPRSS2 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>A simple explanation for the reduced viral titres and spreading of virus PR8_HA(MVEKT) and the increased replication of virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice would be the absence or reduction of HA cleavage in PR8_HA(MVEKT). However, Western blot analysis revealed that the HA-loop of both viruses, PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), was cleaved in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. Nevertheless, PR8_HA(MVEKT) was less efficiently cleaved compared to PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). One likely explanation could be that PR8_HA(MVEKT) is cleaved by a protease that recognizes the HA protein at a nearby but markedly different cleavage site than the trypsin-like TMPRSS2. Such a shift by a single or three amino acids is sufficient to cause cleavage but would thus not result in efficiently activated particles as has been reported for cleavage of H3-HA by thermolysin and chymotrypsin [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25, 26</xref>]. A second possibility could be that the respective unknown protease cleaves at the same site as TMPRSS2 but does not generate activated particles, as has been described for hepsin [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In both cases, these viruses would not be infectious and do not lead to high titres, tissue damage and death of the animals although the HA protein is cleaved.</p><p>Which other protease(s) could be responsible for the cleavage of HA(D-MVEKT) in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice? We showed recently that in addition to TMPRSS2 also TMPRSS4 was required for optimal cleavage and replication of H3-HA [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another candidate may be TMPRSS11D (HAT), which was shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to cleave H3-HA [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27, 28</xref>]. Additionally, it was described that H3 can be cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> by kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5), tryptase Clara (TPSB2), TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6, 29, 30</xref>]. For these studies, additional mouse mutants with single and double KO will be required. Recently, a <italic>Klk5</italic>-deficient knock-out mouse was described that showed no difference in body weight loss compared to WT mice after infection with a H3N2 IAV supporting again the hypothesis that more than one protease is responsible for cleavage of H3-HA [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To identify the third protease that cleaves H3-HA <italic>in vivo</italic>, additional mouse mutants with single, double or even triple KO will be required.</p><p>In conclusion, exchanging the H3-HA sequences for the H1-HA-loop plus one distant amino acid increases virus replication and pathology in <italic>Tmprss2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. More studies are still needed to fully understand these processes and identify yet unknown proteases as well as to eventually develop inhibitors against host proteases that can be used for intervention treatment in humans. Nevertheless, our results provide further support for host proteases as a highly potential target to inhibit IAV replication and pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1-5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCK) cells (ATCC) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (Open Biosystem) were kept at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with 5 &#x0200a;% CO<sub>2</sub> in minimal essential medium (MEM, Gibco) containing 10&#x0200a; % fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories) and 1&#x0200a; % Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S, Biochrom).
