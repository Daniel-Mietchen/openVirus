  <p>Scheme of recombinant viruses. The structure of recombinant viruses with name, origin of segment 4 (HA), origin of the loop, backbone segments (Other proteins) and relevant HA amino acid sequences are illustrated. Differences at the amino acid level are shown for the N-terminal part (amino acids 16–32) and the protease recognition site with its neighbouring region (amino acids 320–329, H3 numbering), which we refer to here as the ‘HA-loop’ (highlighted in green). HA
   <sub>1</sub> is highlighted in orange (except the HA-loop) and HA
   <sub>2</sub> in yellow. Differences in amino acid sequences between HA-HK and HA-PR8 are labelled red. The arrow indicates where cleavage occurs. PR8: A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1); HK: A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2).
