  <p>PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) but not PR8_HA(MVEKT) virus causes epithelial damage in 
   <italic>Tmprss2
    <sup>−/−</sup>
   </italic> mice. Female 8–12-week-old WT and 
   <italic>Tmprss2
    <sup>−/−</sup>
   </italic> KO mice were infected intranasally with 2×10
   <sup>5</sup> f.f.u. PR8 (WT: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3; KO: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3), PR8_HA(HK) (WT: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3; KO: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3), PR8_HA(MVEKT) (WT: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3; KO: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3) or PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) (WT: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3; KO: 
   <italic>n</italic>=3). Lungs were prepared at day 4 p.i., sectioned and stained with H&amp;E. Bronchiolar epithelial damage (a) and inflammation (b) were scored. WT mice: black, 
   <italic>Tmprss2
    <sup>−/−</sup>
   </italic> mice: red. Error bars represent ±1 
   <sc>sem</sc>. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA and a post-hoc pair-wise 
   <italic>t-</italic>test and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. 
   <italic>P</italic>-values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant (***
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Inflammation scores were not significantly different by ANOVA. Therefore, no post-hoc analysis was performed.
