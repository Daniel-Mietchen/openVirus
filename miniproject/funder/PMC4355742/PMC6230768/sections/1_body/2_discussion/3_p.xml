<p>The replacement of only the HA-loop was not sufficient to overcome the resistant phenotype of 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice. However, replacement of the HA-loop and additional replacement of a distant amino acid, E31 by aspartic acid from H3-HA, strongly increased mortality of 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice after infection [virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. The increase in pathology was due to a higher viral replication and increased lung epithelial damage which was comparable to WT mice infected with this virus. E31 is predicted to interact with R321 of the HA-loop in H1-HA. The exchange of E31 and accompanied changes of the HA protease recognition site could lead to an altered accessibility of the HA-loop for other proteases than TMPRSS2 in [PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)]. Several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies also suggested that the exchange of the HA-loop itself does not necessarily lead to productive HA processed by matriptase protease [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, when the cleavage site of an H1-HA was exchanged by the amino acid sequence RSSR, matriptase was still unable to cleave the HA-loop. Similarly, an H9-HA carrying the minimal furin cleavage motif was not cleaved by furin [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Further studies are thus needed to address the role of additional proteases and requirements for a fully functional HA processing. The importance of a distant amino acid on the pathogenicity of an H3 virus had been shown before by exchanging amino acid 8 in HA resulting in the loss of a glycosylation site and increased pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13, 20</xref>]. In addition, it was shown that cleavage by TMPRSS2 results in a less glycosylated HA
 <sub>1</sub> compared to cleavage by trypsin or TMPRSS4 [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study confirms previous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses demonstrating the role of loop and distant amino acids for viral replication.
