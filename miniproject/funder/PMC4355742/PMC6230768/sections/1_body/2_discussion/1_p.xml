<p>We and others have previously shown that deletion of 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> in mice results in resistance to infection with H1N1 and monobasic H7N9 IAV [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>]. Yet, two studies showed that replication of H3N2 was only marginally affected and caused pathology in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10, 12</xref>]. A third study described an H3N2 variant that was not able to replicate in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice [
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, after serial passages in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice, this virus acquired a mutation in the HA stalk which led to replication and pathology in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup> Tmprss4
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> double knock-out mice, replication and pathology after infection with our H3N2 isolate was strongly diminished and infected mice survived. These observations suggest that H3 viruses are able to replicate in a 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> background whereas H1 viruses cannot. Here, we investigated in detail the differences in the HA sequence that are responsible for the different behaviour of H1 and H3 viruses in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice. For this, we generated a series of reassorted and mutated IAV and analysed body weight loss, survival, viral replication in lung, lung epithelial cell damage, and cleavage of the HA protein in WT and 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice.
