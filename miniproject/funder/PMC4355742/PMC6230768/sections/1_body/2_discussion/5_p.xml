<p>Also, it should be noted that any change in the amino acid sequence, which was introduced in this study, may have an influence on viral fitness and thus replication rate and pathogenicity. This can be clearly seen when the replication of different viruses was compared in WT mice. However, in this study, we did not seek to investigate the effect of these amino acid exchanges on viral fitness in WT mice but our study aimed to understand the role of specific amino acids in the loop and potentially interacting amino acids on the dependency of virus replication and pathogenicity for the TMPRSS2 protease. Thus, our main conclusions relate to the difference of virus pathogenicity and replication between WT and
