<p>In conclusion, exchanging the H3-HA sequences for the H1-HA-loop plus one distant amino acid increases virus replication and pathology in

More studies are still needed to fully understand these processes and identify yet unknown proteases as well as to eventually develop inhibitors against host proteases that can be used for intervention treatment in humans. Nevertheless, our results provide further support for host proteases as a highly potential target to inhibit IAV replication and pathology.
