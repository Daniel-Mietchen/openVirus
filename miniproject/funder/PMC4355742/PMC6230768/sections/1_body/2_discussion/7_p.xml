<p>A simple explanation for the reduced viral titres and spreading of virus PR8_HA(MVEKT) and the increased replication of virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice would be the absence or reduction of HA cleavage in PR8_HA(MVEKT). However, Western blot analysis revealed that the HA-loop of both viruses, PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), was cleaved in

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice. Nevertheless, PR8_HA(MVEKT) was less efficiently cleaved compared to PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). One likely explanation could be that PR8_HA(MVEKT) is cleaved by a protease that recognizes the HA protein at a nearby but markedly different cleavage site than the trypsin-like TMPRSS2. Such a shift by a single or three amino acids is sufficient to cause cleavage but would thus not result in efficiently activated particles as has been reported for cleavage of H3-HA by thermolysin and chymotrypsin [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25, 26</xref>]. A second possibility could be that the respective unknown protease cleaves at the same site as TMPRSS2 but does not generate activated particles, as has been described for hepsin [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In both cases, these viruses would not be infectious and do not lead to high titres, tissue damage and death of the animals although the HA protein is cleaved.
