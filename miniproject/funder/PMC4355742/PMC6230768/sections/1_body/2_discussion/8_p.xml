<p>Which other protease(s) could be responsible for the cleavage of HA(D-MVEKT) in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice? We showed recently that in addition to TMPRSS2 also TMPRSS4 was required for optimal cleavage and replication of H3-HA [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another candidate may be TMPRSS11D (HAT), which was shown 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to cleave H3-HA [
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27, 28</xref>]. Additionally, it was described that H3 can be cleaved 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5), tryptase Clara (TPSB2), TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) [
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6, 29, 30</xref>]. For these studies, additional mouse mutants with single and double KO will be required. Recently, a 
 <italic>Klk5</italic>-deficient knock-out mouse was described that showed no difference in body weight loss compared to WT mice after infection with a H3N2 IAV supporting again the hypothesis that more than one protease is responsible for cleavage of H3-HA [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To identify the third protease that cleaves H3-HA 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, additional mouse mutants with single, double or even triple KO will be required.
