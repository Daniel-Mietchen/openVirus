<p>Many studies performed in the mouse model system demonstrated that virus replication in the lung and associated tissue damage or functional impairment of infected cells is the main cause for severe pathology [

 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21, 23</xref>]. In this study, histopathological analysis showed that tissue damage was the major correlate for disease severity. It also correlated well with replication (between WT and mutant mice for a given virus) whereas tissue inflammation was not significantly correlated. We thus hypothesize that virus replication and subsequent tissue damage is the main cause for disease severity. This conclusion is well in line with the interpretation that the absence or presence of specific proteases is the main driver for virus maturation, and subsequently its replication and spread in the infected lung and eventually severity of the disease. A similar result was obtained from patients infected with pandemic 2009â€‰H1N1 or H7N9. Patients whose genome carried a higher-expression variant of TMPRSS2 were more severely ill than patients expressing less TMPRSS2 [
