<p>Next, we investigated if the higher mortality in PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)-infected mice was due to increased viral replication. WT and

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice were infected with 2×10
 <sup>5</sup> f.f.u. PR8, PR8_HA(HK), PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). On day 2 and 4 p.i., viral loads were determined in infected lungs (

 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice after infection with PR8 and PR8_HA(MVEKT) at 2 and 4 days p.i. demonstrating that viral replication is strongly reduced in the absence of TMPRSS2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed between WT and KO mice after infection with PR8_HA(HK) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) on day 2 suggesting that replacement of the HA-loop plus a distant amino acid allows efficient replication of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). At day 4 after infection with HK_HA(PR8) the viral load was lower than at day 2, but still the same for WT and 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast to this observation, the viral load of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) at 4 days p.i. was lower in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice compared to the WT. This is in agreement with the higher survival rate of 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice. Additionally, viral replication was significantly higher in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice infected with PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) compared to infections with PR8_HA(MVEKT) or PR8 at day 2 and 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the difference in virus virulence (body weight loss and mortality) between PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) and PR8_HA(MVEKT) can be explained by differences in viral replication in infected lungs and thus increased tissue damage.
