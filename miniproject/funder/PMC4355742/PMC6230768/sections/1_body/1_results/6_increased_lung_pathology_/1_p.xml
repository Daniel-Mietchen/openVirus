<p>To investigate if increased viral replication of the PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) virus was associated with increased lung tissue damage, we performed histopathological studies of infected lungs. After infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8, lungs showed significantly reduced bronchiolar epithelial damage in

 </italic> mice with PR8, PR8_HA(HK), PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). In conclusion, the difference in virulence (body weight loss and mortality) between PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) and PR8_HA(MVEKT) is due to an increase in tissue damage resulting from higher levels of viral replication.
