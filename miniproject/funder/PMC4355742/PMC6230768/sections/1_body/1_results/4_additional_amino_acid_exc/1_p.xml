<p>The results described above showed that the exchange of the H3-HA-loop for the H1-HA-loop alone does not result in a virus that overcomes TMPRSS2 dependency. Therefore, we inspected the crystal structure of the H1-HA from the 1918 ‘Spanish flu’ virus (PDB [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] ID: 1RD8; [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) in more detail. H1-HA of the H1N1 1918 ‘Spanish flu’ virus and the PR8 (H1N1) utilized in this study share a sequence similarity of 89 % and the herein discussed amino acids are present in both proteins. By this approach, we identified a salt bridge formed by arginine at position 321 and glutamic acid at position 31 which is located in proximity to the HA-loop and thus might play a role for protease recognition (
