<p>Therefore, we also replaced this amino acid in H1 with the equivalent amino acid from the H3 sequence in addition to the HA-loop: aspartic acid at position 31 (mutant E31D). This resulted in virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Of note, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) could only be rescued after exchange of the codon GAG (encoding for glutamic acid, nucleotide 144–146) to GAU, but not GAC (both encoding for aspartic acid) which might be due to a restriction in the

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice showed strong body weight loss with a similar kinetic as WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Also, all of the infected WT mice and 40 % of infected 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice died (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) is able to cause considerable body weight loss and mortality also in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice although to a lesser extent. We confirmed that both exchanges are required for the higher pathogenicity of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) by studying the pathogenicity of the single mutant PR8_HA(D) virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref> and S2). This virus exhibits slightly higher pathogenicity (body weight loss similar, one mouse died) in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice than PR8 but was much less virulent than PR8_HA(D-MVEKT).
