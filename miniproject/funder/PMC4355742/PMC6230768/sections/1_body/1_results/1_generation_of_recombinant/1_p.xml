<p>In this study we aimed at determining which HA sequences are responsible for the observed differences of virus replication and associated pathology between H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in

 </italic> mice. For this, we generated several reassortants and mutant viruses based on A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) and A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) (HK). Plasmids were generated by sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 to rescue viruses. We first generated two reassorted viruses, HK_HA(PR8) carrying the entire HA segment of H1 on the backbone of HK, and PR8_HA(HK) carrying the entire HA segment of H3 on the backbone of PR8 (

 <sub>1</sub>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). We refer to this HA region as the ‘HA-loop’ which is predicted to interact with cellular proteases and in which HA cleavage occurs between amino acids R329 and G330 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Additionally, we produced a virus in which we also exchanged a more distant amino acid from the H1-HA to the H3-HA sequence that is predicted to interact with amino acids in the loop (see below for more details) either by itself or in combination with the loop exchange. In these viruses, referred to as PR8_HA(D) or PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), respectively, the glutamate at position 31 was replaced by aspartate from H3 (E31 to D31, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Of note, we could not rescue recombinant virus with single amino acid exchange in the H1-HA-loop (predicted protease recognition sequence: H1-PSIQSR to H3-PEKQTR) suggesting that the entire H1-HA-loop or H3-HA-loop sequence is required for a functional HA. The replaced and mutated HA segments (segment 4) were incorporated into viruses with an isogenic PR8 backbone for all other segments (
