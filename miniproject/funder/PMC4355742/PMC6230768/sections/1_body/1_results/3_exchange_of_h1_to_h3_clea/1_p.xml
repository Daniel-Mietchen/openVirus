<p>Next, we sought to identify the specific amino acid sequences in the H3-HA that are responsible for body weight loss and mortality in

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice. For this, we exchanged the H3 sequence (
 <underline>M</underline>RN
 <underline>V</underline>P
 <underline>EK</underline>Q
 <underline>T</underline>R) for the HA-loop of H1 (LRNIPSIQSR) resulting in virus PR8_HA(MVEKT). Infection of WT mice showed that PR8_HA(MVEKT) was not as pathogenic as the parental PR8 virus; only 50 % of the infected WT mice died after infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) compared to 100 % lethality of WT mice after infection with PR8 or PR8_HA(HK) (

 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice only lost body weight slightly and all infected mice survived (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). These results demonstrate that the exchange of the HA-loop alone from H1-HA to H3-HA is not sufficient to cause strong body weight loss and mortality in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice, suggesting that additional amino acids outside the HA-loop region are required for this phenotype.
