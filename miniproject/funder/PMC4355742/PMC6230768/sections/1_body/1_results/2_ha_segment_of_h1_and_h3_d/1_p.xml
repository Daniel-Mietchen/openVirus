<p>WT and

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> knock-out (KO) mice were infected with 2×10
 <sup>5</sup> f.f.u. PR8, HK_HA(PR8) and PR8_HA(HK). After infection with PR8 (H1N1), WT mice lost body weight and all infected mice died, whereas 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice lost body weight only slightly and all infected mice survived (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Infection with HK_HA(PR8) resulted in body weight loss in WT similar to infections with PR8 whereas 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice showed a similar resistance phenotype as for infections with PR8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results demonstrate that the resistance phenotype to H1N1 virus in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice resides in the H1-HA segment and that other proteins of the HK virus do not have a major impact. Infection of 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> and WT mice with PR8_HA(HK) led to body weight loss in both mouse strains and death of all infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These results are consistent with our previous observations using the entire HK (H3N2) virus [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, results with the reassorted viruses HK_HA(PR8) and PR8_HA(HK) were identical to the results from the parental viruses (PR8, HK) in previous studies when the same infection dose was used (2×10
 <sup>3</sup> f.f.u.; Fig. S1, available in the online version of this article). Together, our results demonstrate that exchange of the HA segments leads to a phenotype that resembles that of the parental virus (H1N1 or H3N2, respectively) in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> and WT mice. Thus, H3-HA is necessary and sufficient for body weight loss and mortality in

  <sup>−/−</sup>
