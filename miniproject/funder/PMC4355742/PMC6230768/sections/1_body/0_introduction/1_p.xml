<p>Influenza A virus (IAV), a member of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family, is responsible for a highly contagious respiratory illness that affects millions of people worldwide during seasonal epidemics causing huge mortality and economic loss [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>]. H1N1 and H3N2 are the presently circulating virus subtypes that cause yearly epidemics in humans. The receptor-binding surface molecule haemagglutinin (HA) forms homotrimers [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule HA
 <sub>0</sub> and proteolytically processed into the subunits HA
 <sub>1</sub> and HA
 <sub>2</sub> that are connected by a disulfide bond. Activation of HA is important for its fusion potential with the endosome including a conformational change to release the viral genome into the cytoplasm (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref>]). Depending on the protease recognition motif, several proteases have been identified to cleave HA (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref>]). The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to cleave H1- and monobasic H7-HA 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> at the cleavage sites PSIQSR↓G and PEIPKR↓G, respectively [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4, 9</xref>]. Furthermore, in mouse knock-out (KO) mutants, it was shown that 
 <italic>Tmprss2-</italic>deficient 
 <italic>(Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>)
 </italic> mice are highly resistant to infections with H1N1 and monobasic H7N9, but only weakly to H3N2 [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>]. In resistant 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice, H1- and H7-HA are not efficiently cleaved and subsequently the virus fails to spread in infected lungs and therefore does not cause pathology [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>]. On the other hand, H3N2 is able to replicate in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice and cause mortality [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10, 13</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup> Tmprss4
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> double KO mice, replication of H3N2 is still occurring although at a strongly reduced level resulting in low mortality [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, the H3-HA motif PEKQTR↓G is not only processed by TMPRSS2, but also by TMPRSS4 and at least one more, yet unknown protease [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
