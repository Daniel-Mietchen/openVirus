<p>Lungs were homogenized using FastPrep-24 Instrument (MP Biomedicals). For this, 2ml PBS/0.1  % bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the lungs in a Lysing MatrixD tube (MP Biomedicals) and homogenized for 30 s at 6.5 m s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Cell debris was spun down for 10 min with 200

 </bold> at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant containing virus. Virus titres were determined using f.f.u. assay. For this, viruses were serially tenfold diluted in infection medium [MEM containing 0.1 % BSA, 2.5 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> NAT (N-acetylated trypsin, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 % P/S]. MDCK II cells (6×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well of a 96-well plate, grown for 24 h in MEM supplemented with 1 % P/S) were washed with infection medium. Afterwards cells were infected with 50 µl of each virus dilution. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5  % CO
 <sub>2</sub>, cells were overlayed with 100 µl DMEM containing 1  % avicel, 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-Glutamine, 0.1  % BSA and 2.5 µg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> NAT and kept at 37 °C in 5  % CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were stained 24 h p.i. at room temperature. For this, cells were washed with 100 µl PBS and fixed with 96  % ice-cold ethanol for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with 100 µl PBS and permeabilized with 0.5  % Triton X-100 and 20 mM glycin in PBS for 10 min. Cells were washed with 100 µl wash buffer (WB) (0.5  % Tween 20 in PBS) and 50 µl primary antibody were added for 40 min (1 : 1000 in WB, goat anti-influenza virions 1301, Virostat). After two wash steps with 100 µl WB, 50 µl of the secondary antibody were added for 40 min (1 : 1000 in WB, anti-goat-IgG-HRP, KPL, MA, USA). Finally, after two wash steps with 100 µl WB, 30 µl of the substrate were added (TrueBlue, KPL) and incubated for 30 min until blue spots appeared. The substrate was then washed with tap water, cells were dried and foci were counted. Titres were calculated as f.f.u. ml
 <sup>−1</sup> (virus stocks) or f.f.u./lung (lung homogenates).
