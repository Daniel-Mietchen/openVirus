<p>Total protein was measured in lung homogenates (2 days p.i.) or BAL samples (3 days p.i.) using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were then mixed with 8x SDS loading buffer and 50 µg total protein in lung homogenates or 20 µg total protein in BAL of each sample was run on a 10  % SDS gel. Proteins were blotted on a PVDF-membrane (Bio-Rad) and H1 was detected by staining with rabbit anti-H1N1-HA antibody (PR8, Sino biological, 11684-RP01), H3 after staining with rabbit anti-H3N2-HA (A/Brisbane/10/2007, Sino biological, 11056-PR02) or NP protein with anti-NP antibody (GeneTex, GTX125989), all at a dilution of 1 : 5000, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody in a dilution of 1 : 10 000 (Sigma, A0545). Bands were visualized using Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Immobilon) in an imaging system (FujiFilm LAS-3000). The blot with lung homogenates was then incubated with mouse anti-actin (Santa Cruz, sc-47778) diluted 1 : 1000, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (Cell signaling, 7076) diluted 1 : 3000 and visualized as described before. Intensities of bands were analysed using ImageJ [
