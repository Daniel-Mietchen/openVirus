<p>Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCK) cells (ATCC) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (Open Biosystem) were kept at 37 °C with 5  % CO
 <sub>2</sub> in minimal essential medium (MEM, Gibco) containing 10  % fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories) and 1  % Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S, Biochrom). A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) was originally obtained from Otto Haller, University of Freiburg. All viruses were propagated in the chorio-allantoic cavity of 10-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories, Germany) for 48 h at 37 °C, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The titre of the stock viruses was determined by f.f.u. assay (f.f.u. ml
 <sup>–1</sup>). Viral RNA was extracted using the QiAamp Viral RNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Quality and integrity of total RNA was controlled on Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies; Waldbronn, Germany). The RNA sequencing library was generated from 100 ng total RNA using Illumina True Seq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) without fragmentation according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq using MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles, paired end run).
