<p>Data and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, CA) and R software package [
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Statistical significance for body weight loss was determined by a multi-factorial ANOVA (including repeated measures for mice as subject) using statistical software R and the model body_weight ~ mouse_strain * days_pi + (1|subject) and post-hoc pair-wise 
 <italic>t</italic>-test with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction. For the ANOVA, only the days p.i. were considered when at least 50  % of infected mice were still alive (2×10
 <sup>5</sup> f.f.u.: PR8: days p.i. 1 to 4; HK_HA(PR8): days p.i. 1 to 4; PR8_HA(MVEKT): days p.i. 1 to 8; PR8_HA(D-MVEKT): days p.i. 1 to 5; PR8_HA(HK): days p.i. 1 to 4; PR8_HA(D): days p.i. 1 to 5; 2×10
 <sup>3</sup> f.f.u.: PR8_HA(HK): days p.i. 1 to 6; HK_HA(PR8): days p.i. 1–6). Statistical significance for viral load was determined by a multi-factorial ANOVA using statistical software R and the model lg10_virus_titre ~ virus_type * mouse_strain. Statistical significance for lung pathology was determined by a multi-factorial ANOVA using statistical software R and the model mean_inflammation_score ~ group and percent_damage ~ group. 
 <italic>P</italic>-values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant. GraphPad Prism was used to calculate statistical differences for survival curves with the Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.
