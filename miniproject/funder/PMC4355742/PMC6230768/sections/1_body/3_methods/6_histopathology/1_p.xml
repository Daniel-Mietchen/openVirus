<p>Lungs were prepared from infected mice and immersion-fixed for 24 h in 4  % buffered formaldehyde solution (pH 7.4), dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut from five evenly distributed levels and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. For each group (KO and WT, virus), three mice were studied and five sections per mouse were analysed for inflammation using a semi-quantitative scoring system from 0=none, 1=mildly, 2=moderately, 3=severely increased cellular infiltration. In addition, bronchiolar structures with and without epithelial cell necrosis were counted on one section to calculate percentages of affected bronchi.</p>
