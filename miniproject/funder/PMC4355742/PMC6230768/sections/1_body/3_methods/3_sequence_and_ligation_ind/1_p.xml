<p>For cDNA preparation, the Uni12 primer (1 µl, 10 mM) was bound to 500 ng viral RNA with 1 µl dNTP in a total volume of 13 µl at 65 °C for 5 min and cooled on ice for 1 min. Then, 4 µl 5x First-Strand Buffer, 1 µl 0.1 M DTT, 1 µl RNasin (Promega) and 1 µl SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen) were added. Reverse transcription was performed for 50 min at 50 °C and stopped for 15 min at 70 °C. Finally, RNA was digested using 1 µl RNaseH (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C. Plasmids originated from A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) were cloned into pHW-2000 vector [kindly provided by Robert Webster (St. Jude, Memphis, USA)] by SLIC modified from [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. First, a PCR was performed using 1 µl PRECISOR High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (BioCat) on 0.5 µl cDNA with 2 µl of each primer (10 µM) and 1.25 µl dNTPs (10 mM each) in a total of 50 µl, running the program 98 °C 2 min; 35×98 °C 30 s, 57–60 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1–4 min; 72 °C 10 min in a thermocycler. Empty vector pHW-2000 was cut with BsmBI (NEB) for 2 h at 55 °C. Samples were run on an agarose gel and bands of appropriate size were cut and purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). Next, 5′ overhangs were made using 50 ng cut vector and PCR product in a 1 : 6 ratio with 0.1 µl T4 DNA polymerase (NEB) and 1 µl buffer 2.1 in a total of 10 µl at 22 °C for 30 min, heat inactivated at 75 °C for 20 min and finally annealed at 37 °C for 30 min. Last, 5 µl of this reaction was transformed into 100 µl chemically competent XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). To insert mutations into the HA, PCR was performed using 1.5 µl PfuUltra High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Stratagene), 5 µl 10x PfuUltra buffer, 1 µl dNTPs (10 mM each), 50 ng plasmid and 1 µl of each primer (10 µM) in a total volume of 50 µl. The following program was run in a thermocycler: 2 min 95 °C; 18×30 s 95 °C; 30 s 55 °C and 5 min 72 °C; 5 min 72 °C and cooled down to 4 °C. The pHW-HA was digested with 1 µl DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h and then chemically competent XL1-Blue cells were transformed using the final product. Plasmid DNA was purified with the Roti-Prep Plasmid MINI (Roth) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Correct insertion of the mutation was verified by sequencing.
