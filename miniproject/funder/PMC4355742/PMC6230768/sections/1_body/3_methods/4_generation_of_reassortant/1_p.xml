<p>Recombinant viruses were generated by DNA transfection as described earlier [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. All pHW-2000 plasmids containing eight segments of PR8 (A/Puerto/Rico/8/34, H1N1) were kindly provided by Robert Webster (St. Jude, Memphis, USA). HEK 293T and MDCK cells were co-cultured in a six-well plate and grown 24 h at 37 °C in 5  % CO
 <sub>2</sub> until cells reached confluency. Cells were washed and 800 µl OptiMEM (Gibco) were added. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or 
 <italic>Trans</italic>IT-LT1 (Mirus Bio LLC) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 1 µg of each plasmid and 15 µl Lipofectamine or 16 µl 
 <italic>Trans</italic>IT-LT1, respectively. Within 24 h post transfection medium was exchanged with 2 ml MEM containing 1 % P/S and 1 µg TPCK-trypsin (tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone treated trypsin) (Sigma). Cells were monitored every day until a cytopathic effect appeared and virus was harvested. After amplification of virus, RNA was extracted and whole virus genome was confirmed using next generation sequencing by Illumina (see Cells and viruses).
