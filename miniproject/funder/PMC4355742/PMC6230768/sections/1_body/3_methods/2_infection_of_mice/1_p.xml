 <italic>Tmprss2</italic>-mutant mice were kindly provided by Peter S. Nelson, FHCRC, Seattle, USA [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Exons 10–13, essential for serine protease activity, were deleted through homologue recombination with the targeting vector. Mice were on a mixed background and further backcrossed in our facility to C57BL/6JRj (Janvier, France) for nine successive generations (B6.129S1-
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic>
 <sup>tm1Tsyk</sup>). The correct background was verified by Neogen MegaMUGA (High Density Mouse Universal Genotyping Array) SNP-Assay. The analysis demonstrated 99.79 % matching to the C57BL/6J genome with a remaining 8.9 Mb region flanking the original 129-
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> genomic region on chromosome 16. C57BL/6JRj WT mice used as controls were purchased from Janvier (France) and maintained under SPF conditions at the Central Animal Facilities at the HZI, Braunschweig. Mice (female, 8–12 week old) were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of Ketamine-Xylazine solution (5 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> Ketamine, WDT, Garbsen; 1 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup> Xylazine, CP-Pharma, Burgdorf; in sterile 0.9  % NaCl, WDT, Garbsen) with a dose adjusted to the individual body weight (200 µl/20 g body weight). Virus was diluted in sterile PBS to a dose of 2×10
 <sup>5</sup> f.f.u./20 µl and mice were infected by intranasal application. Subsequently, body weight and survival were monitored for 14 days. In addition to mice that were found dead, animals with a body weight loss of more than 30  % of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. All mouse infections were performed in at least two independent experiments.
