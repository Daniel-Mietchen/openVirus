 <p>Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a naturally-occurring, fecally transmitted disease caused by a Hantavirus (HV). It is extremely damaging to human health and results in many deaths annually, especially in Hubei Province, China. One of the primary characteristics of HFRS is the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of its occurrence, with notable seasonal differences. In view of this heterogeneity, the present study suggests that there is a need to focus on trend simulation and the spatiotemporal prediction of HFRS outbreaks. To facilitate this, we constructed a new Seasonal Difference Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SD-STARIMA) model. The SD-STARIMA model is based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARMA) model first developed by Cliff and Ord in 1974, which has proven useful in modelling the temporal aspects of spatially located data. This model can simulate the trends in HFRS epidemics, taking into consideration both spatial and temporal variations. The SD-STARIMA model is also able to make seasonal difference calculations to eliminate temporally non-stationary problems that are present in the HFRS data. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed SD-STARIMA model offers notably better prediction accuracy, especially for spatiotemporal series data with seasonal distribution characteristics.</p>
