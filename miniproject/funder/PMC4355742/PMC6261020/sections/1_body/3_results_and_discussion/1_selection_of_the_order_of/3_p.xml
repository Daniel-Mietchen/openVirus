 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g007">Fig 7</xref> presents the stationarity analysis results relating to HFRS incidence after using a first-order difference. The time series fluctuates around the value 0, indicating an overall uniform distribution. The ACF and PACF appear to be tailing off. It can be inferred from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g007">Fig 7</xref>. that, after taking the first-order difference into account, the time series shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g006">Fig 6</xref>. is a stationary time series. Therefore, for this paper we have chosen to use the first order difference to preprocess the data.
