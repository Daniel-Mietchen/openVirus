<p>For the STARIMA model, a spatial weight matrix had to be established first of all. First-order spatial neighborhood matrices and second-order spatial domain matrices of 73*73 were obtained according to the spatial neighborhood relationship of 73 counties in Hubei Province (there are actually 76 counties, but 73 were used as samples and the other 3 for validation). The core diagonal elements of the first-order adjacency matrix are 0. There are no adjacent spatial units if the non- diagonal elements are 0. 1 indicates that there are adjacent spatial units. The first- and second-order spatial neighborhood matrix can be obtained on the basis of the specific adjacency unit according to the row and column identifying the elements and the line standardization.</p>
