<p>We also evaluated the prediction results and general performance of the ARIMA, STARIMA and SD-STARIMA models to assess their relative effectiveness. 
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref> shows the correlation coefficient (R), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Average Absolute Error (MAE) and Classic Akaike Information Criterion(AIC) for each of the models. It can be seen from the table that the SD-STARIMA model is more reliable and that the error between its predicted values and actual observed values is smaller. Overall, then, we can conclude as follows:
