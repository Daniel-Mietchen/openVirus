<p>Li et al. have used a GWR (geographically weighted regression) model to identify the impact of environmental factors and social-economic factors on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of HFRS in China [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this model, spatial characteristics are taken into account when undertaking the GWR-based analysis. However, this model suffers from the opposite flaw to the one above: temporal correlation is also a key influencing factor for HFRS cases in Hubei Province. Thus, by overlooking the temporal factors, this may similarly undermine the accuracy of the estimated results.
