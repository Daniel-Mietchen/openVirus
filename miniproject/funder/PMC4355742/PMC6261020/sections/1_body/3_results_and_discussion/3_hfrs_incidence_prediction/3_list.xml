  <p>The data relating to HFRS incidence in Hubei Province has a fluctuating distribution curve and is quite different from other statistically sampled data in terms of its space and time distribution features, which are characterized by an obvious seasonal distribution. An SD-STARIMA model was therefore introduced that is able to adjust for seasonal difference and thus fit the data incorporating seasonal distribution trends more effectively.</p>

  <p>The data for HFRS incidence in Hubei Province has both spatial and temporal characteristics. The SD-STARIMA model has both spatial and temporal features that are thus able to explain and simulate the HFRS tendencies in Hubei, with a spatial-temporal weight matrix being used to quantify the influence from the neighboring counties. We found that the SD-STARMA model has a higher degree of fit as a result of its implementation of time-space autocorrelation than would be the case with time autocorrelation alone.</p>

  <p>Although the overall trend for HFRS incidence is consistent across every county in Hubei Province, the time series for the different counties is still different because of various impacting factors such as the local environment and human demography. The SD-STARIMA model is able to combine not only historical influences, but also the spatial and temporal impact from neighboring counties to evaluate the tendencies for HFRS incidence for any one specific county.</p>
