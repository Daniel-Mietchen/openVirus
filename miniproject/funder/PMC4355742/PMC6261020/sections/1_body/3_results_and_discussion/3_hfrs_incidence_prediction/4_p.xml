<p>Having arrived at our results, we also compared them, to previous studies relating to HFRS analysis and prediction. Zhang at al., for instance, used a basic Poisson regression method to examine the potential impact of climate variability on the transmission of HFRS [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. They incorporated climatic variables across a range of lags into a basic Poisson regression model that effectively eliminated the lagged effect of the climatic variables on the number of HFRS cases. However, spatial influences and spatial lag for the HFRS data were not considered, potentially overlooking a significant set of influencing factors.
