<p>ARIMA models are able to take into account changing trends, periodic changes, and random disturbances in a time series, so they are very useful for modeling a time seriesâ€™ time dependence structure. In epidemiology, ARIMA models have been successfully applied to predict the incidence of a number of infectious diseases, such as influenza [

 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], to mention but a few [

 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. ARIMA (p,d,q) modeling of time series originated with the work of Box-Jenkins [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The model-building process was designed to take advantage of associations in the sequentially-lagged relationships that usually exist in periodically collected data [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The following were the parameters selected when fitting the ARIMA model: 
 <italic>p</italic>, the order of autoregression; 
 <italic>d</italic>, the integration parameter; and 
 <italic>q</italic>, the order of the moving average. Autocorrelation function (ACF) and Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) graphs were used to identify the order of the moving average (MA) and the autoregressive (AR) terms included in the ARIMA model.
