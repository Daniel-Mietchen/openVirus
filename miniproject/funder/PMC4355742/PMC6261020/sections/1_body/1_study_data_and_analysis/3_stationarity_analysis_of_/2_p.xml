<p>Thus, according to the seasonal characteristics and stationarity analysis of the HFRS outbreaks presented above, the series for HFRS incidence distribution in Hubei Province is temporally unstable. As previously mentioned, a large number of studies have shown that ARIMA models are better able to fit data with a relatively stable time distribution and no strong spatial autocorrelation, but they are not so effective when there is spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the sample data [

 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This was the original reason for the development of Cliff and Ord’s, Spatiotemporal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model [

In that case, there is a need for a new spatiotemporal series model that is capable of analyzing the seasonal characteristics and stationary distribution of the HFRS outbreaks in Hubei to improve the precision of the predictions.
