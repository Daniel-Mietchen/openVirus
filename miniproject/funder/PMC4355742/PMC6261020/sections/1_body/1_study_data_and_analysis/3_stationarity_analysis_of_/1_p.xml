<p>To arrive at a more effective time series analysis, it is necessary to identify the spatial and temporal series of the HFRS case data. Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g003">3</xref> show that the HFRS outbreak incidence in Hubei is clustered and does not meet the requirements of a normal distribution. In order to look for significant correlations in the HFRS outbreak distribution across the time series, an autocorrelation of the HFRS incidence time series data was undertaken using an autocorrelation graph. The autocorrelation graph and partial autocorrelation graph are plotted according to the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation coefficients. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g004">Fig 4(A)</xref>, the abscissa is the number of lags and the ordinate is the ACF (autocorrelation function) value. The two lines in this figure represent the autocorrelation coefficient confidence interval of 95%. If there is no autocorrelation, the distribution pattern should be randomly distributed within the 95% confidence interval, without any fixed pattern and with the ACF values gradually tending to zero as the lag

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g004">Fig 4(A)</xref> that the autocorrelation coefficient 
 <italic>r</italic>

 </sub> does not do this. At the same time, it can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207518.g004">Fig 4(B)</xref> that the partial correlation function value is larger at the 1
