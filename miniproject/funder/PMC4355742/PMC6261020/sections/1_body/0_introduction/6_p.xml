<p>Drawing upon time and space series modeling, the geographer A.D. Cliff and the statistician J.K. Ord, originally proposed in 1974 a space-time series modeling framework [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that is essentially a spatial expansion of the time series model. It combines Spatial Autocorrelation (SAR), a Spatial Moving Average (SMA) and Spatial Regression (SR). A large number of studies had shown that, whilst the ARIMA model provided better fitting results for data with a relatively stable temporal distribution and no strong spatial autocorrelation, its effectiveness for prediction relating to spatiotemporally heterogenous sample data was much weaker [

The STARIMA model provides a space-time autocorrelation function (ST-ACF) and a space-time partial correlation function (ST-PACF) to address the problem of measuring spatiotemporal correlations. It also introduced a spatiotemporal lag operator that makes it capable of simultaneously extrapolating and predicting multiple spatial units [

 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The STARIMA model has also been applied to rainfall and waterlogging process simulation and to short-term forecasting. Here, it offers improved prediction accuracy and reliability when compared to traditional hydro model simulation and prediction [
