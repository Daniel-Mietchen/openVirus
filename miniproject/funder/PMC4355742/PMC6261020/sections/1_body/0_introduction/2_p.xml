<p>Spatial and temporal statistical methods have been used to discover the spatial and temporal distribution and clustering characteristics of HFRS across a number of different locations [

 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In China, a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic has been used to try and identify the clustering of HFRS, drawing upon data spanning the period 1980 to 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A Gaussian GWR model has also been used to try and identify the factors influencing HFRS transmission (such as meteorological factors, rodent density, surface mean elevation, water area and human population density) drawing upon data from Hubei that was collected between 2011 and 2015 [

 <italic>I</italic> index was adopted for a global spatial autocorrelation analysis that sought to identify the overall spatiotemporal pattern of HFRS outbreaks in Hubei between 2005 and 2014, and Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used at the same time to explore the possible factors influencing the epidemics, such as the weather and the area’s geography [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cross-correlation analysis has also been used to assess a possible association with meteorological variables and a time-series Poisson regression model was adopted to examine the independent contribution of meteorological variables to HFRS transmission in both Elunchun and Molidawahaner counties in Northeastern China between 1997 and 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Alongside of this, a generalized additive model with penalized smoothing splines has been used to examine the effect of meteorological factors on the occurrence of HFRS in Jiaonan between 2006 and 2011 [
