<p>Identifying the spatial and temporal distribution of HFRS can help with analyzing and evaluating the trends in HFRS outbreaks, thus leading to the adoption of more effective measures for the prevention and control of the disease. HFRS, however, has a frustrating degree of spatiotemporal heterogeneity and seasonal variation [

So, in order to conduct a better analysis of HFRS distribution and to acquire a more accurate means of prediction, the construction of a space-time model seems to be called for. Space-time modeling refers to the process of finding an analytical method to model and predict the value of an unrecorded space-time position based on given spatiotemporal data [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Space-time modeling is a spatial expansion of time series modelling and the factors influencing the attribute values of unobserved space-time positions bring together the spatial and temporal factors associated with single time series modeling, single spatial modeling and spatiotemporal modeling.
