<p>Time series-based approaches have commonly been used in the past to predict the trends in HFRS epidemics, with ARIMA models standing as prime example. As a result of their capacity to capture both spatial and temporal variation, simulation results based on STARIMA models have been found to be more accurate than the results provided by non-spatial models like ARIMA. However, because there are also seasonal characteristics relating to the HFRS epidemics in Hubei Province, we developed a new model named SD-STARIMA that is able to incorporate adjustments for seasonal differences into space-time series analysis of HFRS outbreaks. We compared the estimates produced by ARIMA, STARIMA and SD-STARIMA for HFRS incidence data for Hubei Province and found that the SD-STARIMA model more closely predicted observed trends.</p>
