<p>In conclusion, our examination of various possible models in this paper demonstrated the importance of analyzing seasonal differences in relation to HFRS epidemics because of the diseaseâ€™s seasonal characteristics. On top of this, we found that first-order differences most closely reflect the stability data and bimodal distribution characteristics of the disease. We then constructed a first-order difference based SD-STARIMA model that is able to make accurate predictions using both space-time autocorrelation coefficients and space-time partial autocorrelation coefficients.</p>
