<p>To validate the proposed approach, we used data relating to three counties that have a higher incidence of HFRS in Hubei Province (Luotian, Zhongxiang and Yicheng). According to the results, the SD-STARIMA model is more accurate than the ARIMA and STARIMA models and is generally much better for counties that are consistent with overall distribution trends. In that case, the SD-STARIMA model proposed in this paper has been proven to be more reliable for predicting HFRS epidemics in Hubei Province and has the potential to be more widely used for the prediction of epidemics.</p>
