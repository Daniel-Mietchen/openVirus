<p>The additional detection of DENV-3 and its relative proportion against DENV-2 in our study makes it a dual or multiple circulation of serotypes. This suggests possibility of concurrent serotype infections within the population. With the documented evidence that concurrent circulation by multiple Dengue serotypes influences clinical expression and accounts for the emergence of Dengue Hemorrhagic fevers (DHFs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], our finding presents a cause for public health concern in a country where hitherto hospital-based clinical and laboratory-based virologic surveillance system for DENV infection is inadequate. Since 1982 when the first case of concurrent infections with 2 DENV serotypes was reported in Puerto Rico [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], there have been documented reports of several concurrent infections in other countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and usually, though not in all cases, concurrent infections occur during epidemics or outbreaks. Our study finding of the co-circulating serotypes which also suggests hyperendemicity but without any apparent clinical or sub-clinical manifestation of DF or DHF may be partly due to the lack of hospital and laboratory-based surveillance at the time. It could also in part be attributed to the events at the time (during the peak of the EVD epidemic in West Africa) when the patients presented to the health facility were paid more attention because of the heightened alert for EVD suspected cases. Nevertheless, an absence of DHF notwithstanding hyperendemic co-circulating DENV transmission was also observed in a study in Haiti [
