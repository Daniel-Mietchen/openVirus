<p>Dengue serotype 2 has been dominant in West Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and this was given credence with the recent outbreaks in Burkina Faso and Senegal [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In an earlier hospital-based study conducted in a peri-urban area in Ghana, we sought to identify pathogens that cause febrile illnesses among children. Of the 700 enrolled, 2 were found to be acutely infected with DENV-2 when viral RNA was detected using molecular tools [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The dominance of Dengue 2 may be attributed to the prevalence of the strain of the transmissible vector in the sub-region. DENV serotypes and strains within the serotypes are known to vary in their ability to infect and disseminate in mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dengue serotype 2 strains have been demonstrated to be better adapted and tend to infect the highly domesticated

 <italic>aegypti</italic> more efficiently [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is thus considered the principal vector for DENV in urban areas whereas the species 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is recognized as an important vector in some rural areas [
