<p>In our study analysis, we performed sequence phylogeny to confirm and establish the serotypes of the positive patient’s samples as documented reports in the sub-region on the circulation of different DENV serotypes are poor. Few publications however provide information on outbreaks and serological surveillance studies and reports that documented DENV infection in travellers. The results confirmed our serotypes as closely related to each other and clustered within DENV serotype 3 and in close homology with sequences from Senegal (KU509282) and India (FJ544564 and KU216208). Nonetheless, DENV-2 has been the main serotype reported to be circulating in West Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] since the case of DENV was detected in Nigeria in 1964 [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the West African countries of Côte d’Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Guinea, DENV-2 was detected from sylvatic cycles [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and more closely in 2005, DENV-2 was identified in a traveller who returned from Ghana [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Despite this, DENV-3 has been detected severally in Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with an instance where analysis suggested the importation of the virus from the Indian sub-continent [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Again, in our neighbouring country Côte d’Ivoire, DENV-3 was documented to have been co-circulating with Yellow fever [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These reports corroborate our finding of DENV-3 circulation in Ghana which has been noted to be consistent with evidence that this serotype is spreading in the sub-region [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
