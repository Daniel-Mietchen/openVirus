<p>The conventional RT-PCR products were sequenced and were assembled using the DNASTARâ€™s Lasergene sequence analysis software with base calling proofread by graphic examination of the electropherograms. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on 511 nucleotides of the capsid (pre-membrane) and the 266 nucleotides of the non-structural protein target genomic regions target genes and the analysis included the amplified samples from the conventional RT-PCR as well as GenBank reference sequences of 34 and 37 respectively (
