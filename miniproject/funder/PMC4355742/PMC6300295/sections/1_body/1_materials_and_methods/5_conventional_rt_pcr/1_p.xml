<p>In all, four conventional RT-PCR assays were performed and, in each test, run a volume of 25 μl with 5 μl nucleic acid extract was used as a template. The reagents, cycle numbers, primer sequences, target regions and amplicon lengths are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The four conventional RT-PCR assays were performed using the Aeris G-96 well PCR system (Esco Micro Pte Ltd, Singapore). The amplification products were electrophoresed on a 2% Agarose gel (peqlab Biotechnologie, Erlangen, Germany), stained with Ethidium bromide, and viewed under UV light.
