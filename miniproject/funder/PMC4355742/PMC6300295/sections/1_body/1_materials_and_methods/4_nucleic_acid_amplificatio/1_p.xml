<p>To amplify the nucleic acid and detect the genomic sequence of interest, several amplification assays were deployed. An initial test run was carried out with a TaqMan-based real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay developed by Johnson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] to detect and type the four DENV serotypes. In a 25μl reaction mixtures with the Applied Biosystems 7300 RT-PCR system (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), volumes each of 5μl of extracted and purified RNA from the clinical sera or plasma were combined with 10 pmol each of Dengue serotype specific primer and probe sets and targets. Each reaction mixture contained a single Dengue serotype primer pair and probe–making four separate reactions for the isolated and purified RNAs for each clinical specimen. The reagent master mix was prepared according to the number of reactions required for each test run using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (#AM1005, Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA). Then a final addition of 5μl of individual RNA to each appropriately labeled well. Included in each test run were ‘no RNA’ or nuclease-free water reagent and Dengue positive RNA control. A presumptive positive for Dengue serotype specific virus was considered for a clinical specimen when the controls met stated requirements and the growth curves crossed the threshold line within 40 cycles with the inverse true for negatively considered clinical specimens for Dengue serotype specific virus.
