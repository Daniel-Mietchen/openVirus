<p>The clinical specimens of sera and plasma used in this study were archived specimens stored at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR). These samples had been collected between 2014 and 2016, during the West African EVD outbreak. Eligible patients were examined by trained health staff and diagnosed on suspicion of EVD illness based on the routine surveillance case definition of the standard WHO case definitions for Ebola and Marburg virus diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During that period, they were tested for EVD and other VHFs including Marburg, Lassa fever, yellow fever and West Nile by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Residual specimens were stored at -80Â°C. Thus, the batch of specimens used in this work had previously been tested for EVD, Marburg, Lassa fever and yellow fever but were yet to be tested for other flaviviruses.
