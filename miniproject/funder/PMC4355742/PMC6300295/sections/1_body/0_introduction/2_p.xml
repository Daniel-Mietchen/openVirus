<p>DF which is considered the most important 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito-borne viral disease to infect humans is caused by one of four closely related serotypes of Dengue virus (DENV) [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The four serotypes, DENV serotypes 1–4, have caused large urban outbreaks, particularly once the co-circulation of different serotypes is observed or when a new serotype is presented [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus within the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is endemic and known as a common illness throughout Southeast Asia and much of the Americas [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A study that used a cartographic approach provided an annual global estimate of 390 million DENV infections of which 67 to 136 million showed at any level of disease severity [
 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this same study 70% of the global estimated infections were predicted to have occurred in Asia and 16% in Africa [
