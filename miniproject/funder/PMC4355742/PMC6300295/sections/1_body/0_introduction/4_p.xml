<p>To establish a definitive diagnosis for these suspected cases of EVD, a testing algorithm that involved investigating for the other known endemic VHFs in the sub-region was adopted. Thus, laboratory investigations were not only performed for Ebola and Marburg but the other endemic hemorrhagic fever viruses including Yellow fever, Lassa fever West Nile and DF. While a definitive viral diagnosis could not be established for the majority of the suspected cases, four were found to be positive for dengue virus with our testing algorithm. The import of this approach was reinforced when analysis of the case investigation forms that accompanied these suspected specimens suggested only 10% met the WHO standard case definition for an EVD [

From the foregoing, we sought to detect viral agents of hemorrhagic fevers likely to be endemic in the country from the suspected clinical specimens submitted for laboratory investigation of EVD. We intend to present the molecular indication of a native Dengue viral infection in Ghana.
