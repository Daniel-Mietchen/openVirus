<p>The widespread epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in three West African countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, between 2013 and 2015 caused significant mortality, with reported case fatality rates of up to 72% [

 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Many West African countries including Ghana that are near to these three most affected countries were deemed at high risk of EVD importation. As a response to the outbreak in these neighboring countries, a national surveillance system was set up in Ghana as part of an EVD preparedness and response plan to detect and rapidly respond to cases and rumors of cases. Clinical specimens of serum/plasma from patients suspected of EVD from health facilities across the country were submitted to the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), which was designated for laboratory investigation of these suspected cases.
