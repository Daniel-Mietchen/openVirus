<p>All 32 patientsâ€™ clinical specimens that were found positive by ELISA for anti-DENV IgM antibodies were analyzed by several PCR assays. Using the TaqMan-based rRT-PCR assay, viral RNA was detected in 4 out of the 32 DENV IgM positive samples. They were characterized as 1 DENV-2 (sample ID 29) and 3 DENV-3 (sample IDs 42, 50 and 73) serotypes. Clear DNA fragments of expected sizes were observed for all but sample 29 when the conventional RT-PCR assays were performed on the 4 positive samples (
