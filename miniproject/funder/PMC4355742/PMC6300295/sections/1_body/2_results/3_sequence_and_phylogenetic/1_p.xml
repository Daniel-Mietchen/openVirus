<p>To determine the genotypes and evolution of the viruses present in the positive patients’ samples, the amplicons from the conventional RT-PCR run were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The parsimony analysis by maximum likelihood method [

 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] included the three amplified patient’s samples (42, 50 and 73), as well as GenBank reference sequences. In both phylogenetic trees, the patient’s samples were closely related to each other and clustered within DENV serotype 3 and in close homology with sequences from Senegal (KU509282) and India (FJ544564 and KU216208) (
