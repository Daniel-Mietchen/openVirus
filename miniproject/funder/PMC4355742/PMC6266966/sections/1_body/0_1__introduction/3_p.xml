<p>The viral particle is spherical and enveloped, consisting of an icosahedral capsid surrounded by a lipid envelope of approximately 60–70 nm in diameter. The genome consists of a single stranded positive sense RNA of approximately 11.8 kb in length, encoding four non-structural proteins: NSP1–4 and 5 structural proteins: C-E3-E2-6K-E1 [
