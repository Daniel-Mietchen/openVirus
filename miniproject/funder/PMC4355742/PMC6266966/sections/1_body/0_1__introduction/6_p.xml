<p>The state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), in the southeast region of Brazil, has been a hotspot for DENV introduction and spread since the 1980s. Oiapoque, in the northern state of Amapá (AP), was the epicenter for the CHIKV epidemic during its first introduction in 2014. From 2015 to 2017, almost 500,000 chikungunya cases were reported in Brazil, 277,882 in 2016 alone [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here, we aimed to investigate chikungunya suspected cases and the possible occurrence of coinfections among three circulating arboviruses from epidemics that occurred in AP (north region) during 2014 and RJ (southeast region) during 2016. We further performed the genotyping and molecular characterization from the partial sequencing of CHIKV representative strains. Considering that mutations such as A226V in the ECSA genotype have not yet been observed in the Brazilian strains, molecular characterization studies can represent an important tool to monitor the dispersion of circulating genotypes and identify possible mutations that facilitate mosquitoes’ transmission.
