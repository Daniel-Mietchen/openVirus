<p>Phylogenetic analysis was possible by the recovery of 375 nucleotides from the partial sequencing of the E1 gene from representative CHIKV strains detected during the epidemics that occurred in RJ (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) during 2016 [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and in AP (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17) during 2014â€“2015 (this study). Reference sequences available from GenBank were used representing the Asian, ECSA, and West African genotypes. After comparative analysis, the results showed that all strains from AP were grouped in the branch of the Asian genotype, while those from RJ clustered in the branch of the ECSA genotype, together with the sequence of a sample identified in Bahia in 2014 (
