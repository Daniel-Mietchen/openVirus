<p>Molecular characterization was also performed and no amino acid differences were observed in the AP strains. Despite this, partial analysis of the E1 fragment of the RJ strains did not demonstrate the A226V mutation, revealing that the amino acid alanine was present in the E226 position. Interestingly, a K211T amino acid substitution was identified in all samples analyzed and a V156A substitution was identified in two samples from this study. It is important to note that the CHIKV sequences identified in BA belonging to the ECSA genotype did not show this substitution at amino acid 211, thus having a lysine (K), which was also observed in the reference sequence from Angola (1962).</p>
