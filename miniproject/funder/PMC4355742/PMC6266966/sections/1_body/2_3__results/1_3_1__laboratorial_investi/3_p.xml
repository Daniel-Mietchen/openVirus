<p>Molecular diagnosis on acute samples confirmed 53.0% (53/100) of the CHIKV suspected cases tested. The qRT-PCR for CHIKV detection confirmed 11.3% (6/53) of the positive cases, whereas the commercial Simplexa™ CHIKV kit confirmed 30.1% (16/53). Positive cases confirmed simultaneously by the two methodologies were 58.5% (31/53). A total of 66.0% (35/53) of the confirmed CHIKV cases were randomly selected and quantified, and viral titers ranged from 1.01 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 9.84 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies of RNA/μL.
