<p>As a differential diagnosis, all suspected CHIKV cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 91) were submitted to serological and/or molecular methodologies for exclusion of dengue and zika. No case was detected by RT-PCR for detection and typing of DENV. The Simplexaâ„¢ dengue kit confirmed 4.3% (4/91) cases as belonging to DENV-4 serotype, being 3/4 (75.0%) acute cases and 1/4 (25.0%) with 10 days of disease. Of those, 1/4 (25.0%) was also detected as DENV-4 by the qRT-PCR established by Johnson et al. (2005). In addition, 26/91 (28.6%) cases were confirmed for ZIKV by the qRT-PCR, with 22/26 (84.6%) acute cases with up to six days of disease, 1/26 (3.8%) with eight days, 1/26 (3.8%) with 13 days, 1/26 (3.8%) with 15 days, and 1/26 (3.8%) with 25 days of disease.
