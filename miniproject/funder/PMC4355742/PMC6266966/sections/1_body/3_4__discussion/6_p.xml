<p>In 2016, until epidemiological week 52, RJ reported 85,200 cases of chikungunya [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the spread of the virus throughout the Brazilian territory, including RJ, was stressed due to the high levels of mosquito vectors infestation throughout the country [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The results from the hospital-based study performed here, most of the cases analyzed were confirmed for CHIKV (70/91; 76.9%) by molecular and/or serological methodologies, with the majority detected by RT-PCR (50/70, 71.4%) in acute samples. Despite this, CHIKV viral RNA was also detected in 18 convalescent samples with more than 10 days of symptoms, and curiously, one of those was collected after 71 days of disease. In humans, the persistence of CHIKV viral RNA in perivascular macrophages of synovial fluid in a chronic patient has been demonstrated for up to 18 months after infection and this may be justified by T cell depletion due to the strong immune response during the acute phase, causing as a consequence the viral persistence [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Further studies are needed to elucidate how and for how long CHIKV persists, as well as its relationship with the patientâ€™s immune system and clinical evolution for chronic arthralgia [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To date, it has been demonstrated that viral persistence is directly associated with immune inefficiency and efficient viral escape [
