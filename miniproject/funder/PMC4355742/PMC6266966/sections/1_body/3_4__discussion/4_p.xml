<p>The commercial kit anti-CHIKV ELISA IgM (Euroimmun) used in this study is recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and has 98.1% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity, according to the manufacturer. The Platelia™ Dengue NS1 Antigen kit is used for the early diagnosis of dengue infections based on NS1 antigen capture, and as a serology test, presents higher sensitivity and specificity considering the IgM and IgG detections. Anti-DENV IgM is detected between three to five days after the onset of infection and IgG, after 10 to 14 days, different from the NS1 antigen which can be detected from 0 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms, with a peak on six to 10 days of infection [
