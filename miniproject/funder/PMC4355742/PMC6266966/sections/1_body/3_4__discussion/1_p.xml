<p>The present study investigated CHIKV suspected cases in Brazil from patients experiencing a febrile illness accompanied by intense polyarthralgia during outbreaks that occurred in the north region (Amapá, AP) in 2014, characterized as the first autochthonous cases, and in the southeast (Rio de Janeiro, RJ) in 2016, after its spread to the southeast region. Due to the epidemiological situation presented and the co-circulation of arboviruses (CHIKV and DENV) in the north region during the period, surveillance studies, such as the one presented here, play a role in understanding CHIKV’s spread in Brazil.</p>
