<p>Nunes et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] observed two separate CHIKV introductions in Brazil and reported the emergence of the Asian and ECSA CHIKV genotypes, with possible different dynamics of the genotypes dispersion across the country. The ECSA genotype was introduced from Angola to Feira de Santana, Bahia (BA) in June of 2014, when it was introduced independently from strains originating in Angola (West Africa). The Asian genotype circulating in the Caribbean and South America was introduced in Oiapoque in early September of 2014, probably imported from French Guiana, a border country. Due to the similarities with DENV transmission, it was suggested that CHIKV would have the same dynamics, with transmission peaks occurring between January and April. Furthermore, it would be expected a prevalence of the Asian genotype in the tropical regions of Brazil, where 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is well established, and the ECSA genotype in subtropical and temperate regions, where 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is more abundant. In the long run, both genotypes could disappear from the region if the population immunity levels increased sufficiently. Alternatively, CHIKV could establish an enzootic cycle in the region with sporadic human epidemics. This pattern has been observed in Africa and potentially in Southeast Asia, where there is some evidence of a transmission cycle of the causal virus involving non-human primates and mosquitoes inhabiting the forest similar to that observed for wild-type yellow fever virus.
