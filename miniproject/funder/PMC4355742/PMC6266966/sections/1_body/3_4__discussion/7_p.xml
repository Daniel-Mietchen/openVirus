<p>All acute phase samples from AP and RJ were quantified by qRT-PCR and the results demonstrated low viral titers, which does not corroborate with the high viremia observed during this infection, which can increase from 10
 <sup>9</sup> to 10
 <sup>12</sup> copies of RNA/mL [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The low viral titer obtained here may be due a test limitation or sensitivity. Although higher, there are no major differences between the high viremia in acute symptomatic patients when compared to the asymptomatic patients [
