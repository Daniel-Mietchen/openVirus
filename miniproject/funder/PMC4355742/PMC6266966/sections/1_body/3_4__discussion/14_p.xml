<p>Despite this, this study revealed a substitution on E1 (K211T) in all samples analyzed and on E1 (V156A) in two samples. The K211T substitution has not yet been identified in the strains from Bahia, which has a Lysine (K), such as the reference sequence from Angola (1962). Other studies are needed to clarify the consequences of those changes in the mosquitoes fitness and in the human immune system, but some publications suggest that new mutations such as L210Q, I211T, and G60D on the E2 gene from the IOL may also offer advantages for CHIKV transmission by
