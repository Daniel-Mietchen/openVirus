 <sup>®</sup>, Camberley, UK) for quantification of CHIKV confirmed cases were used as complementary strategies according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The determination of anti-CHIKV IgM antibodies was performed according to the in-house IgM capture ELISA protocol described by the CDC and the Ministry of Health (2014) and by using the anti-CHIKV ELISA IgM (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The IgM antibody detection using ELISA immunofluorescent assays is a promising and highly reliable approach to be used during the active surveillance of CHIKV as it represents recent and active infections, and may be detectable after 2 days of disease [
