<p>For dengue serological diagnosis, suspected cases were submitted to the Dengue Virus IgM Capture DxSelect™ (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) and Platelia™ Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Molecular detection and DENV serotype identification were performed by conventional RT-PCR as described previously by Lanciotti et al. [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at −70 °C. Aiming to further exclude DENV infection in negative cases, all samples were further tested using the Simplexa™ Dengue Real Time RT-PCR (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, for viral qualitative detection and typing of DENV. Due to the cross-reactivity among flaviviruses in the serological methods, suspected zika cases were tested by the real-time RT-PCR for ZIKV, as described previously by Lanciotti et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All samples were also subjected to a RT-PCR for detection of alphaviruses (Mayaro virus–MAYV) according to de Morais Bronzoni et al. [
