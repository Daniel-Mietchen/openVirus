<p>Chikungunya positive cases by qRT-PCR were randomly selected for partial sequencing (E1 gene) according to the semi-nested protocol described by Reference [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-10-00623" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and phylogenetic analysis. This protocol amplifies approximately 469 nucleotides along the E1 gene, and due to sequence editing losses, we aimed to amplify approximately 375 nucleotides along this region. This fragment allows us to answer the questions about this study, which consists of the genotyping of circulating strains and observation of specific modifications, such as the A226V mutation, which allowed the emergence of the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL). Viral RNA was extracted from serum, plasma or whole blood of CHIKV cases using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The fragments generated were purified using PCR Purification Kit or Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Germany) and sequenced in both directions using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction version 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems
 <sup>®</sup>, Foster City, CA, USA). The thermocycling conditions consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C/10 s), annealing (50 °C/5 s) and extension (60 °C/4 min). Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems
 <sup>®</sup>, California, USA. The sequences analysis was performed using BioEdit (

The data set was constructed with sequences previously deposited on GenBank and representative of each genotype and with sequences identified using BLAST. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA 6 (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.megasoftware.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.megasoftware.net/</uri>), by the “neighbor-joining” method and maximum-likelihood, Kimura-2 parameter model (K2), with a bootstrap of 1000 replications. Both methods were used as confirmation of the results. The trees were built based on the analysis of the best-fit-for model, as provided by the software. Sequences available in GenBank (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/</uri>) were used as reference for the different genotypes of CHIKV (Asian, ECSA and West African),
