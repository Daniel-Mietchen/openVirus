<p>The exponential growth of chikungunya, especially in populated and touristic regions, such as RJ, represents a serious public health problem and the co-circulation of three arboviruses (DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV) as observed here, does impair the laboratory and clinical diagnosis, making it a challenge. Moreover, monitoring the dispersion of CHIKV genotypes and identifying possible mutations that facilitate the viral transmission by mosquitoes vectors is of primary importance, especially in large regions with high vector densities and presence of susceptible individuals such as those observed in Brazil. </p>
