  <p>Phylogenetic analysis based on 375 nucleotides recovered from the E1 gene of CHIKV strains identified in Rio de Janeiro (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10) during 2016 and in Amapa (
   <italic>n</italic> = 17). Neighbor-joining method, Kimura-2-parameter model (K2), bootstrap of 1000 repetitions. The analyzed CHIKV sequences are represented by a black circle. The CHIKV strains were designated as follows: GenBank accession number (or strain name/country/year). ECSA: East-Central-South African genotype.
