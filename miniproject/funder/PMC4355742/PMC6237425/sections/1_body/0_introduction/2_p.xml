<p>Throughout 2014â€“16, two arboviruses, dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) were responsible for large disease outbreaks worldwide. Health systems were disrupted and resources exhausted amidst a huge mobilisation of labour and materials towards controlling the outbreaks. The Dominican Republic was similarly affected. In 2015/early-2016, a major dengue outbreak affected the island resulting in 17,324 cases in 2015 (18.0 per 10,000 population) and 6329 (6.6 per 10,000 population) in 2016. As this outbreak abated, the first cases of Zika were detected. Then by week 52 of 2016, 5,235 Zika patients (5.5 per 10,000 population), 22 cases of infant microcephaly and 600 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) had been reported.</p>
