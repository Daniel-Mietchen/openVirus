<p>The national age and sex distribution of Zika and dengue cases can be observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006876.g004">Fig 4</xref>. As a percentage, dengue infections were higher among men than women: 54.5% (95% Credible Interval (CI) 53.9%, 55.2%) vs. 45.5% (95% CI 44.7%, 46.0%) respectively. By comparison, Zika infection was markedly lower among men than women: 26.2% (95% CI 24.9%, 27.3%) vs. 73.8% (95% CI 72.6%, 75.0%) respectively. Pearsonâ€™s chi-squared test for independence was significant at p&lt;0.0001 (unadjusted odds of dengue infection: 0.0026 vs. 0.0022, X
 <sup>2</sup> = 198.79, p&lt;0.0001 in males and females respectively; unadjusted odds of Zika infection: 0.00027 vs. 0.00077, X
 <sup>2</sup> = 1200.00, p&lt;0.0001 in males and females respectively). Crude and age-adjusted, sex stratified national attack rates can be observed in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> below. Age-adjusted attack rates of dengue in males was 25.9 per 10,000 population vs. 21.5 per 10,000 population in females, while age-adjusted attack rates of Zika infection were 2.7 per 10,000 population in males vs. 7.6 per 10,000 population in females.
