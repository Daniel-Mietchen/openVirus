<p>Datasets were analysed to describe Zika, dengue and GBS nationally. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006876.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows a time-series plot of national suspected (WHO case definition) clinical infections of dengue, Zika and GBS by date of symptom onset. While dengue and Zika peaks are distinct, they are not independent in time. GBS incidence occurs simultaneously with the onset of Zika.
