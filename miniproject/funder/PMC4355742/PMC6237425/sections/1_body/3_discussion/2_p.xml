<p>That 75% of reported dengue infections occurred before the age of 20 is not unexpected, given the immune-na√Øve status of younger age groups in a country where dengue is endemic. It is equally unsurprising that a newly introduced virus, such as Zika, resulted in a much broader demographic of incident cases, due to a completely susceptible human population. Yet by contrast, when analyses were stratified by age, adjusted Zika attack rates were higher among 20-50yrs. This is likely due to a number of direct and indirect factors, namely: 1) higher mobility among younger demographics, leading to increased exposure to infected
