<p>The R0 is used widely to establish the strength or intensity of a given outbreak, where &gt;1 results in continuing spread and &lt;1 results in suppression of disease transmission. However any model estimations can change based on the parameterisation of the model used [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and can be limited by surveillance bias, in this case, possible sex-specific over-reporting. Data are likely further confounded by reporting biases, including a large ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as well as likely under-reporting among specific demographics, such as the MSM (men-who-have-sex-with-men) community [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed these limitations are borne out by the data presented in this article, where although R0 was significantly higher in women thereby reflecting the incident risk calculations, there remained a consistent inexplicable artefact for ages 20-30yrs, which showed lower strength of transmission relative to baseline (albeit statistically insignificant among females). This is likely due to spatio-temporal effects within this highly mobile age group. Additionally, these crude estimates were not adjusted for age/sex distributions, although still they largely reflected sex-specific incident rates: R0 was significantly higher in all age groups of increasing mobility and reproductive age, relative to 0-10yrs. Together, the R0 trend suggests faster Zika transmission among highly mobile, sexually active females but as previously noted, this is likely due to health-seeking behaviour. Considering this, the headline Zika R0 of 1.80 and associated sex/age specific attack rates should be taken with caution while the overuse of the R0, particularly when attempting to establish trends across age and sex, should be discouraged.
