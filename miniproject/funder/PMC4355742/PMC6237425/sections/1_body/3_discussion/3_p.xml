<p>Recent literature has documented cross-reactivity between dengue and Zika antibodies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In light of this, one might expect to observe a difference, in either direction, in the Zika incident rate in adults compared to infants and children, as much of the adult population in Dominican Republic is already dengue seropositive. This assumption is built on data indicating that prior dengue infection leads to both antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Zika symptoms, as well as possible protective effects, such as the shortening of the Zika viraemic period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. And yet incident rates in this dataset are broadly similar between the susceptible and na√Øve demographics: Zika attack rates among males and females between 50-60yrs (and males between 40-50yrs) were similar to infants and children. This suggests that while cross-reactivity occurs at the molecular level, this might not be sufficient to prevent or enhance symptomatic Zika disease at the population level [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While disease severity was not an outcome of this study, cross-reactivity may be either limiting or indeed accelerating associated Zika morbidity or mortality among dengue-seropositive populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but as yet remains an outstanding knowledge gap. Also, it is not known whether congenital antibodies confer protection against microcephaly [
