<p>National surveillance data, especially the use of suspected cases, will be subject to some misclassification of disease (Zika as dengue) during the early stages of the outbreak. Categorisation by age will have resulted in the presence of residual confounding that may marginally influence the results. R0 calculations assumed that the human population was na√Øve to both Zika and dengue, which may have resulted in a negative bias if existing herd immunity to either infection was high. Additionally, results between ages 70-80yrs remain unreliable due to large credible intervals while R0 calculations for 80+yrs could not be completed due to paucity of data. Notably, it was not possible to remove pregnant women from the dataset to control for media campaigns targeting this demographic. Finally, the R0 artefact within the 20-30yr-age band remains inexplicable.</p>
