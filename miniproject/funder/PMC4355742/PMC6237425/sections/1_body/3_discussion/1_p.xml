<p>During the time period July 2015â€”July 2016, Dominican Republic experienced two large flavivirus outbreaks as part of a continuing worldwide trend for increasing dengue and Zika incidence. This was followed by the onset of Zika-associated neurological and developmental conditions, known as Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly. A retrospective analysis of the available data described the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreaks on a national level, stratified by age and sex, along with relevant adjustments for population structure, accompanied by crude R0 estimates to better describe the strength of transmission in the population.</p>
