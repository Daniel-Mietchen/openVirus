 <p>Virus infection induces a wide range of host defense responses, such as the innate immune response and inflammation. Some viruses express accessory proteins to induce general shutoff of host protein synthesis, which is one of the major viral strategies to counteract host antiviral activity and immune response. Influenza A virus expresses two proteins, NS1 and PA-X, to induce general shutoff. Their mechanism of action is different; NS1 interacts with CPSF30 and blocks the 3â€™end processing of host pre-mRNAs, while PA-X degrades target mRNAs through its endonuclease domain. Importantly, the NS1 and PA-X activities differ among the virus isolates, suggesting a functional interplay between these two proteins. In this study, we rescued and characterized 2009 pandemic H1N1 mutant viruses with various NS1 and PA-X shutoff activities. Our data showed that PA-X was the major contributor of general shutoff of host protein synthesis, while NS1 specifically targeted genes involved in host innate response and cytokine response. Our data also suggest that viral mRNAs, especially the NS gene can be the target of PA-X induced degradation if NS1 shutoff activity is active. This study indicates a functional interplay between NS1 and PA-X proteins, which is required for optimum viral growth.</p>
