<p>PA-X is a novel influenza virus shutoff protein expressed from PA mRNA as a result of ribosomal frameshifting [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although a limited amount of PA-X is expressed in infected cells due to low frameshift efficiency [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], PA-X significantly impacts general host shutoff and suppresses host antiviral and immune responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Importantly, PA-X shutoff activity is stronger than NS1 in the context of plasmid transfection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PA-X contains the initial 191 amino acids of the PA protein and the unique C-terminal 41 or 61 amino acids, depending on the virus strains [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We and others demonstrated that the endonuclease active site, residing in the N-terminal domain of PA-X, is responsible for cellular mRNA degradation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our previous study showed that PA-X localized and degraded host mRNAs both in the nucleus and cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We and others also found that the unique C-terminal region is crucial for high shutoff activity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A recent study also suggests that PA-X selectively degrades RNA polymerase II-transcribed host mRNAs in the nucleus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the exact molecular mechanism of PA-X mediated shutoff activity remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the expression of PA-X is highly conserved, but its shutoff activity varies between the strains. Human viruses seem to have reduced PA-X shutoff activity than avian viruses due to mutations in the N-terminal domain [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Importantly, the 2009 pH1N1 viruses express highly active PA-X, but their NS1 proteins lack shutoff activity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the variation of NS1 and PA-X activities between the viruses could promote the optimum viral growth in their specific hosts.
