<p>In this study, we investigated the effect of influenza PA-X and NS1 proteins on viral growth efficiency and suppression of host mRNAs in the context of virus infection. We generated recombinant influenza A viruses (A/California/04/2009) containing mutations in PA and NS genes. The viruses express shutoff-active or inactive forms of NS1 with a normal or reduced amount of PA-X expression. Using these viruses, we determined i) the impact of PA-X and NS1 shutoff activities on host protein synthesis, ii) the specificity of target host transcripts, iii) regulation of host innate immune responses, and iv) the effect of shutoff activities on viral mRNA expression. Our data indicated that i) PA-X suppressed host protein synthesis more efficiently than NS1, ii) shutoff-active NS1 specifically targeted genes involved in innate signaling and cytokine release, while target transcripts of PA-X were less specific, but showed some preference for genes involved in cellular protein metabolism and protein repair, and iii) in the presence of both active NS1 and PA-X, expression of viral transcripts, especially NS1 and NEP mRNAs, were substantially reduced. Our results suggest that influenza viruses regulate their PA-X and NS1 shutoff activities to create an optimum environment for efficient growth and spread in a specific host.</p>
