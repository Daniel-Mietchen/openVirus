<p>Influenza A virus is a major respiratory pathogen that frequently causes seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics, resulting in half-a million deaths worldwide each year [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Like many other viruses, the influenza virus relies on the host cellular machinery to facilitate its replication cycle. However, host cells recognize and respond to viral infection through inducing various anti-viral proteins and interferons (IFNs). To overcome the host defense system, many viruses express proteins to evade the innate immune response or target general host protein synthesis. General shutoff targeting host mRNAs limits competition from cellular transcripts and secures priority access of viral mRNAs to host translation machinery [
