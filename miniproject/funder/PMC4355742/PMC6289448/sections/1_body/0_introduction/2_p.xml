<p>Influenza A virus expresses two viral proteins, NS1 and PA-X, to induce host shutoff. The NS1 is a multifunctional protein best known for its role in antagonizing IFN responses by blocking RIG-I activation and preventing nuclear localization of transcription factors [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. NS1 of human viruses also suppresses host protein synthesis by preventing maturation of host transcripts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Influenza NS1 has been shown to bind the 30-kDa subunit of CPSF (CPSF30), a component of CPSF complex involved in the cleavage of the 3' signaling region of newly synthesized pre-mRNA [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A crystal structure of a complex composed of the NS1 effector domain (ED) and F2F3 fragment of CPSF30 indicates that two NS1 molecules and two CPSF30 are components of this complex, and NS1 residues F103, M106, K108, D125, and D189 play a critical role for CPSF30 interaction [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These key NS1 residues are highly conserved among human isolates, although they are less conserved among animal isolates. For example, the pathogenic H5N1 influenza A/Hong Kong/483/97 (HK97) virus isolated from humans as well as a mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) do not bind CPSF30 due to mutations at residues 103 and 106, and are not able to induce general shutoff [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The NS1 of 2009 pandemic influenza viruses (pH1N1), including A/California/04/2009 (Cal) lack the ability to bind to CPSF30 due to mutations in the consensus CPSF30 binding residues (K108R, D125E and D189G), and therefore are unable to induce general shutoff [
