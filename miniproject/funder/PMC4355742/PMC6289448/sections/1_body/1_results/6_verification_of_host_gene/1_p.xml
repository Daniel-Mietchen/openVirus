<p>We next verified the expression levels of IFN-λ1, IFN-β1, and IL-6 mRNAs in infected cells by qRT-PCR. Total RNAs extracted from infected A549 cells were prepared at 16 h pi, and quantities of IFN-λ1, IFN-β1 and IL-6 mRNAs were measured. We observed a similar trend with RNA-Seq data that the Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] virus most effectively suppressed the expression of the IFN-λ1, IFN-β1 and IL-6 mRNAs (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Our finding indicates a significant role of shutoff-active NS1 in suppression of key host genes involved in innate and adaptive immune responses. However, this effect of shutoff-active NS1 was lessened by PA-X. Hence, it is conceivable that a functional interplay between PA-X and NS1 is required for the optimum regulation of host antiviral responses.
