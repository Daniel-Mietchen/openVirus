<p>To identify the mRNAs preferentially targeted by PA-X, we directly compared the downregulated genes between each pair of viruses whose difference was only in their PA-X shutoff activity. We identified 55 and 127 transcripts, which are uniquely suppressed at least two-fold by PA-X in the absence or presence of shutoff-active NS1, respectively (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Twenty-six genes were common between the two gene sets (

GO term analysis of these 156 genes demonstrated enrichment in cellular protein modification process, cellular protein metabolism, and protein repair, suggesting that PA-X preferentially targets mRNA related to these pathways (

The preferential targeting of mRNAs involved in cellular protein metabolism revealed by the GO term analysis may suggest an additional strategy of viruses possessing high PA-X activity to induce stronger inhibition of host protein synthesis (
