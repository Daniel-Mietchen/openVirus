<p>Next, we compared the differentially expressed genes between each pair of viruses whose difference was only in their NS1 shutoff activity. We identified 288 genes by comparing Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] to Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], and 282 genes by comparing Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] to Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]. There were 77 common genes between these two gene sets, and a total of 493 genes specifically downregulated by shutoff-active NS1, majority of which are genes induced by viral infection (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Strikingly, Gene ontology (GO) term analysis using Enrichr GO Biological Process 2017b database of these 493 genes indicated that the type I IFN signaling pathway, response to exogenous dsRNA, inflammatory response, and chemokine/cytokine-mediated signaling pathways were the primary biological pathways affected by infection with viruses possessing shutoff-active NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s006">S2 Table</xref>). We then compared the expression profiles of these 493 genes by constructing a heat map. Hierarchical clustering was performed to identify four different groups in which the differentially expressed genes belong to (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1 Table</xref>). GO term analysis for genes in each cluster indicated difference in their specificity. Cluster 1 (contains 115 genes) were enriched with genes associated with the inflammatory response and the chemokine-mediated signaling pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Cluster 2 contained 151 genes that were expressed less in cells infected with all the mutant viruses compared to wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] virus. However, genes in this cluster showed no significant association with any particular pathway (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Cluster 3 contained 104 genes that were expressed less in Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] infected cells than those in Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] and Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] infected cells. These genes included those associated with response to exogenous dsRNA, type I IFN signaling pathway and positive regulation of transcription (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Lastly, cluster 4 contained 123 genes whose expression levels were uniquely reduced by infection with Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] relative to infection with Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] and Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] viruses. These genes were associated with the type I IFN signaling pathway, antiviral genes, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, regulation of NF-κB signaling, apoptotic process, and inflammatory response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Collectively, this data suggest that three mutations in NS1 (R108K, E125D, G189D) which activate shutoff activity through CPSF30 binding also increased the virus’s ability to specifically suppress induction of genes involved in signaling pathways of the host innate immune response. The data of cluster 4, which showed reduced expression of host genes after infection with Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] compared to Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], also suggest that PA-X may interfere with NS1’s activity to specifically suppress genes involved in type I IFN signaling pathway (
