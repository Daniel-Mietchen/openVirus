<p>The RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR data clearly indicate that the shutoff-active NS1 more specifically and effectively targets and suppresses innate immune responses than shutoff-inactive NS1. The specificity of NS1â€™s target mRNAs cannot be entirely explained by the activity of NS1 in inhibiting general pre-mRNA processing through its CPSF30 interaction. It is also possible that the three mutations introduced to NS gene (R108K, E125D, G189D) affect other functions of NS1 beyond its ability to interact with CPSF30. NS1 is well characterized for its inhibitory activity on innate signaling through its interaction with TRIM25, which ubiquitinate the RIG-I CARD domain [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To determine if NS1 binding to CPSF30 affect the innate signaling pathway, we first analyzed the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 by co-immunoprecipitation assay from the lysates of infected cells. Our data indicate that TRIM25 was co-immunoprecipitated with NS1 regardless of the mutation (

We next determined activation and phosphorylation of IRF-3 at early time points after infection. In contrast to Sendai virus Cantel strain that is known to be a strong inducer of innate response [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These results indicate that both wild-type and mutant NS1 are capable of blocking IRF3 activation in infected cells. Therefore, the specific suppression of innate gene expression through NS1 mutation detected in transcriptomic analysis likely reflect downstream effect of NS1-CPSF30 complex possibly during transcription of the innate genes.
