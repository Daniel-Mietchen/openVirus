<p>We verified the gene expression of NS1 and HA mRNAs in infected A549 cells by qRT-PCR at various times after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Comparison of the effect of PA-X on NS1 and HA mRNA levels (Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] vs. Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] vs. Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] viruses) indicates that PA-X also reduced the expression of viral mRNAs especially at later time points when more PA-X are accumulated in the cells. Consistent with the RNA-Seq data, the lowest NS1 mRNA levels were detected in Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high]-infected cells by qRT-PCR. Therefore, in the presence of shutoff-active NS1, PA-X likely contributed to a reduction of NS1 mRNA. To determine if this reduced NS1 mRNA is common to NS gene, we also determined the level of NS vRNAs in infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Interestingly, NS vRNA levels were also the lowest in Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high]-infected cells, suggesting the possibilities that PA-X also reduced replication of NS RNAs or targeted NS RNAs in the presence of shutoff-active NS1. To investigate the effect of NS1 and PA-X on viral gene expression in different host species, viral vRNA and mRNA levels were also measured in chicken DF-1 cells and demonstrated a similar trend (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). As expected from qRT-PCR data, expression of NS1 was significantly reduced only in cells infected with Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high]. To determine the effect of NS1 and PA-X expression on viral growth in human airway cells, we infected Calu-3 cells with the viruses at an MOI of 0.1 and measured the virus growth at various time points. As we previously reported, reduced expression of PA-X attenuated growth and spread of wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">Fig 9D</xref> left) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there was a trend towards enhanced growth and spread by reduced PA-X expression in the presence of shutoff active NS1, although statistical analysis showed no significance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">Fig 9D</xref> right). These results suggest that although PA-X enhances growth and spread of the virus lacking the NS1 shutoff activity, it negatively impact on the growth of viruses expressing shutoff active NS1, possibly due to the restricted expression of NS1 that specifically target and regulate host innate responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Collectively, our findings indicate that NS1 shutoff activity plays a critical role in blocking antiviral responses in human hosts. However, the shutoff activity of NS1 can be less efficient due to suppression of NS mRNAs by PA-X shutoff activity. Overall, our data suggest that influenza viruses need to adjust their NS1 and PA-X activities to achieve maximum effect on counteracting host responses.
