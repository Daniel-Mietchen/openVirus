<p>The transcriptome data suggest that Cal NS1 mutations at the CPSF30 binding residues (R108K, E125D, G189D) enhance specific suppression of host innate and cytokine responses. However, PA-X negatively affected NS1’s activity in regulating host responses (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g006">6</xref>). We speculated that PA-X possibly reduced NS1 expression, thereby interfering with NS1’s shutoff activity. PA-X was reported to specifically target host RNA pol II transcripts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the effect of PA-X on expression of viral mRNAs has not been determined. Therefore, we further analyzed the RNA-Seq data for the expression of viral mRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Our data indicate that PA-X and NS1 mutant viruses had differential effects on expression of each viral mRNA segment. Further analyses on the effect of shutoff-active NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) and PA-X (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) on expression of each viral mRNA segment were demonstrated. Intriguingly, the Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] virus, which expressed normal amount of PA-X with shutoff-active NS1, demonstrated drastically low expression of NS1 and NEP mRNAs compared to other viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). This reduction of NS mRNAs were not observed in cells infected with Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] or Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] viruses, indicating that both shutoff-active NS1 and PA-X are required for an extensive reduction of NS mRNA expression.
