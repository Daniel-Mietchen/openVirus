<p>Both influenza NS1 and PA-X proteins are known contributors of host shutoff, although their mechanism of action is different. To analyze the functional interplay between PA-X and NS1, we generated viruses with various shutoff activities by mutating the PA-X and NS1 genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The pH1N1 strain we used (A/California/04/2009) expresses highly active PA-X, but shutoff-inactive NS1 (referred to as wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high]). To reduce expression of PA-X, we inserted mutations in the frameshift motif of Cal PA (referred to as Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]), which we previously confirmed to significantly reduce PA-X expression in infected cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Two mutant viruses, Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] (expresses shutoff-active NS1) and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] (expresses shutoff-active NS1 with limited amount of PA-X) were successfully rescued. These viruses were plaque-cloned in MDCK cells, and their PA and NS gene sequences were confirmed to have the designed mutations. Together with the Cal wild-type (Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high]) and Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] (reduced PA-X expression) we previously rescued [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we analyzed the effect of the viral shutoff activities on host response and virus growth.
