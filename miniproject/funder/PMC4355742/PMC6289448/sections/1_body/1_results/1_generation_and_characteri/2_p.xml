<p>First, we determined multi-step growth kinetics of the viruses at various time points (2, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post infection (pi)) in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. While Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] virus grew better than other viruses at 12 h pi, all recombinant viruses reached the plateau phase at approximately the same time point after infection with the equivalent virus titer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We also determined the production of infectious virions from infected human lung epithelial A549 and chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells. Similar to what was observed in MDCK cells, infected A549 cells yielded more virion production of Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] than other viruses although there was no statistically significant difference (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Next, we determined the effect of the mutations on cellular protein synthesis in infected A549 cells and DF-1 cells. The host proteins were metabolically labeled with 
 <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys for 30 min at 16 h pi. Viruses expressing normal level of PA-X (Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high]) efficiently suppressed host protein synthesis in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Levels of newly synthesized host proteins detected by metabolic labeling also correlated with cellular Î²-actin mRNA levels as determined by qRT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), which demonstrated less actin mRNA levels in Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] or Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] infected A549 cells. Interestingly, viruses expressing mutant NS1 induced stronger general host shutoff in DF-1, but not in A549 cells (Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] compared to Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] or Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] compared to Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]). These results indicate that PA-X has stronger impact than NS1 in inducing general protein expression in human A549 cells, while NS1 also contributes to general shutoff in avian DF-1 cells.
