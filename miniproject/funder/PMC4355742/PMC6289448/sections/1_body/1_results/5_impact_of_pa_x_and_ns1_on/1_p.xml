<p>We next compared the induction of key genes known to be involved in innate response upon influenza virus infection. We selected the representative genes of innate signaling, IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and determined their induction upon infection. The expression of RIG-I signaling or antiviral response-related genes, such as DDX58 (RIG-I dsRNA sensing), IFIH1 (MDA-5 dsRNA sensing), IRF-7 (IFN regulatory factor 7; activates both IFN-α and IFN-β), UBA7 (ubiquitin activating enzyme that catalyzes ISGylation of targeted proteins), and HERC5 (ubiquitin protein ligase that mediates ISGylation of targeted proteins) were significantly elevated after infection by all recombinant influenza Cal viruses (

Comparison between Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] and Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] suggest that PA-X contributes to the suppression of IFN-β and IFN-λ induction. However, induction of IFN genes or genes associated with the innate signaling pathway was most effectively suppressed by Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low], which has shutoff-active NS1 but reduced PA-X expression (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We determined the induction of the ISGs upon infection with the viruses. Among the selected ISGs, Mx1, Mx2, OAS2, OASL, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, TRIM22, and ISG15 were highly up-regulated (130 to 1,300-fold change upon infection with wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] virus), most of which are known to inhibit influenza virus infection and/or replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). PA-X barely impacted the gene expression of the ISGs that were strongly induced upon influenza virus infection (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s007">S3 Table</xref>). Little difference in gene level was observed between Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] and Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] virus-infected samples. Remarkably, Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low], again most effectively suppressed the ISG induction in infected cells, while Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], which express both shutoff-active NS1 and PA-X, was less efficient, indicating the negative impact of PA-X on NS1-induced suppression of ISG induction (
