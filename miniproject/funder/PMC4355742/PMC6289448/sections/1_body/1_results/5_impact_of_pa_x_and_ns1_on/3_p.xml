<p>Apart from host components involved in inflammatory and IFN-signaling pathways, MHC molecules are the crucial components of the immune system, as they link the innate and adaptive immune systems [

In response to virus infection, MHC class I molecules are responsible for presenting peptides derived from intracellular viral antigens to cytotoxic T cells. The MHC or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I heterodimer is assembled from a polymorphic heavy chain (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-E, HLA-F, and HLA-G) and a light chain called β2-microglobulin (β2m) [

Among the selected MHC class I genes, HLA-B was highly up-regulated (40-fold change upon infection with wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] virus) and its expression level was lower in Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] virus compared to other virus-infected conditions (
