<p>In response to viral infection, lung epithelial cells and leukocytes produce chemokines and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which function in cell signaling to limit infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is well established that regulation of cytokine and chemokine production plays a major role in viral pathogenicity and immune response [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, antigen presentation by MHC class I proteins contribute to the clearance of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, we compared the differential expression of representative interleukin, chemokine, and MHC class I genes, which were significantly up-regulated upon infection. Among the selected interleukin genes, IL-6, which functions in acute inflammation and B-cell maturation, was highly up-regulated (40-fold change upon infection with wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] virus). However, the Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] virus induced only a four-fold change of IL-6 mRNA (

Among the selected chemokine genes, CCL5 (RANTES; chemoattractant for monocytes, memory T-helper cells, and eosinophils), CXCL10 (IP-10; chemoattractant for monocytes and T cells), and CXCL11 (IP-9; chemoattractant for interleukin-activated T cells) were highly up-regulated (60 to 90-fold change upon infection with wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] virus) (
