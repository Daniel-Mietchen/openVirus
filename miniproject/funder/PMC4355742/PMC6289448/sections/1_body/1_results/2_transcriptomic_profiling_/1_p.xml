<p>Although both influenza NS1 and PA-X proteins confer general suppression of host protein synthesis, they employ dissimilar mechanisms to reduce host gene expression, suggesting that their target mRNAs could be different [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, we determine the preferential cellular mRNA targets of NS1 and PA-X by comparing the mRNA expression profile of human A549 cells left uninfected (mock) or infected with the various recombinant viruses for 16 h. First, we validated the RNA samples used for the RNA-Seq experiment. Processing statistics for transcriptomic analysis show mapped sequence reads of each sample ranging from 77–99% with the uniquely mapped sequence reads ranging from 67–90% (

Sample-to-sample distance matrix showed a high degree of similarity between the three replicates of each condition and some degree of similarity among all virus-infected conditions, but was highly distinct from mock samples (

Principal component analysis was performed to visualize the overall effect of experimental covariates and batch effects. The sample groups were separated following the PC1 and PC2 axes, indicating different gene expression profiles between mock and infected conditions and also between the four different virus-infected conditions. Among the four viruses, Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] gene expression profiles were the most closely related (
