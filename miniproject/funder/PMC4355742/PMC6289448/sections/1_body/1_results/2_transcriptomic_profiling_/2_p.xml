<p>In our RNA-Seq analysis, 34,677 annotated genes showed non-zero total read count. Volcano plots were created to graphically display the significance and magnitude of changes in the data points between each pair of viruses to mock. The majority of differentially expressed genes were up-regulated upon infection (red dots), while down-regulated genes (green dots) were present to the lesser extent in all virus-infected conditions compared to mock (

Differential gene expression analysis of these 34,677 genes indicated that the number of genes significantly up-regulated (adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05) at least two-fold in 16 h pi-virus infected cells compared to mock were 1,450 (4.18%), 1,218 (3.51%), 945 (2.73%), and 780 (2.25%) for Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low], Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low], respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Among these, 503 genes were commonly up-regulated upon infection with the viruses, while other genes were specifically up-regulated in certain virus infected conditions (

Similarly, a number of genes were significantly down-regulated (adjusted P-value &lt; 0.05) at least two-fold in virus infected cells compared to mock: 465 (1.34%), 372 (1.07%), 224 (0.65%), and 142 (0.41%) for Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low], Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low], respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Among these, 53 genes were commonly down-regulated upon infection with any recombinant viruses (
