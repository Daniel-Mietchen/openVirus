<p>Next, we directly compared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cells infected with recombinant viruses to pinpoint the outcome of PA-X and active NS1 on host gene expression (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). PA-X reduced the expression of 55 (Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] vs. Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]) and 127 (Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] vs. Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low]) genes at least two-fold, but also increased the expression of 211 (Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] vs. Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]) and 137 (Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] vs. Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low]) genes, suggesting that PA-X also increases expression of certain host genes. Interestingly, while expression of mutant NS1 that can induce general shutoff insignificantly, increased the numbers of at least two-fold-upregulated genes (eight DEGs for Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] vs. Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] and 17 DEGs for Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] vs. Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]), it markedly increased the numbers of at least two-fold-downregulated genes in infected cells regardless of PA-X expression (288 DEGs for Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] vs. Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] and 282 DEGs for Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] vs. Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]) (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that the target genes of PA-X, but not shutoff-active NS1 increase the expression of some other host transcripts.
