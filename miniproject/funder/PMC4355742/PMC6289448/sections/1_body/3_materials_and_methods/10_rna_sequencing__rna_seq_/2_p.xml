<p>Sequence reads were cleaned and adapter trimmed using trimmomatic-0.36. The reads quality were checked by FastQC before mapping them to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p7, primary assembly + gencode 25 annotation) or the influenza reference genome (Influenza A/ California/04/2009 (H1N1); Accession: PRJNA363070) with STAR2.5.2b. Raw read counts were obtained using featurecounts from the subread 1.5.0p3 package and gencode 25 human gene annotations using only uniquely aligned reads. DESeq2-1.16.1 was used to perform differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis. DESeq2 performs an internal normalization where read counts for every gene in each sample were divided by geometric mean. The median of the normalization ratio is the size factor for that sample. This procedure corrects for library size and RNA composition bias. Differentially expressed genes were further defined as those genes that have absolute fold change value &gt;2.0 with an adjusted P-value threshold of 0.05.</p>
