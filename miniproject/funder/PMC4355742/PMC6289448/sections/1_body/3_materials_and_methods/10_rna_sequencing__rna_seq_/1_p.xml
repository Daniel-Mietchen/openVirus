<p>Confluent A549 cells in a 12-well plate were either left uninfected or infected with the viruses at an MOI of 2 for 16 h in triplicates. Total RNAs were extracted using Illustra RNAspin Mini (GE Healthcare). RNA concentration and quality were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, showing that RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values of &gt; 7.0, OD260/280 = 2.0–2.2 and 28S: 18S rRNA &gt; 1.0. mRNA was purified from 200 ng total RNA with oligo-dT magnetic beads and fragmented. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with random hexamer priming followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. End repair and 3’ adenylation was then performed on the double-stranded cDNA. Illumina adaptors were ligated to both ends of the cDNA, purified by gel electrophoresis, and amplified with PCR primers specific for the adaptor sequences to generate amplicons of approximately 200–500 bp in size. The amplified libraries were hybridized to the Illumina single-end flow cell and amplified using the cBot (Illumina) at a concentration of 8 pM per lane. Single-end reads of 100 nt were generated for each sample and aligned to the organism-specific reference genome. RNA-sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer.</p>
