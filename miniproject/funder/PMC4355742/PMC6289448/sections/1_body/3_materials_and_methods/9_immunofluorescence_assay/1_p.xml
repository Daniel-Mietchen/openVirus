<p>A549 cells infected with the viruses at MOI of 5 for 6 h were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with methahol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min. Cells were reacted with mouse anti-IRF3 mAb (1:1,000, eBioscience) followed by anti-mouse IgG conjugated with AlexaFluor 594 (1:1,000, Invitrogen). Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Images were obtained using an Olympus IX50 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 60x oil immersion objective.</p>
