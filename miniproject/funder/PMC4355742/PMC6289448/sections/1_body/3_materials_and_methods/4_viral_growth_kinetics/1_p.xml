<p>Multi-step growth kinetics of the viruses was analyzed in MDCK and Calu-3 cells. In brief, confluent cells were infected with the viruses at an MOI of 0.05 (MDCK) or 0.1 (Calu-3) for 1 h and cultured in DMEM containing 0.15% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (2 Î¼g/ml) for MDCK cells or without trypsin for Calu-3 cells. At various h pi, 10% of the cultured supernatant was collected and titrated in MDCK cells. Viral titers were expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>)/ml. A single step growth of the viruses was determined in A549 and DF-1 cells. Confluent cells were infected with the viruses at MOI of 2 for 1 h. After washing, infected cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.15% BSA without trypsin. Culture supernatants were collected at 2 and 18 h pi, and virus titers were titrated in MDCK cells.
