<p>Confluent human A549 and chicken DF-1 cells in a 24-well plate were either left uninfected or infected with the viruses at an MOI of 2 (A549) or MOI of 1 (DF-1) for 1 h and incubated in DMEM containing 0.15% BSA. At various times after infection, cells were washed and cultured in methionine, cysteine-free DMEM media (Gibco) for 30 min. Then, cells were labeled with 
 <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys (25 μCi, PerkinElmer) in the same medium for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were lysed with 50 ul of NP-40 lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, and 5% glycerol), and 15 ul of the radiolabeled lysates were resolved in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were exposed on a phosphor screen and visualized using Personal Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Volume analysis was performed using Quantity One 1-D analysis software (Bio-Rad).
