<p>Our data evidently indicate that PA-X has a strong impact on host gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Specifically, infection with influenza viruses possessing highly active PA-X shutoff activity, regardless of shutoff activity from NS1, results in a rapid decline in host protein synthesis in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This result is consistent with the observation that PA-X expressed from cDNA suppressed reporter gene expression more efficiently than shutoff-active NS1 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and it induces host shutoff in broad species [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast, the CPSF30 binding residues of NS1, which are crucial for inducing host shutoff, are less conserved among animal isolates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The biological and evolutionary reasons why the influenza viruses maintain PA-X expression and its shutoff activity while having differential NS1 shutoff activities across the strains are not actually known. Expression of highly active PA-X and shutoff-active NS1 exhibits the strongest host shutoff activity in avian DF-1 cells; however, we speculated that this condition might not be optimum for avian or animal virus growth within their hosts due to their dependence on host machinery.
