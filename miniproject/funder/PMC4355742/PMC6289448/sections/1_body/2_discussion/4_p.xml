<p>The NS1-CPSF30 complex seems to be important for efficient viral growth and spread in mammalian host. A previous report indicated that NS1 mutations at 103 and 106 in H5N1 virus significantly enhance systemic growth and virulence in mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the crystal structure, two NS1 ED and two CPSF30-F2F3 fragments formed a complex [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One NS1 ED interacts with one CPSF30-F2F3 through residues 108, 125 and 189, and with other molecules through residues 103 and 106, which seems to stabilize the complex formation. This tetramer complex formation likely promotes effective inhibition of antiviral responses, but could also have negative impact on viral replication as discussed below. Interestingly, sequence data available in the Influenza Research Database indicate that although early pH1N1 isolates contain 108R, 125E and 189G, pH1N1 viruses mutated at residue 125 from E to D emerged in 2015 and became dominant thereafter (

However, pH1N1 may continue to mutate in its NS1 and PA-X residues during seasonal infections to enhance its activity to specifically inhibit innate and cytokine responses in human hosts.
