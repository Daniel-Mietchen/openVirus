<p>Both NS1 and PA-X were reported to induce general shutoff, still whether their shutoff activities are specific to certain host genes is not known. Our RNA-Seq and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that shutoff-active NS1 specifically targets the host mRNAs related to IFN and cytokine signaling pathways (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s006">S2</xref> Tables). The GO analysis of NS1 showed strikingly high combined scores to genes involved in type I IFN signaling pathway. These genes were significantly reduced in cells infected with Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Importantly, this specific targeting cannot be solely explained by its ability to block pre-mRNA processing through CPSF30 binding, since this general shutoff mechanism should apply to global cellular mRNAs. Our data suggest that the NS1-CPSF30 complex either has an additional role in blocking innate signaling pathways or inhibits the processing of specific mRNAs involved in innate signaling. NS1 is known to interact with TRIM25, which ubiquitinates and activates RIG-1, subsequently inhibiting innate signaling pathway. We determined the TRIM25 interaction with wild-type and mutant NS1, and detected no difference in their binding. Also, wild-type and all the mutant viruses we tested suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation in infected cells, suggesting that the NS1 mutation that allows for CPSF30 interaction has little effect on innate signaling that mediates IRF3 activation and translocation (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, our data suggest that NS1-CPSF30 complex might have an inhibitory effect during the transcription of innate genes in the nucleus.
