<p>Viral shutoff could also negatively affect viral gene expression because influenza viruses totally rely on cellular resources for their replication cycle. In fact, we observed reduced expression of viral mRNAs on the virus expressing highly active PA-X and shutoff-active NS1 (Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">9</xref>). This suppression of viral mRNAs was detected both in human A549 and chicken DF-1 cells (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s003">S3</xref>). Interestingly, NS genes (NS1 and NEP mRNAs) were the most affected in the virus expressing active PA-X and shutoff-active NS1, indicating both proteins act together to reduce NS mRNA expression (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which may allow PA-X targeting NS mRNAs through a direct or indirect interaction with shutoff-active NS1. In conclusion, our data support the idea of a functional interplay between PA-X and NS1 proteins in counter-regulating expression of viral genes.
