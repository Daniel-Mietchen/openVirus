<p>In contrast to NS1 which specifically targeted innate genes, PA-X preferentially targeted genes involved in protein modification or catabolic processes, which may have additional impact on its ability to suppress host protein expression in infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>). However, the combined scores of these pathways are relatively low compared to what the biological pathways detected in NS1-shutoff active viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s008">S4</xref> Tables). These statistical values indicate how likely the target genes in a group are associated with a particular pathway. Hence, it is also possible that PA-X has more general targets than shutoff-active NS1 and is not truly associated with any specific pathway.
