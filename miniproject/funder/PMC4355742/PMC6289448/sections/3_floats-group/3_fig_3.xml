  <title>Analysis of genes suppressed by active NS1 or PA-X.</title>
  <p>Genes suppressed by shutoff-active NS1 (A) or PA-X (B) are shown. A Venn diagram demonstrates number of genes suppressed by NS1 or PA-X at least two-fold. Heatmaps show the 493 (A) or 156 (B) DEGs. Each row represents each gene (blue: low expression; red: high expression; Z-score scaling from -2 to 2). Each column represents one replicate from each virus group. Shutoff activity elicited from PA-X and active NS1 was noted under each virus-infected conditions. Hierarchical clustering was performed and cluster numbers based on their expression profiles were demonstrated on the left of the heatmap (A).</p>
