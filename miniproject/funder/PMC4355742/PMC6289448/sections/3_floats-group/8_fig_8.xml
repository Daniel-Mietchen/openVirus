  <title>RNA-Seq analysis of influenza viral gene expression.</title>
  <p>(A) Viral gene expression data obtained from RNA-Seq analysis demonstrates levels of normalized influenza viral mRNA counts of PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M1, M2, NS1, and NEP mRNAs. DESeq2 performs an internal normalization where geometric mean is calculated for each gene across all infected samples. (B) Impact of shutoff-active NS1 on viral gene expression was analyzed by a direct comparison between viruses expressing shutoff-active and inactive NS1, and was demonstrated in fold difference of viral mRNAs in log
   <sub>2</sub> scale. (C) Impact of PA-X on viral gene expression was analyzed by a direct comparison between viruses expressing normal and reduced amount of PA-X, and was demonstrated in fold difference of viral mRNAs in log
   <sub>2</sub> scale.
