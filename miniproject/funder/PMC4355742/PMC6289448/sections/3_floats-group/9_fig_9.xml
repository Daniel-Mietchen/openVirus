  <title>Expression of mRNA, vRNA and proteins of NS1 and HA, and growth of the viruses in Calu-3 cells.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were infected with the viruses at MOI of 2 and viral mRNA (A) and vRNA (B) were quantitated by qRT-PCR at various times after infection. The data represent averages with standard deviations (n = 3). *, P&lt;0.05. (C) HA and NS1 protein expression in infected A549 cells were determined by Western blot analysis. Cellular actin protein was detected as a loading control. Left figure is a representative of three independent experiments and bar graph on right shows relative expression level (n = 3). *, P&lt;0.05, **, P&lt;0.01. (D) Multi-step growth of the viruses were determined in human airway Calu-3 cells. Cells were infected at MOI of 0.1 and released progeny virions in the culture supernatants at various time points were titrated. The data represent averages with standard deviations (n = 3).</p>
