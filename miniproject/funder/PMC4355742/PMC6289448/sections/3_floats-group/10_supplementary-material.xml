  <title>Processing statistics of transcriptomic data (RNA sequencing) and validation of RNA samples.</title>
  <p>(A) Processing statistics for transcriptomic analysis of the 15 RNA samples including three biological replicates of uninfected condition (mock), and Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low], Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] infected A549 cells at MOI of 2 for 16 h. The processing statistics include number of raw, cleaned, removed, uniquely mapped, non-uniquely mapped and, no feather count of sequence reads of each sample. (B) Sample-to-sample distance matrix of RNA-Seq analysis. A heatmap shows the hierarchically clustered Euclidean distances between samples from the regularized log transformation of the normalized count data. The scale on the right demonstrates the arbitrary unit of distance between samples in which the dark color represents less distance (more similarity) and the light color represents greater distance between samples (less similarity). (C) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot representing the variance in the gene dataset. The samples shown in the 2D plane are spanned by their first two principal components of all samples including three replicates of mock, Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low], Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] infected conditions.</p>
