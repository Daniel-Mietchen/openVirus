  <title>Generation of influenza PA-X and NS1 mutant viruses.</title>
  <p>(A) Cal mutant viruses contain mutations in either the frame-shift motif of PA gene or indicated NS1 amino acids or both. (B) Multi-step viral growth kinetics of the viruses in MDCK cells. Cells were infected with the viruses at an MOI of 0.05 and cultured in the presence of trypsin for up to 48 h. Virus samples in the cultures were titrated in MDCK cells. The dashed line indicates the detection limit of the assay. (C) A single-step virus growth in A549 and DF-1 cells. Cells were infected with the viruses at MOI 2 and cultured at 37Â°C. Released viruses in the culture supernatant were collected at 2 and 18 h pi and titrated. Fold increase of the virus titer at 18 h pi compared to 2 h pi was calculated. The data represent averages with standard deviations (n = 3). *, P&lt; 0.05.</p>
