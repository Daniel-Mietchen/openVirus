Through viral PA-X and NS1 proteins, the virus is capable of suppressing host protein synthesis, termed &#x0201c;host shutoff.&#x0201d; Although both proteins are known to induce general shutoff, specificity of target genes and their functional interplay in mediating host shutoff are not fully elucidated. In this study, we generated four recombinant influenza A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1) viruses containing mutations affecting the expression of active PA-X and NS1. We analyzed viral growth, general shutoff activity, specificity of mRNA targets, and viral gene expressions. Our results showed that PA-X was the major contributor in reducing general host protein expression in the virus-infected cells. Intriguingly, our transcriptomic analysis from infected human airway A549 cells indicate that shutoff-active NS1 specifically targeted host mRNAs related to interferon (IFN) signaling pathways and cytokine release. Specificity of target mRNAs was less evident in PA-X, although it preferentially degraded genes associated with cellular protein metabolism and protein repair. Interestingly, in the presence of shutoff-active NS1, PA-X also degraded viral mRNAs, especially NS segments. The virus expressing shutoff-active NS1 with reduced amount of PA-X expression most efficiently suppressed antiviral and innate immune responses in human cells, indicating that influenza virus needs to optimize the contribution of these two shutoff proteins to circumvent host responses for its optimum growth.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Virus infection induces a wide range of host defense responses, such as the innate immune response and inflammation. Some viruses express accessory proteins to induce general shutoff of host protein synthesis, which is one of the major viral strategies to counteract host antiviral activity and immune response. Influenza A virus expresses two proteins, NS1 and PA-X, to induce general shutoff. Their mechanism of action is different; NS1 interacts with CPSF30 and blocks the 3&#x02019;end processing of host pre-mRNAs, while PA-X degrades target mRNAs through its endonuclease domain. Importantly, the NS1 and PA-X activities differ among the virus isolates, suggesting a functional interplay between these two proteins. In this study, we rescued and characterized 2009 pandemic H1N1 mutant viruses with various NS1 and PA-X shutoff activities. Our data showed that PA-X was the major contributor of general shutoff of host protein synthesis, while NS1 specifically targeted genes involved in host innate response and cytokine response. Our data also suggest that viral mRNAs, especially the NS gene can be the target of PA-X induced degradation if NS1 shutoff activity is active. This study indicates a functional interplay between NS1 and PA-X proteins, which is required for optimum viral growth.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI129988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6612-694X</contrib-id><name><surname>Takimoto</surname><given-names>Toru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the National Institute of Health through Grant number R01AI129988 (CC and TT).

Like many other viruses, the influenza virus relies on the host cellular machinery to facilitate its replication cycle. However, host cells recognize and respond to viral infection through inducing various anti-viral proteins and interferons (IFNs). To overcome the host defense system, many viruses express proteins to evade the innate immune response or target general host protein synthesis. General shutoff targeting host mRNAs limits competition from cellular transcripts and secures priority access of viral mRNAs to host translation machinery [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Influenza A virus expresses two viral proteins, NS1 and PA-X, to induce host shutoff. The NS1 is a multifunctional protein best known for its role in antagonizing IFN responses by blocking RIG-I activation and preventing nuclear localization of transcription factors [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. NS1 of human viruses also suppresses host protein synthesis by preventing maturation of host transcripts [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Influenza NS1 has been shown to bind the 30-kDa subunit of CPSF (CPSF30), a component of CPSF complex involved in the cleavage of the 3' signaling region of newly synthesized pre-mRNA [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A crystal structure of a complex composed of the NS1 effector domain (ED) and F2F3 fragment of CPSF30 indicates that two NS1 molecules and two CPSF30 are components of this complex, and NS1 residues F103, M106, K108, D125, and D189 play a critical role for CPSF30 interaction [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These key NS1 residues are highly conserved among human isolates, although they are less conserved among animal isolates. For example, the pathogenic H5N1 influenza A/Hong Kong/483/97 (HK97) virus isolated from humans as well as a mouse-adapted A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) do not bind CPSF30 due to mutations at residues 103 and 106, and are not able to induce general shutoff [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The NS1 of 2009 pandemic influenza viruses (pH1N1), including A/California/04/2009 (Cal) lack the ability to bind to CPSF30 due to mutations in the consensus CPSF30 binding residues (K108R, D125E and D189G), and therefore are unable to induce general shutoff [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>PA-X is a novel influenza virus shutoff protein expressed from PA mRNA as a result of ribosomal frameshifting [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although a limited amount of PA-X is expressed in infected cells due to low frameshift efficiency [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], PA-X significantly impacts general host shutoff and suppresses host antiviral and immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Importantly, PA-X shutoff activity is stronger than NS1 in the context of plasmid transfection [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PA-X contains the initial 191 amino acids of the PA protein and the unique C-terminal 41 or 61 amino acids, depending on the virus strains [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We and others demonstrated that the endonuclease active site, residing in the N-terminal domain of PA-X, is responsible for cellular mRNA degradation [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our previous study showed that PA-X localized and degraded host mRNAs both in the nucleus and cytoplasm [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We and others also found that the unique C-terminal region is crucial for high shutoff activity [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A recent study also suggests that PA-X selectively degrades RNA polymerase II-transcribed host mRNAs in the nucleus [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the exact molecular mechanism of PA-X mediated shutoff activity remains largely unknown. Furthermore, the expression of PA-X is highly conserved, but its shutoff activity varies between the strains. Human viruses seem to have reduced PA-X shutoff activity than avian viruses due to mutations in the N-terminal domain [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Importantly, the 2009 pH1N1 viruses express highly active PA-X, but their NS1 proteins lack shutoff activity [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the variation of NS1 and PA-X activities between the viruses could promote the optimum viral growth in their specific hosts.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of influenza PA-X and NS1 proteins on viral growth efficiency and suppression of host mRNAs in the context of virus infection. We generated recombinant influenza A viruses (A/California/04/2009) containing mutations in PA and NS genes. The viruses express shutoff-active or inactive forms of NS1 with a normal or reduced amount of PA-X expression. Using these viruses, we determined i) the impact of PA-X and NS1 shutoff activities on host protein synthesis, ii) the specificity of target host transcripts, iii) regulation of host innate immune responses, and iv) the effect of shutoff activities on viral mRNA expression. Our data indicated that i) PA-X suppressed host protein synthesis more efficiently than NS1, ii) shutoff-active NS1 specifically targeted genes involved in innate signaling and cytokine release, while target transcripts of PA-X were less specific, but showed some preference for genes involved in cellular protein metabolism and protein repair, and iii) in the presence of both active NS1 and PA-X, expression of viral transcripts, especially NS1 and NEP mRNAs, were substantially reduced. Our results suggest that influenza viruses regulate their PA-X and NS1 shutoff activities to create an optimum environment for efficient growth and spread in a specific host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Generation and characterization of recombinant viruses containing mutations in PA and/or NS genes</title><p>Both influenza NS1 and PA-X proteins are known contributors of host shutoff, although their mechanism of action is different. To analyze the functional interplay between PA-X and NS1, we generated viruses with various shutoff activities by mutating the PA-X and NS1 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The pH1N1 strain we used (A/California/04/2009) expresses highly active PA-X, but shutoff-inactive NS1 (referred to as wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high]). To reduce expression of PA-X, we inserted mutations in the frameshift motif of Cal PA (referred to as Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low]), which we previously confirmed to significantly reduce PA-X expression in infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To activate NS1 shutoff activity, we made three mutations in the Cal NS1 gene (R108K, E125D, G189D), which were shown to enhance binding to CPSF30 [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and suppress the expression of co-expressed proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Two mutant viruses, Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high] (expresses shutoff-active NS1) and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] (expresses shutoff-active NS1 with limited amount of PA-X) were successfully rescued. These viruses were plaque-cloned in MDCK cells, and their PA and NS gene sequences were confirmed to have the designed mutations. Together with the Cal wild-type (Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high]) and Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low] (reduced PA-X expression) we previously rescued [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we analyzed the effect of the viral shutoff activities on host response and virus growth.</p><fig id="ppat.1007465.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007465.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Generation of influenza PA-X and NS1 mutant viruses.</title><p>(A) Cal mutant viruses contain mutations in either the frame-shift motif of PA gene or indicated NS1 amino acids or both.

The specificity of NS1&#x02019;s target mRNAs cannot be entirely explained by the activity of NS1 in inhibiting general pre-mRNA processing through its CPSF30 interaction. It is also possible that the three mutations introduced to NS gene (R108K, E125D, G189D) affect other functions of NS1 beyond its ability to interact with CPSF30. NS1 is well characterized for its inhibitory activity on innate signaling through its interaction with TRIM25, which ubiquitinate the RIG-I CARD domain [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Consistent with the RNA-Seq data, the lowest NS1 mRNA levels were detected in Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high]-infected cells by qRT-PCR. Therefore, in the presence of shutoff-active NS1, PA-X likely contributed to a reduction of NS1 mRNA. To determine if this reduced NS1 mRNA is common to NS gene, we also determined the level of NS vRNAs in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).

To determine the effect of NS1 and PA-X expression on viral growth in human airway cells, we infected Calu-3 cells with the viruses at an MOI of 0.1 and measured the virus growth at various time points. As we previously reported, reduced expression of PA-X attenuated growth and spread of wild-type Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high] virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">Fig 9D</xref> left) [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

These results suggest that although PA-X enhances growth and spread of the virus lacking the NS1 shutoff activity, it negatively impact on the growth of viruses expressing shutoff active NS1, possibly due to the restricted expression of NS1 that specifically target and regulate host innate responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Collectively, our findings indicate that NS1 shutoff activity plays a critical role in blocking antiviral responses in human hosts. However, the shutoff activity of NS1 can be less efficient due to suppression of NS mRNAs by PA-X shutoff activity.

However, their shutoff activities vary between virus isolates.

Influenza viruses rely on cellular machinery for genome replication and viral protein synthesis; therefore, the viruses likely need to adjust their shutoff activities to create an optimum cellular environment for efficient viral growth. In this study, we investigated the functional interplay between influenza PA-X and NS1 proteins on viral and host gene expression in infected human and avian cells and identified preferential cellular mRNA targets and the biological pathways associated with PA-X and NS1 shutoff activities. We found that i) PA-X strongly inhibits host protein synthesis in human and avian cultured cells, while the effect of active NS1 on general host protein synthesis was predominantly observed in avian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>); ii) PA-X preferentially targets cellular mRNAs involved in protein modification, metabolism and repair processes, while shutoff-active NS1 specifically targets genes involved in antiviral responses and strongly suppresses induction of IFN, interleukin, chemokine and class I MHC genes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s006">S2</xref> Tables); iii) shutoff-active NS1 together with PA-X predominantly repressed viral NS1 and NEP mRNA expression (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">9</xref> and S3); and iv) the virus expressing shutoff-active NS1 with a limited amount of PA-X (Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low]) whose shutoff activity mimics that of seasonal human viruses, is the most potent in antagonizing antiviral and innate immune responses in human cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g006">6</xref>).</p><p>Our data evidently indicate that PA-X has a strong impact on host gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Specifically, infection with influenza viruses possessing highly active PA-X shutoff activity, regardless of shutoff activity from NS1, results in a rapid decline in host protein synthesis in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This result is consistent with the observation that PA-X expressed from cDNA suppressed reporter gene expression more efficiently than shutoff-active NS1 [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Expression of PA-X is highly conserved among influenza A viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and it induces host shutoff in broad species [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast, the CPSF30 binding residues of NS1, which are crucial for inducing host shutoff, are less conserved among animal isolates [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The biological and evolutionary reasons why the influenza viruses maintain PA-X expression and its shutoff activity while having differential NS1 shutoff activities across the strains are not actually known. Expression of highly active PA-X and shutoff-active NS1 exhibits the strongest host shutoff activity in avian DF-1 cells; however, we speculated that this condition might not be optimum for avian or animal virus growth within their hosts due to their dependence on host machinery.</p><p>Both NS1 and PA-X were reported to induce general shutoff, still whether their shutoff activities are specific to certain host genes is not known. Our RNA-Seq and pathway enrichment analysis indicated that shutoff-active NS1 specifically targets the host mRNAs related to IFN and cytokine signaling pathways (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s006">S2</xref> Tables). The GO analysis of NS1 showed strikingly high combined scores to genes involved in type I IFN signaling pathway. These genes were significantly reduced in cells infected with Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Importantly, this specific targeting cannot be solely explained by its ability to block pre-mRNA processing through CPSF30 binding, since this general shutoff mechanism should apply to global cellular mRNAs. Our data suggest that the NS1-CPSF30 complex either has an additional role in blocking innate signaling pathways or inhibits the processing of specific mRNAs involved in innate signaling. NS1 is known to interact with TRIM25, which ubiquitinates and activates RIG-1, subsequently inhibiting innate signaling pathway. We determined the TRIM25 interaction with wild-type and mutant NS1, and detected no difference in their binding. Also, wild-type and all the mutant viruses we tested suppressed IRF3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation in infected cells, suggesting that the NS1 mutation that allows for CPSF30 interaction has little effect on innate signaling that mediates IRF3 activation and translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g007">Fig 7</xref>). A recent structural analysis showed that NS1 interferes with the correct positioning of the TRIM25 PRYSPRY domain required for RIG-I ubiquitination [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Cal NS1 contains E96/E97 residues in the effector domain (ED), which have been shown to be important for the complex formation with TRIM25 [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, our data suggest that NS1-CPSF30 complex might have an inhibitory effect during the transcription of innate genes in the nucleus.</p><p>The NS1-CPSF30 complex seems to be important for efficient viral growth and spread in mammalian host. A previous report indicated that NS1 mutations at 103 and 106 in H5N1 virus significantly enhance systemic growth and virulence in mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the crystal structure, two NS1 ED and two CPSF30-F2F3 fragments formed a complex [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One NS1 ED interacts with one CPSF30-F2F3 through residues 108, 125 and 189, and with other molecules through residues 103 and 106, which seems to stabilize the complex formation. This tetramer complex formation likely promotes effective inhibition of antiviral responses, but could also have negative impact on viral replication as discussed below. Interestingly, sequence data available in the Influenza Research Database indicate that although early pH1N1 isolates contain 108R, 125E and 189G, pH1N1 viruses mutated at residue 125 from E to D emerged in 2015 and became dominant thereafter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). At this stage, it is unclear if this single mutation alters the interaction with CPSF30 or its shutoff activity. However, pH1N1 may continue to mutate in its NS1 and PA-X residues during seasonal infections to enhance its activity to specifically inhibit innate and cytokine responses in human hosts.</p><p>In contrast to NS1 which specifically targeted innate genes, PA-X preferentially targeted genes involved in protein modification or catabolic processes, which may have additional impact on its ability to suppress host protein expression in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>). However, the combined scores of these pathways are relatively low compared to what the biological pathways detected in NS1-shutoff active viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s005">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s008">S4</xref> Tables). These statistical values indicate how likely the target genes in a group are associated with a particular pathway. Hence, it is also possible that PA-X has more general targets than shutoff-active NS1 and is not truly associated with any specific pathway.</p><p>Viral shutoff could also negatively affect viral gene expression because influenza viruses totally rely on cellular resources for their replication cycle. In fact, we observed reduced expression of viral mRNAs on the virus expressing highly active PA-X and shutoff-active NS1 (Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">9</xref>). This suppression of viral mRNAs was detected both in human A549 and chicken DF-1 cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s003">S3</xref>). Interestingly, NS genes (NS1 and NEP mRNAs) were the most affected in the virus expressing active PA-X and shutoff-active NS1, indicating both proteins act together to reduce NS mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). This reduction was common between NS1 and NEP mRNAs, suggesting that these NS mRNAs include <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence(s) that can be a target of PA-X in a presence of shutoff-active NS1. Previous reports suggest a direct interaction of NS1 protein with NS mRNAs [<xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which may allow PA-X targeting NS mRNAs through a direct or indirect interaction with shutoff-active NS1. In conclusion, our data support the idea of a functional interplay between PA-X and NS1 proteins in counter-regulating expression of viral genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial A549 and Calu-3, chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium with L-glutamine, 4.5 g/L glucose and sodium pyruvate (DMEM; Corning) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Seradigm) and HEPES (Gibco).
