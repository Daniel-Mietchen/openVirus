<p>Because FMRP is known to be a repressor of cellular mRNA translation (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Zalfa et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Laggerbauer et al., 2001</xref>), we hypothesized that translation of ZIKV is inhibited by FMRP early after infection. To test this hypothesis, we used an infectious ZIKV that expresses NanoLuc luciferase and analyzed early accumulation of NanoLuc in control and FMRP KD cells. Treatment with the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) was used to control for background signal present in the virus stock. The Nanoluc signal observed in control cells was well above that detected in the CHX-treated control at 3.5 hr post infection (hpi) indicating measurable viral protein synthesis at this early time point. Importantly, we observed a 4-fold increase in NanoLuc signal in FMRP depleted cells (siFMR1) compared to control siRNA transfected cells, suggesting that FMRP depletion results in increased of ZIKV translation (

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2009</xref>), ruling out a possible contribution of RNA replication to the increased luciferase signal in FMRP KD cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Consistent with this, we did not observe significant differences in viral RNA accumulation between control and FMRP KD cells in the absence or presence of NITD008 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, we calculated a 3.5-fold increase of ZIKV translation efficiency (NanoLuc levels normalized to ZIKV RNA) in FMRP KD cells compared to the negative control in both the absence and presence of NITD008 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that FMRP inhibits ZIKV infection by reducing viral translation.
