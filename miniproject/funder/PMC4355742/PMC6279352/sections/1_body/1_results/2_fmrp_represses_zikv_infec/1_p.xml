<p>Given the binding of FMRP to ZIKV sfRNA, we hypothesized that this protein would play an antiviral role for ZIKV. To analyze the functional relevance of FMRP in ZIKV infection, we infected HeLa cells in which FMRP was knocked down (KD) with individual siRNAs or a pool of four different siRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Forty-eight hours post-infection with ZIKV-Dakar at low MOI (0.01), we measured viral titers using plaque assay and rate of infection by flow cytometry. Both viral titers and rate of infection were increased by 2- to 5-fold due to FMRP KD (

The antiviral effect of FMRP was corroborated by immunofluorescence (IF) of infected cells to detect viral antigen and analysis by high-content imaging (
