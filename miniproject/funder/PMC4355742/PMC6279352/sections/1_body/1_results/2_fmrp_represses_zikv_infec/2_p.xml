<p>We also tested the effect of FMRP KD under experimental conditions that interrogate virus infection at higher MOI and shorter infection time, and observed that FMRP KD increased infection rate from ~50% to~80% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>) revealed the presence of two distinct populations of infected cells: one of low FI and a second of high FI for expression of viral envelope (E) protein. Cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA (blue histogram) were predominantly in the low-infected cell population. In contrast, cells transfected with siRNAs targeting FMRP (red histogram) were mostly in the highly-infected population. We calculated FI mode values, indicating the maximum FI peak for each condition and found that FMRP knockdown led to a ~ 10 fold increase, indicating elevated levels of E protein expression (
