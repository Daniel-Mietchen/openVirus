<p>Given the key role of FMRP in neurodevelopment, its mechanism of action has been extensively studied and several cellular mRNAs are known targets for translational repression by FMRP (

 <italic>BRD4</italic>. Protein levels of FXR2, TLN1 and BRD4 increased after transfection of siRNA targeting FMRP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6â€”figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting that the mRNAs encoding these proteins are genuine FMRP targets in HeLa cells. The remaining proteins were either undetectable (ARC) or were unaffected (RAC1, Rho A, PNPLA6, KDM5C, TSC2, SOD1) which suggests that FMRP may have cell-type specific effects (
