<p>Next, we asked whether the WT and mutant viruses exhibit differential sensitivity to FMRP depletion. We observed that Δ10 ZIKV infection rate in HeLa cells is reduced compared to WT ZIKV under negative control conditions (~11% vs~25% infected cells) and, importantly, FMRP KD disproportionately enhanced Δ10 ZIKV infection rate (
