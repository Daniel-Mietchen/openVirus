<p>To probe for antagonistic effects of ZIKV sfRNA on FMRP activity, the expression of FMRP targets was evaluated in the context of infection. First, we analyzed expression levels of FXR2 by WB in HeLa cells infected with WT ZIKV and Δ10 ZIKV. In order to achieve similar infection rates for the two viruses, cells were infected at MOI of 3 for WT ZIKV and MOI of 4.5 for the mutant virus. Interestingly, these experiments revealed a 2.7-fold-increase of FXR2 protein levels in cells infected with WT ZIKV (

Although Δ10 ZIKV infection also increased the mean level of FXR2, this effect was not statistically significant (p=0.277) compared to uninfected cells. In parallel, we measured the expression of FXR2 by flow cytometry in ZIKV-infected cells using a double staining protocol. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows the distributions of the cells based on infection with either WT ZIKV or Δ10 ZIKV, indicating similar levels of infection for both viruses (~86% for WT and ~90% for Δ10 ZIKV). FXR2 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was enhanced by WT virus and, to a lesser extent, by the Δ10 ZIKV mutant. Quantitatively, there was a two-fold increase of FXR2 MFI in WT ZIKV infected cells and a 1.5-fold increase for Δ10 ZIKV compared to uninfected cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Interestingly, infection of cells by Δ10 ZIKV caused FXR2 to redistribute into discrete cytoplasmic puncta which was also evident at reduced frequency in WT ZIKV-infected cells. FXR2 has been previously reported to concentrate in stress granules (

In addition to FXR2, we also observed elevated expression of TLN1 by WB in cells infected with WT ZIKV compared with uninfected and Δ10 ZIKV infected cells (
