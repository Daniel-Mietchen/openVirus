<p>Because FMRP binds preferentially to ZIKV sfRNA, we tested the hypothesis that sfRNA, which accumulates to high levels during the course of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), is capable of attenuating FMRP-mediated anti-ZIKV activity. For this purpose, we analyzed a ZIKV mutant (Δ10 ZIKV) that contains a 10-nt deletion within the 3′ UTR DB structure and is highly attenuated in mice and non-human primates (

 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2017b</xref>). We first asked whether Δ10 ZIKV is deficient in sfRNA production. Analysis of viral RNA from infected HeLa cells demonstrated that Δ10 ZIKV has a defect in sfRNA accumulation. An sfRNA/gRNA ratio of 2.7 was observed in WT ZIKV infected cells but the ratio was only 0.6 in Δ10 ZIKV infected cells. These results suggest that Δ10 ZIKV is attenuated, as least in part, through loss of sfRNA accumulation caused by the 10-nt deletion (
