<p>In order to map the region(s) of the ZIKV 3′ UTR that mediate binding of FXR proteins, we performed an RNA affinity chromatography experiment using HeLa lysate and fragments of the ZIKV- PRVABC59 3′ UTR, and probed for proteins by western blotting (WB). As expected, the complete 3′ UTR interacted with FMRP, FXR1 and FXR2 (

Deletion of xrRNA1 dramatically reduced interaction with all three proteins (lane 2) and deletion of xrRNA1 and 2 eliminated detectable binding. Additionally, xrRNA1 alone was sufficient to bind FMRP, FXR1 and FXR2 (lane 4). These data indicate that xrRNA1 is necessary and sufficient for efficient binding to these proteins. We also probed for DDX6, G3BP1 and PTB. DDX6 interacted specifically with the ZIKV dumbbell region in contrast to FMRP. Interestingly, PTB and G3BP1, which were previously reported to interact with the DENV 3′ UTR (
