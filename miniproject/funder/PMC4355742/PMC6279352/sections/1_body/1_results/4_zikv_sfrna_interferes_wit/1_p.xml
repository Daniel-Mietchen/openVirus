<p>To further test the role of sfRNA we asked whether or not this noncoding RNA could modulate expression of FMRP targets in the absence of infection. Electroporation was used to transfect full-length, in vitro synthesized sfRNA or a deletion mutant lacking xrRNA1 and xrRNA2 (DBSLIII). We electroporated RNAs with either 5′ triphosphate or monophosphate into HeLa cells and evaluated RNA integrity and abundance side-by-side with sfRNA from infected cells. We detected three distinct sfRNA species in infected cells that have been previously reported for ZIKV: sfRNA1, sfRNA2 and sfRNA3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>) (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Filomatori et al., 2017</xref>). Electroporated RNAs were partially degraded although some intact sfRNA remained even at 48 hr post-electroporation. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of the FMRP targets FXR2 and BRD4 by flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> to F). Compared to the DBSLIII RNA, electroporation of intact sfRNA resulted in modest, but highly significant, increases in both FXR2 and BRD4 levels. These results suggest expression of ZIKV sfRNA is sufficient to interfere with FMRP. We next asked whether ZIKV infection alters the expression of FMRP targets in mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Male A129 mice were infected with WT (n = 4) or Δ10 ZIKV (n = 4) using 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU. At 6 days post-infection, protein expression levels of FXR2 and PNPLA6 [a validated FMRP target (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>)] were measured in testes. In WT ZIKV-infected mice, we observed statistically significant increases in expression of both FXR2 (1.6-fold) and PNPLA6 (2.5-fold) compared to uninfected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,C and D</xref>). For Δ10 ZIKV-infected mice, expression levels of FXR2 and PNPLA6 were elevated to lesser extents, but these effects were not statistically significant. Measurements of viral genomes indicated a higher burden of infection for the WT virus than Δ10 ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) which may contribute to the differential effects on FXR2 and PNPLA6 levels. Nevertheless, these data taken together with observations made in cultured cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), implicate the ZIKV sfRNA as an antagonist of FMRP function.
