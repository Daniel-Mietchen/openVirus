<p>5′ triphosphate RNAs were generated as described above using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs) and specific primers for sfRNA (forward: 5′

 <named-content content-type="sequence">GATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCCCTCAGAGGACACTGAGTCAAAAAA</named-content> 3′). 5′ monophosphate RNAs were by generated by synthesis of capped RNAs followed by treatment with Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 5′ tri- and monophosphate RNAs were treated with the Turbo DNAse I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNAs were purified using Trizol LS and Direct Zol RNA MiniPrep (Zymo Research) for RNA clean up. 36 pmol of DBSLIII or sfRNA were electroporated into 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> HeLa cells in 250 µL of Ingenio electroporation solution (Mirus) using the Gene Pulser X cell Electroporation System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) following manufacturer´s instructions. 48 hr post electroporation, cells were analyzed for expression of FXR2 and BRD4 and transfection efficiency by NB as described above.
