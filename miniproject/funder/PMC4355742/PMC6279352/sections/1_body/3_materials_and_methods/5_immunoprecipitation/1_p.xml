 <sup>6</sup> HeLa cells were plated in 10 cm dishes. 24 hr later, cells were infected with ZIKV-Dakar, ZIKV-Cambodia and ZIKV-Puerto Rico at an MOI of 3 for 48 hr. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS, scraped and pelleted in 3 mL of PBS (5 min, 1500 rpm at 4°C). Cell pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) with protease inhibitors (Roche). All steps of the IP were performed at 4°C. For each IP 100 µL of protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was washed with 1 ml NT2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.05% IGEPAL) and blocked for 30 min in NT2 buffer with 0.5 mg/mL BSA. Beads were washed three times with NT2 buffer and incubated with either 10 µg of rabbit anti-FMRP, anti-PTB or rabbit IgG in a total volume of 600 µL of NT2 buffer for 2 hr with head to tail rotation. After coupling antibodies, beads were washed three times with NT2 buffer. One mg of protein from clarified lysate was diluted in NT2 buffer in a total volume of 600 µL and added either to IgG or FMRP beads and incubated with rotation for 1 hr. After incubation, beads were pelleted, washed four times with NT2 buffer and resuspended in 115 µL of NT2. 15 µL of beads were used for WB and 100 µL for RNA isolation using Trizol. Equal volumes of RNA (5 µL) from IP reactions were processed for Northern blotting.
