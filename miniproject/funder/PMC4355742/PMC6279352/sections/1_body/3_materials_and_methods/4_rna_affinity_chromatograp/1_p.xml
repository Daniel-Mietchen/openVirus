<p>Synthetic DNA fragments corresponding to the complete 3′ UTRs of African (strain MR766, accession number KX377335.1) and pandemic Asian-lineage ZIKV (PRVABC59 strain, KX377337.1) were obtained from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid containing tobramycin aptamer (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2018</xref>). As a control RNA we used a sequence corresponding to the DENV NS2A sequence as previously reported (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Manokaran et al., 2015</xref>). PCR was used to generate DNA templates for T7 in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript T7 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA affinity chromatography using JEG3 cell lysate was performed following the published protocol (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2014</xref>). Eluted RBPs were identified by label-free mass spectrometry at the UTMB Mass Spectrometry Core. Samples were dissolved in 30 μl denaturation buffer (4% SDS and 100 mM DTT in 0.1M TEAB pH 8.5), heated at 65°C for 15 min, and loaded onto 30 kDa spin filters (Merck Millipore). The buffer was exchanged three times with UA solution (8 M UREA in 0.1 M TEAB pH 8.5) by centrifugation at 14,000 g. After removal of SDS, cysteine alkylation was accomplished through the addition of alkylation buffer (50 mM IAA, 8 M UREA in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5) for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. UA buffer was exchanged with TEAB buffer (40 mM TEAB pH 8.5). The proteins were digested with trypsin (enzyme-to-substrate ratio [w/w] of 1:100) and 5% ACN at 37°C overnight. Peptides were centrifuged through the size exclusion membrane and collected into a clean microcentrifuge tube, followed by a rinse with 80 μL of 0.2% formic acid. The combined peptide solution was then dried in a speed vac and resuspended in 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 97.9% water and placed in an autosampler vial for LC/MS analysis. Raw data files from the mass spectrometer were aligned by accurate mass and time in Progenesis QI for proteomics (version 2.0.5556.29015, Nonlinear Dynamics, a Waters Company). The top five spectra for each feature were exported as *.mgf files and searched against a combined Uniprot-Human canonical database. Peptide identifications were imported into Progenesis QI, and all peptides with −10logP scores &lt; 30 (Mascot or confidence score) were removed. Conflict resolution was performed in order to remove lower scoring peptides when multiple peptides were assigned to a single feature. Protein quantification was calculated from normalized peptide abundances using a summed abundance of unique peptides. Unique peptide abundance was calculated by the area of the corresponding peaks in the ion chromatograms. Protein abundance from RBPs interacting with PRVABC59 and MR766 ZIKV 3′ UTRs were compared with control RNA to calculate ratios of enrichment (PRVABC59 3′ UTR/NS2A and MR766 3′ UTR/NS2A). Eight proteins that were identified by ≥2 unique peptides and were found ≥2 times in both the ZIKV sequences relative to the control RNA were considered high-confidence ZIKV 3′ UTR binding proteins RBPs with ratio &gt;2 were considered as enriched.
