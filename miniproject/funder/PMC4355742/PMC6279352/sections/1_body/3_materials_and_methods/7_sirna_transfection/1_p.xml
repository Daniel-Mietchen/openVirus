<p>Protein knockdown was performed using individual siRNAs (Qiagen) or a pool of siRNAs. 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> HeLa cells were plated in a 24 well plate. The next day cells were transfected with AllStars Negative Control siRNA (Qiagen), individual siRNAs, or the pool using 30 nM of siRNA and 1.5 µL of RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted in 50 µL of Opti-MEM media (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 4 hr, transfection media was replaced by fresh media and cells were incubated for 48 hr. HeLa cells were infected as noted in the figure legends.
