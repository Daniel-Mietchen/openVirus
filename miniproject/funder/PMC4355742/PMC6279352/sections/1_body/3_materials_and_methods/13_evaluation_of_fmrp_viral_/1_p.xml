<p>All animal studies were done in accordance with IACUC protocols as per UTMB policy. A129 mice were obtained from colonies maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Male 8–9 week-old A129 mice were infected with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFU of WT (n = 4) or Δ10 ZIKV (n = 4) mutant viruses through the intraperitoneal route. PBS was given to the mock-infected mice through the same route (n = 3). At 6 days post-infection mice were euthanized, and testes were removed immediately as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 2014</xref>). Testes were flash-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80°C. Tissue was homogenized and lysed with a tissue grinder (OmniTHQ) in 500 µL of polysome lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>,1 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40). RNasin 1:1000 dilution (Promega) and protease inhibitor (Roche) were freshly added to samples. Samples were rotated for 10 min at 4°C to induce lysis and then flash-frozen on dry ice. Samples were thawed and nuclei were pelleted at 3000 x g for 10 min. 10 µg of protein samples from tissue lysates were fractionated in a 4–12% acrylamide gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted for FXR2, PNPLA6 and GAPDH with antibodies mentioned above. For RIP, testis lysate obtained from a mouse infected with WT ZIKV (ZIKV-Cambodia) was pre-cleared by adding 50 µL of protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotating for 30 min at 4°C. 50 µL of beads were blocked in 600 µL of NT2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40) with 0.5 mg/mL BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.5 mg/mL yeast tRNA (Sigma-Aldrich). After blocking, beads were washed and incubated overnight at 4°C with 10 µg of either FMRP or Rabbit IgG antibodies. Antibody-bound beads were washed four times with ice-cold NT2 buffer. For the IP, 2 mg of pre-cleared protein was added to the antibody-bound beads. Final volume was adjusted to 600 µL with NT2 buffer containing RNase and protease inhibitors and incubated for 1.5 hr at 4°C. After incubation, beads were washed four times with NT2 buffer and processed for WB and RNA isolation as in the RIP for HeLa cells. qPCR was performed using ZIKV ORF primers described above and specific primers that amplify ZIKV 3′ UTR (nucleotides 10623 to 10722 of ZIKV-Cambodia: forward 5′
