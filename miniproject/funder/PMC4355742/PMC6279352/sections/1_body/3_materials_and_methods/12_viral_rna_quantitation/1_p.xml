<p>Viral genome and GAPDH RNA were quantified by RT-qPCR. Cell-associated RNA from HeLa was extracted by the Trizol method (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reverse transcribed using the MultiScribe Reverse transcriptase protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR was performed with SYBR mix on a StepOne plus instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The ΔΔCT method was used to calculate relative expression levels of viral genome. Primers used for ZIKV ORF (nucleotides 4541 to 4631 of ZIKV-Cambodia: forward 5′ 
 <named-content content-type="sequence">CTGTGGCATGAACCCAATAG</named-content> 3′; reverse 5′ 
 <named-content content-type="sequence">ATCCCATAGAGCACCACTCC</named-content> 3′). Primers used for human GAPDH (forward 5′ AGCCACATCGCTCAGACAC 3′; reverse 5′ GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC 3′). To evaluate viral genome in mice, RNA from testes lysates were obtained by diluting 15 µL of cell lysate in 85 µL of NT2 buffer and 300 µL of Trizol LS. RNA transcription and qPCR were performed as mentioned above using primers for ZIKV ORF and mouse GAPDH (forward 5′ 
 <named-content content-type="sequence">AAGGTCATCCCAGAGCTGAA</named-content> 3′; reverse 5′ 
 <named-content content-type="sequence">AAGGTCATCCCAGAGCTGAA</named-content> 3′).
