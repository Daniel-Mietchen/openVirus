<p>Cells were harvested and fixed with 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized and blocked for 20 min (1X PBS, 0.1% tween 20, 5% FBS), incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with mouse 4G2 antibody and then 1 hr with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to detect ZIKV envelope protein (E protein). E protein fluorescence was measured with the Guava easyCyte system (Millipore) using the red laser (642 nm) for

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>. Double staining was performed for 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to detect E protein and cellular FXR2 protein. E protein was detected using mouse 4G2 antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor 488. FXR2 protein was stained using rabbit anti-FXR2 and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa fluor 647. Sample analysis, scatter plots of infected cells, mean fluorescence intensities and histograms were performed in FlowJo V10 software.
