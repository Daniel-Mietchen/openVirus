<p>Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies) with 1X protease inhibitor. 10 µg of protein samples were resolved under denaturing conditions on 4–12% acrylamide gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific). ZIKV NS4B, and NS2B, BRD4, TLN1, PNPLA6, Actin and GAPDH were detected using primary antibodies mentioned above. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with IRDye 800 or 680 (LI-COR Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies. Blots were developed in the LI-COR Odissey luminescence system and protein expression was quantified by densitometry with the Image Studio Lite Ver 5.0 software.</p>
