<p>We provide evidence for de-repression of endogenous FMRP target mRNAs in the context of ZIKV infection of cultured cells and mouse testes. Specifically, we observed that the FMRP targets, 
 <italic>FXR2</italic>, 
 <italic>TLN1</italic>, 
 <italic>BRD4</italic>, and 
 <italic>PNPLA6</italic> were elevated at the protein level as a consequence of ZIKV infection. Moreover, infection with Î”10 ZIKV, which produces less sfRNA than WT virus, resulted in weaker or no effects on FMRP targets compared with WT ZIKV. We further observed that introduction of synthetic sfRNA into cells leads to upregulation of two FMRP targets: FXR2 and BRD4. These results provide functional evidence indicating that the ZIKV sfRNA interferes with the activity of FMRP, although sfRNA-independent mechanism(s) for modulation of FMRP targets by ZIKV may also be at play.
