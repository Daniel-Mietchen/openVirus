<p>Mechanistically, we determined that FMRP inhibits ZIKV translation. FMRP is widely expressed and has been characterized to repress translation of specific neuronal mRNAs but the precise mechanism is unknown. Chen et al. demonstrated that drosophila FMRP (dFMRP) can bind directly to the ribosome in the absence of mRNA (

The binding location of dFMRP on the ribosome suggests that it occludes recruitment of elongation factors and tRNA, leading the ribosome reversibly stall as observed by Darnell et al. (

Based on this proposed mechanism, we speculate that FMRP binds the ZIKV genome within the viral open reading frame and causes elongating ribosomes to stall, leading to a deficiency in viral protein synthesis. Alternatively, it is possible that FMRP interaction with the 3′ UTR of the viral genome could lead to impaired translation. Finally, changes in the expression of FMRP targets may indirectly contribute to enhanced ZIKV infection upon FMRP knockdown. For example, the increase in FXR2 subsequent to FMRP depletion could positively impact ZIKV infection (
