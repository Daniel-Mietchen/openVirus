<p>We found that the recently developed ZIKV vaccine strain, Δ10 ZIKV, is compromised for sfRNA production and is replication-deficient in HeLa cells (

Interestingly, infection with Δ10 ZIKV, but not WT ZIKV, caused relocalization of FXR2 to cytoplasmic granular structures reminiscent of stress granules (SG), suggesting that sfRNA may prevent SG formation. This is consistent with previous reports that show very low SG formation in flavivirus infected cells (

Importantly, Δ10 ZIKV infection was disproportionately increased by FMRP depletion compared to WT ZIKV, suggesting that one function of ZIKV sfRNA is to antagonize FMRP. In support of this, our RNA-IP experiments showed that FMRP preferentially co-IPs sfRNA compared to viral genomes. This may be partly explained by stoichiometry of sfRNA to genomes which reaches nearly 4 to 1 at the height of infection, depending on ZIKV strain. It is also possible that sfRNA structure differs from the corresponding region present in the viral genome and this dictates preferential FMRP interaction. We speculate that ZIKV sfRNA works as a ‘sink’ to saturate FMRP and prevent its repressive interactions with both viral RNA and cellular target mRNAs. This is reminiscent of recently described roles for the DENV sfRNA as a molecular sink for proteins involved in interferon responses (G3BP1, G3BP2, CAPRIN1, TRIM25) (
