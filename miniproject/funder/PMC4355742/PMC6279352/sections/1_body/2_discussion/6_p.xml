<p>Besides interferon responses, there are intrinsic restriction factors that recognize viral components and block replication (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Yan and Chen, 2012</xref>). For flaviviruses, a few intrinsic anti-viral factors have been described: YTHDF1-3 proteins that bind methylated RNA and regulate stability, were reported to interact with ZIKV RNA and inhibit infection (

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Paranjape and Harris, 2007</xref>); similarly, FBP1 blocks translation of JEV through interacting with untranslated regions of JEV RNA (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chien et al., 2011</xref>). The association of these antiviral factors with the viral genome and their functional consequences have only been observed in cell culture and it remains to be seen whether or not these will be validated in vivo. Furthermore, there are no reports that the intrinsic anti-viral function of these proteins is counteracted by flaviviral factors. In this work we describe that FMRP is an intrinsic, direct-acting ZIKV restriction factor that interacts with ZIKV RNA and is counteracted by the sfRNA as it accumulates during infection.
