<p>FMRP inhibited infection of multiple ZIKV strains but did not restrict the related flavivirus, DENV, even though we previously identified FMRP as a DENV RNA-binding protein by RNA affinity chromatography (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that FMRP acts as an intrinsic restriction factor for ZIKV. It is not clear why DENV infection is immune to FMRP. It is possible that DENV eludes physical interaction with FMRP in infected cells or that ribosomes translating DENV RNA do not effectively recruit FMRP, which is thought to be a prerequisite for translational repression (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Blackwell et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, FMRP was recently described as a proviral host factor for influenza A virus that promotes assembly of viral RNPs, and FXR proteins were shown to redundantly promote replication of specific alphaviruses (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Hirano et al. showed interaction of FMRP with the genomic RNA of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV), accumulation of FMRP at sites of local TBEV replication, and that FMRP depletion reduces TBEV infection (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Muto et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, FMRP can play a positive, negative or no role in infection, depending on viral species.
