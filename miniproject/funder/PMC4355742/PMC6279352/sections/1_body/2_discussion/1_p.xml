<p>Here, we report functional interactions between ZIKV and FMRP, an important regulatory factor in neurodevelopment (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Harlow et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Hoeft et al., 2010</xref>). FMRP interacted with ZIKV RNA, with particular affinity for the sfRNA, in both infected cultured cells and mouse testes. FMRP interaction with the viral genomic RNA presumably limits infection through inhibiting early synthesis of viral proteins. Importantly, accumulation of ZIKV sfRNA suppressed the anti-viral activity of FMRP and, consequently, resulted in de-repression of endogenous FMRP target mRNAs. Together, our observations have important implications for ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.
