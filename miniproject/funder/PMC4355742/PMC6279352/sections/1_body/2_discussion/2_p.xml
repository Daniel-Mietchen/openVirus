<p>Multiple studies have been performed to characterize the RNA-binding specificity of FMRP (

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) which is found at six sites in the ZIKV 3′ UTR, each of them located in the dumbbell regions. Our mapping experiments, however, showed that the dumbbells are dispensable for FMRP binding to ZIKV 3′UTR, suggesting that these WGGA motifs do not mediate interaction with FMRP. Interestingly, using in vitro RNA selection Darnell et al. identified a highly structured target for the FMRP KH2 domain containing a pseudoknot (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Darnell et al., 2005</xref>). To date, no FMRP target mRNA has been identified that contains this motif but it is notable that the ZIKV xrRNA1, which is required for FMRP binding in vitro, folds into a complex structure containing several tertiary interactions (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Akiyama et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that the artificial RNA identified by Darnell and colleagues shares similar three-dimensional structural features with the sfRNA which allow it to bind FMRP with high affinity.
