<p>Our observations have implications for ZIKV pathogenesis in tissues with high expression of FMRP: brain, placenta and testes (

Given the well-established role for FMRP in promoting neurodevelopment, it is tempting to speculate that certain aspects of ZIKV neuropathogenesis may be explained by sfRNA-mediated FMRP inhibition, leading to inappropriate expression of FMRP target mRNAs. Development of congenital Zika syndrome is likely multifactorial and symptoms such as microcephaly, which is only one disease manifestation (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aliota et al., 2017</xref>), are unlikely to be the consequence of FMRP inhibition. Nevertheless, our findings warrant further research into how ZIKV interactions with FMRP might contribute to disease outcome.
