<p>The flaviviral genome contains 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) that are essential for genome cyclization and initiation of RNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Filomatori et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez et al., 2005</xref>). The ZIKV 3′ UTR is highly structured and consists of four domains: xrRNA1, xrRNA2, the dumbbell (DB) and the 3′ SL (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). The ZIKV 3′ UTR contains confirmed and predicted pseudoknot interactions located in xrRNA1 and xrRNA2, respectively. These pseudoknots are important for stalling of the cellular 5′ to 3′ exonuclease, XRN1, and accumulation of at least two sfRNA species (sfRNA1 and sfRNA2) (

 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Göertz et al., 2018</xref>). The DENV sfRNA has been shown to interact with stress granule associated proteins G3BP1, G3BP2 and CAPRIN1 and the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to dampen innate immune responses (

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Manokaran et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, Moon et al reported that DENV-2 and KUNV sfRNAs inhibited XRN1 activity, leading to accumulation of uncapped transcripts in infected cells and disruption of mRNA homeostasis that could potentially deregulate antiviral responses (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2012</xref>). Regarding ZIKV, Musashi-1 (MSI1) was reported to be required for efficient infection and interact with viral genomes; additionally, ZIKV infection disrupted the activity of MSI1 (33). However, whether or not ZIKV sfRNA interacts with MSI1 and modulates its activity is unclear.
