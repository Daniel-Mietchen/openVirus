<p>In this work, we identified the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) as a host factor that binds to the ZIKV sfRNA and to viral genomes. Functional assays indicated that FMRP represses ZIKV infection by inhibiting viral translation. Analysis of an attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate (Δ10 ZIKV) that is defective for sfRNA production suggests that sfRNA enhances ZIKV infection partly through antagonizing FMRP activity. Additionally, we observed that ZIKV infection blocks the canonical activity of FMRP and increases the expression of FMRP target genes. Finally, we present evidence implicating deregulation of FMRP activity in a mouse model of ZIKV infection, suggesting that ZIKV pathogenesis may involve virus-mediated FMRP inhibition.</p>
