<p>The ZIKV life-cycle starts with virus attachment and receptor-mediated endocytosis (

Upon endosome acidification, the viral envelope fuses with the endosomal membrane, releasing the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm for uncoating and initial viral translation at the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Translation produces a single polyprotein that is cleaved co- and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases into 10 mature proteins: three structural proteins forming the virion (capsid, C; pre-membrane, prM; and envelope, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) required for viral replication and inhibition of host defense mechanisms (
