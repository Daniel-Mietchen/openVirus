<p>The experiments in Figure 4 were performed at a short time point in the presence or absence of the NS5 inhibitor, NITD008, to account for a possible contribution of viral RNA synthesis to luciferase signals. We do not know the kinetics of RNA synthesis with this modified virus but we observed essentially no difference plus or minus NITD008 in the effects of FMRP knockdown on luciferase levels. This lack of difference is the critical point to note. We interpret these data as evidence supporting a role for FMRP in ZIKV translational repression.</p>
