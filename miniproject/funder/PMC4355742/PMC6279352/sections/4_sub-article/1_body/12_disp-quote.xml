 <p>3) Clarification of the mechanism of restriction. Based on the known function of FMRP, the authors focused on viral translation (subsection “FMRP represses ZIKV infection by blocking viral RNA translation”, last paragraph) but it is unclear whether this protein acts directly on the viral RNA.</p>
 <p>3a) Does the protein need to bind the 3'UTR or the ORF for this activity? Does it work directly or indirectly? It is possible that the increase infection could be a consequence of alteration of the expression of FMRP targets. This issue should be considered and different possibilities should be at least discussed.</p>
