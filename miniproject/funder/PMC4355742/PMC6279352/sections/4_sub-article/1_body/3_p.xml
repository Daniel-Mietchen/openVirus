<p>We appreciate this request for clarification. The experiments referred to are not comparable: Figure 3C was performed with the WT Dakar strain and the experiments in Figure 5 used WT Cambodia strain derived from the previously reported infectious clone. A closer comparison could be performed with the Figure 3â€”figure supplement 1B where the increase in the WT Cambodia strain was 2.5-fold. We emphasize in the revised manuscript that different ZIKV strains exhibited somewhat different sensitivities to FMRP depletion.</p>
