<p>The reviewers raise an important point. Our combined data showing binding of FMRP to ZIKV RNA and correlated enhanced infection/translation due to FMRP knockdown strongly suggest that the effect of FMRP is direct. While this is the most parsimonious explanation, our data do not prove that this is the case and it is possible that alteration in expression of FMRP targets contributes to the effect on ZIKV infection. Likewise, our data do not inform on whether binding to the 3â€™ UTR or ORF restricts virus translation. These possibilities are noted in the revised manuscript Discussion.</p>
