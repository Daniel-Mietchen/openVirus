<p>We agree that IP of an unrelated RBP would provide additional evidence for specificity of ZIKV-FMRP interaction. In response to this comment we performed additional RNA immunoprecipitation assays with the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) along with northern blot analysis. This revealed that sfRNA strongly prefers interaction with FMRP compared to PTB. These results are included in new Figure 2C. Regarding the experiment with mouse testes shown in Figure 2C we speculate that efficiency of IP from this tissue was relatively inefficient compared to IP from cultured cells. Nevertheless, this experiment showed clear enrichment of ZIKV RNA with FMRP IP.</p>
