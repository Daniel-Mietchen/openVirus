<p>This is an excellent comment and we agree that demonstration of FMRP modulation by sfRNA out of the context of the infection would strengthen our conclusions. To address this we performed electroporation of sfRNA and a mutant version with deletion of xrRNA1 and xrRNA2, regions required for FMRP-sfRNA interaction. Levels of established targets of FMRP (FXR2 and BRD4) were analyzed by flow cytometry. These experiments show that introduction of sfRNA in uninfected cells leads to increased levels of FXR2 and BRD4, supporting a role for ZIKV sfRNA in FMRP inhibition. Data from these experiments are shown in new Figure 7.</p>
