 <p>1) Further testing of the specificity of the FMRP-sfRNA interaction is needed.</p>
 <p>1a) The Δ10 mutation produces less sfRNAs but its attenuation can be due to any number of reasons. For example, the 3'UTR is crucial for recruiting pro-viral RBPs that aid in translation and replication; the Δ10 mutation can disrupt this independently of sfRNAs. Thus, the observation that the attenuated virus is rescued to a higher extent upon FMRP depletion could be due to other non sfRNA related mechanism. More direct evidence is required to support the claim that sfRNA antagonizes FMRP activity. Is it possible to transfect sfRNA (and non-FMRP binding mutant sfRNA) in the cell and show effects on FMRP activity outside of the context of infection?</p>
