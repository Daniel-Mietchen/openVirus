<p>We agree it is of interest to determine what effects FXR2 may have on ZIKV infection as well as FXR1. We performed knockdown of these proteins and observed contrasting effects: FXR2 knockdown decreased rate of ZIKV infection, making it unlikely to repress ZIKV translation, while FXR1 depletion slight enhanced infection. These observations are now shown in new Figure 3â€”figure supplement 2.</p>
