<p>The reviewers make a good point concerning the possibility of differential RNA decay during the RNA IP reaction. To address this, we analyzed ZIKV genomes and sfRNA in supernatants from RNA IP reactions by Northern blot side-by-side with input RNA. This showed that both viral genomes and sfRNA remain intact during the IP. These data are shown in new Figure 2C.</p>
