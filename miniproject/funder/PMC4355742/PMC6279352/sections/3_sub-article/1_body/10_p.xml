<p>1c) For Figure 2A and B, at least one RBP control antibody, and not just IgG, should be included in this RIP to confirm preferential interaction of FMRP with sfRNA over an unrelated RBP. For Figure 2C, FMRP is relatively abundant in testes with a high viral load but the FMRP-RIP signal is low (again an unrelated RBP RIP is an important control) â€“ how do the authors explain this result?</p>
