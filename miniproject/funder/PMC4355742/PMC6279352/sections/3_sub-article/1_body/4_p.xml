<p>The translational repressor protein FMRP has been previously implicated as a host factor that modulates viral infectivity, for example as a Dengue virus (DENV) RNA binding protein (RBP), an influenza A RNP assembly factor and a positive host factor for Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus infection. Additionally, the FMRP-related FXR proteins enhance replication of some alphaviruses. In this manuscript, Soto-Acosta and coworkers add to this list by using RNA affinity chromatography and MS to identify a number of host proteins that bind to the Zika virus 3'UTR. Among these proteins FMRP, and related proteins FXR1 and FXR2, were selected for further studies. These proteins bind a specific RNA structure of the viral 3'UTR known as xrRNA1, which is present in the viral genome and in viral sfRNAs. FMRP, a cellular RNA-binding protein (RBP) that binds to the 3'UTR of Zika virus, inhibits virus production by interfering with viral translation. FMRP binds a specific 3' UTR region (xrRNA1) of ZIKV subgenomic RNA (sfRNA), which accumulates during ZIKV infection and inhibits FMRP inhibitory activity. Using siRNA-mediated FMRP depletion, they provide evidence that FMRP loss increases ZIKV translation/infection and also stimulates sfRNA-deficient ZIKV10-del. ZIKV also upregulates FMRP translational targets in both Hela cells and mouse testes.</p>
