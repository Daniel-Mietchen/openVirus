<p>Studies on ZIKV continue to be of biomedical concern due to ZIKV-associated congenital microcephaly and inflammatory peripheral neuropathy. In this context, the findings reported in this study are important since they add to our understanding by dissecting the interaction of FMRP/FXR proteins with sfRNA. Overall, the described experiments are well-controlled, the manuscript is well-written and the finding that FMRP acts as a restriction factor for ZIKV infection is novel and of high interest. The reviewers felt, however, that key experiments were missing to fully support the conclusions. Especially, the conclusion that sfRNA strongly antagonizes FMRP activity is less well supported because it is mainly based on an attenuated ZIKV strain with distinct replication kinetics.</p>
