  <title>FMRP inhibits ZIKV translation early after infection.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) An infectious ZIKV reporter virus expressing NanoLuc luciferase was used to evaluate ZIKV translation. HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA (siControl) or the siRNA pool targeting the FMR1 gene (siFMR1). Two hours before infection, cells were pretreated with DMSO (-NITD008) or NITD008 at 20 μM. Accumulation of Nanoluc was evaluated at 3.5 hr post-infection. Cycloheximide (CHX) treatment was used to control for background signal present in the virus stock. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The graph shows luminescence signals with background (CHX control) subtracted and normalized to the siControl condition. (
   <bold>C</bold>) In parallel, viral RNA was measured by RT-qPCR, calibrated with GADPH mRNA expression and normalized to siControl. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Translation efficiency was calculated by normalizing the luminescence signals to ZIKV RNA levels. Data represent mean ±SEM of one representative experiment for A, three independent experiments for B and two independent experiments for C and D. (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.005, ***p&lt;0.001). .
