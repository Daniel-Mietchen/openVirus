  <title>ZIKV sfRNA increases expression of FXR2 and BRD4 in the absence of infection.</title>
  <p>Electroporated 5′ triphosphate (
   <bold>A</bold>) or monophosphate (
   <bold>D</bold>) RNAs were analyzed by northern blot, 48 hr after electroporation. Total RNA from cells infected with ZIKV-Puerto Rico was analyzed to visualize the presence of sfRNA1, sfRNA2 and sfRNA3. The expression levels of FXR2 and BRD4 were evaluated by flow cytometry in cells electroporated with 5′ triphosphate (
   <bold>B,C</bold>) or monophosphate (
   <bold>E,F</bold>) RNAs. Mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) in presence of the mutant control DBSLIII (blue) and sfRNA (red) are shown. Plots in C and F represent the mean ±SD of four and two independent experiments, respectively. (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.005, ***p&lt;0.001). MFI intensities were normalized to the mutant control. .
