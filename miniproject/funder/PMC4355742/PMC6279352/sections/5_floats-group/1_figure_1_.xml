  <title>xrRNA1 is required and sufficient for FMRP binding to the ZIKV 3′ UTR.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the secondary structures present in the ZIKV 3′ UTR and RNAs used for affinity chromatography. Deletion mutant RNA constructs fused to a tobramycin aptamer at the 5′ end are shown. DENV NS2A coding sequence was used as a negative control RNA. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Purified RNAs bound to tobramycin-sepharose beads were incubated with HeLa cell lysate and unbound proteins were washed away prior to elution for western blotting for DDX6, FMRP, FXR1, FXR2, G3BP1 and PTB.
