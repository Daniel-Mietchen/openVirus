  <title>Depletion of FMRP increases ZIKV infection.</title>
  <p>HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA (siControl) and individual or a pool of four different siRNAs targeting FMR1 (siFMR1). Cells were infected with ZIKV-Dakar at MOI 0.01 for 48 hr. (

   <bold>B</bold>) Viral titers in supernatants were measured by plaque assay and are plotted as PFU/ml. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Infection rates were measured by immunofluorescence against viral envelope (
   <bold>E</bold>) protein using flow cytometry (representative scatter plots are shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or (

   <bold>E</bold>) HeLa cells were transfected with siControl or siFMR1 (pool) and infected with ZIKV-Cambodia (MOI 0.01), ZIKV-Puerto Rico (MOI 0.01) or DENV-2-NGC (MOI 0.03) 48 hr later. At 48 hr post-infection, supernatants were collected and analyzed for viral titers. Graphs represent the mean ±SD of PFU/mL of one of three independent experiments for ZIKV-Cambodia and ZIKV-Puerto Rico. For DENV-NGC, three biological replicates are plotted (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.005, ***p&lt;0.001). NI, non-infected cells.

    <p>HeLa cells were transfected for 48 hr with control siRNA (siControl) and siFMR1 (pool). Cells were then infected with ZIKV-Dakar at MOI one and collected at 20 hr post-infection. Infection rate was measured by flow cytometry. (
