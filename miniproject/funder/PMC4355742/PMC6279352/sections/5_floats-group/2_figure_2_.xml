  <title>FMRP interacts with ZIKV RNA in infected cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) was performed using either control IgG or anti-FMRP antibodies. HeLa cells were infected with the indicated virus at MOI of 3 and harvested 48 hr post-infection. Viral genome (gRNA) and the subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) were detected by Northern blot (NB) using a DNA probe that hybridizes to the ZIKV 3′ UTR. Western blotting (WB) shows the specificity of FMRP IP. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Bar graph showing the preferential binding of FMRP to ZIKV sfRNA. Densitometry analysis of NB assays was performed to determine relative levels of co-precipitating gRNA and sfRNA compared to input signals. Enrichment of sfRNA was normalized to the gRNA enrichment. Data represents the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments for ZIKV-Dakar and ZIKV-Cambodia (*p&lt;0.05). One experiment was performed for ZIKV-Puerto Rico. (
   <bold>C</bold>) RNA IP from HeLa cells infected with ZIKV-Dakar using anti-PTB, anti-FMRP and isotype control antibodies. (
   <bold>D</bold>) FMRP interacts with ZIKV RNA in infected mouse testes. Testes from ZIKV-infected mice were lysed and used for FMRP-RIP. RT-qPCR assays were used targeting the ZIKV ORF, to measure viral genomes exclusively, and the 3′ UTR, to measure both genomes and sfRNA. Bar graph represents the enrichment of viral RNAs in FMRP-pulldown normalized to the control IgG. Data indicates the mean ± range of two biological replicates. The WB shows IP of FMRP.
