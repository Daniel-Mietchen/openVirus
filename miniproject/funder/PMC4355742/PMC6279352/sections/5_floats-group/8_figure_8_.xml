  <title>ZIKV infection increases the expression of FMRP targets in infected mouse testes.</title>
  <p>A129 mice were non-infected (NI; N = 3) or infected with WT (N = 4) or ∆10 ZIKV (N = 4) with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> FFU. At 6 days post-infection, mice were euthanized, and testes were removed for lysis. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Protein expression levels of FXR2 and PNPLA6 were analyzed by WB. No FXR2 was detected in mouse #2 infected with ∆10 ZIKV and we therefore eliminated this sample from the analysis. (
   <bold>B</bold>) A fraction of testes lysates was processed for RNA isolation and levels of viral genomes were measured by RT-qPCR using a pair of primers that amplify a region of the ZIKV ORF. GAPDH was used as loading control for WB assays and calibrator gene for RT-qPCR. Relative protein expression levels of FXR2 (
   <bold>C</bold>) and PNPLA6 (
   <bold>D</bold>) were measured by densitometry analysis, adjusted to loading control and normalized to non-infected mouse (NI). Error bars represent the mean ±SEM of three mice for non-infected condition (NI), four mice for WT ZIKV and three mice for ∆10 ZIKV. *p&lt;0.05. N.D, non-detected. .
