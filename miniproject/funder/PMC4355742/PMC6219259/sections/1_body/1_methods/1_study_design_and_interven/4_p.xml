<p id="Par19">This intervention aimed to leverage the potential of good health communication. Neither nurses nor contract staff had previous experience with partner testing mobilization. For all case managers, a two-day training was held at the beginning of the program with follow-up trainings every 3 months. Study investigators and HIV care experts conducted one-on-one training sessions with each case manager on case counseling, HIV treatment and care, partner notification, and especially partner referral testing. Training sessions included simulated case manager-participant interactions. Training materials and operation study manuals were provided by NCAIDS. After the first training and before program initiation, all case managers passed project tests to ensure that they had the ability to execute project procedures. A handbook was issued to all providers on HIV-related counseling and project procedures.</p>
