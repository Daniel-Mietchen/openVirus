<p id="Par18">Based on the personnel availability of the ART clinics, we selected nurses as case managers in three sites, and other case managers were recruited as contract staff if clinics could not appoint nurses for involvement. The same funding was provided to all clinics. Of a total 10 case managers, six were nurses who were already employed at the clinic and four were contract staff who were newly hired for this pilot. Selection of contract staff was performed by posting a position notice in project clinics. Candidates qualified in current clinic volunteers and were subsequently approved by the project leader after interview. The educational backgrounds of the contracted case managers varied from sociology to health management, and they all had HIV-related volunteer experience. All case managers were engaged full-time in this program.</p>
