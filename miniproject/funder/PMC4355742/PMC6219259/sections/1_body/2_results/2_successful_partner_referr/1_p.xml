<p id="Par29">Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify factors related to successful partner referral for HIV testing (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Multivariable analysis further indicated that married index participants were more likely to successfully refer their partners for HIV testing (AHR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.20–1.73) compared to single index participants. Relative to unemployed index participants, those employed were more likely to successfully refer a sexual partner for testing (AHR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.11–1.49). Having a case manager who was a nurse increased the likelihood of successful referrals (AHR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.36–1.80) compared to contract staff.
