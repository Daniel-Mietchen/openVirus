<p id="Par30">Of the 829 referred partners who received testing, 92 (11.10%) screened HIV-positive (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Stable male partner relations were more likely to result in a referred partner testing HIV-positive (AHR = 5.50, 95% CI = 1.85–16.39). Having a case manager who was a nurse was associated with increased likelihood of referred partners testing HIV-positive, compared to contract staff case managers (AHR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.45–3.92).
