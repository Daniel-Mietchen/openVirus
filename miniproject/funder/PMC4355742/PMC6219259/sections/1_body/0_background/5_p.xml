<p id="Par15">In order to address the challenge to HIV case finding posed by this sectorial division of labor, we conducted a novel health communication-based intervention to integrate MSM partner testing with ART clinic services. For each HIV infected index participant who was newly referred to an ART clinic, we assigned a case manager who oversaw treatment and care, with emphasis on additional partner testing services. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the integrated partner testing service for improving case finding among MSM. We identified the predictors of both successful partner referral for HIV testing and HIV-positive test results among referred partners.</p>
