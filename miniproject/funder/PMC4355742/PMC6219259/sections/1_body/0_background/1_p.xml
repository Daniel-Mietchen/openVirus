 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This strategy calls for 90% of people living with HIV to be diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed patients to be sustained on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of treated patients to achieve viral suppression by 2020. As the entry point of the care cascade and the prelude to the “treat all” strategy, the first 90% is the cornerstone of the 90–90-90 approach. Approximately 40% of people living with HIV around the world are still unaware of their serostatus [
