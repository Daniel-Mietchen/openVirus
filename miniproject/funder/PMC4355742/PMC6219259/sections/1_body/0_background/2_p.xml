<p id="Par12">The HIV epidemic in China has a low national prevalence at 0.06% (0.05â€“0.07%) of the total population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Currently, sexual transmission is the primary mode of HIV transmission, and specific regions and populations bear a heavier burden. In particular, MSM are disproportionally affected by HIV and have experienced a sharp rise in incidence in recent years. Among newly diagnosed HIV cases nationwide, the percentage of all sexually transmitted cases increased from 33.10% in 2006 to 92.20% in 2014, and the proportion of HIV cases among MSM increased from 2.50% in 2006 to 25.80% in 2014 [

To deal with the challenge of identifying more cases among MSM, a variety of prevention and treatment interventions have previously been implemented, most notably testing by community mobilization [
