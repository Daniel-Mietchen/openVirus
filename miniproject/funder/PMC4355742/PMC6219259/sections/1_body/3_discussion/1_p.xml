<p id="Par31">The aim of this health communication pilot study was to assess the impact of partner referral testing integration with ART services among MSM in China. We sought to improve case-finding among MSM by training case managers to provide intensified counseling related to partner testing. We found that having a nurse as a case manager, being employed, and being married were more likely to result in successful partner referral testing and HIV-positive screenings among referred partners. Having a stable male partner was also a related factor for referred partnersâ€™ screening HIV-positive.</p>
