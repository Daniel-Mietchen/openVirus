<p id="Par33">From our study results, we identified a few factors that may highlight underlying social determinants and influence future policy development. Firstly, case managers who were nurses proved to be more effective in mobilizing partner testing [

Of index participants who had nurse case managers, 42.38% (503/1187) referred partners for testing, of whom 13.72% (69/503) tested HIV-positive, compared to the 27.28%(326/1195) referral rate and 7.05% (23/326) HIV-positive in the contract staff case manager group. Nurse-delivered interventions had improved outcomes such as ART adherence in another study as well [

Despite nurses and contract staff receiving the exact same case manager training, it is possible that nurses were better able to communicate with participants due to their previous health delivery background. Secondly, we also found an association between employment status and the successful referral of a sexual partner, possibly indicating that stable income improved referral for partner testing. Finally, index participants in stable male relationships were more likely to have an HIV-positive partner. This suggests that the partner testing intervention should be scaled up in this population.
