Only partner testing that occurred through consultation with the index participantâ€™s case manager was included in our analysis. Second, the lack of a control group does not allow us to directly compare the HIV testing rate in our pilot study to the standard of care. Third, to protect the privacy of the partners referred by index participants, very little information was collected about them (e.g. lacking information on average counseling duration of case managers and intervention fidelity). Finally, the standard case definition for an adult HIV infection diagnosis in China requires a positive result on a confirmatory western blot antibody test. However, we considered referred partners to be HIV-positive for the purposes of this study if they tested positive for HIV through ELISA screening (i.e. without a western blot test).</p>
