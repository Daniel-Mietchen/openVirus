<p>Spatial effects may play important roles in the spread of diseases including FMD. The scan statistic is commonly used to test if a one-dimensional point process is purely random or if any clusters can be detected [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this respect, the spatial scan statistic has been one of the most commonly used techniques to address spatial clustering of animal diseases, FMD included [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Some of the advantages of the technique include the ability to identify specific high-risk areas, as well as to quantify the risk [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This type of model makes minimal assumptions about the time, geographical location, or size of the outbreak, and it adjusts for natural purely spatial and purely temporal variation. In this technique, a hypothetical spatiotemporal cylinder is centred at the geospatial coordinates of each location where outbreaks had been reported. The base and the height of the cylinder represented, respectively, the spatial and temporal dimensions for each potential cluster of outbreaks. The base and height of the cylinder were let to vary up to a maximum size equivalent to the inclusion of 50% of the reported outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A condition of the time–space permutation model of the scan statistic is that the numbers of cases within the spatiotemporal cylinder are Poisson distributed. This condition can be assumed when the number of cases per day (cd) and the number of cases per area (ca) are small, compared with the overall number of cases.
