<p>In analytical epidemiology including FMD risk factors analysis, regression modelling is one of the most important statistical techniques used to investigate the effect of one or several explanatory variables (e.g., exposures, risk factors) on a response variable such as mortality rate or disease occurrence [

Regression models are useful because they allow analysts to identify when and where outbreaks are likely to occur (logistic regression) or how large an outbreak will be (Poisson regression). Hence, depending on the nature of the data, three regression models were mainly used in epidemiological studies: logistic regression, Poisson regression and alternatively negative binomial regression.
