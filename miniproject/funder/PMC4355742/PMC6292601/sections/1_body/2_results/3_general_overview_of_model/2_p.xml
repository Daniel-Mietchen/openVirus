Indeed, the modelling approach of infectious disease is to divide the host population into different compartments denoted S, E, I, R representing respectively Susceptible, Exposed (infected but not yet infectious), Infected and infectious and Recovered (or removed) animals or premises. The dynamics of infection are then represented by the movement of hosts from one compartment to another. Such a model is also referred to as a SLIR model, with S, L, I, R representing respectively Susceptible, Latent, Infected and infectious and Recovered (or removed) animals or premises. If vaccination is involved, there may also be a compartment denoted V representing vaccinated animals or premises [

Simulation models are used in a similar way to mathematical models, but they tend to have greater flexibility allowing the effectiveness of control measures to vary geographically and over time. Indeed, all of these techniques can contribute to contingency and planning through exploration of the resource requirements of different strategies in hypothetical FMD epidemics [
