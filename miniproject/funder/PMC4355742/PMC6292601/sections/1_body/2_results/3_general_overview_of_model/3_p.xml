<p>Although, there is no agreed classification system for models. Several authors have focused on different aspects of models, which may distinguish them from each other. According to the treatment of probability, variability, and uncertainty, models can be stochastic or deterministic. Models, which assign averages or most likely values to all parameters and model the average or most likely outcome of probability events, are named ‘deterministic’ models. They produce a single output or result for each set of input values or scenario [

As parameter values within the model can vary and the occurrence of chance events is random, stochastic models must be run repeatedly to produce a range of outcomes from the same input scenario. Such models were used by Keeling et al., [
