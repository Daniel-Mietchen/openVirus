<p>Based on the method of data extraction used in this review, the key findings of the included articles related to FMD qualitative risk assessment (n = 5) were summarized in a narrative description of each study. Taking into account the design of these studies, an exception was made to include some published reviews with respect to the defined time frame of publication which is between 1997 and 2016. In general, FMD qualitative risk assessment was based on the OIE assessment framework, using available data from published sources and various unpublished sources [

As mentioned above, the main application of risk analysis in the animal health field has been directed to import risk analysis, which is the assessment of disease risks associated with international trade in animals and their products. This is illustrated by the research question of some included articles, which served as basis for the qualitative assessment of risk [
