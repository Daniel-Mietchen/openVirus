<p>In conclusion, the findings of this systematic review reveal that apart from models that were developed following the 2001 FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom, there are a number of publications describing modelling studies carried out in countries where FMD is endemic. Additionally, this review pointed out the unavoidable prerequisites of good-quality data to perform modelling studies with the ultimate goal to understand the epidemiology, to plan and to evaluate control programs of FMD even in countries where the disease is endemic. Certainly, FMD could be effectively controlled, if certain conditions are met. The recommended measures to be adopted include a regional approach to disease control and setting up global or regional surveillance partnerships. In addition, political and administrative authorities should consent more resources to strengthen veterinary services and the veterinary laboratory capacities especially in developing countries where FMD is endemic. When these steps are achieved, improving the data collection and the disease reporting system combined with appropriate analysis and implementation of appropriate interventions could possibly have a positive impact on FMD management and control at either the regional or national level.</p>
