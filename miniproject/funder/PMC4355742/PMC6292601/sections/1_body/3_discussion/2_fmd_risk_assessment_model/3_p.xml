<p>Depending on the used approach, the selected studies have also some shortcomings that can be ascribed to the risk assessment methodology. As noted above, qualitative risk assessments express risks in relative qualitative terms and often involve the aggregation of expert opinions. A comprehensive collection of data combined with expert opinion, was first undertaken by the European Commission for the Control of Foot and Mouth Disease (EuFMD), but thereafter extended and reviewed by the working group on FMD risk coordinated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). This was done to assess the risk of FMDV entering through a pathway that could lead to its eventual release in the European Union from FMD risk regions such as Africa, Asia and South America [

To this regard, the methodology for qualitative risk assessment must be rigorous to ensure that the true risk, and not the false risk perception, is assessed as most likely, any decision can lead to a major animal health and economic impact [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Risk assessment can be also quantitative, i.e. providing a numeric estimate of the probability of risk and the magnitude of the consequences. Furthermore, quantitative risk assessment allows to model uncertainty and accordingly to undertake sensitivity analysis to determine the relative importance of variation in different inputs on the output(s) [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, quantitative risk analysis may be too complex to carry out as they require more time, resources and accurate data. Indeed, a major and common problem for modelling is the lack of reliability and accuracy in recorded data [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Similarly, it should be emphasized that several FMD endemic countries with substantial animal populations provide no information on FMD outbreaks or provide data that are considered to reflect a significant under-reporting of the true situation [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. A distinguishing feature of the outbreak of FMD that occurred in the UK in 2001 is that detailed and factually correct data were collected throughout the epidemic. This data set has proven to be of enormous value for informing mathematical and simulation modelling studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In a recently published review, Pomeroy 
 <italic>et al</italic>., [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] elegantly demonstrated the crucial importance of data availability and accessibility for model implementation. Similarly, Hyeyoung 
 <italic>et al</italic>., [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] demonstrated the unavoidable prerequisites of good-quality data to perform modelling. Indeed, they have more recently showed by simulation modeling the impact of the movements of mobile pastoralists on FMDV transmission in a transhumance system in the Far North Region of Cameroon. However, according to the authors a comprehensive explanation of the endemic feature of FMD in the concerned study area must include other factors such as the roles of sedentary and international transboundary herds and possible FMD carriers. Moreover, whatever the modelling approach (quantitative or qualitative), the uncertainty of each step of the model should be clearly underlined and reported to decision-makers.
