<p>In areas where wildlife constitutes a threat to FMDV transmission, building fences at the fringes of game reserves to avoid contact between wild and domesticated animals has been adopted in some regions as a FMD prevention method. Also, given the fact that human activities through several pathways could be an important risk factor, the enhancement of compliance of biosecurity measures and the awareness of all stakeholders (e.g. farmers and veterinarians) should be taken into consideration in planning control options.</p>
