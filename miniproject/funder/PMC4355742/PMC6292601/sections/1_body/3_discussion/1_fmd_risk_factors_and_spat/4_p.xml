<p>For example, in logistic regression analysis, large sample sizes are required to provide sufficient number of positive cases for proper estimation [

For example, statistical power calculations were seldom reported in the included articles. On the other hand, the association between considered variables as well as the justification of the sample size are reported in these articles.
