<p>Even though there are numerous epidemiological modelling studies that have assessed risk factors and spatiotemporal distribution of FMD occurrence [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] most of them are related to particular epidemic episodes, mainly the 2001 FMD epidemic in Europe and, as a result, their findings cannot be extrapolated to all situations [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, these studies are useful but also some limitations and should be cautiously considered before implementation in Africa as not only their output but also the modelling methods used need to be translated onto local field conditions and considering available data. Although the technical development is identical, the application of models can and should vary based on the purpose of the research. In addition, some of the limitations of the risk factors analysis and of the spatiotemporal distribution could be related to the applied model type [
