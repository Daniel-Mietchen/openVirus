 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Nevertheless, it has a disadvantage due to the shape of the clusters constrained by the cylindrical shape (with a circular base) of the window used to scan the studied area. This could lead to a serious constraint when the geographical extension of the detected clusters is large [
