<p>Another example of limitation due to the applied model is given by Perez 
 <italic>et al</italic>., [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Indeed, these authors have used the co-kigring model to estimate the spatial risk of FMD in Pakistan. The co-kriging model uses information on covariates that are assumed to be associated with the outcome and to be known throughout the study area. Consequently, the findings of this type of study are formulated from a model that is based on a probabilistic interpolation method, which does not consider the variability of data resulting from various reporting systems [
