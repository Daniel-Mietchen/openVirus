<p>The limitations of models in relation to the used data will be further discussed in the next section devoted to qualitative and quantitative FMD risk modelling. However, the limitations due to the use of questionnaires should be mentioned. Indeed, some authors presented a possible reporting bias when using data recorded by questionnaire rather than by using a prospective collection of objective data [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Using questionnaires, a confounding effect among variables has been reported [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. For instance, Bronsvoort et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], mentioned the existence of many variables relating to cattle density and management, the quality of veterinary services and other socio-economic factors, as well as possible ecological factors that could vary across the study area, which the questionnaire did not measure and will need further investigation with a much larger study. This pointed out the weakness of questionnaire-based studies, which is the potential for recall bias and the lack of possibility to validate questionnaire responses [
