<p>A range of analytical techniques exists with specific uses ranging from FMD outbreak response planning (e.g. risk analyses, simulation modelling studies, mathematical modelling studies) to understanding which farms are at risk of infection, once an incursion has occurred (regression models) (

Therefore the aim of this review was to systematically collect information on studies related to some risk models for FMD that are well supported by scientific evidence from the literature. This review will specifically focus on the use of modelling in an FMD endemic context such as Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to inform recommendations on critical FMD prevention and control options.
