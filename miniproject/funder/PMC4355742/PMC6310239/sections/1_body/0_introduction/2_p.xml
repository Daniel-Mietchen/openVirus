<p>NoVs are members of the 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family and possess a 7.5–7.7 kb genome. NoVs are nonenveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. To date, NoVs have been genetically classified into seven genogroups (GI to GVII) and thirty-nine genotypes, including 9 genotypes in GI, 22 in GII, 2 in GIII, 2 in GIV, 1 in GV, 2 in GVI, and 1 in the tentative new GVII genogroup [
