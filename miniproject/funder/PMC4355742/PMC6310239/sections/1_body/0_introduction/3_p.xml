<p>Epidemics of NoV outbreaks have increased substantially in China since the winter of 2014 [

Only 0.8% (1/132) of the identified NoV outbreaks were reported in 2006, whereas 46.2% (61/132) occurred in 2015, and 11.4% (15/132) occurred in the first half of 2016 [

A series of AGE outbreaks have been reported to the Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since June 2015. In the present study, we aimed to determine the circulating NoV genotypes associated with AGE outbreaks in Jinan, China. We further explored the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreaks that occurred from June 2015 to March 2017. This study should help health authorities and policy makers create effective measures to address NoV outbreaks.
