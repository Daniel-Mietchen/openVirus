<p>Noroviruses (NoVs) are the principal causative pathogen of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis (AGE) among five viral agents (NoV, sapovirus (SaV), rotavirus (RoV), astrovirus (Ast) and human adenovirus (ADV)) [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Globally, NoVs are estimated to be associated with 18% of all cases of AGE [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. NoV outbreaks have been reported in congregate settings, such as cruise ships, childcare centers, and long-term care facilities [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The common symptoms are nonbloody diarrhea and/or vomiting accompanied by low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and nausea. Dehydration is the most frequent and dangerous complication [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Outbreaks caused by NoV result in a total of $4.2 billion in direct health care system costs and $60.3 billion in annual societal costs worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. NoV transmission mainly occurs through foodborne and human-to-human transmission via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A low infectious dose facilitates effective NoV transmission. The estimated 50% infectious dose (ID
 <sub>50</sub>) ranges from 18 to 2800 genomic equivalents [
