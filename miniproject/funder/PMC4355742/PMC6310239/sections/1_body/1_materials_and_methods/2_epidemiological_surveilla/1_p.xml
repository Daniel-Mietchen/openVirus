According to the guidelines, outbreaks are required to be reported to the National Emergent Public Health Event Information Management System. A field investigation is then performed, and data are collected via a questionnaire survey. The first reported individual in an outbreak is regarded as the index case. For this study, the human specimens (stool, anal swab, vomit or throat swab) and/or environmental specimens (food, water or surface swab) were collected and delivered to the Jinan CDC using refrigerated transport at 4Â°C. The human specimens were collected from clinically compatible cases within 5 days of onset. Viral detection was performed on the specimens in the Viral Disease Detection Laboratory at the Jinan CDC. The virus-negative specimens were sent to the Department of Microbiology at the Jinan CDC for bacterial testing.
