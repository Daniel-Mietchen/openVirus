<p>The stool, anal swab, vomit, and food samples were processed in a 10% suspension of phosphate-buffered saline (supplemented with Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>). The throat and surface swabs were stored in Hank’s balanced salt solution. Contaminated water was concentrated using a centrifugal filter (Merck Millipore, Ltd., Ireland). All samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min (Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA). RNA/DNA was extracted from 200 μl supernatant using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and suspended in 50 μl elution buffer. RNA/DNA was amplified immediately or stored at −80°C°C. The protocol is provided as DOI:
