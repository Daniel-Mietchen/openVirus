<p>A single outbreak can be caused by multiple NoVs genotypes (
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). GII.17 and GI.6 were responsible for outbreak I; GII.17 and GI.3 for outbreak III; and GII.3 and GI.6 for outbreak V. For outbreak X, GI.5 was detected in both human specimens and water specimens (well water and household tap water).
