<p>Among five of the other outbreaks, four occurred in kindergartens (outbreaks VI and XIII-XV), and one (outbreak V) occurred at a college. The field investigation showed that the affected individuals came to the kindergartens or college and without any rest. Therefore they came into close contact with others at the kindergartens or college. Using laboratory testing, NoVs were detected in samples from these affected cases. NoVs were easily transmitted via close contact among the children/college students.</p>
