<p>Outbreak IV occurred at construction site D. The affected individuals ate lunch and supper in the construction site cafeteria. A field investigation of employees, food handlers and the sanitation conditions of the cafeteria was conducted. Because the leftovers had been cleaned up, the food samples were not collected. NoVs were identified in the ground sewage from the cafeteria, but no NoVs were detected in barreled drinking water. Outbreak X occurred in residential district H, where household tap water was supplied from a well. The well was located at a lower elevation than the residential district, and two possible contamination sources rendered the well water at a high risk of contamination. A lavatory was located approximately 30â€“40 meters east of the well and a vegetable garden was beside the top of the well. NoVs were detected in both the well water and the household tap water. Thus, collecting related water samples is important for analyzing the risk factors in outbreaks.</p>
