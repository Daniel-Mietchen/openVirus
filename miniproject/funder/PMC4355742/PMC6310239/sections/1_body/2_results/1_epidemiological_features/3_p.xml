<p>Five of the outbreaks (outbreaks I-III and VII-VIII), had one common characteristic: a farmer’s market was located near the affected colleges, at which the students often ate. During the field investigation, the affected individuals were surveyed about the food items consumed using a questionnaire; the survey indicated that most of the infected cases had a history of eating at the farmer’s market. We believe that the colleges were constantly at risk of foodborne infection due to the absence of regulations on farmer’s markets. The infected cases were not isolated at the college in a timely manner, and transmission occurred via the human-to-human route. The lack of effective supervision of colleges made it more difficult to control the outbreaks in a timely manner.</p>
