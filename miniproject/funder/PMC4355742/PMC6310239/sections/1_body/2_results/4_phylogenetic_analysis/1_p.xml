<p>NoV GII.17 was the predominant genotype appearing in outbreaks during 2015–2016 in Jinan, China. The representative GII.17 reference strain sequences, which were identified during 2007–2016, were obtained from the GenBank database. Phylogenetic analysis of the reference strains demonstrated that the GII.17 strains were divided into two groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209245.g003">Fig 3</xref>): the GII.17 strains isolated in 2007–2011 belonged to Group I, and those isolated in 2012–2016 belonged to Group II. All GII.17 strains responsible for the outbreaks in Jinan belonged to Group II. Furthermore, the GII.17 strains isolated from the Jinan outbreaks shared a higher nucleotide homology with the reference strains isolated in Nanjing in 2015 (KU720511) and Korea in 2016 (KX764869) than with the strain isolated in Korea in 2012 (KC413403).
