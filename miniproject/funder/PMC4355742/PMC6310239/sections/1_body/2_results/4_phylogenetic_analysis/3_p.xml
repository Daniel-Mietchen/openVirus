<p>Three GI genotypes (GI.3, GI.5 and GI.6) were identified in the outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the GI.6 strains were grouped into 2 clusters (GI.6a and GI.6b) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209245.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The GI.6 strains from the outbreaks appeared to be from cluster GI.6a and had a close relationship with the Shandong strain from 2014 (KX245256), suggesting that the predominant GI.6 genotype appeared in China in 2014. All of the GI.5 strains, which were collected from water samples (well water and household tap water) and human specimens in outbreak X, showed high nucleotide sequence homology (99.7%-100%) with each other, implying that the well water was the most likely infection source in outbreak X.
