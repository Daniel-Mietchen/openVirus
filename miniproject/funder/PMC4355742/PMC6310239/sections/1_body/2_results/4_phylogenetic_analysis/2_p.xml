<p>In addition, the other three GII genotypes were detected in the outbreaks. GII.1 and GII.2 were not detected in 2015â€“2016, but began to be found in the outbreaks occurring in the kindergartens in the first quarter of 2017 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209245.g004">Fig 4</xref>). GII.2 was found in the February outbreaks, and GII.1was identified in the March outbreak. The GII.2 strains from the outbreaks were grouped into two subclusters and originated from two infection sources (outbreaks XIII and XIV). All GII.2 strains showed high homology with the Taiwan strain from 2017 (KY596003), which suggested that the KY596003 strain might prevail in Taiwan and in Jinan, China. GII.1 had a higher homology with the Nanjing strain that appeared in 2011 (KM246922) than with the Thailand strain that appeared in 2014 (KR007959), indicating that the KM246922 strain appearing in 2011 re-emerged in 2017. GII.3 strains appeared in the outbreaks in October 2015 and March 2016. The GII.3 strains were more similar to the Anhui strain that appeared in 2015 (KX372685) than to the Pudong strain that appeared in 2012 (KU672109), which suggested temporal evolution of the GII.3 strains.
