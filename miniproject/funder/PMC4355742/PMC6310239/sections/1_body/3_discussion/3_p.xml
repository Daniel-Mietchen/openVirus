<p>The NoV VP1 protein is considered to be closely associated with the infectivity and antigenicity of NoV strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We conducted phylogenetic analysis on a partial VP1 region to understand the evolution of these non-GII.4 NoV strains. Two meaningful results emerged. First, the period of prevalence of each non-GII.4 NoV genotype varied. For example, GII.17 appeared and was the most common genotype in 2015, but its influence declined in 2016. In contrast, GII.2 and GII.1 did not appear until 2017. Second, the genetic characteristics of non-GII.4 NoVs continuously changed. The GI.6 strains identified in three outbreaks, all of which belong to subcluster GI.6a in the phylogenetic tree, had low nucleotide homology with the Taiwan strain from 2015, which belonged to subcluster GI.6b. Furthermore, the novel GII.17 variant was more similar to the Korea strain from 2016 than to the Korea strain from 2012.
