<p>The fifteen outbreaks reported to the Jinan CDC from June 2015 to March 2017 occurred mostly in colleges, kindergartens, and schools. Fourteen of the 15 outbreaks were caused by NoVs, including eight by GII infections and six by mixed infection with GII and GI/RoV-A. Seven predominant genotypes (GII.17, GII.3, GII.2, GII.1, GI.6, GI.5 and GI.3) were identified. Since late 2014, non-GII.4 genotypes have been sporadically associated with outbreaks. In the winter of 2014–2015, a novel GII.17 NoV strain (GII.17; Kawasaki 2014) emerged as a major causative agent of gastroenteritis outbreaks in China and Japan [
