<p>The limitations of this study must be noted. First, although the AGE surveillance system has gradually improved in Jinan since 2015, epidemiological data on AGE outbreaks prior to 2015 were missing. Second, in order to control outbreaks as soon as possible, phylogenetic analyses were performed on the VP1 region of GI and GII NoVs. However, the rapid evolution of the VP1 gene has been speculated to result in immune-escape features and cause new pandemics [

Chan et al. noted that the emerging GII.17 NoV was identified by multiple genetic signatures of histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding and antigenic epitopes, had immune-escape features, caused severe gastroenteritis in previously less-vulnerable populations, and spread rapidly [
