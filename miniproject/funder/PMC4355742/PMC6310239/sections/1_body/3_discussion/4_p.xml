<p>The safety of drinking water has long been a worldwide health issue, especially in developing countries. Contaminated well water is an important transmission vehicle, and schoolchildren are susceptible to waterborne diseases in China [
 <xref rid="pone.0209245.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A waterborne outbreak (outbreak X) in this study occurred in a rural residential district in Jinan. GI.5 strains isolated from the self-supply well water and the household tap water belonged to the same cluster as those isolated from infected residents. However, these findings regarding water contamination were different from those of previous reports. For example, GI.6 and GII.4 were found in Korean groundwater [

Thus, our study enriches the epidemiological data on NoV GI.5 outbreaks in China. Self-supply well water is very common in the rural district of Jinan, and the government should increase the supervision of self-supply well sanitation conditions to ensure access to safe water. In addition, waterborne viral outbreaks are often difficult to recognize. Sensitive methods are needed to detect viruses in environmental samples [
