  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of the GII.17 norovirus strains isolated from outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis based on the partial sequence of the capsid gene encoding the VP1 protein.</title>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining (N-J) method with the Kimura 2-parameter model and 1000 bootstrap replications. Bootstrap values are shown in the phylogenetic tree; values less than 80% are not represented. The bar at the bottom of the figure is proportional to the genetic distances. The black dot represents the GII.17 strains obtained from the outbreaks in Jinan in 2015â€“2016.</p>
