From June 2015 to March 2017, fifteen outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were reported to the Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. To identify the circulating NoV genotypes associated with outbreaks in Jinan, China, 414 specimens from the 15 outbreaks were collected and analyzed for the causative viruses, and phylogenetic analysis was performed on the NoV-positive strains. The NoV detection rate was 57.5% (238/414), and a total of 14 outbreaks were caused by NoVs (eight by infection with genogroup II (GII), five by mixed infection with GI and GII, and one by mixed infection with GII and rotavirus (RoV)-A). A total of 75 NoV sequences were obtained from 13 NoV-positive outbreaks and classified into seven genotypes (38 GII.17, 13 GII.2, 4 GII.3, 4 GII.1, 10 GI.6, 5 GI.5 and 1 GI.3), while GII.4 was not identified. The most prevalent genotype changed yearly during the 2015&#x02013;2017 period. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these NoV genotypes had high homology with the strains circulating worldwide, especially strains from Asian countries and cities. Our study illustrated that multiple non-GII.4 NoV genotypes were prevalent in outbreaks of AGE in Jinan, China. Year-round surveillance of multiple NoV genotypes could help health authorities reduce the impact of NoV outbreaks on public health.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Jinan Institute of Science and Technology Development Project of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>201221064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Lanzheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Jinan Institute of Science and Technology Development Project of China (grant number 201221064), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jnsti.gov.cn/jnsti/technet">http://www.jnsti.gov.cn/jnsti/technet</ext-link> to LZL.

Globally, NoVs are estimated to be associated with 18% of all cases of AGE [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. NoV outbreaks have been reported in congregate settings, such as cruise ships, childcare centers, and long-term care facilities [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The common symptoms are nonbloody diarrhea and/or vomiting accompanied by low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and nausea. Dehydration is the most frequent and dangerous complication [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Outbreaks caused by NoV result in a total of $4.2 billion in direct health care system costs and $60.3 billion in annual societal costs worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. NoV transmission mainly occurs through foodborne and human-to-human transmission via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A low infectious dose facilitates effective NoV transmission. The estimated 50% infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) ranges from 18 to 2800 genomic equivalents [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>NoVs are members of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family and possess a 7.5&#x02013;7.7 kb genome. NoVs are nonenveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. To date, NoVs have been genetically classified into seven genogroups (GI to GVII) and thirty-nine genotypes, including 9 genotypes in GI, 22 in GII, 2 in GIII, 2 in GIV, 1 in GV, 2 in GVI, and 1 in the tentative new GVII genogroup [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. GII.4 has been the predominant genotype associated with gastroenteritis outbreaks and sporadic cases worldwide in the past two decades [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, since 2014, novel non-GII.4 NoV genotypes continue to be reported in outbreaks. In the winter of 2014, GII.17 became the newest circulating genotype among gastroenteritis outbreaks originating in Asia [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Whether the dominant GII.4 strains will be replaced by non-GII.4 NoV genotypes worldwide remains to be seen [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Epidemics of NoV outbreaks have increased substantially in China since the winter of 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Qin and colleagues reported that NoV outbreaks showed an increasing trend from 2006&#x02013;2016 in China. Only 0.8% (1/132) of the identified NoV outbreaks were reported in 2006, whereas 46.2% (61/132) occurred in 2015, and 11.4% (15/132) occurred in the first half of 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The Guidelines on Outbreak Investigation, Prevention and Control of Norovirus Infection (2015) were released in 2015 to standardize the surveillance of NoV outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Jinan is the capital city of Shandong Province in Eastern China and has a total population of seven million. A series of AGE outbreaks have been reported to the Jinan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since June 2015. In the present study, we aimed to determine the circulating NoV genotypes associated with AGE outbreaks in Jinan, China. We further explored the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreaks that occurred from June 2015 to March 2017. This study should help health authorities and policy makers create effective measures to address NoV outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Jinan CDC in China.

In total, 329 human specimens were collected, including 95 stool samples, 213 anal swabs, 13 throat swabs and 8 vomit samples. A total of 85 environmental specimens were obtained from 47 food samples, 26 contaminated water samples and 12 surface swabs. All 414 specimens were tested for NoV, RoV, SaV, Ast, and ADV.</p><p>Five of the outbreaks (outbreaks I-III and VII-VIII), had one common characteristic: a farmer&#x02019;s market was located near the affected colleges, at which the students often ate. During the field investigation, the affected individuals were surveyed about the food items consumed using a questionnaire; the survey indicated that most of the infected cases had a history of eating at the farmer&#x02019;s market. We believe that the colleges were constantly at risk of foodborne infection due to the absence of regulations on farmer&#x02019;s markets. The infected cases were not isolated at the college in a timely manner, and transmission occurred via the human-to-human route. The lack of effective supervision of colleges made it more difficult to control the outbreaks in a timely manner.</p><p>Among five of the other outbreaks, four occurred in kindergartens (outbreaks VI and XIII-XV), and one (outbreak V) occurred at a college. The field investigation showed that the affected individuals came to the kindergartens or college and without any rest. Therefore they came into close contact with others at the kindergartens or college. Using laboratory testing, NoVs were detected in samples from these affected cases. NoVs were easily transmitted via close contact among the children/college students.</p><p>Outbreak IV occurred at construction site D. The affected individuals ate lunch and supper in the construction site cafeteria. A field investigation of employees, food handlers and the sanitation conditions of the cafeteria was conducted. Because the leftovers had been cleaned up, the food samples were not collected. NoVs were identified in the ground sewage from the cafeteria, but no NoVs were detected in barreled drinking water. Outbreak X occurred in residential district H, where household tap water was supplied from a well. The well was located at a lower elevation than the residential district, and two possible contamination sources rendered the well water at a high risk of contamination. A lavatory was located approximately 30&#x02013;40 meters east of the well and a vegetable garden was beside the top of the well. NoVs were detected in both the well water and the household tap water. Thus, collecting related water samples is important for analyzing the risk factors in outbreaks.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Virological screening</title><p>A total of 238 of the 414 (57.5%) specimens collected from these outbreaks were positive for NoV by real-time RT-PCR.

All GII.2 strains showed high homology with the Taiwan strain from 2017 (KY596003), which suggested that the KY596003 strain might prevail in Taiwan and in Jinan, China. GII.1 had a higher homology with the Nanjing strain that appeared in 2011 (KM246922) than with the Thailand strain that appeared in 2014 (KR007959), indicating that the KM246922 strain appearing in 2011 re-emerged in 2017.

Such outbreaks often occur in healthcare facilities, restaurants, cruise ships and institutional settings and have commonly drawn the attention of society. GII.4 has been successfully persistent, with periodic emergence over the past two decades worldwide (GII.4 US95/96 in 1995, GII.4 Farmington Hills in 2002, GII.4 Hunter in 2004, GII.4 Den Haag in 2006, GII.4 New Orleans in 2009, and GII.4 Sydney in 2012) [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, our study focused on the occurrence of non-GII.4 NoVs and the important role of these NoVs in AGE outbreaks in Jinan, China.</p><p>The fifteen outbreaks reported to the Jinan CDC from June 2015 to March 2017 occurred mostly in colleges, kindergartens, and schools. Fourteen of the 15 outbreaks were caused by NoVs, including eight by GII infections and six by mixed infection with GII and GI/RoV-A. Seven predominant genotypes (GII.17, GII.3, GII.2, GII.1, GI.6, GI.5 and GI.3) were identified. Since late 2014, non-GII.4 genotypes have been sporadically associated with outbreaks. In the winter of 2014&#x02013;2015, a novel GII.17 NoV strain (GII.17; Kawasaki 2014) emerged as a major causative agent of gastroenteritis outbreaks in China and Japan [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. During November and December 2016, GII.2 was reported to be the most common genotype in Guangdong and Hong Kong, China [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. During 2014 to 2015, GII.17, GII.3, GI.3, GI.5, and GI.6 were identified in NoV outbreaks in Victoria, Australia, but GII.4 was still the most common genotype detected [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, no GII.4 strain was identified in the outbreaks. Thus, the emergence of diverse non-GII.4 genotypes played an important role in the outbreaks of AGE in Jinan, China.</p><p>The NoV VP1 protein is considered to be closely associated with the infectivity and antigenicity of NoV strains [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We conducted phylogenetic analysis on a partial VP1 region to understand the evolution of these non-GII.4 NoV strains. Two meaningful results emerged. First, the period of prevalence of each non-GII.4 NoV genotype varied. For example, GII.17 appeared and was the most common genotype in 2015, but its influence declined in 2016. In contrast, GII.2 and GII.1 did not appear until 2017. Second, the genetic characteristics of non-GII.4 NoVs continuously changed. The GI.6 strains identified in three outbreaks, all of which belong to subcluster GI.6a in the phylogenetic tree, had low nucleotide homology with the Taiwan strain from 2015, which belonged to subcluster GI.6b. Furthermore, the novel GII.17 variant was more similar to the Korea strain from 2016 than to the Korea strain from 2012.</p><p>The safety of drinking water has long been a worldwide health issue, especially in developing countries. Contaminated well water is an important transmission vehicle, and schoolchildren are susceptible to waterborne diseases in China [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A waterborne outbreak (outbreak X) in this study occurred in a rural residential district in Jinan. GI.5 strains isolated from the self-supply well water and the household tap water belonged to the same cluster as those isolated from infected residents. However, these findings regarding water contamination were different from those of previous reports. For example, GI.6 and GII.4 were found in Korean groundwater [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and GII.17 accounted for 76% of the NoV contamination of surface water in Kenya [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Li and colleagues first reported an outbreak of GI.5 in Shanghai in February 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Outbreak X occurred in May 2016, prior to the outbreak in Shanghai. Thus, our study enriches the epidemiological data on NoV GI.5 outbreaks in China. Self-supply well water is very common in the rural district of Jinan, and the government should increase the supervision of self-supply well sanitation conditions to ensure access to safe water. In addition, waterborne viral outbreaks are often difficult to recognize. Sensitive methods are needed to detect viruses in environmental samples [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our study showed that concentrating contaminated water via a centrifugal filter is an effective way to detect NoVs.</p><p>Ten outbreaks (outbreaks I-III, V-VIII and XIII-XV) in our study were associated with human-to-human transmission. These outbreaks occurred in colleges/kindergartens and had the common characteristic that the NoV-infected cases were not isolated in a timely manner. Li and colleagues reported that contact between students and individuals with suspected cases led to a 5.6-fold increase in the infection risk compared to the absence of contact with suspected cases [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Students and children are usually active and in close contact with others. Thus, the prompt identification of cases and the timely isolation of the NoV-infected cases is important to control NoV outbreaks.</p><p>The limitations of this study must be noted. First, although the AGE surveillance system has gradually improved in Jinan since 2015, epidemiological data on AGE outbreaks prior to 2015 were missing. Second, in order to control outbreaks as soon as possible, phylogenetic analyses were performed on the VP1 region of GI and GII NoVs. However, the rapid evolution of the VP1 gene has been speculated to result in immune-escape features and cause new pandemics [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Chan et al. noted that the emerging GII.17 NoV was identified by multiple genetic signatures of histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding and antigenic epitopes, had immune-escape features, caused severe gastroenteritis in previously less-vulnerable populations, and spread rapidly [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the hypervariable P2 domain has been shown to be a powerful tool for genotyping and tracking outbreak-related samples [<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209245.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Efforts to improve molecular analysis approaches for different NoV gene regions are underway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that non-GII.4 NoV genotypes were the predominant circulating genotypes and were responsible for AGE outbreaks from 2015 to 2017 in Jinan, China. Non-GII.4 NoVs have been increasingly recognized as important causative agents of these outbreaks. In addition, the great diversity of the prevailing non-GII.4 strains, as well as the evolutionary features of these strains, demonstrated that the emergence of new NoV strains often leads to the occurrence of outbreaks. Thus, the implementation of year-round molecular epidemiological surveillance of NoVs is necessary to reduce the impact of NoVs on public health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are particularly grateful to Xingyi Geng, Shuhui Xu, Huaru Xu, Zhan Li and the local CDC for sample collection and field investigations in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0209245.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>National Virus Reference Laboratory</collab> (<year>2016</year>). <source>UCD NVRL Annual Reference Virology Report 2015</source>. <publisher-loc>Ireland</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>UCD National Virus Reference Laboratory, University College Dublin</publisher-name> Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nvrl.ucd.ie/node/100">https://nvrl.ucd.ie/node/100</ext-link>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0209245.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Verhoef</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Premkumar</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Parashar</surname><given-names>UD</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
