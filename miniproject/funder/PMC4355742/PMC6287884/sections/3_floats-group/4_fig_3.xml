  <title>PhyML tree of insect-specific flavivirus NS5 gene sequences associated with mosquito pools from Lake Baringo and Lake Victoria.</title>
  <p>The phylogeny was created from 779–908 nt fragments. GenBank accessions are indicated in parentheses, followed by collection country with province in parentheses, and the mosquito species in which they were identified. Viruses identified from mosquitoes reared from larval collections in this study are indicated in bold with specimen ID’s in brackets. Bootstrap percentages at the major nodes are of agreement among 1000 replicates. The branch length scale represents substitutions per site. The gaps indicated in the branches to the yellow fever virus outgroup represent 3.0 substitutions per site. (LB: Lake Baringo; LV: Lake Victoria; NEP: North-Eastern Province; WP: Western Province; CnP: Central Province; CP: Coastal Province; RVP: Rift Valley Province).</p>
