 <p>The East African region is endemic to diverse mosquito-transmitted arboviruses, though little is known about the role of vertical transmission in maintaining these viruses within mosquito vector populations during inter-epidemic periods. We sampled mosquito larvae from the Lake Baringo and Lake Victoria regions of Kenya and reared them to adults in the laboratory before screening them for mosquito-associated viruses by multiplex RT-PCR-HRM, cell culture, and sequencing. From the Lake Victoria region, we detected the arbovirus, Bunyamwera, which can cause febrile illness in humans, in 
  <italic>Culex univittatus</italic> and vector competent 
  <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes. We also identified diverse insect-specific flaviviruses in 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, 
  <italic>Aedes luteocephalus</italic>, 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. and 
  <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> mosquitoes. From the Lake Baringo region, we detected Anopheles flavivirus in 
  <italic>An</italic>. 
  <italic>gambiae</italic> mosquitoes. These findings demonstrate that naturally occurring vertical transmission potentially maintains viruses in circulation within the sampled vector species populations. Therefore, mosquitoes may potentially transmit a pathogenic arbovirus during their first bite after emergence. Because various insect-specific flaviviruses have recently been found to either inhibit or enhance replication of specific arboviruses in mosquitoes, their vertical transmission, as observed in this study, has implications as to their potential impact on both horizontal and vertical transmission of medically important arboviruses.
