<p>Nucleic acid (NA) was extracted from the 210-μl mosquito homogenate aliquots using the MagNA 96 Pure DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) in a MagNA Pure 96 automatic extractor (Roche Applied Science) and eluted into a final volume of 50 μl according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A reverse transcription-multiplex polymerase chain reaction with high-resolution melting (RT-PCR-HRM) analysis based arbovirus screening protocol recently developed by Villinger et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was used to rapidly screen many samples and detect the presence of four arbovirus genera, namely, 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> (family Togaviridae), 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (family Flaviviridae), Bunyamwera-group 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> (family Peribunyaviridae), and 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> (family Phenuiviridae). Briefly, the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription (RT) kit (Life Technologies, USA) was used to synthesize complimentary DNA (cDNA) of the nucleic acid extracts. cDNA synthesis from 5 μl of extracted nucleic acids was performed in 10-μl reaction volumes with final concentrations of 1x RT Buffer, 4 mM dNTP mix, 2.5 U/μl MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase, 1 U/μl RNase Inhibitor, 600 μM non-ribosomal random hexanucleotide primers [
