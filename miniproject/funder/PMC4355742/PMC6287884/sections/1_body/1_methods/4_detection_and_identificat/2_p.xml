<p>We used established multiplex RT-PCR thermocycling conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in a HRM capable Rotor-Gene Q real-time PCR thermocycler (Qiagen, Redwood city, CA, USA) to screen for virus sequences in cDNA templates. Ten microliter reactions consisting of 1 μl cDNA template, 5 μl 2x MyTaq HS Mix (Bioline, UK), 1 μl of 50 μM SYTO-9 saturating intercalating dye (Life Technologies), and multiplex PCR primers at concentrations given in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The QIAgility robot (Qiagen) for liquid handling was used to set up the reaction mixture. Touchdown PCR cycling conditions as detailed by Villinger et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] included an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 seconds, annealing at 63.5–47.5°C for 20 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 5–30 seconds, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 3 minutes. Immediately after PCR, the product was held at 40°C for 1 minute before HRM analyses of PCR product double stranded DNA stability by measuring SYTO-9 fluorescence at 0.1°C temperature intervals increasing every 2 seconds from 75°C to 90°C. PCR grade water was used as negative control, and Bunyamwera (
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>), dengue and West Nile (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), sindbis and Middelburg (
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>), and Rift Valley fever (
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>) viruses were used as positive controls. Positive samples were re-run in singleplex reactions (using primers from only one genus; 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Amplicons from singleplex runs were purified with ExoSAP-IT for PCR Product Kit (Affymetrix Inc., USA) and Sanger-sequenced at Macrogen (Korea). Samples that were positive for the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus by HRM analysis were further sequenced from nested PCR products using the 2NS5F (5’-GCNATNTGGTWYATGTGG-3’) and 2NS5Re (5’-TRTCTTCNGTNGTCATCC-3’) primers that amplify longer nucleotide fragments (~930 nt) of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> NS5 genes [
