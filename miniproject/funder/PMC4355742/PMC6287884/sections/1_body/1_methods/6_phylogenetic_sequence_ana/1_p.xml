<p>Using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], initial searches were performed for comparison of all obtained virus sequences with those in GenBank. This was followed by sequence alignments using the default settings of the MAFFT v7.017 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] plugin in Geneious software, to identify virus segments. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic relationships of the studyâ€™s insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs) NS5 sequences with those of related ISFVs were analyzed using PhyML version 3.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], employing the Akaike information criterion [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] for automatic selection of the general time reversible (GTR) sequence evolution model. Tree topologies were estimated using nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) improvements over 1000 bootstrap replicates. Rooting the phylogeny to the yellow fever vaccine strain sequence (GenBank accession NC_002031) as an outgroup, the phylogenetic tree was depicted using FIGTREE version 1.4.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
