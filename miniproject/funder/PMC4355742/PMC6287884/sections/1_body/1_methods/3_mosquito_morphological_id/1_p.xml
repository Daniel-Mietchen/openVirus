<p>All reared adult mosquitoes were identified and sorted using morphological keys [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] in petri-dishes on frozen ice packs to keep them cold and to avoid degradation of any viruses in the samples. The ice packs were wrapped with paper towels to absorb moisture and prevent frosting of the petri-dishes. We stored pools of ≤25 reared adult mosquitoes in well-labelled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes according to species, larval collection sites, sex, and dates in tubes in a -80°C freezer.
