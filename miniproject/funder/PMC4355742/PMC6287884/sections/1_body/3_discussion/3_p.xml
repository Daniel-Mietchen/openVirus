<p>Recent laboratory vector competence studies have found that Bunyamwera virus can be competently transmitted by 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and can naturally infect 
 <italic>Aedeomyia africana</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles coustani</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mansonia africana</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> was found to be refractory to Bunyamwera virus infection experimentally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate that Bunyamwera infection persists from larval stages to adults in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>univittatus</italic> mosquitoes as well as in Bunyamwera competent 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic>. This expands the mosquito species, and indeed genera, that may play key roles in maintaining Bunyamwera virus in circulation. Though the vectorial competence of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>univittatus</italic> to transmit Bunyamwera virus has not been established, the species is thought to prefer birds as a source of bloodmeals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and has recently been found to also feed on dogs, donkeys, sheep, and toads [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], as well as humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>univittatus</italic> may have a greater potential for transmitting arboviruses between birds and other vertebrates to humans, in contrast to the more anthropophilic 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic>.
