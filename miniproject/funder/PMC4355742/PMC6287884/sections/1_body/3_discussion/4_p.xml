<p>The vertically transmitted ISFVs, AeFV and CFAV, were only detected in samples from the Lake Victoria region, not only in

 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], Aedes flavivirus, which is phylogenetically distinct from related Culex flaviviruses, has previously also been found in

 <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes sampled in Italy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Our findings therefore support not only the vertical transmission of ISFVs in mosquitoes, but also the potential of occasional horizontal transmission between mosquito species and genera. Therefore, ISFVs in mosquito populations represent a promising model for the study of the evolution of host specificity of flavivirus infectivity [
