<p>We documented the vertical transmission of the 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, Bunyamwera virus, from naturally occurring infections in two mosquito species–
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>univittatus</italic>–the former of which has previously been found to competently transmit Bunyamwera virus during blood-feeding on suckling mice [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This is of public health importance and needs to be monitored closely, as Bunyamwera is an important cause of acute febrile illness in humans (Bunyamwera fever) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] that is able to reassort with closely related arboviruses to form new viruses, such as Ngari virus, which can cause haemorrhagic fever in humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. With the well-established role of vertical transmission in

 <italic>triseriatus</italic> mosquitoes of the closely related 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, La Crosse virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the potential of Bunyamwera virus to remain in circulation by vertical transmission within mosquito populations in East Africa, highlights the importance of control strategies focused on vectors and the replication of arboviruses within the vector.
