<p>The Lake Victoria and Lake Baringo regions of Kenya have historically been associated with arboviral diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and have unique lake and island biogeographies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in which arboviruses exist [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Outbreaks in the 1960s around the Lake Victoria basin involved Semliki Forest, chikungunya, and o’nyong-nyong viruses that are vectored by 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito species, respectively [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. More recent studies have found seropositivity for arboviruses in humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During the recent 2006–2007 Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Baringo County, 10 mosquito species were implicated as potential vectors, among which 
 <italic>Aedes pembaensis</italic> Theobald, 
 <italic>Culex univittatus</italic> Theobald, and 
 <italic>Culex bitaeniorhynchus</italic> Giles were reported as potential vectors for the first time [
