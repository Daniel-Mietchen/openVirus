  <p>Experimental setting of the transmission study. Challenged animals were placed on the outer half of the divided units along with a nonchallenged, direct-contact animal. Indirect-contact animals were placed in the inner half of the units. Directional airflow is illustrated by arrows, where clean air was introduced in the caging system from the outer half of the unit, passed through each cage, and evacuated through the middle section of the system. Challenged animals are represented by red biohazard symbols, while black biohazard symbols represent nonchallenged animals. Male ferrets were located on the left, and female ferrets were on the right.</p>
