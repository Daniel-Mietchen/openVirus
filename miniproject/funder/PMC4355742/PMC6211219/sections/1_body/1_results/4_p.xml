<p>All animals were assessed for the presence of EBOV glycoprotein-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at the time of euthanasia. DM1 (day 10) and DF3 (day 26) had IgM antibody levels below the limit of detection of the assay, while all other animals were seropositive by the end of the experiment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">d</xref>). Therefore, all animals were seropositive for either one or both antibody isotypes at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that EBOV transmission via indirect contact is less efficient than direct contact in inducing EVD. As such, only 1 of 6 indirect-contact ferrets received an exposure dose of live virus sufficiently high to result in EVD (
