<p>As infection progressed, animals were evaluated for viremia and virus shedding through the oral, nasal, and rectal mucosae. The average peak viremia levels were 1.79E9 genome equivalent copies (GEQ)/ml and 8.4E8 GEQ/ml for CM1 to CM3 and CF1 to CF3, respectively. The difference was not found to be statistically different [one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA); F(3,6) = 0.4677]. DM1 to DM3 had a mean peak viremia level of 3.2E11 GEQ/ml, while IM3 did not have an available sample since it was found dead (

The average peak levels of oral, nasal, and rectal shedding for CM1 to CM3 were 1.6E7 GEQ/ml, 9.0E5 GEQ/ml, and 4.0E7 GEQ/ml, respectively. Similarly, CF1 to CF3 exhibited average peak levels of oral, nasal, and rectal shedding of 1.4E7 GEQ/ml, 1.3E6 GEQ/ml, and 7.2E7 GEQ/ml, respectively (

Environmental swabs on the front and back of the metal mesh and the air exhaust on the side of the indirect-contact animals were negative for EBOV by reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), with the exception of the air exhaust by IM2 on day 7, which was positive for EBOV at 2.3E3 GEQ/ml. These results indicate that low levels of EBOV can be detected in the surroundings of indirect-contact animals, supporting the hypothesis that IM3 was most likely infected by fomites.
