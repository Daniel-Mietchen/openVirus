<p>It is well accepted that human-to-human transmission of EBOV in outbreaks occurs through direct contact with infected bodily fluids (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); however, there have been few studies on EBOV transmission in animal models. A better understanding of all the potential modes of EBOV transmission is important for protecting the general population and clinical personnel against infection. Transmission of EBOV-Mayinga from infected to naive rhesus macaques in the absence of direct contact has been previously described (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but similar conditions involving EBOV-Kikwit and cynomolgus macaques did not result in transmission (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Pig-to-pig (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and pig-to-NHP (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) transmissions have been described for EBOV-Kikwit, and a guinea pig model of EBOV transmission was established using guinea pig-adapted EBOV-Mayinga, the first rodent model for transmission studies (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).
