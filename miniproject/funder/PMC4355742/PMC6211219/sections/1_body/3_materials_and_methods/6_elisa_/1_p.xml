<p>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for analysis of Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV GP)-specific IgM and IgG were performed using recombinant EbolaGPΔTM (IBT Bioservices catalog no. 0501-025) as the antigen. Briefly, 96-well half-well plates were coated with 30 μl of protein at a concentration of 1 µg/ml, left at 4°C overnight, and then blocked for 1 h at 37°C with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)–5% skim milk the following morning. Plates were then washed 3 times with 0.1% PBS–Tween, and the serum dilutions were applied to the plates and incubated at 37°C for 1 h followed by washing 3 times with 0.1% PBS–Tween. Goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase (IgG-HRP) (KPL catalog no. 074-1006) was added for 1 h at 37°C at a 1:1,500 dilution. The plates were read using ABTS [2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)] peroxidase substrate (Thermo Fisher catalog no. 37615), which was applied at 50 µl per well, and left for 30 min before reading. Each sample was assayed in duplicate. A titer was considered to represent a positive result if the average value was 7.733 standard deviations above background.</p>
