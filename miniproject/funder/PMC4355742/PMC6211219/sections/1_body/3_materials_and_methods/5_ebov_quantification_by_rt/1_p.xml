<p>Oral, rectal, and environmental swabs, as well as nasal washes, were collected in 1 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), and RNA was extracted from 140 µl of this solution within hours of collection. For titers measured by RT-qPCR, total RNA was extracted from whole blood or DMEM from swab samples with a QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen). EBOV was detected with a LightCycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis Probes (Roche) kit, with the RNA polymerase (nucleotides 16472 to 16538; accession no.

The reaction conditions were as follows: 63°C for 3 min, 95°C for 30 s, and cycling of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s for 45 cycles on an ABI StepOnePlus system. The sequences of the primers used were as follows: for EBOVLF2, CAGCCAGCAATTTCTTCCAT; for EBOVLR2, TTTCGGTTGCTGTTTCTGTG; and for EBOVLP2FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-ATCATTGGCGTACTGGAGGAGCAG-black hole quencher 1 (BHQ1). GEQ data were determined using the formula 
 <italic>y</italic> = (1,000 × 
 <italic>t</italic> × 
 <italic>n</italic>)/(
 <italic>b</italic> × 
 <italic>r</italic>), where 
 <italic>t</italic> represents the number of copies in the qPCR reaction (calculated from a standard curve using a plasmid containing the L gene of EBOV), 
 <italic>n</italic> represents the elution volume of the RNA extraction, 
 <italic>b</italic> represents the volume of blood from which the RNA was extracted, and 
 <italic>r</italic> represents the volume of RNA used in the qPCR reaction.
