  <title>Delivery does not impact transport of AAV expressed mAb to mucosa.</title>
  <p>Fractional mucosal Ab translocation is shown for AAV injected NHP for nasal, rectal and buccal compartments (top, middle, bottom, respectively), stratified by dose (all receive 2 shots, left) or number of shots (all receive 2 x 10
   <sup>12</sup> gc/animal total, right). Data points outside the linear range of standard curves were excluded. No nasal swab measurements for the low dose animal (2 x 10
   <sup>11</sup> gc/animal) were detectable (upper left).
