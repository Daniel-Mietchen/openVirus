  <title>Screening potential AAV8 constructs in mice.</title>
  <p>(A) Antibody concentration as measured by ELISA in mice at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (red, green, blue, respectively) injected with AAV8-Ab (2.5 x 10
   <sup>10</sup> gc/animal) (ND, not done). (B) Neutralization regression curves are shown for ITS01, ITS08, ITS10, ITS11, ITS06.02 (panels, left to right) from purified mAb (blue, open circles) or sera from AAV injected mice (red, open squares) from 2 replicates at 3 timepoints, against either the SIV tier 1 smE660.A8 or the tier 2 smE660.2A5.
