  <title>Lack of measurable ADA elicitation after mAb infusion.</title>
  <p>Rhesus macaques were infused with ITS01-LS (n = 2, blue) or ITS09.01-LS (n = 2, red) four times (denoted on x-axis by numbered circles) over the course of ~60 weeks. Averages of duplicate measurements of anti-drug antibody responses against ITS01-LS (upper) or ITS09.01-LS (lower) for all four animals are shown. Anti-ITS01-LS relative units are standardized based on a monoclonal anti-ITS01-LS standard; anti-ITS09.01-LS relative units are expressed in electrochemical units as no anti-idiotypic mAb has been isolated. Limits of detection are denoted by hashed lines for ITS01-LS and ITS09.01-LS.</p>
