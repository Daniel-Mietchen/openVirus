  <title>Dose and injection site number titration of AAV administration.</title>
  <p>(A) Absolute (upper panels) or fractional (lower panels) serum antibody levels of ITS01, ITS06.02 or both are shown as a smoothed fit with 95% confidence interval shading for varying doses (left panels) or shots (right panels). At the lowest dose, data for a single animal is shown (the other one animal showed no expression of transgene). Animals received 2 injections into the quadriceps with AAV8-ITS01 and/or AAV8-ITS06.02 at low, medium, high doses (2 x 10
   <sup>11</sup> (n = 1; green), 2 x 10
   <sup>12</sup> (n = 24; cyan), 2 x 10
   <sup>13</sup> (n = 6; violet) gc/animal, respectively). Controls received no injections (n = 16; gray). For varying shots, animals received 2 x 10
   <sup>12</sup> gc/animal spread across 1, 2, 4, 8 injection sites (1: R quadriceps (n = 2; orange), 2: both quadriceps (n = 24; cyan), 4: both quadriceps and gastrocnemii (n = 2; magenta), 8: both quadriceps, gastrocnemii, deltoids and biceps (n = 2; blue), respectively). (B) Fractional mucosal transgene IgG is shown for individual macaques in mucosal compartments (n = 28). A scale adjustment is an x-axis break to emphasize early mucosal accumulation denoted by diagonal hashes between 4 and 5 weeks post AAV. (C) The correlation between serum versus rectal transgene mAb is shown for weeks 2, 4, and 5â€“24 post AAV. Points are colored by number of shots and point shapes denote dose, low, medium or high as noted in the legend.
