  <title>Pharmacokinetics of infused anti-SIV env mAbs.</title>
  <p>ITS01-LS (blue; n = 2) and ITS09.01-LS (red; n = 2) were infused intravenously 4 times (indicated on x-axis) into NHP at 30 mg/kg (solid lines) or 3 mg/kg (hashed line) and measured by ELISA. The absolute serum (A) and fractional mucosal (B) expression in rectal biopsies (upper) and swabs (lower) are shown. (C) Fractional mucosal mAb correlated with fractional serum mAb for both biopsies (left) and swabs (right); linear regression is fit (solid lines) with a 95% confidence interval (shaded area). (D) Serum mAb half lives are expressed in days by animal and infusion number in table format, with average and standard deviation across all four infusions.</p>
