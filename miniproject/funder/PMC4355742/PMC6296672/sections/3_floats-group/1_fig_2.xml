  <title>Impact of anti-vector immunity on transgene expression.</title>
  <p>(A) Anti-vector reactivity and (B) expression of ITS01 is shown for the six animals of 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Animals with low (A10V030; orange) and intermediate (A10V026; purple) pre-existing anti-vector immunity are highlighted. After 6 months, two of these animals were re-injected with 1 x 10
   <sup>13</sup> gc AAV8-ITS01 in the right quadriceps. (C) Anti-AAV8 reactivity was boosted, however (D) no increase in serum ITS01 was observed. Anti-AAV8 measurements are in arbitrary optical density (OD
   <sub>450nm</sub>)/ml units.
