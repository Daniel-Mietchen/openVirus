  <title>Passively infused in vitro produced Ab exhibits clearance of selected glycosylated Ab species.</title>
  <p>Glycans were eluted from serum anti-SIV env reactive mAbs from passively immunized animals and analyzed via capillary electrophoresis. (A-D) Grouped glycan species are displayed as a percent of total glycans for animals receiving infusion of purified NAb are compared across time. (E) Individual species of glycans are quantified as a percent of total and compared between across time for infused animals.</p>
