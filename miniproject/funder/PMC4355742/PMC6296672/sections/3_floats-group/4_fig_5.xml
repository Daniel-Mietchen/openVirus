  <title>AAV-expressed mAb exhibit a distinct glycosylation profile from 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> purified or naturally secreted mAb.
  </title>
  <p>Glycans were eluted from serum anti-SIV env reactive mAbs from passively immunized or SIV-infected animals and analyzed via capillary electrophoresis. (A-D) Analysis of total grouped glycan species are displayed as a percent of total glycans (E) Individual glycan species of are quantified as a percent of all glycans and compared by derivation. (F-I) Analysis of total grouped glycan species of AAV expressed NAbs are compared across time. (J) Individual glycan species of are quantified as a percent of all glycans and compared across time for AAV derived antibodies. (A-D, F-I) Differences between groups reaching p ≤ 0.001 are denoted by black lines. (E, J) Differences between groups of individual glycans reaching p ≤ 0.001 are described in text.</p>
