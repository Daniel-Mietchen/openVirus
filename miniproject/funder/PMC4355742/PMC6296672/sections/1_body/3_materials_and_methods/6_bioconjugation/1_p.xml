<p>Antibodies were biotinylated (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO., USA) or sulfo-tagged (Meso-Scale Discovery) using activated NHS-ester chemistry. Antibodies were buffer exchanged into 100 mM carbonate buffer pH 8.4 and adjusted to 1 mg/ml. NHS activated tags (biotin or sulfotag) were reconstituted in DMSO anhydrous to 10 mg/ml and 3 nM, respectively and 8 Î¼g or 500 nmoles were added to buffer exchanged IgG. The reaction was incubated for 1 hour at RT in the dark with gentle agitation. The reactions were simultaneously desalted and buffer exchanged twice using zeba spin columns 40 MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA., USA) into 10 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl + 0.1% NaN
 <sub>3</sub> pH 8.2.
