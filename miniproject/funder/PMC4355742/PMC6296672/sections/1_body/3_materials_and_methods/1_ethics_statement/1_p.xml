<p>All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and all animals were housed and cared for in accordance with local state, federal and institute policies in an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facility with stringent standard operating procedures and compliant with U.S. Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and Regulations, the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and all applicable NIH Policies on 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> research. These experiments were carried out under the following protocol numbers (VRC-14-475, VRC-14-499, VRC-14-487). All animals were monitored carefully by veterinary staff. To date, no adverse events have been associated with these immunizations. The NHP study was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) set forth under the Regulations and Standards in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 9 CFR, Chapter 1, Subchapter A—Animal Welfare, Parts 1, 2, and 3. Approval of this study by the VRC ACUC ensured compliance with AWA requirements for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological and physical well-being of nonhuman primates. Specific humane interventions are described in the nonhuman primate protocol, including detailed descriptions of monitoring frequency, use of anesthesia and analgesia for procedures, and humane method of euthanasia based upon the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines on Euthanasia, or as recommended by the veterinary staff. Sedation was performed using Ketamine Hydrochloride 5.0–10.0 mg/kg IM or with xylazine 0.5–1.0 mg/kg, as required. Upon completion of the study animals were made available to other investigators according to the Vaccine Research Center Policy on post-study disposition of nonhuman primates. Any nonhuman primates that could be used in other research protocols, by criteria defined in this policy, were euthanized at the discretion of the PI via the following method: exsanguination while under a deep surgical plane of anesthesia induced by sodium pentobarbital, 10–15 mg/kg IV. Euthanasia was performed under the guidance of the veterinary staff. Euthanasia was followed by a full gross and histopathologic examination of a full range of tissues. All carcasses were disposed of by incineration.
