<p>Pseudovirus stocks were generated and titrated. Breifly, 293T cells cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were plated at 2 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/flask in a T75 flask. Cells were co-transfected on day 1 with 10 μg of ΔEnv-SG3 HIV plasmid backbone and 3.3 μg envelope expression plasmid of the desired pseudotype using 40 μl Fugene transfection reagent (Promega) in 800 μl serum free media. Fresh culture media was replaced on day 1 post transfection. Supernatant containing virus was harvested on day 2 post-transfection, filtered at .45 μ (Merck-Milipore; Billerica, MA., USA), aliquoted and frozen at—80°C.
