<p>Plasmids containing packaging component for AAV8 capsid plus the desired antibody expression transgene containing chimeric genome were co-transfected into 293 cells. Supernatants were harvested and viral vectors were precipitated using PEG8000 (Sigma-Aldrich) and pelleted by centrifugation. Viral pellets were subjected to 2 rounds of CsCl centrifugation (60,000 RPM x 24 hours) and AAV factions were collected via syringe. Vectors were desalted and concentrated to 3â€“3.6 x 10
 <sup>13</sup> gc/ml and frozen. All AAV lots were tested for purity via SDS-PAGE and for expression in SCID mice.
