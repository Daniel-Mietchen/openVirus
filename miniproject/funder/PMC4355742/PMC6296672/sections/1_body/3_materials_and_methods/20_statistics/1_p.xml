<p>All statistical analyses were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (SAS Institute Inc.; Cary, NC, USA). Differences in antibody expression levels over time were calculated using a matched pairs model to perform a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Correlation of relative mucosal and serum mAb were performed by linear fit of the Log
 <sub>10</sub> of the data by compartment (rectal, nasal, or saliva sponges, or rectal biospies) at weeks 2, 4, or 5â€“24. Covariates analysis was performed on Log
 <sub>10</sub> of relative mucosal data to control for contributions of dose and number of injections in AAV immunized animals. Tests between multiple groups were performed using nonparametric Steel-Dwass to adjust for multiple comparisons. Comparisons between two groups were performed using Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sums test where data were not normally distributed. Comparison of mean serum antibody levels between transgenes across time for statistically significant differences was performed using matched pairs analysis. Smoothed fits were generated using R (version 3.4.0).
