<p>Our goal was to determine the feasibility of antibody gene transfer using AAV8 in rhesus macaques as a model for passive immunization interventions in humans. Healthy male and female Macaca mullatta animals were used, all were of Indian origin except where noted. Based on the literature, we expected expression of antibody might be difficult to achieve and thus began with a pilot study of 6 NHP at high dose. Given the robust expression observed, we sought to further optimize and characterize our system of passive immunization by altering dose (Indian origin macaques) and number of shots (Chinese origin macaques). Given the success of delivery at 2 x 10
 <sup>12</sup> gc/animal, we delivered antibody via AAV8 at this dose and 5 x 10
 <sup>12</sup> gc/animal in larger challenge studies, including relevant antibody delivery data here. Two outliers were excluded from averages of serum antibody; a control monkey with high background serum reactivity in our ITS01 quantitation and one monkey given AAV at low dose that did not show transgene expression. All macaques included our protection analysis were of Indian origin. Rates of infection and viral loads between historic and contemporaneous controls were comparable, as previously observed with this challenge stock. Two monkeys were censored after the second challenge in our initial protection study due to false positive SIV viral load measurement. Sample collection endpoints were at least 25 weeks post AAV.
