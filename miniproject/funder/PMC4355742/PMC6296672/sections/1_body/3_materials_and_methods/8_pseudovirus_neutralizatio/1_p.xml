<p>The pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed as previously described.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] In brief, mAb/serum were serially diluted 5-fold for a series of 8 dilutions and incubated with previously titrated pseudovirus for 30’ in 96-well black culture plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following incubation, 10
 <sup>4</sup> TZM-bl cells are added to wells in 20 μl and incubated overnight. The following day 80 μl additional medium was added. 24 hours later, 50 μl of Steady-Glo lysis/luciferase substrate reagent solution (Promega; Madison, WI., USA) was added to each well. The data was acquired using a Spectramax luminometer (Molecular Devices). Neutralization is calculated as a 1 –sample RLU / baseline control RLU after background subtraction.
