<p>Transgene antibodies were extracted from tissue biopsies and mucosal swabs as previously described.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] Briefly, tissue biopsies were transferred to and dissociated in microtubes using a micropestle (VWR International; Radnor, PA., USA) in PBS plus protease inhibitor (Roche; Basel, Switzerland). Samples were spun at 15000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min. Supernatant was filtered using Spin-X tubes (Corning Life Sciences; Corning, NY., USA) with .22 μm sterile filter (Sigma-Aldrich) and spun as before. Antibody was extracted from muscosal swabs by soaking Wek-Cel sponge spears in 300 μl elution buffer (PBS + protease inhibitor + 0.5% IGEPAL + 0.25% BSA) for 5 minutes in Spin-X tubes with .22 μm sterile filters. Tubes containing sponges and buffer were spun as before. Following filtration, an additional 300 μl was applied to sponges and tubes were spun as before. Saliva was collected by spinning Salivette tubes (Sarstedt; Nümbrecht, Germany) at 3000 x g for 10’. Antibody in extracted samples were quantified as above using a single 1:5 dilution point for transgene antibody and 1:100–1000 for total IgG detection. Antibody concentration in sera/mucosal extracts were calculated based on standard curve. For a given sample, the estimate of the lowest in-range dilution was included as the final estimate of mAb concentration. Mucosal extracts with blood contamination and were excluded based on visual observation.
