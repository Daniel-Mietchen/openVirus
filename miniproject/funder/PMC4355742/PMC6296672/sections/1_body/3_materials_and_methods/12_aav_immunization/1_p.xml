<p>To screen constructs, SCID mice were immunized with 2.5x10
 <sup>10</sup> gc total of AAV8-DJ vectors (n = 1 per construct) containing anti-SIV Env antibody genes via the intramuscular injection into the gastrocnemius in a volume of 100μl. Non-human primates were immunized with AAV8-DJ vectors containing anti-SIV Env antibody genes via the intramuscular route. Intramuscular injection was distributed over 1, 2, 4, or 8 injections into the right quadriceps, both quadriceps, both quads and gastrocnemius, or quads, gastrocs, biceps brachii and deltoids (respectively). Injection volumes were 250 or 500 μl for a total dose between 2 x 10
 <sup>11</sup> and 2 x 10
 <sup>13</sup> gc/animal.
