<p>The primary site for biosampling was the femoral vein but other sites such as the saphenous or cephalic tail veins were used according to the approved protocol, at the discretion of veterinary staff. Bleeds were 5 ml in serum separator tubes (SST) or EDTA tubes using 20â€“22 g needles and either syringes or vacuum tubes (Becton Dickinson and Co.). The blood volumes removed from each monkey were based on: 1) the current assessment that total blood volume of a rhesus monkey is approximately 6% of its total body weight (60 g/kg); 2) the maximum blood volume removed did not exceed 20% (12 ml/kg) per month, with no more than 15% (9 ml/kg) removed during any single draw; and 3) ongoing experience and hematological observations in each monkey.</p>
