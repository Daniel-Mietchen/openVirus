<p>Antibody titers were quantified from heat-inactivated sera using the Meso-Scale Discovery Sector 2400 platform as previously described (Meso-Scale Discovery; Rockville, MD., USA).[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] Breifly, MSD 384 well streptavidin coated plates were blocked for 1 hr at RT using 35μl 5% (W/V) MSD blocker A buffer shaking at 600RPM. Plates were washed 6 times and incubated with a biotin-bait conjugate for 60’ at RT shaking at 600RPM. For ITS01 and ITS06.02, anti-idiotype antibodies were generated in mice as described previously (Genscript; Piscataway, NJ., USA).[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] The clones 17B4-IgG1 (mouse anti-ITS01), 8A4-IgG1 (mouse anti-ITS06.02) and 44A11-IgG1 (mouse anti-ITS52) were selected based on maximum binding to target with minimal off target reactivity. These antibodies were biotinylated and used as coat protein at 1 μg/ml. For total IgG quantitation, coat protein was mouse anti-rhesus IgG-biotin (Life Diagnostics; Westchester, PA., USA, clone 10C2-9) at 4 μg/ml. For total anti-Env antibody, SIVmac239 gp140-FT was enzymatically biotinylated using BirA according to manufacturer’s instructions (Avidity L.L.C.; Aurora, CO, USA). ITS52 in sera could not be detected and animals receiving only this antibody were excluded from all analyses, those receiving ITS01 + ITS06.02 + ITS52 were grouped with ITS01 + ITS06.02. Bait proteins were removed by washing and plates were incubated as above with sample sera diluted at 1:500, 1:2500, 1:12500, and 1:62500, purified mAb standards or blanks in 1% (W/V) MSD blocker A buffer. Samples were washed and plates were incubated as above with secondary antibody sulfo-tagged mouse anti-rhesus IgG (Southern Biotech; Birmingham, AL, USA, clone: SB108a). Plates were washed as before, followed by addition of 35μl μl of MSD read buffer. Electrochemiluminescence was quantified on an MSD sector 2400 instrument according to manufaturers recommendations. Antibody concentration in sera/mucosal extracts were calculated based on standard curve. For a given sample, the estimate of the lowest in-range dilution was included as the final estimate of mAb concentration.
