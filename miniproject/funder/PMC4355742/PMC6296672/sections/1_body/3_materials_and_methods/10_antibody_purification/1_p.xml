<p>Plasmids containing heavy and light chain genes for a given antibody were co-transfected into Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 0.5 μg/Ig chain/ml of culture containing 2.8 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in 85% of the final culture volume on day 0. Expifectamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DNA were diluted in optiMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 10% of the final culture volume according to manufacturer’s specifications and added to cells. On day 1, the included enhancers 1 and 2 were added to the culture according to the manufacturers specifications. Culture supernatants were harvested on days 5–8 and filtered using a .45 μ filter. Antibodies were purified from supernatant over a protein A column (GE Healthcare; Silver Spring, MD., USA) by gravity flow and buffer exchanged into PBS. All preparations were sterile filtered. Antibody preparations were stored at 4°C or frozen at -30°C.
