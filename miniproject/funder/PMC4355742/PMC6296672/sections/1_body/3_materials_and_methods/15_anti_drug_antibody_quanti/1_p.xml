<p>Anti-drug antibody responses were detected using MSD sector 2400 as above using biotinylated ITS01-Fab or ITS06.02-Fab as coat protein at 0.5 and 2 μg/ml, respectively. Fabs were generated by digesting 1mg whole IgG containing a cleavage site (HRV3C) from human rhinovirus by incubation at 4°C for 16 hours with 10 U of HRV3C protease (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fabs and Fc were separated by protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using an ÄKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare). 17B4 and 8A4 expressed on rhesus IgG1 Fc were used as standards to provide an estimate of serum anti-drug antibody. Serum ADA and standards were detected using an Fc reactive anti-human IgG at 0.25 μg/ml. ADA responses against ITS09.01-LS were measured via as above, however, no positive control anti-ITS09.01-LS clone was available on a rhesus IgG1 Fc backbone and relative units are electrochemiluminescence units.</p>
