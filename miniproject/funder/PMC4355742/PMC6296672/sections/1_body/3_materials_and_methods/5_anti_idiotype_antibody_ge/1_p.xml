<p>Balb/c mice were immunized with Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) with Fab derived from ITS01 or ITS06.02 initially. At weeks 2 and 5 post immunization (p.i.), mice were reimmunized with Fab plus Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA). At week 8 p.i., mice were reimmunized with Fab alone. Splenocytes were fused with myeloma cells at day 60 p.i. and plated in 96-well plates for expansion for screening of supernatant reactivity to Fab. Positive clones were expanded, subcloned by limiting dilution and reexpanded to generate anti-idiotype antibody producing cell lines. Culture supernants of subclones were screened to ensure Fab reactivity was preserved. Hybridoma heavy and light chain V regions sequences were determined by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. These VH and VK sequences were synthesized and cloned into mouse IgG1 and IgK expression vectors for production in cell culture.</p>
