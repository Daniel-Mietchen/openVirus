<p>Intrarectal challenges were performed according to the current SOP from our laboratory of animal medicine, LAM SOP 9008â€“3. Briefly, challenge stocks were titrated in vivo as described previously[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. On the day of challenge, viral stock aliquots were thawed at RT and diluted in PBS to the appropriate dilution to make 1ml aliquots in 1ml syringes. Animals were sedated with Ketamine (10 mg/kg body weight (BW), intramuscularly (I/M) or subcutaneously (S/Q)) and Xylazine (0.5 mg/kg BW, I/M or S/Q) on the day of challenge and laid prone with elevated haunches. Syringes were inserted intrarectally up to the end of the barrel and the viral challenge stock was injected. Syringes were removed after 5 minutes and animals were recaged.
