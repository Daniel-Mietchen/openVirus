<p>Alternately, purified antibodies delivered during NHP PK infusion and initial mouse AAV studies were quantified in animal sera by ELISA as previously.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Breifly, 96-well maxisorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA., USA) were coated with 2 μg/ml of SIVmac239-gp140-FT in PBS at 4°C for 16 hours. Standards, blanks or diluted samples (1:50,000, 1:100,000 and 1:150,000) were applied to wells and incubated for 60’ at 37°C. Secondary anti-rhesus IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech; clone: SB108a) was diluted 1:5000 and incubated in wells for 60’ at 37°C. HRP activity was resolved using 100 μl of SureBlue TMB (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD., USA) and stopped using 100 μl of 1N H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. Plates were washed with PBS + 0.02% Tween-20 six times between coating, samples, detection and resolution. OD
 <sub>450nm</sub> was measured on a Versamax microplate reader (Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale, CA., USA). Antibody concentration in sera/mucosal extracts were calculated based on standard curve. For a given sample, the estimate of the lowest in-range dilution was included as the final estimate of mAb concentration.
