<p>Magnetic streptavidin beads (New England Biolabs; Ipswich, MA., USA) were linked to SIVmac239-biotin according to manufacturers instructions at a ratio of 1 μg protein/10 μl beads and washed with binding buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA) prior to use. 200 μl of heat-inactivated plasma was incubated with 50 μl of 1 μm blank beads for 1 hour at RT to clear out any bead-reactive antibodies. Beads were precipitated, and plasma was added to 25 μl of antigen-bound magnetic beads at 37°C for 1 hour. Beads were then washed with binding buffer and resuspended in 20 μl of PBS containing of IdeZ Protease (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour while shaking to release IgG F
 <sub>c</sub> fragments from the beads. Cleaved F
 <sub>c</sub> fragments were deglycosylated and labeled using the GlycanAssure APTS kit (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, glycans were removed using PNGaseF at 50°C for 1 hour. Glycans were purified on magnetic beads prior to being labeled with APTS for 2 hours at 50°C. Excess dye was removed using glycan-reactive magnetic beads. Resultant labeled glycans were diluted 1:5 in a total volume of 10 μl of capillary electrophoresis loading buffer containing GeneScan 600 LIZ Dye Size Standard v2.0 and Landmark Red and run on a 3730 Genetic analyzer using a POP7 polymer and a 36 cm capillary according to manufacturers instructions. Data was analyzed using the GlycanAssure Data Analysis Software (Thermo Fisher) against 24 labeled standards (Prozyme; Hayward, CA., USA).
