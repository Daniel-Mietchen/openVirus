<p>Our data reveal the necessity to factor anti-vector immunity into AAV based passive immunization strategies, yet another hurdle for this technology. Given the successful transduction of animals harboring low/intermediate pre-existing anti-vector immunity, the pre-existing humoral response appears to have been qualitatively different from that generated via delivery of AAV8 IM in that it did not abrogate transduction. However, the humoral response after AAV immunization is substantial, as previously reported.[

These data highlight the challenge of crafting immunization regimens that might re-administer many shots of AAV within a &lt;1 week window. Work is underway to identify AAV capsids with low seroprevalence or immunogencity that might circumvent the issue of anti-vector immunity.[
