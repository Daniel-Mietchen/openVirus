<p>AAV-vectored mAbs, by virtue of retaining function, mucosal translocation, and stable expression levels, could provide a means of passive immunization against infectious diseases. This represents an attractive alternative to regimens employing repeated infusions, which may not scale well given the practical and financial costs of widespread application needed in the battle against HIV or other epidemics.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] Clinical trials delivering broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV have begun using either protein infusion (NCT02568215, NCT02716675) in Phase II or AAV VIP in Phase I (NCT017455, NCT03374202) and will serve as a proof of principle on these concepts. The infrastructure to scale passive immunization strategies to combat epidemic disease is not yet in place. This effort will require substantial investment from government and industry to make passive immunization either via AAV or infusion feasible on a global scale. In the past 8 years, a large number of potent broadly neutralizing antibodies have been described that target various sites of vulnerability on its viral envelope.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] The best candidates for prophylaxis or therapy remain to be determined. The NHP model, as we demonstrate here, provides an excellent platform with which to compare mAbs via infusion or AAV to test and optimize passive vaccine concepts.
