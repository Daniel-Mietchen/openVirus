<p>To prolong the half-life of transgene mAbs, the Fc region could be modified to augment circulating mAb levels by reducing clearance. Based on clinical data comparing WT versus “LS mutant” Fc regions, the half-life of an antibody can be prolonged by a factor of 3-fold.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] We expect that introducing this mutation into the transgene Fc could therefore result in a commensurate 3-fold increase in the serum mAb levels.
