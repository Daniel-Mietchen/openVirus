<p>The generation of anti-drug antibodies responses that block neutralization or binding has been observed previously in many studies attempting mAb delivery based on AAV and remains a major hurdle in the field.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In the present study, the half-life of infused antibodies did not decrease following repeated infusions, except following the fourth infusion of ITS01, by ~2-fold in one animal. In the presence of an anti-drug antibody response, this reduction would have expected to have been far more dramatic, as previously described.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] In fact, directly assaying anti-drug antibody responses revealed levels at or close to background for all but one animal. The one animal, A03684, that showed signal just above baseline may have been falsely positive. The serum reacted to both antibodies, despite administration of only ITS09.01-LS. Additionally, no boosting of the ADA was observed after successive administrations, despite a signal just above background following the second infusion.
