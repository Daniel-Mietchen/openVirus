<p>Our study demonstrates the utility of NHP to model passive immunization delivering native anti-viral mAbs via infusion or AAV. Infused mAbs behave as expected for native antibodies and were detected at the mucosal surfaces within a short timeframe following infusion.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] The successful translocation of infused and AAV delivered mAb to the rectal mucosal is encouraging and the protective effect of AAV delivered antibodies against viral challenge represents an example of species matched AAV vectored immunoprophylaxis against infectious diseases.
