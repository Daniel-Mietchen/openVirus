<p>Glycan profiles of AAV expressed mAbs demonstrate the differences between glycosylation machinery of muscle, 293, CHO, and B/plasma cells. It is widely recognized that the N267 glycan on the Fc region relates to the neutralizing, functional or inflammatory nature of a given antibody by modulating Fc receptor binding affinity.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] AAV expressed mAbs bear profiles with higher frequency of digalactosylated and sialylated glycan species on their Fc versus antibodies derived via cell culture or infection. This signature has been reported to confer increased Fc mediated functionality to mAbs and lower anti-inflammatory signaling.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] Cell line and infection derived mAbs have an opposite Fc glycan profile in this regard, based on their frequent agalactosylation and lower frequency sialylation. The diverse profile of discrete glycan species found on antibody Fc derived from various cellular sources further highlights the potential heterogeneity of antibodies produced for/following passive immunization. More work detailing specific Fc-glycan modulated effector function is needed before passive immunization approaches against target diseases can be tuned at the glycan level.
