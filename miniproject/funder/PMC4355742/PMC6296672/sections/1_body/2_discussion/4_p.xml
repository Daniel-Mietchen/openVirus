<p>In spite of previous reports finding strong ADA responses in 50–100% of AAV injected animals, we found only 20% of animals generating these responses against ITS01 and ITS06.02.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We confirm the loss of expression, as observed by others, following the generation of an ADA response. This reduced frequency of ADA responses is likely due to the use of autologous, naturally-arising mAbs, with high identity to germline, 91% and 88% for ITS01 and ITS06.02, respectively. The ADA responses were directed against Fabs, and were not cross reactive, ruling out anti-CH
 <sub>2/3</sub> responses, while suggesting no inherent adjuvanting of self epitopes by AAV. The remaining possible epitopes targeted by ADA responses are thus CH1, light chain constant regions, variable region alleles of the transduced antibodies not harbored by the transduced monkey, or anti-idiotype directed against the recombined/somatically hypermutated region of the variable regions.
