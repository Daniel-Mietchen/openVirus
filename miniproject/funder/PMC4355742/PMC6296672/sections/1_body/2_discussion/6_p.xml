<p>We tested various regimens to effect higher expression. Surprisingly, there was little impact of dose on expression of the transgene in the plasma, suggesting that physical limits are reached at about 10
 <sup>12</sup> gc per injection. Notably, physical limitations of uptake by muscle cells are unlikely to be different between NHP and humans. Our data gives pause to clinically dosing AAV single-site injections based on the weight of the recipient. In contrast, we found that the expression did increase with the number of injections sites, using the same cumulative dose, as has been reported previously in the case of DNA vaccination.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Thus, clinical trials attempting to reach the plasma levels of mAb we found in NHP may need to scale the 
 <italic>number</italic> of injections by weightâ€”e.g., a single injection of 2 x 10
 <sup>12</sup> gc in a 4 kg NHP is a model for 20 injections of 2 x 10
 <sup>12</sup> gc in an 80 kg human, but will not model a single injection of 40 x 10
 <sup>12</sup> gc.
