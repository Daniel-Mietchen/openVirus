<p>Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of an AAV based VIP strategy to provide a protective effect against infectious disease. To date antibody mediated protection based on mAb delivery via AAV has only been demonstrated in clonal SHIV/SIV challenge models in macaques and HIV, Influenza, and Ebola clonal challenge in mice.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Here we use a fully rhesus system to delivery native mAbs and a repeated limiting dose SIVsmE660 swarm challenge model to demonstrate antibody mediated protection. Previous attempts to delivery whole IgG via AAV for protection studies have been hampered by the generation of ADA responses that abrogated transgene accumulation during the challenge regimen. Here, only one animal in our protection study had plasma mAb levels drop to below detection limits by the final challenge timepoint. We acknowledge the caveat of reliance on historic controls for the initial protection study. However, the rates of infection historic (0.33 infections/challenge) and contemporaneous controls (0.40 infections/challenge) were reproducible. These data demonstrate the utility of vectored approaches in macaques to model passive immunization against infectious disease that maintain functional levels of mAb throughout a prolonged challenge regimen. Studies to further detect and dissect an antibody-mediated protective effect are currently underway.
