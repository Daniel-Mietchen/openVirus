<p>To determine the utility of AAV to provide adequate and durable expression of anti-SIV env mAbs in NHP 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected six rhesus macaques intramuscularly with 10
 <sup>13</sup> gc/animal each of AAV8-ITS01 and AAV8-ITS06.02 separately, one in each quadriceps to avoid potential mismatched Ig heavy/light chain pairing. Detectable transgene mAb began at week 2, peaked at week 5 and came to setpoint around week 14 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). ITS01 and ITS06.02 expression peaked at 21.2 ± 8.6 μg/ml and 8.6 ± 1.7 μg/ml, respectively. At peak serum antibody levels (day 28 post AAV), ITS01 reached higher levels (mean ITS01 = 18.2 μg/ml; mean ITS06.02 = 5.2 μg/ml; p = 0.03; Matched Pairs Wilcoxon Signed Rank), but this difference disappeared by day 42 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In two animals, serum abundance of both mAbs (DEB8) or ITS01 (A10V030) fell below the limit of detection at set point, which was later found to be due to ADA, discussed below.
