<p>Given the successful delivery of antibody via AAV8, we reduced the dose by 10- and 100-fold to economize vector production. At medium dose (2 x 10
 <sup>12</sup> gc/animal; n = 24), comparable expression was observed compared with high dose (2 x 10
 <sup>13</sup> gc/animal; n = 6) (

 <sup>11</sup> gc/animal; n = 2), one of two animals showed no serum accumulation of mAb, while the other showed low peak and set point expression near baseline. Both animals demonstrated anti-AAV8 seroconversion. The animal lacking serum transgene accumulation was removed from further analyses to demonstrate correlations between dose and output levels. When comparing peak (weeks 4 post AAV) and set point (weeks 18–54 post AAV), serum transgene mAb, no differences among doses were observed that reached significance (p ≤ 0.05). The highest dose trended to mildly higher levels, but the increase was about two-fold despite a 10-fold higher dose. These data suggested a saturation of the site of injection occurring at or near the medium dose, which might be expected if the number of muscle cells transduced by needle injection is limited by physical parameters.
