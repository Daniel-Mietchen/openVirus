<p>To further explore this limitation, we administered the same total medium dose divided across 1 (n = 2), 2 (n = 24), 4 (n = 2), or 8 (n = 2) injection sites at a single time point. Peak serum transgene mAb accumulation followed a near-linear dependence on the number of injection sites (

However, these differences waned by week 24; nonetheless, the two animals receiving 8 injections exhibited a more consistent, high-level expression. These data suggest that optimization of plasma transgene mAb accumulation from AAV should be aimed at delivery devices that can target many distinct injection sites rather than increasing the dose of the vector.
