<p>To ensure that AAV transgene mAbs are translocated to mucosal surfaces, where they may act prophylactically against pathogens, we measured transgene mAb from nasal, rectal and buccal swabs. Assaying mAb abundance revealed long term accumulation at these mucosal sites (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007395.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Translocation of transgene mAbs to rectal mucosa correlated strongly with relative serum mAb abundance at peak and late timepoints (week 4, R = 0.30, p = 0.01; weeks 5–24, R = 0.78, p ≤ 0.01) (
