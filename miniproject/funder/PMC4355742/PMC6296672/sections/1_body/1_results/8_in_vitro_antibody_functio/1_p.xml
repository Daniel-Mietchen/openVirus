<p>Antibody glycosylation has been demonstrated to alter function, particularly, neutralization. Additionally, ADA responses can target antibody paratopes, blocking their ability to neutralize effectively. In our initial mouse screening for AAV administration, serum ITS08 and ITS10 no longer had neutralizing capability (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007395.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), although the reasons for this loss of function were not explored. Sera from animals transduced with a single AAV transgene antibody were compared against purified mAb. When normalized for transgene antibody abundance, the serum neutralization regression curve aligned with that of purified cell culture produced mAb (

 <sub>50</sub> was observed for all timepoints, for animals receiving either ITS01 and ITS06.02, and against both neutralization-sensitive and -resistant SIVsmE660 clones tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Similarly, the maximum neutralization capacity between transgene and purified cell culture derived mAb was consistent across all assays for ITS01 and ITS06.02 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Thus, there was no change in the SIV-neutralization parameters of the mAbs expressed by the AAV transduction.
