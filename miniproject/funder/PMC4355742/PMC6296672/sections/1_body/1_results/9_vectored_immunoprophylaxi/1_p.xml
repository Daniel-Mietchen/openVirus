<p>Delivery of antibodies via AAV has been proposed as a one shot alternative to repeated infusions for protection against infectious diseases. Given the translocation of mAbs expressed via AAV to mucosal surfaces and retention of function, we hypothesized that protection against repeated low dose administration of SIV could be observed. We enrolled Indian origin macaques that received ITS01 and ITS06.02 into a challenge regimen to test the hypothesis that vectored delivery of anti-viral antibodies could protect against SIV infection. We began challenges five weeks post AAV to allow for adequate accumulation of transgene mAb in plasma and at mucosal surfaces then performed seven limiting dose intrarectal challenges using SIVsmE660 swarm at AID
 <sub>0.33</sub>. The passively immunized group had a 3.1% rate of infection, with only a single infection in 32 challenges compared to the 34% rate of infection of historic controls (n = 20). VIP reduced the rate of infection by ~90% compared with historic controls (p = 0.003) (

Two monkeys were removed from the challenge regimen after two challenges due to false positive viral loads (later confirmed by retesting sera from the same time points). As a sensitivity analysis, we refit our models with these two animals excluded. The results were unchanged (p = 0.006). To confirm this protective effect, we repeated this challenge regimen with an AAV vectored mAb group (n = 4) and contemporaneous controls (n = 4). The mAb pretreatment showed a trend towards a similar level of protection versus contemporaneous controls (75%, p = 0.237), with 2 infections in 20 challenges. These infections occurred despite &gt;10 Î¼g/ml of serum transgene mAb in AAV treated animals (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). These animals had a geometric mean peak viral load 0.67 logs lower than control animals. Combining data from all challenges with the same virus swarm stock, the AAV transduced animals (n = 10) showed a protective effect of 83% (p = 0.002) versus controls (n = 24).
