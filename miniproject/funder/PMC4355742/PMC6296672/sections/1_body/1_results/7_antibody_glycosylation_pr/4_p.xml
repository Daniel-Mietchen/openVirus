<p>Hepatocytes have been shown to be highly permissible to AAV transduction and contribute to transgene serum expression. However, these cells are short lived compared to muscle cells and may contribute only temporarily to transgene expression. Thus, we compared the glycan profiles of transgene mAb secreted at 3–4 (peak), 8 (mid), and 12 (late) weeks post AAV. Bulk galactosylation, sialylation, fucosylation and biection did not change over time (
