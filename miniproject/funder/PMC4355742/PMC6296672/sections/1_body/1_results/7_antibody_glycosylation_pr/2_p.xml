<p>Bulk Fc-glycan analysis from antibodies revealed AAV transgene mAbs had more digalactosylated and fewer agalactosylated mAbs than 293 or infection derived mAb (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007395.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Bisected glycans were lowest in 293 derived mAb compared to AAV and B/plasma cell derived mAb (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007395.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Transgene mAbs and CHO produced cells were highly monosialylated compared to infection derived mAb, with AAV derived mAbs also being highly disialylated compared to infection derived mAb. AAV derived mAbs also bore more total sialylation than infection derived antibody (
