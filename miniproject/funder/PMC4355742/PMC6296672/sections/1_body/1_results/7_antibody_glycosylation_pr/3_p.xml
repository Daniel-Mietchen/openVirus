<p>To further dissect these differences, the individual glycan species were compared. 293-derived mAbs contained much higher levels of G0F and G1F glycans than AAV and infection derived antibody (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007395.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). AAV derived mAb bore higher G1, G1’/G0FB, G1’F/G1FB, G2S1, and G2S1B Fc-glycans than all others. Infection derived antibody was enriched in G0, G1S1F, G2F, G2FB, G2S1FB and G2S2F and found to be lowest in G1, G2S1’B, G2S2 and G2S2B. Where cell culture derived mAb (293 and CHO) were equivalent, G1 and G2S1FB were enriched glycan species from these sources.
