 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] We compared the Fc glycosylation profile of transgene mAbs secreted by these cell types in the transduced animals to those of B/plamsa cells during infection or tissue culture-derived antibody. Specifically, we quantified Fc-glycan species of Env-specific mAbs from the sera of AAV transduced animals at week 4 post AAV, mAb infused animals (293 or CHO-produced) day 5 post infusion, and chronically SIV infected animals (polyclonal sera) via capillary electrophoresis. Because of the descriptive nature of this analysis comparing many glycan species, only those significant differences with p â‰¤ 0.001 by Steel-Dwass nonparametric comparisons are reported below.
