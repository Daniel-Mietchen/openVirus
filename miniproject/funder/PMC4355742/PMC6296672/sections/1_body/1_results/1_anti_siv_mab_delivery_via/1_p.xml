<p>To test the feasibility of passive immunization of rhesus macaques using anti-SIV env mAbs, we performed an initial series of antibody infusions. Animals received purified ITS01-LS (n = 2) or ITS09.01-LS (n = 2) intravenously four times at 3 or 30 mg/kg at approximately 9 week intervals. The LS mutation is reported to enhance antibody persistence in human and macaques, and was chosen here to mirror clinical passive immunization.[

At peak post infusion, mucosal ITS01-LS represented up to 2% and 3% of total IgG in rectal biopsies and swabs, respectively. Likewise, mucosal ITS09.01-LS represented up to 2.3% and 1.2% of total IgG in rectal biopsies and swabs, respectively. The amount of mucosal mAb was correlated to the plasma levels (rectal Weck-Cel spears, R = 0.60, p ≤ 0.01; biopsies, R = 0.83, p ≤ 0.01) (
