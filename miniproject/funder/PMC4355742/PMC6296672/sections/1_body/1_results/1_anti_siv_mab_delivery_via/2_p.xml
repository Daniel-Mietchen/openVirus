<p>The consistent serum antibody decay rates suggest the absence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses, despite the introduction of the “LS” mutation to increase neonatal FcR binding and extend circulating half-life of mAbs.[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] We found no evidence of ADA by direct assay of sera, even after 4 successive infusions, save for one animal A03684 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007395.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This animal tested positive for ADA against ITS01 and ITS09.01 at one and two timepoints, respectively. All three of these measurements were only slightly above the limit of detection for ADA. In this animal, despite receiving only infusions of ITS09.01-LS, the serum was reactive to both ITS01 and ITS09.01 Fab. Additionally, the half-life of ITS09.01 following the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> and 4
 <sup>th</sup> infusions did not decrease dramatically compared to others. Thus, this response was an extremely weak, cross-reactive ADA response.
