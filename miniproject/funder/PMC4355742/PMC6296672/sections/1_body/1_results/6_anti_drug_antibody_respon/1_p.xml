<p>Prior passive immunization attempts in rhesus macaques using mAbs derived from humans, antibody-like molecules or non-native anti-S(H)IV mAbs have been complicated by frequent and rapid anti-drug antibody generation.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We quantified serum anti-drug antibody responses in macaques receiving anti-SIV env mAb via AAV. At late timepoints, (9–31 weeks post AAV), serum mAb (ITS01 or ITS06.02) was below the limit of detection in all animals where ADA responses were generated (p ≤ 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, serum ADA responses were infrequent: approximately 20% of animals developed measurable ADA against the antibodies they received via AAV (7/38 anti-ITS01; 6/22 anti-ITS06.02). No cases were observed of cross reactive ADA: i.e. no animals receiving ITS01 generated anti-ITS06.02 antibodies or vice versa, suggesting these responses are specifically anti-idiotypic (
