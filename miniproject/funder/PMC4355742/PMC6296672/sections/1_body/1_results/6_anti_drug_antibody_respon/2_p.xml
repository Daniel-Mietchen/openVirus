<p>To characterize the basis of the serum ADA response, a subset of animal sera, including from all animals that generated ADA at late timepoints, were assayed for ADA over time. Polyclonal serum ADA were quantified using a monoclonal ADA standard, and thus are quantified relative to monoclonal μg/ml equivalents. These estimates were overlaid with serum antibody expression levels for three representative cases, where no ADA (A9V056), ADA to both mAbs (05C043) or ADA to only one mAb is generated (28812) (
