<p>Notably, all animals developed high anti-vector immunity within 2 weeks of injection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We chose one animal that maintained (A9V097) and one (DEB8) that lost detectable serum ITS01 to investigate the possibility for repeat AAV administration to boost serum mAb levels. Animals were injected with 10
 <sup>13</sup> gc of AAV8-ITS01 each at 180 days after initial administration. Re-administration boosted the high anti-vector immunity approximately 10-fold higher within one week (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), indicating a successful “take” of the injection. Nonetheless, serum ITS01 abundance did not change in the 10 weeks following the second administration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, high level anti-vector humoral immune responses will inhibit repeat transduction by the same vector.
