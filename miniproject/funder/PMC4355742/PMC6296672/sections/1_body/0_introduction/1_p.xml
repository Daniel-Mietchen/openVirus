<p>Antibodies mediate protection against infection for nearly all traditional licensed vaccines. To achieve protective antibody titers, active immunization has historically been employed. More recently, given advances in monoclonal antibody isolation and production technologies, delivery of prophylactic antibodies via passive vaccination is being considered for pathogens where active vaccination strategies have not succeeded. Advantages of passive immunization include better efficacy, enhanced coverage against multiple disease strains or serotypes, greater tolerability, and economics. Strategies to prevent infection via prophylactic administration of monoclonal antibodies are advancing clinically, with success against a variety of diseases (primarily in animal models): respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza A, hepatitis C, herpes simplex, Ebola, Rabies, cytomegalovirus, Hendravirus, and HIV.[
