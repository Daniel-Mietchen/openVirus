<p>The use of AAV to deliver antibodies against infectious disease has been adopted by the field of HIV preclinical research and recently extended to human clinical trials. (NCT017455, NCT03374202) To date, two phase I clinical trials delivering anti-HIV envelope broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) via AAV have begun. However, the field of HIV is awash with candidate antibodies that may be useful for prophylaxis. To determine the best passive immunization candidates for HIV prevention via gene therapy, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> NHP models are the best animal model. To date, five studies have provided proof of principle that HIV/SIV envelope targeting antibodies can be delivered to NHP via AAV.[
