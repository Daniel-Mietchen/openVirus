 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Gene therapy provides a potential one-time administration strategy, after which protein products are produced

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a safe gene therapy vector capable of delivering transgenes long term.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The clinical success of AAV-vectored gene therapy for hemophilia highlights the potential to replace infusion of purified F.VIII or F.IX protein in humans with a single administration, resulting in millions of dollars saved in infusions of purified clotting factors.[
