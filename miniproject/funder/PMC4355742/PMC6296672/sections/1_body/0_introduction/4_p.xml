<p>Initial studies delivered non-simian antibodies, simianized antibodies, or antibody-like molecules showed high frequency of loss of expression due to anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Chimeric models suffered from issues of compatibility between host immune system and the infecting virus or non-simian antibody. Specifically, the generation of ADA was reported to abrogate any protective effect of the delivered antiviral molecules. Here, we show that we can largely circumvent the challenges of anti-drug immune responses previously described by delivering autologous, naturally-arising mAbs, as would be done clinically. We demonstrate the feasibility of AAV8-based delivery of native anti-SIV Env-specific mAbs, show durable transgene antibody accumulation in serum and mucosal compartments with a low frequency of ADA responses in species-matched immunocompetent outbred hosts, and observed a protective effect of VIP against SIV challenge.
