We used a rhesus macaque animal model to optimize delivery of naturally-arising, autologous anti-SIV neutralizing antibodies expressed by Adeno-Associated Virus 8 (AAV8) vectors. Vectored transgene expression was confirmed by quantitation of target antibody abundance in serum and mucosal surfaces. We tested the expression achieved at varying doses and numbers of injections. Expression of the transgene reached a saturation at about 2 x 10<sup>12</sup> AAV8 genome copies (gc) per needle-injection, a physical limitation that may not scale clinically into human trials. In contrast, expression increased proportionately with the number of injections. In terms of anti-drug immunity, anti-vector antibody responses were universally strong, while those directed against the natural transgene mAb were detected in only 20% of animals. An anti-transgene antibody response was invariably associated with loss of detectable plasma expression of the antibody. Despite having atypical glycosylation profiles, transgenes derived from AAV-directed muscle cell expression retained full functional activity, including mucosal accumulation, <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization, and protection against repeated limiting dose SIVsmE660 swarm challenge. Our findings demonstrate feasibility of a gene therapy-based passive immunization strategy against infectious disease, and illustrate the potential for the nonhuman primate model to inform clinical AAV-based approaches to passive immunization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Antibodies are the humoral component of an immune response against an invading pathogen or vaccine immunogen. For challenging vaccine targets, as an alternative to active vaccination to induce the immune system to generate antibodies, current research is exploring the delivery of these proteins to populations at high risk of infection as prophylactics against infectious diseases, like HIV, RSV, and Ebola, amongst others. Passive vaccination via purified protein will require periodic reinjection to retain protective levels in subjects, adding a barrier to large scale coverage. Alternatively, delivery of antibodies using gene therapy may provide a one-time passive vaccination alternative. This strategy comes with its own hurdles, including anti-vector immunity, anti-drug immunity, physical limitations of vector uptake and the need to confirm antibody functionality. To date, many passive vaccinations strategies remain untested in humans. Non-human primate models of infection are frequently useful for predicting the success of vaccine candidates or concepts. Here, we characterize and optimize a rhesus macaque model for the delivery of anti-viral antibodies via the gene therapy vector adeno-associated virus. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of the mAbs to protect against viral challenge. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and utility of vectored delivery of antibody transgenes in rhesus macaques. We hope this model of antibody delivery may be applied to various disease models in non-human primates and will inform clinical trial design of passive vaccination against infectious diseases.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the NIH Intramural Research Program.

To achieve protective antibody titers, active immunization has historically been employed. More recently, given advances in monoclonal antibody isolation and production technologies, delivery of prophylactic antibodies via passive vaccination is being considered for pathogens where active vaccination strategies have not succeeded. Advantages of passive immunization include better efficacy, enhanced coverage against multiple disease strains or serotypes, greater tolerability, and economics. Strategies to prevent infection via prophylactic administration of monoclonal antibodies are advancing clinically, with success against a variety of diseases (primarily in animal models): respiratory syncytial virus, Influenza A, hepatitis C, herpes simplex, Ebola, Rabies, cytomegalovirus, Hendravirus, and HIV.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] As with all protein-based regimens, obstacles include cost of production[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], maintenance of functional drug levels[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and rejection by anti-drug antibody responses.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Genetic delivery of antibody via viral vectors such as adeno-associated viruses (AAV) is particularly exciting given preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating persistent expression of transgene drug products.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Gene therapy provides a potential one-time administration strategy, after which protein products are produced <italic>in vivo</italic>, and persistently accumulate to functional levels.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a safe gene therapy vector capable of delivering transgenes long term.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The clinical success of AAV-vectored gene therapy for hemophilia highlights the potential to replace infusion of purified F.VIII or F.IX protein in humans with a single administration, resulting in millions of dollars saved in infusions of purified clotting factors.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Used appropriately, AAV vectored gene therapy has an excellent safety record, has been approved clinically as the drug Glybera, and has showed successes in human trials for gene replacement in multiple diseases (lipoprotein lipase deficiency, Leber&#x02019;s congenital amaurosis, and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency).[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The use of AAV to deliver antibodies against infectious disease has been adopted by the field of HIV preclinical research and recently extended to human clinical trials.

To date, five studies have provided proof of principle that HIV/SIV envelope targeting antibodies can be delivered to NHP via AAV.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Initial studies delivered non-simian antibodies, simianized antibodies, or antibody-like molecules showed high frequency of loss of expression due to anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Chimeric models suffered from issues of compatibility between host immune system and the infecting virus or non-simian antibody.

We describe the unique glycan profiles and maintenance of neutralization function of transgene mAbs. Lastly, we performed challenge studies to demonstrate the protective capacity of vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP).

Given the translocation of mAbs expressed via AAV to mucosal surfaces and retention of function, we hypothesized that protection against repeated low dose administration of SIV could be observed. We enrolled Indian origin macaques that received ITS01 and ITS06.02 into a challenge regimen to test the hypothesis that vectored delivery of anti-viral antibodies could protect against SIV infection. We began challenges five weeks post AAV to allow for adequate accumulation of transgene mAb in plasma and at mucosal surfaces then performed seven limiting dose intrarectal challenges using SIVsmE660 swarm at AID<sub>0.33</sub>. The passively immunized group had a 3.1% rate of infection, with only a single infection in 32 challenges compared to the 34% rate of infection of historic controls (n = 20). VIP reduced the rate of infection by ~90% compared with historic controls (p = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007395.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Two monkeys were removed from the challenge regimen after two challenges due to false positive viral loads (later confirmed by retesting sera from the same time points). As a sensitivity analysis, we refit our models with these two animals excluded. The results were unchanged (p = 0.006). To confirm this protective effect, we repeated this challenge regimen with an AAV vectored mAb group (n = 4) and contemporaneous controls (n = 4). The mAb pretreatment showed a trend towards a similar level of protection versus contemporaneous controls (75%, p = 0.237), with 2 infections in 20 challenges.

In the presence of an anti-drug antibody response, this reduction would have expected to have been far more dramatic, as previously described.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] In fact, directly assaying anti-drug antibody responses revealed levels at or close to background for all but one animal. The one animal, A03684, that showed signal just above baseline may have been falsely positive. The serum reacted to both antibodies, despite administration of only ITS09.01-LS. Additionally, no boosting of the ADA was observed after successive administrations, despite a signal just above background following the second infusion.</p><p>We achieved long term anti-SIV Env mAb expression in NHP following AAV injection. Importantly, the consistency with which these mAbs are expressed over the long term is encouraging, with expression observed for up to 1 year. Initial studies delivering immunoadhesins, antibody-like molecules derived from SIV infected rhesus macaques, demonstrated stable expression beyond one year post AAV in all animals injected.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Subsequent studies delivered whole IgG or antibody based molecules to provide anti-envelope immunity to NHP, resulting in stable transduction of a subset of those animals.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Transgene expression in these later studies suffered from anti-drug antibody generation elicited against non-rhesus epitopes (human or artificial constructs), with one group requiring immunosuppression to maintain expression beyond eight weeks. These NHP studies reveal the importance of immunological tolerance to transgene products.

This reduced frequency of ADA responses is likely due to the use of autologous, naturally-arising mAbs, with high identity to germline, 91% and 88% for ITS01 and ITS06.02, respectively. The ADA responses were directed against Fabs, and were not cross reactive, ruling out anti-CH<sub>2/3</sub> responses, while suggesting no inherent adjuvanting of self epitopes by AAV. The remaining possible epitopes targeted by ADA responses are thus CH1, light chain constant regions, variable region alleles of the transduced antibodies not harbored by the transduced monkey, or anti-idiotype directed against the recombined/somatically hypermutated region of the variable regions.</p><p>It is noteworthy that in our study, there was universal concordance between the loss of expression in the plasma and the generation of ADA&#x02014;a strikingly contemporaneous effect. This suggests that the mechanism of loss of transgene expression in AAV-directed expression of autologous mAbs is likely because of antibody-based mechanisms, and not cellular (cytotoxic). This observation further reinforces the importance of circumventing ADA responses, as previously suggested.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>We tested various regimens to effect higher expression. Surprisingly, there was little impact of dose on expression of the transgene in the plasma, suggesting that physical limits are reached at about 10<sup>12</sup> gc per injection. Notably, physical limitations of uptake by muscle cells are unlikely to be different between NHP and humans. Our data gives pause to clinically dosing AAV single-site injections based on the weight of the recipient.

Given the successful transduction of animals harboring low/intermediate pre-existing anti-vector immunity, the pre-existing humoral response appears to have been qualitatively different from that generated via delivery of AAV8 IM in that it did not abrogate transduction. However, the humoral response after AAV immunization is substantial, as previously reported.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Likely, the ineffective re-administration relates to the strong anti-AAV humoral response (which is itself boosted following the second injection). These data highlight the challenge of crafting immunization regimens that might re-administer many shots of AAV within a &#x0003c;1 week window. Work is underway to identify AAV capsids with low seroprevalence or immunogencity that might circumvent the issue of anti-vector immunity.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</p><p>Glycan profiles of AAV expressed mAbs demonstrate the differences between glycosylation machinery of muscle, 293, CHO, and B/plasma cells.

The diverse profile of discrete glycan species found on antibody Fc derived from various cellular sources further highlights the potential heterogeneity of antibodies produced for/following passive immunization. More work detailing specific Fc-glycan modulated effector function is needed before passive immunization approaches against target diseases can be tuned at the glycan level.</p><p>To prolong the half-life of transgene mAbs, the Fc region could be modified to augment circulating mAb levels by reducing clearance. Based on clinical data comparing WT versus &#x0201c;LS mutant&#x0201d; Fc regions, the half-life of an antibody can be prolonged by a factor of 3-fold.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] We expect that introducing this mutation into the transgene Fc could therefore result in a commensurate 3-fold increase in the serum mAb levels.</p><p>Our experience highlights the importance of staged testing in mice, before proceeding to large mammals. Some constructs did not express as rapidly as others or retain neutralizing function when expressed in mice. The reasons for this discrepant in vitro neutralization are unclear, but could be related to inappropriate V region glycans (where potential N-linked glycosylation sites are present) or other post-translational modification. Screening multiple constructs in mice, then down-selecting for trials in NHP to confirm expression and function is key. The NHP model may be useful for optimizing vector parameters such as capsid (tissue targeting), the promoter/enhancer, and other molecular considerations to maximize expression. This technology may inform clinical trial design, however consistent translation between simian and human systems will need experimental validation.</p><p>Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of an AAV based VIP strategy to provide a protective effect against infectious disease. To date antibody mediated protection based on mAb delivery via AAV has only been demonstrated in clonal SHIV/SIV challenge models in macaques and HIV, Influenza, and Ebola clonal challenge in mice.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] Here we use a fully rhesus system to delivery native mAbs and a repeated limiting dose SIVsmE660 swarm challenge model to demonstrate antibody mediated protection. Previous attempts to delivery whole IgG via AAV for protection studies have been hampered by the generation of ADA responses that abrogated transgene accumulation during the challenge regimen. Here, only one animal in our protection study had plasma mAb levels drop to below detection limits by the final challenge timepoint. We acknowledge the caveat of reliance on historic controls for the initial protection study. However, the rates of infection historic (0.33 infections/challenge) and contemporaneous controls (0.40 infections/challenge) were reproducible. These data demonstrate the utility of vectored approaches in macaques to model passive immunization against infectious disease that maintain functional levels of mAb throughout a prolonged challenge regimen. Studies to further detect and dissect an antibody-mediated protective effect are currently underway.</p><p>AAV-vectored mAbs, by virtue of retaining function, mucosal translocation, and stable expression levels, could provide a means of passive immunization against infectious diseases. This represents an attractive alternative to regimens employing repeated infusions, which may not scale well given the practical and financial costs of widespread application needed in the battle against HIV or other epidemics.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] Clinical trials delivering broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV have begun using either protein infusion (NCT02568215, NCT02716675) in Phase II or AAV VIP in Phase I (NCT017455, NCT03374202) and will serve as a proof of principle on these concepts. The infrastructure to scale passive immunization strategies to combat epidemic disease is not yet in place. This effort will require substantial investment from government and industry to make passive immunization either via AAV or infusion feasible on a global scale. In the past 8 years, a large number of potent broadly neutralizing antibodies have been described that target various sites of vulnerability on its viral envelope.[<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] The best candidates for prophylaxis or therapy remain to be determined.
