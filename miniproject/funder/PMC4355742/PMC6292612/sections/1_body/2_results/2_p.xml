<p>Dengue disease incidence patterns observed in both studies are similar to patterns seen in national dengue surveillance data (Supplemental Material S2.2.4.7, ref [
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]). The seasonal trends seen in the monthly attack rates of the placebo groups of each study corresponded with the rainy seasons defined based on the WMO data, suggesting the rainy season represents a period of increased dengue disease. We therefore assumed that if rainfall data had been collected in the studies, the resulting rainy season definitions would not differ substantially from those calculated from the WMO data.
