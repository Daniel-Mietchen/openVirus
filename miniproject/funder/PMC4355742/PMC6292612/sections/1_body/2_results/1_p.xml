 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207878.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the attack rate by month in the placebo (1A) and vaccinated (1B) groups of CYD14 from June 2011 (start of enrollment) to the end of 2013. A seasonal trend can be observed in this plot, with a higher attack rate occurring between June and September in both 2012 and 2013. These months correspond to the rainy seasons of the Philippines (where 49% of the dengue cases occurred), Thailand, and Vietnam. In addition, the proportion of dengue events observed in the vaccine and placebo groups during the rainy season is higher than the proportion of the year that is defined as the rainy season (
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, in CYD14 at the Sao Pablo City site in the Philippines, 80% of the total number of dengue cases were observed to occur during the rainy season, which comprised 42% of the year. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207878.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the attack rate by month in the placebo (2A) and vaccinated (2B) groups of CYD15 from June 2011 (start of enrollment) to mid-2014. The seasonal trend observed in CYD15 is less obvious, although more infections appear to have occurred from April-May and September-November. These periods correspond to the rainy seasons of certain sites in Colombia, where 41% of the dengue cases occurred. The seasonal trend in dengue attack rates may be less apparent in CYD15 because the CYD15 sites covered a larger geographical area and the rainy seasons were less similar than in the CYD14 sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207878.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). The results of the descriptive analysis indicate that our definition of rainy season corresponds to periods of higher observed rates of dengue in CYD14 and in CYD15. Together, these data suggest that rainy season could be a reasonable proxy measurement for periods of increased dengue risk.
