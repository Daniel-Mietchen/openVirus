<p>Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic, virologically-confirmed dengue did not change during the rainy season. In CYD14, the estimated VE during the rainy season was 55.8% with 95% CI = (46.9%, 64.6%) and 53.2% with 95% CI = (38.6%, 64.3%) during the non-rainy season. In CYD15, the estimated VE during the rainy season was 64.1% with 95% CI = (57.7%, 70.6%) and 66.7% with 95% CI = (54.8%, 75.5%) during the non-rainy season. The estimated VEs from the models that included rainy season were almost identical to those from previous analyses [

 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]: 54.9% with 95% CI = (47.0%, 61.6%) for CYD14 and 64.8% with 95% CI = (58.9%, 68.8%) for CYD15. The results from the time-dependent Cox models that include or do not include an interaction term for vaccine and rainy season are shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> for CYD14 and CYD15, respectively. Specifically, the Cox models with time-dependent rainy season showed no significant modification of VE by rainy season in either study and no significant modification in the combined analysis (interaction p-values = 0.74 and 0.69 for CYD14 and CYD15). Rainy season was a strong significant correlate of dengue in the vaccine and placebo groups in each study [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.11 with 95% CI = (1.75, 2.54) in CYD14 and HR = 3.08 with 95% CI = (2.58, 3.67) in CYD15]. Age was also significantly associated with dengue in both CYD14 and CYD15, a finding consistent with previous analyses showing that younger children are at higher risk of symptomatic, virologically-confirmed dengue [
