<p>The results from the combined CYD14 and CYD15 analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207878.s004">S2 Table</xref>) were consistent with the individual trial analyses: risk of dengue was significantly higher during the rainy season (HR = 2.88 with 95% CI = (2.48, 3.35)) and rainy season did not modify VE (interaction p-value = 0.74). In addition, the effect of rainy season did not differ by study (interaction p-value = 0.60). The combined analysis also showed that study was significantly associated with dengue (p-value &lt; 0.01), with a 30% lower risk of dengue in CYD15 compared to CYD14. This may be explained by the higher risk of dengue associated with the different geographical locations of the studies.
