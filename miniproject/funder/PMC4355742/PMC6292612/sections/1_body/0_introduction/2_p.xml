<p>Dengue prevention consists primarily of measures that aim to control the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> vector, such as habitat elimination to reduce the risk of mosquito bites [
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, these measures have had limited ability to protect against disease as outbreaks still occur frequently. Moreover, there is currently no specific antiviral treatment against dengue, although several dengue vaccines are in development [
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The recombinant live attenuated tetravalent vaccine (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur has been tested in two phase III efficacy trials: one placebo-controlled phase III trial of the CYD-TDV dengue vaccine was conducted in 2–14 year olds in South East Asia with the active surveillance phase lasting from June 2011 to December 2013 (CYD14) [

 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). In both trials, after randomization of children to receive vaccine or placebo at 0,6 and 12 months, active surveillance for symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) followed over 25 months after the first injection. The overall intent-to-treat vaccine efficacy (VE) was 54.8% (95%CI 46.8, 61.7) and VE against severe dengue 70% (95%CI 35.7, 86.6) in Asia versus 64.7% (95%CI 58.7, 69.8) and 95.5% (95%CI 68.8, 99.9) respectively in Latin America during this active phase. These findings supported the licensing of CYD-TDV in several dengue endemic countries where the seroprevalence rate is more than 70% [
