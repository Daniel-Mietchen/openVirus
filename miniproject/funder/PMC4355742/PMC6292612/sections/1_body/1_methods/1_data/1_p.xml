<p>We analyzed data from the two primary phase III clinical trials on which CYD-TDV licensure was based: CYD14, conducted in 10, 275 children in five countries in South East Asia, and CYD15, conducted in 20,869 children in five countries in Latin America. Children in each trial were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive three injections of either CYD-TDV or placebo, respectively, at months 0, 6, and 12. Children were followed for symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue until month 25 after the first injection. During this period, all children were under active surveillance. Surveillance consisted of weekly reminders to the family to go to the health care center if acute febrile illness was observed. In cases of acute febrile illness, two blood samples were collected for virological confirmation of the presence of dengue. One sample was collected within 5 days after the onset of fever and the second one was obtained 7 to 14 days later. The first sample was tested for dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen using an ELISA assay (Platelia Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-La-Coquette, France [

If any of these tests were positive, the event was considered to be virologically-confirmed dengue. Both the first and the second samples were tested for dengue IgM and IgG. The first day of the acute febrile illness was used as the date of virologically-confirmed dengue.
