<p>Plots of the monthly attack rate from June 2011 (the month in which enrollment began) to the end of the active phase follow-up period are shown for the placebo and vaccinated groups of CYD14 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207878.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Months were approximated by 30-day periods. In each month-long interval I, the attack rate was calculated as the number of symptomatic, virologically-confirmed dengue events in I divided by the number of participants at risk in I with 95% confidence interval (CI) calculated by Wilson method of interval estimation for a binomial proportion [

 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] version 3.4.3 with the R 
 <italic>binom</italic> package [
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Participants were at risk for dengue in a given month if the date of enrollment was before the end of that month and the date of their last contact with study staff or the end of the active phase was after the start of that month.
