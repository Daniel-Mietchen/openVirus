<p>The risk of dengue was significantly higher during the rainy season in the vaccine and placebo groups of each of the phase III trials and in the combined CYD14 and CYD15 analysis, indicating that our definition of rainy season may serve as a proxy for periods of increased dengue transmission. Importantly, CYD-TDV VE did not vary by rainy season in any of the analyses, suggesting that VE is not expected to change during periods of high transmission in endemic regions. One important caveat to be noted is that rainfall data were not collected in the CYD14 and CYD15 studies themselves, but were obtained from publicly available data from the National Meteorological &amp; Hydrological Services in the individual countries. Although these data are likely less accurate than site-level data collection in the trial, the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services data were of sufficient accuracy to define a binary rainy season variable at the site level that we found to be a strong correlate of risk of dengue in both the CYD14 and CYD15 trials, stronger than any other variable considered. However, as the rainy season variable was considered as a binary variable, we are unable to account for the intensity of the rainfall during given time periods. Precipitation can have complex effects on mosquito abundance (and therefore infection force), since moderate rain increases potential breeding grounds but heavy rain may wash out immature mosquito populations [

Thus, it may be informative to prospectively collect infection parameters in future studies as they could provide more precise estimates of force of infection than our rainy season variable. In particular, the effect of the volume and/or intensity of the rainy season could be investigated as this would provide information not captured by the dichotomous rainy season variable we considered. Other markers such as placebo incidence or mosquito density could also be considered in the model for measuring the force of infection. Here, rainfall data was used because it could be easily obtained for a public database and we were expected less measurement error in this variable than other measures. Moreover, the existing literature has not established a clear relationship between mosquito density and dengue infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Still, another potential approach could be to measure mosquito density and consider it as an effect modifier of vaccine efficacy. A more complex analysis could also account for other factors influencing VE. In particular, given the recent findings on the baseline serostatus, the model could be improved by adjusting on this covariate as well.
