<p>In conclusion, dengue poses a greater risk during the rainy season when large populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes exhibit a high degree of contact with humans. Despite this increase in risk of dengue during the rainy season, there was no evidence to indicate that VE is lower during these periods of increased dengue risk in endemic regions.
