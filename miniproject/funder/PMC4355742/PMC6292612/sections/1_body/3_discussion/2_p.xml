<p>In the combined analysis of 9â€“16 years-olds, we found significant different risks of dengue between the studies CYD14 and CYD15; moreover, country was significantly associated with dengue within each study. We investigated whether these findings were due to a difference in the effect of rainy season on dengue in the different age groups of the two studies. We found that no significant effect modification by age on rainy season in either the CYD14 or CYD15 analyses (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207878.s006">S4</xref> Tables respectively), suggesting that the effect of the rainy season was the same on children of all ages within the study ranges. We also performed similar analyses on children aged 9 years and older in CYD14 and found that the increased risk of dengue during the rainy season was similar to that in the all-age CYD14 analysis, suggesting that the increased risk of dengue during the rainy season is similar across the age range in the trials. To more precisely determine how the effect of rainy season varies by geographic location, it would be informative to explore the impact of rainy season within different countries or sites; however, the small number of cases precludes this type of analysis. We hypothesize that observed differences in dengue incidence by site, country, and/or study may reflect different average monthly and/or annual precipitation levels at the different trial sites. A better understanding of the patterns of rainy season on a more local scale would help guide public health policies and would justify strengthened preventive measures at given periods of the year.
