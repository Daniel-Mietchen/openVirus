   <bold>Competing Interests: </bold>I have read the journal’s policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests; ZM, MEH and PG were funded by contracts from Sanofi Pasteur. EL, RLO, MC, CF and LC are employees of Sanofi Pasteur. GC was employed as a Principal Investigator Coordinator by Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogotá who were contracted by Sanofi Pasteur to conduct the CYD15 study at five of the nine sites in Colombia. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.
