  <p>ZIKV isolates elicit different cytopathic effects in A549 and U-251 MG cell lines. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10 and cell viability was determined by MTT assay at 24 h post-infection. (
   <bold>C</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>D</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 0.01 and cell viability was determined by MTT assay 72 h post-infection. % Cytopathicity = 100% − ((Uninfected Absorbance − Infected Absorbance)/(Uninfected Absorbance) × 100%). Values represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate significant differences in % cytopathicity: *
