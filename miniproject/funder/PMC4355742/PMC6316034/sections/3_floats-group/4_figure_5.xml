  <p>Asian lineage ZIKV isolates induce a higher ratio of negative:positive strand RNA. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10 and 24 h post-infection intracellular positive strand viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are normalized to GAPDH and expressed relative to a standard curve of PFU equivalents per ng input RNA. (
   <bold>C</bold>) A549 cells and (
   <bold>D</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10 and 24 h post-infection the relative amounts of positive and negative strand ZIKV genomes was quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are expressed as a ratio of negative:positive strand RNA. Values represent mean Â± SEM of two or three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate significant differences: *
