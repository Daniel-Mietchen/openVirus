  <p>ZIKV isolates demonstrate unique plaque morphology and different growth kinetics in A549 and U-251 MG cell lines. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Representative images of Vero cell plaque assays of the indicated ZIKV isolates. (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>E</bold>) Cell culture supernatants were collected at the indicated time points and viral titer was determined by plaque assay. (
   <bold>B</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>C</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10. (
   <bold>D</bold>) A549, and (
   <bold>E</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 0.01. Values represent mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate significant differences in viral titer relative to ZIKV
