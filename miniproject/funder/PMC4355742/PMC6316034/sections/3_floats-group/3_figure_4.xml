  <p>Isolate-specific differences are observed in number and fluorescence intensity of dsRNA foci in infected cell. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10 and 24 h post-infection dsRNA expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Scale bar, 20 μm. The number of dsRNA foci per cell in (
   <bold>C</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>D</bold>) U-251 MG cells was quantified using Imaris software (&gt;100 cells/condition). (
   <bold>E</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>F</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10 and 24 h post-infection the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of dsRNA-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. Values represent mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate significant differences: *
