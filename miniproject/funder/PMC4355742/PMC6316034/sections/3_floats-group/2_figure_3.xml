  <p>Contemporary ZIKV isolates induce more dsRNA than pre-epidemic isolates, despite similar numbers of infected cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10 and at 24 h post-infection cells were stained with the pan-flavivirus (4G2) antibody and the percentage of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry. (
   <bold>C</bold>) A549 and (
   <bold>D</bold>) U-251 MG cells were infected with ZIKV at MOI = 10 and 24 h post-infection the percentage of dsRNA-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. The percentage of positive cells was determined by comparison to mock-infected cells. Values represent mean Â± SEM of at least three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate significant differences in % infected cells: *
