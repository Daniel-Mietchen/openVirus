<p>An infectious cDNA of ZIKV strain MR-766 (ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>; Genbank accession: HQ234498.1) was kindly provided by Matthew Evans (Mount Sinai, NY, USA) [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> viral stocks were generated by transfection of 293T cells with the infectious cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) followed by a single passage in Vero cells. ZIKV isolate PLCal_ZV (ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>; Genbank accession: KF99378) was generously provided by David Safronetz (National Microbiology Laboratories, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Isolates PRVABC59 (ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup>; Genbank accession: KU501215) and HS-2015-BA-01 (ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>; Genbank accession: KX520666) were provided by Tom Hobman (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada) and Mauro Teixeira (Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil), respectively. The passage history of each ZIKV isolate is described in
