<p>Translated amino acid sequences of 50 ZIKV polyproteins (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Table S1</xref>) were aligned using ClustalW [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Trees were constructed by neighbor joining of pairwise amino acid distances with the program MEGA7 (according to the distance scale provided) [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Bootstrap resampling was used to determine robustness of branches; values of â‰¥50% (from 1000 replicates) were used.
