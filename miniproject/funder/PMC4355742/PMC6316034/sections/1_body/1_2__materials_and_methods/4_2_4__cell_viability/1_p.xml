<p>Cell viability was monitored using a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay similar to what has been previously described [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, cells were plated at density of 2000 cells per well in flat-bottom 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Ten wells per strain were infected with 100 µL of ZIKV diluted to the indicated MOI. At the specified time points, 10 µL of 5 mg/mL MTT salt (Sigma-Aldrich) in EMEM solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, after which 100 µL of 10% SDS in 0.01 M HCl was added per well and the plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Absorbance at 550 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm was read on a Spark 10M plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). The average absorbance of 10 wells was used and viability experiments were carried out in triplicate. The data was expressed in % Cytopathicity, which was defined as: % Cytopathicity = 100% − ((Uninfected Absorbance − Infected Absorbance)/(Uninfected Absorbance) × 100%).
