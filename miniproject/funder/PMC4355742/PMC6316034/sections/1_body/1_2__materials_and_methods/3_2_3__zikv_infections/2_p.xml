<p>Viral titers were determined by plaque forming unit (PFU) assay on Vero cells. Briefly, 500 Î¼L of 10-fold serial dilutions were incubated for 2 h on Vero cell monolayers in 12-well plates. The virus inoculum was removed, and the cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 1.2% Carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada), 2% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Four days post-infection, cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize plaques.</p>
