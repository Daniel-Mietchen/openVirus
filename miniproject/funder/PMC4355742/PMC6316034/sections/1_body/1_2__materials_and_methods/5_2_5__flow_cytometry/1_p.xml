<p>A549 and U-251 MG cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per 15-cm
 <sup>2</sup> plate the day before infection. Cells were infected with ZIKV at indicated MOI as described above and harvested at the indicated time points. Prior to fixation, cells were stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were fixed using Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Bioscience, Mississauga, ON, Canada) for 20 min and then stained with anti-J2 dsRNA (Scicons, Szirák, Hungary) diluted 1:1000, anti-4G2 (Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada) diluted 1:200, or anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) diluted 1:800 in PermWash (BD Bioscience) for 1 h followed by secondary staining with goat anti-mouse Alexafluor 488 or goat anti-rabbit Alexafluor A546 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) diluted 1:300 for dsRNA or 1:500 for 4G2 and Caspase-3 in PermWash. Data were acquired on an LSRFortessa Analyzer (BD Bioscience) with BD FACSDiva software. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software version 10.5 (BD Bioscience, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Debris and doublets were excluded from the analysis using forward-scatter width discrimination, and the percentage of dsRNA-, 4G2-, or Caspase-3-positive cells was determined by comparison to mock-infected cells.
