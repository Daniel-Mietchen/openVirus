<p>Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that ZIKV can be divided into two main lineages: African and Asian (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The African lineage has caused sporadic infections over the last century, typically resulting in mild, febrile illness [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. All of the strains identified in the 2014–2016 epidemic are of the Asian lineage and are more closely related to the H/PF/2013 French Polynesia strains than the FSM/2007 Micronesia (Yap Island) strain, suggesting that these sub-lineages may have evolved independently from a common ancestor, anchored by the P6-740 strain (Malaysia, 1966) (

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Notably, ZIKV outbreaks in French Polynesia and South America were the first to be associated with neurological symptoms, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and fetal microcephaly [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As such, we sought to perform a comparative analysis of historical and contemporary ZIKV isolates to study the impact of genetic polymorphisms on viral replicative fitness and cytopathicity in cell culture. We chose a panel of ZIKV isolates including: Uganda 1947 (MR766, ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>); an early Asian lineage strain, isolated from a Canadian traveller whom returned from Thailand viremic in 2013 (PLCal_ZV, ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>); and two isolates from the 2015 outbreaks in Puerto Rico (PRVABC59, ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup>) and Brazil (HS-2015-BA-01, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>). Notably, ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> was mouse passaged and all of the other viral isolates were passaged through Vero cells or a combination of Vero and C6/36 mosquito cells (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Table S2</xref>). A detailed amino acid sequence comparison of these strains is available in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">File S1</xref>. Comparison of the overall amino acid composition across strains demonstrates that the maximum amino acid differences are between the ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> isolates (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Table S3</xref>). Polymorphisms are located throughout the viral polyprotein; however, several regions (prM, E, NS2A, NS4B, and NS5 proteins) have a higher accumulation of amino acid polymorphisms, particularly between the African and Asian lineages (
