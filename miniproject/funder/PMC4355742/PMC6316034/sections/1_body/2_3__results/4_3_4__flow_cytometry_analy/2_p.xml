<p>At the low MOI (0.01), the trend in % of dsRNA-positive cells closely mirrored the trend in cytopathicity (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S3</xref>). At 72 h post-infection at MOI 0.01, ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> has the highest % of dsRNA-positive cells in both the A549 and U-251-MG cells, with 30% and 15% dsRNA-positive cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S3A,B</xref>). All of the other ZIKV isolates had a lower % dsRNA-positive cells in both cell types (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S3A,B</xref>), consistent with the intermediate or low CPEs observed at this MOI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D). However, dsRNA staining is likely an underestimation the % infected cells if the viral isolates do not induce high levels of dsRNA. Nonetheless, these results suggest that although ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>, and possibly also ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup>, appear to have a replicative fitness advantage over a single infectious cycle that is more pronounced in astrocytoma cells, they appear to be impaired in cell spread when subjected to multiple rounds of infection at low MOI.
