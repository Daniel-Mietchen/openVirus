<p>Due to the discrepancies in CPEs elicited at different MOIs, we set out to determine the percent of ZIKV-infected cells at high and low MOI using flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S3</xref>). We initially determined the % infected cells by staining for the envelope glycoprotein using a pan-flavivirus (4G2) antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). At MOI 10, ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> infected a lower proportion of A549 cells (36%) when compared to ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> (82%) and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> (61%) at 24 h post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). A similar trend was observed in the U251-MG cells, where ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>, ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>, and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> infected 88%, 60%, and 72% of cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). However, we were unable to detect ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> using the envelope antibody in either cell line. Given that viral epitopes may have changed over the course of the viral evolutionary history, we stained for dsRNA as a marker for active viral replication, to ensure similar sensitivity of detection across all isolates. At MOI 10, we detected significantly more dsRNA in a higher proportion of A549 cells during ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> infection (40%), whereas only approximately 7% of A549 cells were dsRNA-positive in the other three isolates (ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>, ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>, and ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>) at 24 h post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). In the U251-MG cells, the rate of infection was similar to that in A549 cells for ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>, with approximately 10% and 6% dsRNA-positive cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). However, for both the contemporary isolates (ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>), a significantly higher percentage of cells were dsRNA-positive in U-251-MG cells, with approximately 36% and 51% dsRNA-positive cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). These results suggest that ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> may induce more viral RNA replication (as indicated by dsRNA staining) than ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>, since all three isolates display a similar % of infected cells when staining for the viral envelope, but vastly different amounts of dsRNA-positive cells. This may also be true for ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>, which had a similar percentage of dsRNA-positive cells; however, we were not able to assess the % infected cells for this isolate using the envelope antibody. Taken together, these results suggest that over a single infectious cycle, ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> infection results in a greater proportion of dsRNA-positive cells in both cell types, while ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> selectively induces more dsRNA-positive cells in U-251 MG cells.
