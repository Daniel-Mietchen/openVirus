<p>Finally, to further investigate whether the number and brightness of dsRNA foci was related to an increase in viral replication, we also quantified negative- and positive-strand viral RNA (vRNA) by qRT-PCR analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Given that three of the ZIKV isolates used in this study are patient isolates and therefore we are not able to determine absolute vRNA copy numbers using a standard curve of in vitro-transcribed RNA, we quantified positive-strand vRNA relative to a standard curve of vRNA from ZIKV stocks of known titer (log PFU equivalents) as has been done previously [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> produced less positive-strand vRNA than ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> in A549 cells, possibly due to the lower proportion of ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), there were no other statistically significant differences in intracellular positive-strand vRNA across ZIKV isolates in either cell type. This indicates that all of the ZIKV isolates produce similar levels of intracellular positive-strand vRNA after infection at high MOI.
