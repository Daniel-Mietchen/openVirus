<p>We next wanted to determine whether the increase in the % of dsRNA-positive cells observed during ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> infection was due to an increased number of replication complexes induced per cell. Thus, we quantified the number of dsRNA foci by immunofluorescence microscopy and image analyses at MOI of 10 in A549 and U-251 MG cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). In A549 cells, ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> yielded the greatest number of dsRNA foci per infected cell, with on average &gt;250 dsRNA foci/cell, while the Asian lineage isolates had, on average, approximately 124–166 dsRNA foci/cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). In contrast, in the U-251 MG cells, the Brazilian isolate had the greatest number of dsRNA-positive foci, with &gt;225 dsRNA-positive foci/cell, while all other isolates had &lt;100 dsRNA foci/cell on average (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). To further confirm these findings, we calculated the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of dsRNA-positive cells by flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f004">Figure 4</xref>E,F). The MFI revealed similar fluorescent intensities across ZIKV isolates in A549 cells, with the exception of ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup>, which were significantly more intense in this cell type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f004">Figure 4</xref>E). Moreover, in U-251 MG cells, the contemporary isolates displayed a higher MFI for dsRNA-positive cells, suggesting that there were greater amounts of dsRNA per cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). Taken together, this suggests that although the ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> isolate induced more dsRNA foci in A549 cells, they were on average of low fluorescence intensity. In contrast, in U-251 MG cells, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> produced substantially more dsRNA-positive foci, and together with ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup>, the foci were brighter than those of the ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> isolates. However, we cannot rule out the existence of a larger proportion of small dsRNA foci in these cells as our image analysis relied on a minimum foci size (0.3 × 0.3 × 4 µm) for quantification.
