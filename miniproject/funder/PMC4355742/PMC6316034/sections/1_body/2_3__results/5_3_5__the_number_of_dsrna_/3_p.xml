<p>Next, we wanted to determine the relative amount of the replicative intermediate, negative-strand vRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D). Interestingly, on average ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> produced approximately one copy of negative-strand intermediate vRNA for every 100 positive-strand vRNAs in both A549 and U-251 MG cells. In contrast, the Asian lineage isolates produced 1.9 to 2.6 negative strands for every 100 positive-strand vRNAs in A549 cells, and 2.2 to 3.9 negative-strands for every 100 positive strands in U-251 MG cells. This indicates that approximately 1.8 to 4.5-fold more negative-strand intermediate RNA is produced during infection with Asian lineage isolates when compared with ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>. Taken together, this data suggests that the Asian lineage isolates are able to produce more negative-strand intermediate vRNA than the African lineage isolate, and that the contemporary isolates, particularly ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>, induce more dsRNA in U-251 MG cells.
