<p>We next wanted to determine whether there was a connection between viral particle production and the ability to induce cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture. Using an MTT assay to investigate strain-specific differences in cytopathicity, we observed that when cells were infected at MOI of 10, CPE induced by the four ZIKV isolates was consistent with the viral load (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f002">Figure 2</xref>). More specifically, in the A549 cells, all isolates induced similar CPEs with approximately 25% cytopathicity, which represents a 25% reduction in cell viability at 24 h post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), with similar viral titers at this time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, in the U-251 MG cells, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> was significantly more cytopathic at the high MOI, inducing approximately 37% cytopathicity compared with an average of 18% cytopathicity at 24 h post-infection induced by the other ZIKV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Again, this finding is in good agreement with the relative viral titers at this time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). To determine whether CPEs were apoptosis-driven or due to other forms of cell death, we quantified cleaved caspase-3 positive cells by flow cytometry at MOI of 10 in both cell types (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S2</xref>). In A549 cells, apoptosis appears to account for a small proportion of cell death with 3.5%, 1.9%, and 7.2% cleaved caspase-3-positive cells during ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>, ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>, and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> infection, respectively; however, during ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> infection approximately 47% of cells stained positive for cleaved caspase-3 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S2A</xref>). In U251-MG cells, a similar pattern was observed with fewer cells staining positive for cleaved caspase-3 (between 0.6â€“1.43% for ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>, ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup>), whereas approximately 17.1% of cells were cleaved caspase-3-positive during ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> infection (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S2B</xref>). This suggests that, at least for ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>, ZIKV
 <sup>CDN,</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup>, apoptosis is not the main driver of CPEs during ZIKV infection, and thus, other forms of cell death are likely to contribute to this phenotype. However, apoptosis appears to have a greater contribution to CPEs observed during infection with ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>. Taken together, this suggests that over a single infectious cycle, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> induces more CPEs in U-251 MG cells than the other ZIKV isolates, likely due to an increase in apoptosis. In addition, at least at an MOI of 10, CPEs appear to be directly correlated with the viral titer for all four ZIKV isolates.
