<p>We first sought to determine the viral growth kinetics for each of the four ZIKV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>B–E). Viral titers were assessed using both one-step and multi-step growth curves after infection at an MOI of 10 and 0.01, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>B–E). At MOI of 10, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> grew to significantly higher titers at 8 h post-infection in both cell types, suggesting that ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> has an advantage in terms of growth kinetics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). In A549 cells, the increased titer of ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> was much less pronounced by 24 h post-infection, at which time the titers of the other isolates have nearly caught up to within 1-log of ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, in U-251 MG cells, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> continues to replicate to significantly higher titers than all other isolates at all time points post-infection, even when titers have begun to plateau by 24 h post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Interestingly, the ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> titers are already increasing by 8 h post-infection, whereas titers for the other isolates do not increase until after 8 h post-infection based on titers at 0 h [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Overall, this suggests that ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> replicates to higher titers in U-251 MG cells, with faster replication kinetics over a single infectious cycle.
