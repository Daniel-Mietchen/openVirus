<p>While preparing viral stocks we noticed differences in plaque morphology on Vero cells between the four ZIKV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Plaques from the historical ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> were smaller than plaques from the Asian lineage isolates and were more uniform in size (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Of the Asian lineage isolates, both ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> produced plaques with indefinite borders, whereas the plaques from the ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> had clearly defined edges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). In order to better characterize each viral isolate, we investigated strain-specific differences in growth kinetics, cytopathicity, infectivity, and viral RNA accumulation.
