<p>To further investigate the differences in viral replication kinetics between isolates, we also performed a multi-step growth curve at MOI of 0.01 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>D,E). In A549 cells, although at 48 h post-infection ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> have lower titers than ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>, there are no significant strain-dependent differences in viral titers at any other time point post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). In contrast, in the U-251 MG cells, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> grew to significantly higher titers at all time points post-infection when compared to all other viral isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). There were no significant differences in viral titers between the remaining isolates in U-251 MG cells, although ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> tended to have slightly higher titers than ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). Overall, the data demonstrates that over multiple rounds of infection, ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> appears to have a significant replicative advantage in U-251 MG cells, growing to higher titers than all other ZIKV isolates.
