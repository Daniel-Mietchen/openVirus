<p>Herein, we sought to compare viral replicative fitness by investigating viral growth kinetics, cytopathicity, and viral RNA accumulation of contemporary epidemic (2015â€“2016) and pre-epidemic ZIKV isolates in two cell culture models of ZIKV infection. First, we chose to use the A549 human lung epithelial carcinoma cells in order to contextualize our results within the literature, since A549 cells are widely used in ZIKV research [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although A549 cells were reported to be a resilient model of ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the lung is not a target of ZIKV infection in vivo [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, several studies have shown that astrocytes are a primary target of ZIKV infection in vivo [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and a recent study demonstrated that the U-251 MG human astrocytoma cell line is more permissive to ZIKV infection than A549 cells [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we chose to use the U-251 MG cell line because an astrocyte-derived cell type may be a more relevant model for ZIKV-induced neuropathology and be better able to distinguish differences between ZIKV isolates. We found that contemporary ZIKV isolates (from Puerto Rico and Brazil) appear to have an increase in viral replicative fitness in astrocytoma cells over a single infectious cycle, with significantly more double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-positive cells when compared to pre-epidemic isolates, despite similar numbers of infected cells. Moreover, when we investigated viral RNA accumulation, we found that the Asian lineage isolates had a substantially greater proportion of negative-strand intermediates than the African lineage isolate in both A549 and astrocytoma cells. However, over multiple rounds of infection, the contemporary ZIKV isolates appear to be impaired in cell spread, infecting a lower proportion of cells, despite the production of similar or higher titers. Our results suggest that the contemporary ZIKV isolates may have evolved mechanisms that allow them to replicate with increased efficiency in certain cell types and highlight the importance of cell-intrinsic factors in studies of viral replicative fitness.
