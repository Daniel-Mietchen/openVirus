<p>Several groups have shown strain-dependent differences in ZIKV infection in cell culture and mouse models of infection, albeit with conflicting results [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our data suggests that strain-dependent differences in viral replicative fitness are highly dependent on both cell type and the MOI used, which may explain some of these discrepancies in the literature. For example, several groups have demonstrated enhanced infectivity and replication by contemporary American ZIKV isolates, similar to what we observed herein at high MOI [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In contrast, other groups have shown that African lineage ZIKV isolates display higher infectivity and increased cytopathicity in cell culture than Asian lineage isolates when low MOIs (â‰¤1) were used, where few cells are predicted to be infected, similar to what we observed herein [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although it is postulated that the highly-passaged African lineage isolate (MR766) may not accurately represent the phenotype of circulating African lineage ZIKV isolates, it should be noted that a recent study suggests that MR766 behaves similarly to other low-passage African lineage isolates in cell culture, and that all African lineage ZIKV isolates tested were more cytopathic than Asian lineage isolates at low MOIs [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The observed trend in relative CPEs is consistent with our flow cytometry data and the viral titers observed herein, suggesting that there is not an inherent difference in cytopathicity of the four ZIKV isolates, but rather CPE elicited is a consequence of active viral replication. Notably, we found that apoptosis does not appear to be the main driver of cell death during infection, with the exception of ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>, which induced substantially more cleaved caspase-3 positive cells in both cell types. Moreover, we found that ZIKV infection induced more apoptosis in A549 cells than the U-251 MG cells, which is consistent with a recent study that suggests that human fetal astrocytes are resistant to ZIKV-induced apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that apoptosis may be more prevalent at later time points post-infection, as a recent study suggests a higher proportion of activated caspase-3 positive cells at later time points in both A549 cells and human fetal astrocytes with proportions similar to what we report here at earlier time points [
