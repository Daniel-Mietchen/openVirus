  <p>Pruned (A-C) and final graph (D) used to define clusters of cases in the rabies outbreak, obtained using A) only temporal distances, B) only spatial distances, C) only genetic distances and D) all three combined. Nodes represent cases, and edges potential epidemiological links, according to the corresponding data. The inner colours of the nodes indicate the final clusters obtained by combining all data streams (D), whilst the outer colours correspond to the clusters obtained using one data stream at a time. Grey indicates singletons. A reporting rate of 20% was assumed, and pruning cutoff distances corresponding to the 95% quantiles of the input distance distributions were used (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref> for sensitivity analyses on these assumptions). In each graph, the transparency of the vertices was adjusted according to the number of vertices in the graph, with more transparency in graphs with more vertices, to improve readability.
