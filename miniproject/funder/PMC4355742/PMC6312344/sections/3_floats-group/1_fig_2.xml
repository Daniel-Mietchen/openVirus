  <title>Visualization of the clusters of cases of rabies.</title>
  <p>The top left panel shows the incidence of reported cases of rabies over time, by date of report; cases identified as belonging to the same outbreak cluster (using all distances) are shown in the same colour (grey indicates singletons). The top right panel shows the geographic locations of the reported cases using the same colour coding as the incidence panel. The bottom panel shows the unrooted phylogeny obtained by Neighbour-Joining on Hamming distances (i.e. number of different nucleotides) between sampled sequences; the full tree showing two distinct strains more than 700 nucleotides apart is plotted on the left. Details of the two clades are provided in inset A) and B). A reporting rate of 20% was assumed, and pruning cutoff distances corresponding to the 95% quantiles of the input distance distributions were used (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref> for sensitivity analyses on these assumptions).
