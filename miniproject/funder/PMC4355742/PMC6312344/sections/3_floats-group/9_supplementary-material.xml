  <p>Graph representation of clusters of cases in the rabies outbreak, obtained from temporal, spatial and genetic data together, and using different assumptions on the reporting rate (10%, top row; 20%, middle row; and 50%, bottom row) and cutoff for pruning (corresponding to the 90% quantile, left column; 95% quantile, middle column; and 98% quantile; right column). The colours of the nodes (i.e. cases) correspond to the cluster they belong to according to the analysis using a given combination of reporting rate and cutoff. Grey indicates singletons.</p>
