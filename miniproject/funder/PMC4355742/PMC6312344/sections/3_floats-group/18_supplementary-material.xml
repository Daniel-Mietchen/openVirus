  <title>Distribution of the optimal cutoff choice (defined as that yielding the highest average between sensitivity and specificity), for the 200 baseline simulations.</title>
  <p>Note that for certain simulations, several cutoffs yielded the same performance, so a single simulation may be contributing to several cutoffs.</p>
