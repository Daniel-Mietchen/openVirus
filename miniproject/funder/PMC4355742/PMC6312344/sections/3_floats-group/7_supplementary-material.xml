  <title>Distributions of distances assumed for rabies and used to determine the cutoffs to be used at the pruning step.</title>
  <p>Top: Distribution of the serial interval in days (here defined as the time between reporting of a case and its infector). Middle: Distribution of the spatial kernel in kilometers (the distance between a case and its infector). Bottom: Distribution of the number of mutations between the whole genome sequence of the pathogen sampled from a case and its infector.</p>
