  <title>Schematic illustration of our graph approach for combining multiple data streams to identify outbreak clusters.</title>
  <p>In this example, two data streams are considered: the spatial locations of the cases (A) and a phylogeny of pathogens from these cases (D). The three ‘actual’ outbreak clusters are identified in red, blue and green, using different shadings to identify individual cases. Each data source defines a fully connected graph where nodes represent cases and edges are weighted by the spatial (B) and genetic distances (E). Thicker edges represent smaller weights (distances) between cases. Each graph is then pruned separately, removing edges whose weight exceeds a given cutoff (C, F). The intersection of these graphs defines a new graph which retains only edges present in every pruned graph (G). The resulting clusters of cases indicate likely outbreak clusters.</p>
