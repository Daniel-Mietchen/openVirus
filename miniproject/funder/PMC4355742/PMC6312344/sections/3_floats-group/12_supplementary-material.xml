  <title>Visualization of the clusters of cases of rabies on phylogenetic trees.</title>
  <p>The two clades referred to as A (top) and B (bottom) in the main text are represented separately for more readability (clades are distant by more than 700 nucleotides, masking all other diversity). The full phylogeny was obtained by Neighbour-Joining on Hamming distances. Results are shown for various combinations of the reporting rate (10%, top row; 20%, middle row; and 50%, bottom row) and cutoff for pruning (corresponding to the 90% quantile, left column; 95% quantile, middle column; and 98% quantile; right column). The colours correspond to the cluster cases are inferred as belonging to according to the analysis using a given combination of reporting rate and cutoff. Grey indicates singletons.</p>
