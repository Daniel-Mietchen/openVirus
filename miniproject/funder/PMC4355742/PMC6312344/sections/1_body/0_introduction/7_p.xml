<p>We illustrate our approach using surveillance data used for monitoring dog rabies in Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Rabies is an important and complex neglected zoonosis mainly transmitted to humans by dogs [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Campaigns to eliminate canine rabies through the vaccination of dogs, the treatment of all potential human rabies exposures, and the improvement of education about rabies prevention are ongoing but are in many low and middle income countries of limited impact due to the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the disease [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In Bangui, the dynamics of rabies is likely relying on a combination of local transmission, i.e. between dogs within the city, and importations, i.e. rabid dogs entering the city from neighbouring locations, therefore providing an interesting model for a proof of concept of our approach [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Characterising such dynamics, and in particular the relative importance of local transmission versus importations would be critical to implementing effective control strategies. If local transmission dominates the dynamics, then mass vaccination could be sufficient for control. However, if the repeated importations dominate the dynamics, restricting these and focusing on finding and vaccinating the external ‘source(s)’ of infections would be more efficient.
