<p>Defining the adequate cutoff is central to identifying clusters of related cases. We develop a framework for defining cutoffs based on the expected distance distributions between observed cases in an outbreak. This enables us to incorporate pre-existing information about the disease, e.g. the distribution of its serial interval (the time between symptoms onset in a case and its infector), its spatial kernel (the distribution of geographical distances between a case and its infector), and its mutation rate. Typically, such information is available for fully observed outbreaks, which is unlikely to be the case in practice. To address this issue, our approach also accounts for underreporting. We give a general solution to the expected distances between observed cases for a given level of reporting (i.e. fraction of observed cases), as well as some analytical results for common distributions used to describe distances between cases in time (the serial interval), space (the spatial kernel), and for genetic distances (the molecular clock).</p>
