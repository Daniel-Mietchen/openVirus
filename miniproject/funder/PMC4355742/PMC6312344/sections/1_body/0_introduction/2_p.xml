<p>The identification of clusters of cases is also key to adapting the response in ongoing epidemics. Indeed, early assessment of the relative contributions of local transmission versus case importation is essential for designing appropriate intervention strategies. For instance, a nosocomial outbreak may be driven by within-hospital transmissions or repeated introductions from the community, calling for different control measures [

In the case of zoonotic infections, it is also crucial to identify the extent to which within-species transmission and spill-over from the reservoir (i.e. cross-species transmission) contribute to the observed incidence, as illustrated in the case of avian influenza [
