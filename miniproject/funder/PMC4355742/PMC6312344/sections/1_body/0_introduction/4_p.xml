<p>In this study, we introduce a new, simple and intuitive framework for combining various sources of information to identify clusters of related cases of a disease. This evidence synthesis approach can combine various data streams such as the timing and location of the cases, as well as WGS of the pathogen, to identify such outbreak clusters. Our method relies on the observation that, in an outbreak, individuals who infect one another are likely to be closely related with respect to various characteristics; for instance, their symptom onsets appear within the same time period and in neighbouring locations, and they bear genetically similar pathogen strains. We consider that, to be part of the same outbreak cluster, two cases must be closely related in all relevant data streams. These data sources describe relationships between cases in intrinsically different spaces (e.g., temporal, spatial, genetic), but they can all be used to compute pairwise distances between cases (e.g. number of days between dates of onset, geographic distance between locations, number of mutations between pathogen WGS). We define, for each data stream, a weighted graph, where nodes correspond to cases, and the edge between two cases is weighted by the pairwise distance (for this data stream) between these two cases, so that ‘heavy’ edges indicate pairs of cases unlikely to have infected one another. To retain only relevant connections, each graph is then pruned by removing heavy edges, defined as edges whose weight exceeds a predefined cutoff distance (
