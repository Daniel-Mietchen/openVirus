<p>Each pruned graph represents potential epidemiological links between cases for a given data source. To combine these pieces of information, we merge the pruned graphs by intersection, i.e. retaining edges present in all pruned graphs, so that the resulting connected components of the final graph defines clusters of cases related for all types of data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The resulting clusters identify sets of cases likely belonging to the same transmission tree. Importantly, the sizes of the clusters also contain information about the underlying transmissibility [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We exploit this information by deriving estimates of the reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic> (the average number of secondary cases infected by an infectious individual in a large population), given the empirical distribution of the cluster sizes and the assumed reporting rate.
