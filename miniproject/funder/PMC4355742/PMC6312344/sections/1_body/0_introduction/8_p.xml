<p>Relying on dates of onset, geographic locations, and viral genetic sequences, we characterize the epidemiological situation using our method and compare the results to previous, more complex and computationally intensive approaches [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We also test the performance of our method by applying it to a range of simulated datasets. Results suggest our approach provides a fast, flexible, and efficient tool for detecting clusters of cases of an infectious disease linked by transmission.
