<p>Unlike previous approaches [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], our method also exploits preexisting information on the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate, to define whether cases are part of the same outbreak cluster or not. Our method will therefore be particularly useful to understand transmission patterns for known pathogens, for which the natural history, transmission characteristics and evolutionary rates are well described in the literature. On the other hand, non-parametric approaches such as that described in Ypma et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which make no assumption about the underlying pathogen, may be better suited to the analysis of data on emerging, poorly characterised pathogens. Note however that the performance of the method described in Ypma et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] has only been tested on data simulated using an extremely simple and unrealistic evolutionary model, with at least 80% reported cases. In contrast, our approach explicitly accounts for underreporting, and was tested on more realistic epidemic scenarios, with reporting rates as low as 10%. This makes our method more widely applicable in real-life epidemic investigations, in which fully observed transmission chains are rare.
