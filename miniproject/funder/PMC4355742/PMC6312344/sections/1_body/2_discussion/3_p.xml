<p>We used our approach to analyse a dataset of dog rabies in Central African Republic, previously studied using a combination of methods, including a much more complex approach involving particle Monte Carlo Markov chain inference [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The authors estimated an annual rate of 6.78 importations per year ([CI
 <sub>95%</sub>: [3.65; 14.08]), well in line with our main estimate of 4.91 (CI
 <sub>95%</sub>: [3.60; 6.65]) and broadly consistent with estimates obtained in our sensitivity analyses (central estimates ranging from 2.07 to 15.70 importations a year depending on the reporting rate assumed and the input cutoff used). Similarly, Bourhy et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] estimated a reproduction number just below the critical value of 1, which is consistent with our estimate of 
 <italic>R</italic> of 0.92 (CI
 <sub>95%</sub>: [0.85; 1.01]), with central estimates ranging from 0.41 to 0.98 depending on the reporting rate assumed and the input cutoff used). Simply put, our approach retrieved qualitatively identical results to the previous, more complex study, whilst being substantially simpler and orders of magnitude faster.
