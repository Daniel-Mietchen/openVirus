<p>Beyond its computational efficiency, our approach is also extensible to most other infectious diseases, and can be used to achieve epidemic evidence synthesis from any data. For instance, contact data can readily be incorporated in the form of binary distances, where the distance between cases with a reported contact is zero, and one otherwise. Our approach could use any measure of social [

Whenever deep sequencing data is available, existing measures of the genetic differentiation between populations can also readily be applied to describe genetic distances between individuals whilst accounting for within-host diversity [

An additional advantage of our approach for data integration is that it does not formally require different data streams to be independent. Rather, independence is a practical condition for the method to be more efficient: ideally, different data sources should be complementary rather than redundant, so that combining them effectively improves the identification of clusters of related cases.
