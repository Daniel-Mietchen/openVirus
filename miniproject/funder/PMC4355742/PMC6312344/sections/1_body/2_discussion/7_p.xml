<p>One current limitation of our method relates to partially missing data, i.e. cases documented on some but not all data streams (e.g. cases with an onset date but no location). So far, our method assumes that reported cases are documented for all the data sources. As our method explicitly incorporates underreporting, such partly missing data are currently discarded and the reporting probability adjusted accordingly. However, further work should be dedicated to dealing with partly missing data in a more constructive way.</p>
