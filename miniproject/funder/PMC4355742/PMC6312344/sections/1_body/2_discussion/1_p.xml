<p>We have described a new method to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease by combining several data streams. Our study used temporal, spatial and genetic data to detect outbreak clusters, but there is no theoretical limit to the number and nature of data sources, as long as the data can be used to compute a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of cases.</p>
