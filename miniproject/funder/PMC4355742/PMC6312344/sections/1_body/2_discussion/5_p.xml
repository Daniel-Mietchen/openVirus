<p>Interestingly, the identification of optimal cutoffs may not always be necessary. In some cases, one may choose to prioritise high sensitivity or high specificity depending on the relative importance of not detecting an importation versus misclassifying a transmission link as an importation. For example our method could be used with high cutoffs to design a highly sensitive surveillance tool, which would then trigger a warning calling for closer examination of the suspected new outbreak clusters.</p>
