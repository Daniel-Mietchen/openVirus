<p>Interestingly, the clusters identified in the final graph (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) could not be revealed by any data stream alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g004">Fig 4Aâ€“4C</xref>), which illustrates the value of integrating all data streams to identify outbreak clusters. The temporal data alone identified only three clusters of size 2, 23 and 98 respectively; the spatial data could not distinguish any separate introductions; finally, the genetic data led to 9 singletons, three pairs, and three larger clusters of size 7, 17 and 84 respectively. Using all data streams together, a total of 23 distinct clusters were identified, including 16 singletons, two pairs and 5 larger clusters containing respectively 5, 6, 8, 9, and 75 observed cases. These clusters are overlaid on the original data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Importantly, the fact that spatial data alone did not identify any cluster does not mean that this data contained no information on potential clusters. In fact, spatial data was useful in combination with temporal and genetic information, allowing to disentangle outbreak clusters which were otherwise seen as a single outbreak when considering temporal and genetic data only.
