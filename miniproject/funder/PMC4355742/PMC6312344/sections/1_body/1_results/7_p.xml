<p>We also performed a simulation study to assess the extent to which our method was able to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission and accurately estimate the underlying reproduction number and reporting rate. Results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Our method performed generally very well, but the cutoff choice affected the results dramatically. In our main analysis of simulated datasets aiming to reproduce the Bangui epidemiological situation, the mean sensitivity (measured as the True Positive Rate, TPR, see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec004">materials and method</xref>) was 99.3% with a mean specificity (measured as the True Negative Rate, TNR) of 99.7%. The corresponding median relative error in the estimated parameters was low, at -2.5% for the reproduction number and -0.8% for the importation rate (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref> for more results). These results were obtained assuming the same reporting rate as in the simulation, and with a cutoff corresponding to the 95% quantile of the input distributions. Using higher quantiles generally led to a higher sensitivity, but a lower specificity. The average between sensitivity and specificity was very high for all but the highest cutoff considered (99.9% quantile), and was maximal for the 95% quantile (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s013">S12</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s014">S13</xref> Figs). Misspecifying the reporting rate led to lower performances: underestimating and overestimating the reporting rate were associated respectively with lower specificity and lower sensitivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In other simulation scenarios with different reporting rates, using the 95% quantile for pruning led to good although slightly poorer performance, with a mean average between sensitivity and specificity greater than 82%. Varying the degree of diversity in the pathogen sequences of the imported cases didnâ€™t affect much the performance of the method (mean average between sensitivity and specificity greater than 93%,
