<p>We have illustrated our method by applying it retrospectively to the data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. However, our method would also be extremely useful in real-time for disentangling clusters of related cases from isolated cases due to separate introductions of the pathogen into the population. Indeed, this could have a direct impact on control policies, providing information in real time on whether to prioritise control measures aiming at reducing transmission or at reducing importations (or both). In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>, we present a sensitivity analysis where our method is applied to the rabies dataset at two intermediate time points, as well as at the end. We show that our method is robust to application in real-time, with very few differences between the allocation of cases to different clusters in real-time and retrospectively (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref> for detailed results).
