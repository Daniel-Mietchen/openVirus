 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows, overlaid onto the observed pairwise distances, the distributions for the expected distances (in time, space or genetic) between a case and its closest observed ancestor based on the literature and given an assumed reporting rate of 20% [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The equivalent distributions with no underreporting, i.e. the distributions of expected distances between a case of rabies and its infector are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s002">S1 Fig</xref>. Based on these input distributions, we defined cutoffs for each data stream corresponding to the 95% quantiles (90 and 98% quantiles were also considered in sensitivity analyses, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The observed temporal, geographic, and genetic distances were combined with the input cutoffs to produce pruned graphs for each data stream (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g004">Fig 4Aâ€“4C</xref>). These graphs were in turn intersected to produce the final graph whose connected components are clusters of cases connected in all dimensions, therefore representing cases likely linked by transmission (
