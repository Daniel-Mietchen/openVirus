<p>The results presented above were obtained by assuming a reporting rate of 20%, and using a cutoff corresponding to the 95% quantile of the input distance distributions at the pruning step. We explored the extent to which results were affected by changes in these assumptions in sensitivity analyses presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>, where reporting rates of 10%, 20% and 50%, and cutoffs corresponding to the 90%, 95% and 98% quantiles were considered. Lower reporting rates and higher quantiles generally led to fewer, larger clusters (

The largest cluster comprised from 21 to 90 cases across scenarios. In all scenarios, the largest cluster included cases occurring in 2007 when a surge in reported cases was observed. The estimates of the reproduction number in the two most extreme scenarios were 0.41 (CI
 <sub>95%</sub>: [0.31; 0.52] for a reporting rate of 50% and a cutoff corresponding to the 90% quantile) and 0.98 (CI
 <sub>95%</sub>: [0.93; 1.04] for a reporting rate of 10% and a cutoff corresponding to the 98% quantile) respectively. The estimated rate of importation of rabies into the population for these two extreme scenarios was 15.70 [95%CI 13.74; 18.10] and 2.07 [95%CI 1.20; 3.60] importations per year respectively.
