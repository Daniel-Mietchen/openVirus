<p>151 dogs infected with rabies were reported in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic between the 6th January 2003 and the 6th March 2012. Of these, 123 cases had a date of report available, as well as a geographical location and viral genome sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Pairwise distances between these 123 cases are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g003">Fig 3</xref>, separately for temporal, spatial, and genetic distances. The distribution of spatial distances was unimodal, with an average pairwise distance of 3.9km. In contrast, the distribution of temporal distances exhibited two peaks, one at very short time differences, and one around 4 years, likely driven by the multiple peaks in the observed incidence time series (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The distribution of genetic distances was multimodal (as expected from the phylogeny in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g002">Fig 2</xref>), with a main mode at 4 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and the presence of distinct lineages shown by some sequences differing by over 700 SNPs.
