<p>The Institut Pasteur of Bangui, under the instruction of the State health department of the Central African Republic, conducts the collection of suspected rabies dogs and performs rabies laboratory diagnosis according to established national standardized protocols and WHO guidelines [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Over the period 2003–2012, a linelist of 151 rabies cases was collated, with information on the date of report, the spatial coordinates (for all the isolates originating from Bangui), and the genetic sequence of the isolated virus. Rabies diagnosis was performed by direct immunofluorescence on smears of suspected animals, and confirmed in parallel using RT-PCR [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Viral RNA from brain samples was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extractions, RT-PCR and sequencing were performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. 42% of the viral genome was sequenced, including the N, P, M, G and intergenic G-L region, corresponding to positions 161 to 5,221 of the RABV genome [
