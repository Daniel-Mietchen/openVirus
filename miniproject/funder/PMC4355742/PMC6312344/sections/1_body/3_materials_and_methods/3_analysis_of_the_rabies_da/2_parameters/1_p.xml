<p>Information on the distributions of expected distances between rabies cases was retrieved from the literature to inform the cutoff choice used at the pruning step. Following Hampson et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], we assumed a Gamma distributed serial interval, with mean 23.6 days and standard deviation 20.9 days [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. We assumed a Rayleigh distributed spatial Kernel with scale 0.70km, consistent with a mean transmission distance of 0.88 km, as in Hampson et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We assumed a substitution rate of 5.9 x 10
 <sup>âˆ’4</sup> substitutions per site per year for rabies, as estimated in Bourhy et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The distributions of the serial interval, spatial kernel, and number of mutations between transmission pairs are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s002">S1 Fig</xref>. We considered, as in Bourhy et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a reporting rate of 20% in our main analyses (presented in the main text), and reporting rates of 10 and 50% respectively in two extreme scenarios considered in sensitivity analyses (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Finally, in our main analyses we used the 95% quantile of all input distributions as cutoff at the pruning step. Cutoffs corresponding to the 90% and the 98% quantiles were also considered in sensitivity analyses (
