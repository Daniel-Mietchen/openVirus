<p>In summary, given a set of observed outbreak cluster sizes, we obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of 
 <italic>R</italic> (and associated confidence intervals), as well as estimates of the total number of imported cases accounting for under-reporting. A rate of importation is then derived from the total number of imported cases and the period covered by the surveillance system.
