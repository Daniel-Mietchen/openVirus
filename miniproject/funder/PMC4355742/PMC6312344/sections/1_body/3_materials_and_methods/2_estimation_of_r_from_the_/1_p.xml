<p>Transmissibility of a pathogen can be measured using the reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic>, defined as the average number of secondary cases infected by a single primary case. Here we assume that the number of secondary cases (or ‘offsprings’) follows a Poisson distribution with mean 
 <italic>R</italic>. Intuitively, the final size (i.e. the total number of cases once extinction has occurred) of an outbreak seeded with one infected individual, is related to 
 <italic>R</italic>. Numerous studies have characterised this relationship and provided formulations to estimate the reproduction number from the final size of naturally extinct outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. We built on such methods to account for under-reporting (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Assuming unobserved cases are distributed at random across the outbreaks, this approach adjusts the likelihood of an observed outbreak final size by integrating over all possible unobserved cases in that outbreak. Importantly, this method also accounts for the possibility for some, typically small outbreaks, to go entirely unobserved. The method estimates 
 <italic>R</italic>, as well as the probability of observing an outbreak, 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>obs</italic>
 </sub>. An estimate of the number of unobserved outbreaks may then be obtained assuming that it follows a negative binomial distribution characterised by 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>obs</italic>
 </sub> and the number of observed outbreaks. A full description of the inference on both the reproduction number and the number of importations can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The method is implemented and documented in the package 
 <italic>branchr</italic> for the R software [
