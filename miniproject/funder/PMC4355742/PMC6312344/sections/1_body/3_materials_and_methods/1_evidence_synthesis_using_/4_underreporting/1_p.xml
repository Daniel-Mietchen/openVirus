<p>Typically in an outbreak, reporting is incomplete, for example due to imperfect surveillance systems, asymptomatic cases, or patients not seeking care. Such underreporting will directly affect the distances between observed cases, with more underreporting leading to larger distances. For instance, for the temporal data stream, the delay between symptom onset in a case and its closest observed ancestor is typically longer as underreporting, and hence the number of unobserved intermediate cases, increases. If the overall reporting probability, π, is known, and assuming that the probability of being reported is identical for all cases, the number of unobserved intermediate cases between two observed cases can be described by a geometric distribution with probability π. Using this property, we propose, in that case, to define the cutoff κ

 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>,
  <italic>π</italic>
 </sup>, the distribution of the expected distance between an observed case and its closest observed ancestor, accounting for potential unobserved intermediate cases. The formula to derive

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Note that if all cases are observed i.e. π = 100%, then
