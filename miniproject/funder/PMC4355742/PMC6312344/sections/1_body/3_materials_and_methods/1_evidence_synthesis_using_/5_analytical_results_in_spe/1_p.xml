<p>For the three data streams detailed here, we assume that data is available to inform the distribution of the serial interval (the time between a given event such as symptoms onset in a case and its infector), the spatial kernel (the distribution of geographical distances between a case and its infector), and the mutation rate per genome per generation (which, combined with the distribution of the serial interval, can be translated into a distribution of the number of SNPs between a case and its infector [
