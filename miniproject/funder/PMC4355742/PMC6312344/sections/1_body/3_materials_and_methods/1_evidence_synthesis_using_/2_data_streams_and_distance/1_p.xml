<p>Our method is very generic and could be applied using any number and type of data streams, and any distance metric for a given data stream. However, we explore in detail three data streams for which data is commonly available: data on the timing of infection of cases, data on the location of cases, and WGS of the pathogen sampled from each case. For the temporal data stream, we define the distance between two cases as the delay between a specific clinical event (typically symptoms, but could be anything else) in the two cases. For the spatial data stream, we consider the Euclidean distance between the locations of each pair of cases (e.g. the location of their home but again could be defined differently). Finally, for genetic data, we measure the distance between two cases as the Hamming distance, defined as the number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between the pair of considered sequences.</p>
