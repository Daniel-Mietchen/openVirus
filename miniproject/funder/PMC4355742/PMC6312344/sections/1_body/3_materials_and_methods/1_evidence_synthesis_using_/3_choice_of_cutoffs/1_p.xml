<p>The choice of the cutoff κ
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sup> for each data stream will dramatically influence the number of edges retained through the pruning process, and in turn the size of the clusters derived by our method. Here, we consider the case where the pathogen of interest is already known, or where existing case-investigation data exist, so that preexisting information on the distribution of expected distances between cases can be used as input to inform the cutoff choice. If 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sup> denotes the input probability density function or probability mass function of expected distances between a case and its infector for data stream n, the cutoff κ
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sup> for that data stream could then be defined as a predetermined quantile of 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sup>, for instance the 95% quantile. With this approach, two cases would be considered disconnected with respect to data stream 
 <italic>n</italic> (after the pruning step), if the distance between them 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sup>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>,
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub> is larger than the 95% quantile of the input distribution 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sup>. Note that, when several independent data sources are combined, the quantile could be chosen to ensure a certain sensitivity. For instance in our application with 3 data streams, a quantile of 95%
 <sup>1/
  <italic>3</italic>
 </sup> ≈ 98% in each of the 
 <italic>3</italic> data streams would lead to an overall sensitivity of 95%. Note however that this assumes independence between all data streams, which in practice would rarely be the case. For instance, if a secondary case arises soon after a primary case, it is likely to also be close to the primary case in geographical and genetic space. In the presence of such correlations, the resulting sensitivity is likely to be larger than 95%.
