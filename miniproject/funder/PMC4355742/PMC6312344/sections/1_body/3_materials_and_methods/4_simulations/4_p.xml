<p>Following Beugin 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we quantify the ability of our method to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission, through measuring 1) the true positive rate (
 <italic>TPR</italic>) or sensitivity, i.e. the proportion of pairs of cases belonging to the same transmission tree who are inferred to be in the same outbreak cluster), 2) the true negative rate (
 <italic>TNR</italic>) or specificity, i.e. the proportion of pairs of cases not belonging to the same transmission tree who are assigned to different outbreak clusters and 3) the mean between 
 <italic>TPR</italic> and 
 <italic>TNR</italic>, which is proportional to the Rand index, a common criterion used to evaluate clustering methods [
