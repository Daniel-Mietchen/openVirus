<p>For each simulation scenario, we used our method to reconstruct the clusters of cases linked by transmission, as well as re-estimate the reproduction number and the importation rate. In the reconstruction process, we used input distributions obtained by assuming the same mutation rate, genome length, serial interval and spatial kernel as in the simulation. For the analysis of the baseline simulations, we systematically varied the cutoffs and reporting rate, as described in
