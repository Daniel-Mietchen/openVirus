<p>We performed a simulation study to assess the ability of our method to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission and to accurately estimate the underlying reproduction number and importation rate. We considered six simulation scenarios mimicking the transmission of rabies among dogs. Our baseline scenario was designed to closely mirror the transmission characteristics underlying the transmission of rabies in our dataset from Bangui. We then considered five variations of this scenario: a ‘low’, ‘high’ and ‘perfect’ reporting scenarios similar to the baseline scenario but with varying levels of reporting, and a ‘low’ and ‘high’ diversity scenarios, similar to our baseline but where the imported cases had pathogen genetic sequences respectively much more similar and much more different to one another. The scenarios are described in
