<p>The observation that the proportion of hypertension among participants &lt;60 y/o was higher for DENV IgG positive than DENV IgG negative subjects (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006879.s005">S4 Table</xref>) suggest that certain risk factor might associate with DENV IgG positivity or susceptibility to DENV infection. Growing evidence supports the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of hypertension and perturbation of the gut microbiota has been reported to increase the susceptibility to DENV and other flavivirus infections in mice, though the mechanisms remain to be explored in future studies [

It is worth noting that the proportion of comorbidities among DENV IgG positive subjects (41/131 = 30.4%) or among all participants (209/1090 = 19.2%) was lower than the proportion of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases together) for adults â‰¥18 y/o in Taiwan (41.8%) [
