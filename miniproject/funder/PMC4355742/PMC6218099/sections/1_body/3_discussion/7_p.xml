<p>As described in the Methods section, all study participants were asymptomatic during enrollment and only 0.8% of the 1,088 participants and 127 returning participants had a history of recent dengue, suggesting that the enrollment or follow-up was unlikely to be biased by a history of recent dengue. In addition, our questionnaires revealed that 79 (7.3%) of the 1,088 participants had a history of dengue among family members (though not limited to those in the same household), which was lower than the DENV seroprevalence of 12.4% of this study but higher than the estimate of dengue prevalence in Kaohsiung City (1.7%) based on cumulative confirmed cases [
