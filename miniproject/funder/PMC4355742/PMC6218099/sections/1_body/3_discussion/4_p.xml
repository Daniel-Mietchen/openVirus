<p>In agreement with reports from other DENV-endemic regions, DENV seroprevalence in Kaohsiung city increased with age. However, the patterns of age-specific DENV seroprevalence and peak of clinically severe disease among the elderly were different from those in the Americas and Southeast Asia, where dengue hospitalization peaked in children or young adults [

In Brazil, a study in 2006 reported that the DENV seroprevalence rate increased from 54% (5–6 y/o group) to 85% (10–14 y/o group), and the mode of monotypic immunes, which corresponds to the peak of severe disease in age, was estimated to be 14 y/o [

In Singapore, the DENV seroprevalence rate increased from 42% (30–49 y/o group) to 78% (50–59 y/o group); the incidence of severe dengue showed two peaks: one in the 18–29 y/o group probably representing the monotypically immune population and the other in the ≥60 y/o group probably associated with underlying diseases among the elderly (
