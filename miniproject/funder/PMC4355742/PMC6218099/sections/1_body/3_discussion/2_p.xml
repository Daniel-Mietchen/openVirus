<p>The overall DENV seroprevalence in Kaohsiung City was 12.4%. Despite the low seroconversion rate, we used a DENV2-virion IgM ELISA to identify recent infections and calculated the infection rate of the 2015 outbreak. Due to the transient nature of IgM production (duration of ~3–4 months) and the gap between the 2015 and 2016I surveys (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), the possibility of underestimating the infection rate cannot be completely ruled out. Nonetheless, we found that the infection rate in Sanmin district was higher than in Nanzih district (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); consistent with this, a mosquito survey in September 2015 showed higher Breteau, house, larva and adult indices in Sanmin district compared with Nanzih district [

Sanmin is a heavily populated district with many small parks used for community activities, and many new buildings under construction, where unattended waste and water accumulation with high mosquito density have been reported by the city. In contrast, Nanzih is a less populated industrial district with factories and unused land [

The observation that DENV seroprevalence in Sanmin district (16.4%) is higher than that in Nanzih district (6.9%) suggests district-level differences in a metropolitan area and highlights the importance of checking the DENV immune status of each individual before Dengvaxia vaccination [
