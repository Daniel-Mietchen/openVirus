<p>There are several limitations to our study. First, it is worth noting that many commercially available IgG kits, some of which capture human IgG first followed by adding DENV antigens and detecting reagents, have been calibrated to detect high-titer IgG and, therefore, are more suitable to test for recent DENV exposure. The possibility that the InBios DENV detect IgG ELISA has lower sensitivity for detecting remote DENV infections cannot be completely ruled out. However, this caveat is unlikely to affect our major finding of a sharp and significant increase in DENV seroprevalence in the 70â€“79 y/o age group. Second, future studies involving larger sample sizes, randomicity and other districts are crucial to verify the observations in this study. Third, while this study suggests that DENV seroprevalence is low in children (7.1%) based on limited numbers of participants &lt;20 y/o, future studies are needed to investigate the DENV seroprevalence among children, which will reflect interim dengue endemicities. Fourth, another limitation is that all blood samples during the 2015 survey were not taken prior to onset of the 2015 outbreak (

A study of the 1997 outbreak in Santiago de Cuba also reported a low primary DENV infection rate (2%), probably related to focal transmission and heterogeneous distribution of

Additionally, although we found that DENV IgG positivity was unlikely to be attributable to immunization with inactivated JEV vaccine &gt;14 years before, future studies involving sequential samples from recipients of different JEV vaccines (inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines) are needed to better understand the effect of JEV vaccination on DENV IgG serological tests.
