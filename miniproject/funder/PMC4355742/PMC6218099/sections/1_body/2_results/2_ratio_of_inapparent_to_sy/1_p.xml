<p>In addition to capturing seroconversion between the 2015 and 2016I surveys, we also tested samples using a DENV2-virion IgM ELISA during the 2015 (August to November) and 2016I (February to May) surveys to identify infection during the 2015 outbreak, which began in July 2015 and ended in January 2016. There were 19 IgM positive out of 363 samples in Sanmin district and 7 IgM positive out of 346 samples in Nanzih district. We used the number of IgM positive or seroconversion samples (

Using a similar calculation, the infection rate was 2.02% (95% CI: 0.54–2.78%) in Nanzih district; we estimated 2,999 inapparent and 630 symptomatic infections, corresponding to a ratio of inapparent to symptomatic DENV infections of 4.76.
