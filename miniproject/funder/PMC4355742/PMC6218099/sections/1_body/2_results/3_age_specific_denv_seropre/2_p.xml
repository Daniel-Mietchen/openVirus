 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006879.s004">S3 Table</xref>). The distribution of dengue cases increased gradually with age and peaked in the 50–69 y/o group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The proportion of severe dengue among total dengue cases started to increase in the 50–59 y/o group and peaked in the 70–79 and 80–89 y/o groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g003">Fig 3B</xref>); similar trends were observed based on the number or incidence of severe dengue in different age groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006879.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The age-specific dengue cases and proportion of severe dengue in both the Sanmin and Nanzih districts showed a pattern similar to that of Kaohsiung City (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the increase in the proportion of severe dengue with age correlated well with the increase in DENV seroprevalence with age (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.94, P = 0.005, two-tailed Spearman correlation test) (
