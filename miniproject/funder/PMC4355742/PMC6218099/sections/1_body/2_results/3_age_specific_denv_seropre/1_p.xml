<p>We further analyzed DENV seroprevalence stratified by age group (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006879.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Based on the 2015 survey in Sanmin district, DENV seroprevalence rates increased with age from 2% (20–29 y/o), to 4.8% (30–39 y/o), 32.1% (60–69 y/o) and 62.9% (70–79 y/o). In Nanzih district, seroprevalence rates were 4.8% (20–49 y/o), 9.3% (60–69 y/o) and 36.4% (70–79 y/o). The age-specific DENV seroprevalence of the two districts is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g003">Fig 3A</xref>. Despite the difference between the two districts, a sharp and significant increase in seroprevalence from the 50–69 y/o group (born between 1946 and 1965) to those ≥70 y/o (born before 1945) was observed in both districts (P = 0.0002 and 0.002 for Sanmin and Nanzih districts, respectively, Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed), suggesting that the historical island-wide outbreak of 1943–1944 may account for the higher seroprevalence rate among the elderly (≥70 y/o) in Kaohsiung City.
