<p>Testing with the InBios DENV detect IgG ELISA revealed 103 positive, 10 equivocal and 515 negative samples in Sanmin district, corresponding to an overall IgG seroprevalence rate of 16.4% (95% CI: 13.5–17.9%) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). During the 2016I survey right after the 2015 outbreak, 50 of the 202 participants (24.8%) enrolled in 2015 provided a second blood sample; one was found to seroconvert, corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 2% (95% CI: -1.9–4.0%). In Nanzih district, 32 samples were positive, 9 were equivocal and 420 were negative, corresponding to an overall IgG seroprevalence rate of 6.9% (95% CI: 4.6–8.1%). Seventy seven of the 215 participants (35.8%) enrolled in 2015 provided a second blood sample; one seroconverted, corresponding to a seroconversion rate of 1.3% (95% CI: -1.2–2.6%). Consistent with the higher number of dengue cases in Sanmin district compared with Nanzih district (3.8 fold higher) during the recent outbreaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), the overall DENV seroprevalence rate in Sanmin district (16.4%) was 2.4 fold higher than that in Nanzih district (6.9%, P&lt;0.0001, Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed). Combining data from the two districts, the overall DENV IgG seroprevalence was 12.4% (95% CI: 10.5–13.4%). There was no difference in the DENV seroprevalence rate between males and females (14.4% vs. 11.3%, P = 0.15, Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed).
