<p>A nationwide JEV vaccination campaign in Taiwan was launched in the 1960s; children &lt;3 y/o received two doses of inactivated JEV vaccine initially, followed by an increase to three doses (with a booster dose after one year) since 1974 and to four doses (with the last dose during the first year of elementary school) since 1976 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To investigate whether JEV vaccination affected our estimates of DENV seroprevalence, we analyzed the relationship between DENV IgG positivity and history of JEV vaccination or JEV infection through questionnaires during the 2017 survey. Study participants ≤54 y/o (born in 1963 or after) were considered to have received JEV vaccine, and those who were &gt;54 y/o and responded “yes” on questionnaires were considered to have experienced previous JEV infection. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 46% of those with DENV IgG positivity had JEV vaccination or infection, which was significantly lower than the 78% of those with DENV IgG negativity (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0017, Fisher’s exact test, two tailed), suggesting that DENV IgG positivity among adults in this study was unlikely attributed to previous immunization with inactivated JEV vaccine &gt;14 years before during their childhood.
