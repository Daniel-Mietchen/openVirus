The study enrolled participants from two districts (Sanmin and Nanzih) at the beginning of the 2015 outbreak (between August and November 2015) and during three periods after the outbreak (2016I: between February and May 2016; 2016II: between September 2016 and January 2017; and 2017: between August and September 2017) (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. All residents in the two districts were invited to visit the study sites at different community activity centers (enrolling 111 to 215 participants per district during each survey). To record seroconversion, all participants in the 2015 survey were contacted to provide a second blood sample during the 2016I survey. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of enrollment and sample collection; 8 mL blood samples were collected through venipuncture, and sera were processed on the same day and stored at -80 Â°C until use. Questionnaires regarding demographic and socioeconomic information (such as age, sex, education, income), history of dengue, and history of chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, tuberculosis, cancer, chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccination or infection were obtained. Overall, 9 (0.8%) and 31 (2.8%) of the 1,088 participants had a history of recent (2015) and past dengue, respectively; these included individuals with laboratory-confirmed, clinically suspected or self-reported dengue. Of the 417 participants in the 2015 survey, 127 (30.5%) returned voluntarily to provide a follow-up serum sample. Only one (0.8%) had a history of recent dengue, suggesting that individuals returning for re-testing were not doing so because of recent DENV infection.
