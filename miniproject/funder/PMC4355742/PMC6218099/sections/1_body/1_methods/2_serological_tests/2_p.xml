<p>To identify recent infection during the 2015 DENV2 outbreak, an in-house DENV2-virion IgM ELISA was used for serum samples, which were positive or equivocal based on the InBios DENV IgG ELISA during the 2015 and 2016I surveys. Briefly, pellets of DENV2 virions derived from ultracentrifugation of culture supernatants of virus-infected Vero cells or pellets of mock-infected Vero cells were UV inactivated, diluted in coating buffer and loaded on flat-bottom 96-well plates at 4°C overnight, as described previously [

This was followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h and incubation with serum samples (diluted 1:100), which had been preincubated with Gullsorb reagent (Meridian Bioscience) for 10 min to avoid interference of serum IgG or rheumatoid factor on IgM bound to antigen, followed by anti-human IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, TMB substrate and stop solution [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The OD at 450 nm was read with a reference wavelength of 650 nm; samples with signal greater than 3 standard deviations of the mean signal from four negative controls were considered positive [
