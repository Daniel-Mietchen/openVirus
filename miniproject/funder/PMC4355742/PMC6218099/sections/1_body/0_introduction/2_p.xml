<p>Following primary DENV infection, individuals develop long-lived protection against the serotype that they are infected with. During secondary infection with a different DENV serotype, individuals have a higher risk of developing severe disease compared with those experiencing primary infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, due to its low efficacy and increased risk of severe disease accompanying breakthrough DENV infection among DENV-naive individuals, Dengvaxia has been recommended only for DENV seropositive individuals aged 9–45 years [

Studies on DENV seroprevalence can be conducted to assess the potential efficacy of DENV vaccine candidates and to identify individuals who will benefit from being vaccinated. Moreover, DENV seroprevalence studies can improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics among individuals and in different locations, which can, in turn, aid in the development of intervention strategies.
