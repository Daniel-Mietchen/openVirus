<p>Epidemics of dengue disease in Taiwan have been documented since 1902 with an island-wide outbreak occurring in 1942–1943. After World War II (WWII), no dengue outbreak was reported for nearly four decades until 1981, when a DENV2 outbreak occurred in an off-shore islet, the Liuchiu township [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This was followed by a large DENV1 outbreak of &gt;4,000 cases in Kaohsiung City and Pingtung county in 1987–1988. Since then, outbreaks of 100–300 confirmed DENV cases have occurred in southern Taiwan every 2 to 3 years until 2001–2002, when another large DENV2 outbreak of &gt;5,000 confirmed cases took place [

Starting from 2004, a pattern of &gt;200 cases per year as baseline and frequently &gt;800 cases was observed until 2014, when an outbreak (primarily DENV1) with 15,492 confirmed cases occurred in Kaohsiung City. This was followed by another outbreak (primarily DENV2) with 43,419 confirmed cases mainly in Tainan and Kaohsiung Cities in 2015, which was the largest in Taiwan after WWII [
