<p>To test hypotheses about the co-occurrence of syndemic factors, the following algorithm was employed to “count” the number of syndemic factors occurring with a participant in an analogous fashion to other investigations of a syndemic among MSM [

 <xref rid="pone.0206746.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The presence of engaging in HIV risk behavior was coded by employing the Boolean OR operator with the following: Did the participant report currently having more than 1 male sexual partner in the past 90 days? and Did the participant report engaging in CAI in the past 90 days? The presence of engaging in substance misuse was coded by employing the Boolean OR operator with the following: Did the participant report binge drinking in the past 90 days? and Did the participant report illicit use of any other substance in the past 90 days? The presence of experiencing IPV remained coded as noted above. All of these variable were thus binary (1 = presence of the particular syndemic factor; 0 = absence of the particular syndemic factor) for a participant. Finally, a sum of the number of these three syndemic factors that was calculated for each participant, which allows for inference about the presence of more than 1 syndemic factor for that participant.
