Thus, we screen for the use of the following substances: binge drinking (operationalized as “five or more drinks in a single period”), marijuana, powdered cocaine, rock/crack cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and other “party drugs” (e.g., ketamine/“special K”, ecstasy/“X”). Current substance misuse was coded as Yes if use was reported to occur in the past 90 days.
