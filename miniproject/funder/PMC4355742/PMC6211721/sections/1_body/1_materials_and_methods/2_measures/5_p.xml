<p>IPV was assessed using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) [
 <xref rid="pone.0206746.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (Note: the phrase “not part of BDSM/role play” was added to the sexual IPV items). Items related to minor psychological violence (e.g., “shouted at partner,” “stomped out of room”) were not included due to concerns about low specificity with respect to IPV. For this study, the CTS2 was supplemented with questions involving “threatening to out” and “actually outing” a respondent’s sexuality/sex with men behavior—herein referred to as “gay-related” IPV—and “threatening to disclose” and “actually disclosing” a respondent as HIV-positive (regardless of actual status)—herein referred to as “HIV-related” IPV—using the same answer choices as other CTS2 questions. The reliability of the CTS2 was assessed for the set of items falling within each of the CTS2 categories (i.e., psychological, physical, sexual, and injurious) using Cronbach’s α; results from this sample of predominantly HIV-positive, black MSM ranged from .72 - .81, which is comparable to those reported by the originators of the CTS2 [

In this manuscript focused on the current experience of IPV, responses were dichotomized, with any report of experiencing within the past 30 days within a category resulted in coding Yes for currently experiencing that category/type of IPV; if no responses indicated that the experience occurred ever nor within the past 30 days, the responded was coded as No for currently experiencing that category/type of IPV.
