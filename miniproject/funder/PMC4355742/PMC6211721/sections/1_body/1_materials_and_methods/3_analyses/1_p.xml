<p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 21. To test whether CSA is associated with syndemic factors, multivariate regression was used to assess test hypothesis regarding the focal independent variable of CSA with each of the measures of the following syndemic factors as a dependent variable: HIV risk indicators, substance misuse, and experience of IPV. All multivariate models controlled for age; for all outcome measures other than HIV status, covariance adjustment included HIV status (dummy coded with HIV-negative as the reference group). For HIV status as the dependent variable, multinomial logistic regression was employed using HIV-negative as the reference group. For binary dependent variables, logistic regression was employed. For ratio-level dependent variables, linear regression was employed. Inferential hypothesis testing relied on the regression parameter estimates for CSA (i.e., unstandardized coefficient 
 <italic>b</italic> for linear regression, odds ratios [ORs] for logistic regression), their associated standard errors, and corresponding 
 <italic>p</italic>-values. The criterion level used to determine significance was 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.
