<p>This study utilized data obtained during the screening portion of a randomized clinical trial testing a couple-based, behavioral preventive intervention for black MSM couples at elevated risk for HIV/STI transmission. The parent study sought to enroll a sample of black MSM in same sex relationships where one or both partners engaged in illicit use of drugs and engaged in sexual risk behavior(s). Recruitment was conducted from November 2009 to November 2015 at local service agencies, bars, clubs, and community events frequented by MSM in the New York City area; the study also recruited using the internet (e.g., study website, Facebook) and social media apps (e.g., Grindr). Potential participants screened for inclusion in the parent study were informed that the intervention consisted of an orientation session followed by 4 weekly sessions in which both partners conjointly worked with a facilitator to address threats (e.g., HIV, substance misuse) to the well-being, physical health, and sexual health of black men in same-sex relationships.</p>
