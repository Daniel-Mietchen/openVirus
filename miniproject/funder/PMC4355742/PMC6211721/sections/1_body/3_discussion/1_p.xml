<p>Results indicate that the CSA is prevalent among this large sample of Black MSM and associated with several threats to their well-being during adulthood, specifically HIV, substance misuse, and IPV; in fact, CSA was associated with experiencing multiple problems concurrently. The observed prevalence of CSA in this sample of Black MSM are consistent with concerning, elevated rates among other large studies with MSM—15–37%, some as high as 50% with higher rates using less stringent criteria [

 <xref rid="pone.0206746.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The prior multisite study with Black MSM [
 <xref rid="pone.0206746.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] used various indicators/operationalizations for CSA, leading to prevalence rates of 30–51% depending on the criterion; unfortunately, none of the operationalizations used in the prior study are directly comparable to this study. However both these studies found high rates of CSA among the Black MSM.
