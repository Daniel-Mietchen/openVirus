<p>The aforementioned limitations do not undermine a central implication from the study findings since self-report and use of legal criteria are likely to result in under-reporting and, thus, under-estimating the prevalence of CSA: there is a pressing need for the prevention and treatment of CSA and its sequelae among Black MSM [of all HIV statuses]. Such efforts would benefit in turn from greater research in several areas: (1) more comprehensive etiological and epidemiological research to gain a more nuanced understanding of CSA as associated dynamics, including factors such as nature/type, relationship to perpetrator(s), age of onset and duration, and disclosure and/or responses to disclosure; (2) intervention research to tailor existing or develop new evidence-based programs that can effectively address the consequences of experiencing CSA, taking into account the unique needs and context of Black MSM; and (3) services research that can better ensure that such programs are not only available to Black MSM, but also increasing the likelihood that they would be willing and able to use such services at all points in the HIV care continuum, from HIV testing for Black MSM who are unaware of their HIV status or HIV-negative, to access and retention in HIV treatment for Black MSM living with HIV.</p>
