<p>The prior study found marginal support for the link between CSA and HIV risk indicators among Black MSM in unadjusted and adjusted statistical models (only having &gt;3 male sexual partners in the past 6 months was significantly associated with CSA; most results did not reject the null hypothesis and one for one outcome—having any receptive CAI in the past 6 months—CSA was associated with lower risk). This study found strong support for CSA with increased risk, perhaps lending support for the value and need to include individuals of all HIV statuses (negative, unknown, positive) in assessing CSA and the syndemic among Black MSM. Results from this study lend strong support for CSA being associated with subsequent health, behavioral, and social concerns that are core components of a public health syndemic among MSM, specifically HIV infection, HIV sexual risk behavior(s), substance misuse, and IPV. In fact, results are consistent with CSA being a driving factor for the co-occurrence of HIV sexual risk behaviors, substance misuse, and IPV; i.e., CSA may be a driving factor in the formation and/or presence of a syndemic of among Black MSM.</p>
