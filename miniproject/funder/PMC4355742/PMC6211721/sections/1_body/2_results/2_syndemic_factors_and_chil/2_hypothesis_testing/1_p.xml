 <xref rid="pone.0206746.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the findings from multivariate models examining the association between CSA and each of the syndemic factor measures. CSA was significantly associated with greater likelihood of being HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative after controlling for age; while not knowing one’s HIV status (vs. HIV-negative) was suggestive (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 2.0, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.0–1.1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .10), we could not rule out the null hypothesis based on an a priori criterion level of α &lt; .05. CSA was significantly associated with greater risks for all of the other syndemic factors assessed (binge drinking, number of male partners, number of acts of CAI, illicit use of substances, and IPV).
