<p>If illicit substance use was examined by individual substance, CSA was significantly associated with increase odds of current use of marijuana (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 1.5, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.1–2.1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .006) and cocaine (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 1.5, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.1–2.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .01). If IPV was restricted to CTS2 items, CSA was [still] significantly associated with experiencing IPV (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 1.6, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.1–2.2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .007). Separating by type of IPV, CSA was significantly associated with increased odds of currently experiencing physical IPV (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 2.0, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.3–3.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .002), sexual IPV (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 2.5, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.5–4.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .001), injurious IPV (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 3.0, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.6–5.6, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), gay-related IPV (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 2.9, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.6–5.2, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and HIV-related IPV (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 4.0, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.5–10.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .005). Sensitivity analyses included not rectifying potential outliers for number of male sexual partners and number of acts of CAI in the past 90 days; point estimates were unchanged generally beyond the significant figure precision and patterns of significance remained. Thus, conclusions from statistical inferential testing remain unchanged.
