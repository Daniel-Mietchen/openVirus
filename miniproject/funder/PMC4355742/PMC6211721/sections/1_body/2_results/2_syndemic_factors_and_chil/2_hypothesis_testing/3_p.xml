<p>For analyses related to the number of syndemic factors experienced by a participant, CSA was significantly associated with the presence of 2 or more syndemic factors for a participant while controlling for age and HIV status (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 2.0, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.4–2.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); being HIV-positive or having an unknown HIV status were also significantly associated with the presence of 2 or more syndemic factors (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 1.5, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.1–2.1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .02; and 
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 3.7, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.9–12.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .04 respectively). In fact, participants who met criteria for experiencing CSA were significantly more likely to experience all three syndemic factors—i.e., engagement in HIV risk behaviors, substance misuse, and currently experiencing IPV—while controlling for age and HIV status (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 1.6, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 1.2–2.3, 
 <italic>p =</italic> .006); not knowing one’s HIV status was also significantly associated with the presence of all 3 syndemic factors (
 <italic>AOR</italic> = 4.5, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 2.0–9.9, 
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001). These results are consistent with CSA being an underlying factor that increases the presence of a syndemic of HIV risk behavior, substance misuse, and IPV among Black MSM and supports having a non-negative HIV status is associated with the presence of the syndemic.
