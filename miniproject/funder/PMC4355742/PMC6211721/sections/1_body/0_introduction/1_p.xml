<p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) have a disproportionate burden of the HIV/AIDS epidemic since its onset in the U.S. [

 <xref rid="pone.0206746.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]: while Hispanic and White MSM have elevated lifetime risk of HIV diagnoses compared to other populations (1 in 4 and 1 in 11 respectively), Black MSM have a 1 in 2 lifetime risk of becoming infected by HIV. Based on current incidence rates, one model predicted that more than 60% of Black MSM in the U.S. would be infected with HIV by age 40 [
