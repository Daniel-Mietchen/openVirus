<p>Chikungunya fever is an infectious disease caused by the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arbovirus of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family with a widespread and expanding global distribution. First identified in Tanzania in 1952, CHIKV is principally transmitted, in urban transmission cycles, by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes that mainly inhabit tropical and subtropical regions[

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CHIKV has a 11.8kb positive sense RNA genome that encodes four non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) and three main structural proteins (capsid and the spike forming envelope glycoproteins [E1&amp;2])[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Though rarely fatal, CHIKV has a high attack rate and infection can lead to high fever, headache, rash and characteristic severe debilitating arthralgia which can persist. To date, no specific prophylactic or therapeutic interventions exist.
