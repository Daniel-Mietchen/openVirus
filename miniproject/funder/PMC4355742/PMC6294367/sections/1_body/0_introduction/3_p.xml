<p>The first autochthonous CHIKV case in Mexico was reported in October 2014 in the southern border state of Chiapas[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By November, cases had been confirmed in nine states and the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS, “Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social”), which provides health care to ~60% of the population[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], implemented a confirmatory diagnosis algorithm for CHIKV following guidelines set by the National Institute of Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE, “Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos”). Here we analyse the cumulative confirmed cases reported within the IMSS by state from December 2014 to December 2015. We also characterized temporally and geographically representative E1 gene sequences and present an up-to-date phylogenetic analysis of CHIKV lineages, with a focus on the Asian lineage epidemic in the Americas and the Caribbean. Finally, we explore the differing degrees of E1 protein diversity in the viral quasispecies within patients and identify hotspots of intra-patient mutation.
