<p>The maximum liklihood (ML) phylogeny of the final dataset was made in PhyML using a starting tree generated in MEGA version 7.0.14[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) with an O’nyong‘yong virus E1 sequence (strain IBH10964) inlcluded as an outgroup. Both starting tree and the PhyML analysis were done using the GTR+G evolutionary model described above and branch support in PhyML was estimated by the aLRT-SH procedure. For Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) phylogenies, CHIKV lineages were analysed seperately in BEAST version 1.8.3[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Strains with missing sampling day were assigned the 15
 <sup>th</sup> day of the month; missing sampling months and days were assigned as July 2
 <sup>nd</sup>. The temporal signal of the alignments was evaulated in TempEst v1.5[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] using ML trees generated in MEGA version 7.0.14 using the methods described above. BEAST analysis was done under the GTR+G nucleotide substitution model or under the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano nucleotide substitution model with gamma distributed rate variation among sites (HKY+G), a lognormal relaxed clock and a Bayesian Skygrid coalescent model. Effective sample size scores of traces were evaluated in Tracer v1.6. Due to low ESS values under GTR+G (likely because of overparameterisation of the model) all subsequent analyses were done using the HKY+G substitution model. LogCombiner v1.8.3 was used to combine runs of fifty million MCMC states until convergence was reached and a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was determined in TreeAnnotator v1.8.3 from the sampling posterior after discarding 10% of states as burn-in. Nodes with posterior probabilities &gt;0.9 were considered significant and evolutionary rates were considered significantly different if the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals did not overlap. MCC trees were edited in FigTree v1.4.2.
