<p>For each nucleotide cluster, the representative sequence was translated using the program Transeq from the EMBOSS suite[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The translated representative sequences were also clustered at 100% of amino acid identity using CD-HIT (using -C 1 option). The sequence clusters represented an amino acid haplotype. Using the number of sequences in each nucleotide cluster that was previously recorded, the abundance for each amino acid cluster was calculated and normalized using the sequencing yield from the patient with the lowest yield as the normalization factor. A matrix with the normalized abundance of each haplotype and patient names was generated and visualized using the program Cluster v3.0 and Java TreeView v1.1.6r4, respectively. To calculate individual amino acid mutation frequencies, the number of reads forming all amino acid clusters containing a particular mutation was divided by the total number of reads forming all amino acid clusters in the patient.
