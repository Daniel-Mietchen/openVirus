<p>CHIKV diagnosis was done according to guidelines issued by the InDRE[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO)[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Viral RNA was extracted from 200μL of patient serum using the QiAmp Viral RNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Forward and reverse primers (CHIKV 6856 and CHIKV 6981, respectively) and a Carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labelled probe (CHIKV 6919-FAM) were used as described by Lanciotti

 </bold>. The presence of CHIKV RNA was evaluated using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a 25μL reaction using 12.5μL of 2x reverse transcription master mix, 0.25μL of QuantiTect RT mix, 0.25μL of each primer (1μM final concentration), probe 0.15μL (0.15μM final concentration), 6.6μL of water and 5μL de RNA. Using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA), reverse transcription was carried out at 50°C for 30 mins followed by 95°C for 15 minutes and 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 56°C for 1 minute. As stated by the InDRE guidelines[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], Ct values ≤ 38 in duplicate wells were considered positive.
