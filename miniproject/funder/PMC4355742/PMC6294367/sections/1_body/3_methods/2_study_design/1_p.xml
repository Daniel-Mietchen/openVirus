<p>From December 2014 to December 2015, serum samples from all suspect CHIKV cases detected through passive surveillance in 35 IMSS medical centres nationwide (located in 32 Mexican states) were submitted for CHIKV confirmatory diagnosis to the Central Laboratory for Epidemiology (LCE, “Laboratorio Central de Epidemiologia”), IMSS in Mexico City. In accordance with national guidelines, suspect case definition included febrile illness with poly-arthralgia or acute arthritis, plus living in or travelled to, within two weeks of fever onset, an area endemic for

To investigate if CHIKV was present in Mexico prior to October 2014, patients sampled between January and November 2014 principally from Chiapas and surrounding states (Campeche, Oaxaca, Tabasco and Veracruz) who met suspect case definition for dengue virus (DENV) infection (a patient with a non-specified fever who lives or who recently travelled to a region with reported dengue transmission)[

Molecular epidemiological studies of CHIKV infection were carried out on 25 patient specimens. To have a broad overview of viral diversity in areas of high transmission, specimens were included that were sampled in Southern Mexico (the region with most confirmed CHIKV cases during the sampling period of the study) and that were sampled at time points spanning December 2014 and August 2015. In addition, inclusion criteria included sample availability for sequencing and Ct values following RT-PCR diagnosis ≤ 32.
