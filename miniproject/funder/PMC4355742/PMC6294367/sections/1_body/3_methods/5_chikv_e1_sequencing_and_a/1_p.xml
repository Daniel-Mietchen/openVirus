Both amplicons obtained for each patient were sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) with a 600 cycles V3 kit with a paired-end sequencing configuration to obtain 300bp paired end overlapping reads, following the manufacturer’s instructions. For each patient, the paired end reads for each amplicon (COF1 and CIF2 amplicons) were overlapped using FLASH v1.2.7[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with default parameters and non-overlapping sequences were discarded. After reconstructing COF1 and CIF2 amplicons, identical nucleotide fragments were clustered, using CD-HIT v4.6.1[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] with -C 1. The output from the clustering process (.clust file) was transformed to a tab-separated list using the clstr2txt.pl script included in the CD-HIT suite and clusters with at least 50 amplicons, were considered. From each nucleotide cluster, the number of identical sequence amplicons forming the cluster was recorded. The COF1 and CIF2 amplicon sequences with the highest yield were also overlapped (74bp overlap) and aligned to the genome of the African prototype S27 CHIKV strain (accession number AF369024). Following a minimal sequence editing, the consensus sequence for the partial open reading frame for CHIKV E1 gene was identified (1,044bp, genome positions 10,264–11,308). All raw sequencing data was submitted to NCBI Bioproject ID PRJNA495608.
