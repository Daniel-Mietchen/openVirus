<p>Our evolutionary rate estimates amongst Asian datasets (

  <xref rid="pone.0209292.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)
 </bold> were similar to what was reported for E1 by Sahadeo 
 <italic>et al</italic>[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (6.0 E-4 [95% HPD: 4.0â€“8.0 E-4] nucleotide substitution/site/year) and higher than what has been reported for whole genomes[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In accordance with Chen 
 <italic>et al</italic>[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the evolutionary rate of the IOL lineage was over twice that of the ECSA and other lineages -with non-overlapping 95% HPD values- though our estimates were an order of magnitude higher than this report, which was based on the whole genome. The convergent evolution of the adaptive E1:A226V mutation in different IOL clusters[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] likely contributed to the increased the rate of evolution in E1. More generally, the high evolutionary rate estimates of the IOL lineage may result from frequent sampling during the epidemic and inclusion of variants not purged by purifying selection[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], though this effect seems to be less marked in the American and Caribbean sublineage in our study but not others[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
