<p>Of note, the number of non-synonymous intra-host variants observed within the E1 coding sequence was higher than those reported previously in studies assessing the whole CHIKV genome[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The reasons for this discrepancy may be due to the sequencing depth obtained from analysing E1 sequences alone. We suggest that the inclusion of processing artefacts in our analysis (e.g. PCR-generated mutations) is unlikely. For instance, the presence of the same variant in numerous patients and the non-random distribution of variants in discrete mutational hotspots suggest natural variation. Furthermore, we only report minority variants with frequencies &gt;0.1% that represent reads with ≥50 identical nucleotide sequences after clustering at nucleotide level. Individually, most variants occurred at frequencies &lt;10%, suggesting reduced fitness in comparison to the consensus sequence. Interestingly, similar frequencies of minority variants were observed across patients, suggesting a possible evolutionary advantage to their maintenance in the viral swarm[

We also observed a low frequency (0.2%) stop codon mutation (Y214X) in two patients, which may indicate the maintenance of partial or defective genomes[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], with possible fitness effects. Stop codon mutations leading to deletions have similarly been reported in the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus 6K protein [

 <italic>Cis</italic> elements that alter template structure and reverse transcriptase fidelity in specific regions of envelope proteins have been demonstrated for HIV[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Alternatively, these sites may be under low selective constraints and be influenced by neutral or positive selection, possibly through immune-selection pressure. To our knowledge, no neutralizing antibodies elicited against CHIKV have been shown to target residues between E1 189–220 and 349–358[
