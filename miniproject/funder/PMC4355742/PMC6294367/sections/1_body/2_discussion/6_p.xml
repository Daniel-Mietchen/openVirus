<p>The massive parallel sequencing of samples also enabled us to analyse viral diversity in each patient. To assess the entire haplotype of each E1 amplicon (i.e. mutations present in 
 <italic>cis</italic>) we only included overlapping paired end reads that reconstructed the amplicons and had a sequencing depth of at least 50 overlapping reads. We used this approach to reduce the inclusion of sequencing errors or artefacts, allowing us to explore a real representation of the diversity for each patient. Strikingly, a marked heterogeneity in the level of haplotype diversity at the amino acid level was seen in each patient, with levels consistent over both COF and CIF amplicons. The diversity of viral quasispecies is a critical component of viral fitness[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as demonstrated by reduced fitness and pathogenicity of CHIKV replication fidelity variants[

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Whether intrahost diversity relates to the clinical outcome of CHIKV and other arboviruses, such as dengue[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], is a key question. Although our study did not focus on clinical outcomes, most of the primary symptoms reported by patients analysed by sequencing (fever, arthralgia, myalgia and / or headache) were similar to those observed by authors in Mexico and the Island of Reunion [

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], though we observed a greater proportion of arthritis and less haemorrhagic cases

 </bold>. In addition, a similar proportion of patients showed high levels of haplotype diversity as those reported to have persistent clinical symptoms in the Americas (~ 50%)[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, in accordance with the variation in clinical outcomes in acute and persistent stages of infection, we agree with the conclusions of previous reports[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] that the association between interpatient viral diversity and clinic outcome warrants further detailed studies.
