<p>Local CHIKV transmission was first detected in Mexico in October 2014 amid reports of cases in Guatemala and the United States[

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], our analysis supports the introduction of CHIKV shortly before the first autochthonous diagnosed cases, as we found no evidence of CHIKV infection in 500 febrile DENV-negative patients sampled from across the country between January and October 2014. In addition, the tMRCA for the observed Mexican cluster was estimated for November 2014 (September 2014- January 2015 95% HPD). By contrast, ZIKV was reported to be present in Mexican patients 3â€“10 months prior to the first reports of imported cases[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and to have circulated in Brazil up to 12 months prior to its detection[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We suggest that knowledge of ongoing CHIKV transmission in the region and the high rate of symptomatic infections contributed to the early detection of the first cases in Mexico. Active surveillance of emergent arboviral threats, particularly of those with high numbers of asymptomatic cases, is therefore critical for early containment efforts.
