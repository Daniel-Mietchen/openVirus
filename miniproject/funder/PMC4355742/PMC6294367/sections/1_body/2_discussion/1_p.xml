<p>We sought to gain insights into CHIKV evolution by analysing the emergent epidemic in Mexico, where over 11,000 confirmed cases were reported in 2015, the highest number in any country that year [

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], CHIKV spread rapidly to tropical regions nationwide. The endemicity of the primary vector

 <italic>aegytpi</italic> and an immunologically naïve population were central facilitators of the epidemic; however specific factors leading to the focalisation of cases in the South of the country, particularly along the Pacific Ocean, merit attention. Of note, viruses from this region harboured non-synonymous mutations and formed an emergent cluster, suggesting localised evolution of CHIKV in Mexico. Interestingly, the number of Zika virus (ZIKV) cases during the 2016 epidemic in Mexico was also highest in the Southern states of Guerrero, Veracruz and Yucatán[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Striking similarities in transmission dynamics following CHIKV and ZIKV epidemics in the Americas have been observed[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; our data suggest that these similarities are also apparent within Mexico and this may have implications for future arboviral threats as such as Yellow Fever, Mayaro and Oropuche viruses.
