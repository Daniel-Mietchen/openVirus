<p>As expected for an arbovirus where evolution is constrained due to replication in dual hosts[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], variation in the consensus sequences of the E1 gene from 25 patients was limited. We found an undescribed T207M mutation in a single individual that maps to domain II and lies adjacent to an arginine residue involved in E1-E1 inter-spike contacts[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The replacement of a polar amino acid with a hydrophobic residue indicates possible structural changes that should be characterised functionally. We also observed a V291I mutation that was seen in five patients in an outbreak of the IOL lineage in Kerala, India between 2009 and 2013[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and in one patient from Nicaragua sampled in December 2014[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. V291I maps to domain I and the outer surface of a E1 trimer were it has been suggested to have a limited role in modulating infectivity[
