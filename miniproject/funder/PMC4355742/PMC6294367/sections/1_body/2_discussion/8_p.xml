<p>To conclude, we report localised CHIKV transmission and evolution in South West Mexico that gave rise to an emergent Mexican cluster which evolved shortly after the introduction of the Asian lineage of CHIKV into the country. Crucially, the characterisation of the intra-host mutant swarms indicates high levels of E1 protein diversity centred in two previously undescribed mutational hotspots in domains II and III which is common to numerous patients. Whether this variation has a role in determining viral fitness during infection should be further explored mechanistically.</p>
