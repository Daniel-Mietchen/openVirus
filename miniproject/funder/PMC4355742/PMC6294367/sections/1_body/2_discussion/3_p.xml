<p>To assess the evolutionary dynamics of major CHIKV lineages in Mexico and worldwide, we analysed E1 gene sequences. A comparison of phylogenetic trees inferred through ML analyses using whole CHIKV genomes and E1 gene sequences, indicated that the former do not adequately resolve the ECSA lineage[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the use of a starting tree in our ML analysis enabled us to resolve all major lineages, including the ECSA lineage. In addition, separate alignments of major lineages indicated robust phylogenetic signals for the datasets analysed. Importantly, our approach captured diversity from Asian lineage viruses lacking whole genome sequences. Our tMRCA estimates for the Asian, IOL and WAf lineages were similar to studies analysing the whole CHIKV genome[

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, our estimates for the ECSA lineage were 10 to 35 years more recent, reflecting the complex phylogenetic structure of these sequences and the limitations of analyses focused on E1 gene sequences for this lineage[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In accordance with a detailed phylogeographic study[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we estimated, albeit with wider 95% HPD values, that the American and Caribbean sublineage evolved around March 2013 from closely related South Pacific strains. How CHIKV and ZIKV were initially introduced into the Caribbean and Atlantic coast of America, respectively, from Oceania or South-East Asia without apparent prior transmission to the Western coast of the Americas remains unclear. Identifying the ongoing transmission routes of American lineage CHIKV to Pacific Islands, such as French Polynesia, may provide clues, particularly as these cases appear to be forming epidemiologically linked clusters. By contrast, likely imported cases to Italy and Thailand, seem unrelated to recently reported outbreaks[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our result also suggest the presence of emerging clusters in Mexico and Nicaragua and epidemiologically-related transmission between Nicaragua and Honduras which, with other emerging clusters in the region, warrant surveillance, in particular when assessing sylvatic transmission emergence in the Americas[
