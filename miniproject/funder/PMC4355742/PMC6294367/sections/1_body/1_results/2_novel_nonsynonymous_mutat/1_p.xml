<p>To characterise the CHIKV strains circulating in Mexico during the epidemic, we determined the consensus sequence of the E1 glycoprotein-encoding gene from 25 CHIKV-infected patients (

 </bold>) from five Mexican states (five from each state) in the Central/southern region which had most confirmed CHIKV cases by August 2015. Two partial amplicons from the E1 gene were generated (COF1 and CIF2) and deep sequenced. The most abundant sequences from each were overlapped and used to reconstruct a 1044bp region from the E1 gene (E1:270â€“1314).
