<p>The use of next generation sequencing allowed us to analyse intra-patient variability in the reconstructed E1 gene amplicons (COF1 and CIF2; sequencing yields shown in

 </bold>). After clustering the nucleotide sequences with a minimum 50 amplicons, we clustered the translated products for each nucleotide cluster with 100% identity, obtaining 67 amino acid sequence haplotypes for COF1 and 18 amino acid sequence haplotypes for CIF2. The relative abundance of each haplotype is shown in

 </bold>. A wide degree of heterogeneity in the intra-patient diversity of viral haplotypes was seen, and the number of variants present in COF1 and CIF2 correlated significantly amongst patients (

 </bold>). Variant number ranged from the presence of a single variant (COF1_1 in patient Veracruz_4, CIF2_1 in eight patients and CIF2_13 in Guerrero_15;) to 56 COF1 and 17 CIF2 variants within a single patient (Oaxaca_25) with diverse degrees of abundance (

 </bold>). In COF1, six haplotypes (COF1_1–6) were highly abundant in most patients, whereas in CIF2, patients either had nine or more variant haplotypes (N = 12) or 1–4 variants (N = 13).
