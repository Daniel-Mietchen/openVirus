<p>Studies using whole genomes have additionally identified two major recent monophyletic epidemic clades[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our phylogeny did not resolve the monophyly of clade I (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209292.g003">Fig 3A</xref>
 </bold>). However, clade II was estimated to have originated late in 2010 (09/2010 [95% HPD: 06/2009-10/2011]) in South East Asia where it spread to Pacific Island nations such as Micronesia, Tonga and American Samoa. These sequences are the most closely related to the epidemic sublineage in the Caribbean and Americas, which arose at the start of 2013 (03/2013 [95% HPD: 09/2012-07/2013];

 </bold>). Within this sublineage, a well-supported (posterior probability [PP] &gt; 0.9) Mexican cluster (all five specimens form the state of Guerrero and one from Colima [Colima_23]) and two Nicaraguan (accession numbers: KT192722, KT192727, KT192735 and KT192740; and KT192718, KT192724, KT192732, KT192733, KT192736) clusters were found, emerging in late 2014 (11/2014 [95% HPD: 09/2014-01/2015], 11/2014 [95% HPD: 09/2014-11/2014] and 09/2014 [95% HPD: 08/2014-11/2014], respectively;

 </bold>). Sequences forming dyad clusters were also detected from Mexico (Guerrero_9 and Guerrero_15), Nicaragua/Honduras (KT192731 and KR559488) Colombia/Unknown origin (KR559491 and KR559497) and French Polynesia (KM985619 and KR559473). Interestingly, the former dyad (PP = 0.75) and a third sequence from French Polynesia (KJ939333) suggests possible local transmission of the American and Caribbean sublineage in the Pacific islands. By contrast, the two sequences from Italy (KP252141 and KP252142) and one from Thailand (KT192719), are likely indicative of traveller-associated infection.
