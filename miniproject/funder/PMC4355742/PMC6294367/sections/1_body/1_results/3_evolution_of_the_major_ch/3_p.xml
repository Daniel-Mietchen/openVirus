<p>The evolutionary rate of the entire Asian lineage was similar to the rate of the Asian old dataset (6.71E-4 [95% HPD: 4.92E-4, 8.51E-4] vs 6.52E-4 [95% HPD: 3.01E-4, 9.91E-4] nucleotide substitutions/site/year), indicating that the recent epidemics strains evolve at a similar rate to older Asian lineage strains (

 </bold>). The highest evolutionary rate estimate was for the IOL lineage (15.44E-4 [95% HPD: 11.17E-4, 20.28E-4] substitutions/site/year) which was over two-fold higher than the non-IOL ECSA lineage (6.04E-4 [95% HPD: 3.17E-4, 9.40E-4] substitutions/site/year). The lowest mean evolutionary rate estimate was observed for the WAf lineage (4.93E-4 [95% HPD 1.93E-4, 9.38E-4] substitutions/site/year).
