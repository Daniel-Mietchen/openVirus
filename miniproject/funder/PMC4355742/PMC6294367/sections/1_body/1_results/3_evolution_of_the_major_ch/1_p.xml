<p>To assess the evolutionary relationship between the 25 Mexican strains and CHIKV strains sampled globally, and to provide an updated evaluation of evolution within the Asian lineage using all available E1 sequences, we aligned our sequences with 395 CHIKV strains. Our initial maximum likelihood analysis did not resolve the ECSA lineage as being monophyletic, as has been shown in analyses using whole genomes [
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the use of a starting tree resulted in a maximum likelihood phylogeny that resolved the three major CHIKV lineages (Asian, ECSA and WAf) with good branch support for all lineages including the IOL and American and Caribbean epidemic sublineage (
