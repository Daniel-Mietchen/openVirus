  <p>(A)Linear diagram of CHIKV E1 protein (adapted from Voss et al[
   <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] indicating protein domains, amino acid positions (top) and the positions of amino acid mutations (vertical bars) including two mutational hotspots (1 &amp; 2) with the following mutations in order of location: 1 = Y189D, P191T/A/H/R/S, F192V/C/L/S/Y/I, G193D, A194E/G, A195R, R196S/G, P197Q/T, G198V, Q199H/K, F200V/I/C/L, D202E, I203S/T, Q204L/H/P, S205R/G, T207M, E209A, S210R, Y214X, Q218P/H, L219R, V220G; and 2 = N349K, S350A, L352W, Q353K/P, I354S/L/T, S355A/P, F356C/L/S, T358P). Red bars indicate mutations with frequencies &gt;0.01 and that were present in &gt;50% of patients or mutations present in the consensus sequence of a single patient. FL, fusion loop. (B) Structural model of native CHIKV E1 protein indicating the locations of intrapatient point mutations (red).
