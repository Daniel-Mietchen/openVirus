  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Importation risk by year. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Importation risk by month. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Introduced transmission risk by year. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Introduced transmission risk by month. The probabilistic risk presented here is the likelihood of occurrence of at least one DENV infection at provincial level. Nine countries (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam) in SEA with available data of monthly DENV incidence were included here.
