<p>Given the global expanding distribution of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], dengue has established itself throughout the world’s tropical and subtropical regions in both endemic and epidemic transmission cycles, causing significant morbidity and mortality, particularly highly endemic in South-East Asia (SEA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, dengue remains a seasonal disease in China, with epidemics occasionally triggered by imported dengue viruses (DENV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. More than 90% of imported cases between 2005 and 2014 originated from SEA [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Following China’s economic boom in the last two decades, the number of Chinese citizens travelling abroad has increased from 5 million in 1996 to 128 million in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recent government led initiatives to further foster international trade may contribute to increased flows between SEA and China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which could also increase the number of importations of pathogens including DENV.
