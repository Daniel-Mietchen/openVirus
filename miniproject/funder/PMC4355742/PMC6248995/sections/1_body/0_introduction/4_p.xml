<p>While the risk of dengue in China is apparent and growing [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the seasonal pattern and changing risk of importation and subsequent transmission are unclear, a challenge amplified by a dearth of models for assessing seasonal risk for pathogen spread globally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As international travel between SEA and China by airplane is fast and common, based on the assumption that human mobility via commercial air travel is an important conduit for the spread of infectious diseases internationally, we constructed a branching process model by focusing on the seasonal and multiannual movement of DENV from the endemic countries in SEA into China via air travelers of Chinese and SEA residents between 2005 and 2015. We then retrospectively quantified and validated the seasonal risks, ranging from zero to certain (1), of DENV importation from nine SEA countries and leading to autochthonous transmission (introduced transmission) in China, identified geographic and seasonal patterns of emerging origin-destination routes, and estimated the number of imported infections in Chinese travelers and SEA residents into China. With rising concerns about global pathogen dispersal, this study provides approaches and evidence that can inform efforts to mitigate the spread of DENV and other arboviral pathogens including Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses from endemic regions.
