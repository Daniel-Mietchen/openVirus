<p>Some relevant factors for assessing the risk of disease importation from endemic regions into a country are: 1) the risk of a person acquiring the disease in the origin country; 2) the risk of a person traveling to the destination country of interest while infectious; and 3) the likelihood of subsequent local transmission in the destination country [
