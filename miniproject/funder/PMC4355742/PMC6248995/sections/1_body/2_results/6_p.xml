<p>The probability of DENV introduced local transmission from nine SEA countries into China also rose, with a median risk increasing from 0.10 (IQR 0.01–0.30) in August 2005 to 0.56 (IQR 0.21–0.91) in August 2015 at provincial level (

Compared to cities with intensive importation in cold regions of northern China, e.g. Beijing and Shenyang, the introduced risks in the lower latitude cities, e.g. Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou, were much higher and extended over longer time periods (

The countrywide change in the probability of introduced transmission between 2005 and 2015 led to a much larger population being at risk: Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xiamen with 32 million people were the only three cities with a risk greater than 0.5 in August 2005, while there are 102 million people in 10 cities (Guangzhou, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Haikou, Nanning, Wuhan, Changsha and Chongqing) with the same risk in August 2015 (Fig R in
