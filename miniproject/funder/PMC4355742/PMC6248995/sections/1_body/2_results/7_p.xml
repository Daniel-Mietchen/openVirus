<p>The dynamics of dengue in SEA, the volume, demography and immunity level of airline travelers, and the environmental suitability of DENV local transmission in China have been changing the high-risk routes for importation and introduced transmission (Figs S and T in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006743.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). For instance, the Maldives-Guangzhou, Philippines-Fuzhou and Malaysia-Hangzhou routes have had increasing risks since 2005, and cities in central China and middle coastal regions, e.g. Hangzhou, Chengdu and Wuhan, are emerging as destinations with an increasing risk of introduced transmission. Additionally, compared to the monthly occurrence of cases reported at the provincial level in China, the ROC curves showed our model performed robustly with an AUC of 0.86 for importation risk estimates and 0.92 for introduced transmission estimates (Fig U in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006743.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Moreover, the importation risk estimates for SEA residents had a slight better performance than for Chinese travelers (AUC 0.91 vs 0.86).
