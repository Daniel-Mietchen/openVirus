 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006743.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the volume of travelers from SEA and the number of corresponding imported dengue cases into China have positive correlations by year and by origin (
 <italic>Spearman</italic>â€™s rank correlation, both p&lt;0.001). Seasonal patterns of dengue transmission in nine countries were also seen with annual amplitude positively correlated to the latitude of each country. Furthermore, there was a significant synchrony between dengue incidence in SEA and importation to China, and the seasonal epidemics in China were also highly coherent with dengue transmission in SEA and importation into China (
