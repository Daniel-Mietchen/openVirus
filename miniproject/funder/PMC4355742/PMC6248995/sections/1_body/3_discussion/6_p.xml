<p>Nonetheless, the models and findings presented here leverage previous work suggesting that a probabilistic model of pathogen spread over a heterogeneous network by multiple populations could capture most of the information in much complex stochastic simulation models [

Moreover, our retrospective validation showed that the predicted seasonal risk of DENV into China coincided with a surge in the number of imported cases and volume of airline travelers arriving into China from SEA countries with reported dengue virus activity. Our model framework is sufficiently flexible to incorporate new forms of data and adapt to different vector-borne diseases. Moreover, it may be used to project into the future given different scenarios and to quantify the effects of different control methods. It also highlights the need for high-quality, accessible travel and surveillance data at national, regional, and global levels. As shown here, travel dynamics have a direct and drastic impact on regional and global infectious disease dynamics and having accessible data to assess those risks in real time can support appropriate risk assessment and prevention, and control activities.
