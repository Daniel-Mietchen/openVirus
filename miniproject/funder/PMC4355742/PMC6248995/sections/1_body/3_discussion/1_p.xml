<p>Being able to identify areas at risk for introduction and spread of pathogens in a timely manner is critical for situational awareness and for tailoring strategies for preparedness and response, e.g. allocation of finite health and human resources [

In this study, we constructed a branching process modelling framework to elucidate seasonal probability of international spread of mosquito-borne viral disease from endemic countries in SEA via air travel. We have identified the emerging origins in SEA and locations in China that are most susceptible to dengue importation and onward transmission, and we also revealed the seasonal patterns and increasing risks in routes of DENV spread by air travel over a decade. The spatiotemporal heterogeneities of DENV importation risk have also been seen in the travelers of Chinese and SEA residents. The risk of introduced transmission from particular routes identified can be used to inform efforts to prevent and control the spread of DENV, and are particularly important for currently neglected, high-risk locations, i.e. Chengdu, Wuhan and Hangzhou. Moreover, with the increasing risk of dengue importation and transmission from SEA, China can also be the source of exportation, and this was amply shown in the introduction of dengue from Guangzhou into Japan resulting in a small outbreak in Tokyo [
