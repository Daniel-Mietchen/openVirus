<p>The megacities in China, e.g. Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, each regional aviation hubs, have consistently received large volumes of international air passengers, leading to high risks of dengue importation from SEA. However, the rapid growth of travel abroad for tourism, business and migrant workers from cities in central and southwest China is also sufficient to cause substantial risk of importation. A similar pattern has been described for malaria importation from Africa and SEA into these areas [

The increase in imported DENV from SEA has also increased subsequent transmission risk in China, with Guangdong, Yunnan and Fujian provinces frequently reporting outbreaks following dengue importation throughout the last decade. Meanwhile, other provinces (e.g. Henan, Shandong and Shanghai) have reported autochthonous cases of dengue for the first time [

The variation in DENV serotypes introduced from different origins over time is especially relevant considering the potential for adverse effects from dengue haemorrhagic fever after infection with a different serotype of DENV [
