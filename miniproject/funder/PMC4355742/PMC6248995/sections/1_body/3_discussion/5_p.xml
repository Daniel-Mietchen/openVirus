 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], e.g. the incidence of the disease in the country of disembarkation, the probability of being infected/viremic at the time of travel and arrival in the destination country, the duration of viremia, the presence of favorable conditions (vectors and seasonality) in the destination. Therefore, our findings must be considered in the context of several assumptions and data limitations. First, the quality of incidence data on dengue incidence in SEA and China likely varies due to differences in surveillance systems including case definitions, reporting methods, availability of healthcare and laboratory diagnosis, under reporting, and the completeness and accuracy of data reported. Second, the risk of dengue infection in SEA was assumed to be identical across each country, without considering the immunity of different serotypes in Chinese travelers and SEA residents. Third, we only estimated the risk of the Chinese and SEA residents, but the actual nationalities in travelers might be much complex, not only the Chinese and SEA residents, but also the residents from other countries passing through SEA on their way to China. Fourth, we regarded

 <italic>albopictus</italic> as an equally competent vector to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> for DENV, with similar temperature dependency and extrinsic incubation period. Fifth, our estimates did not address variability in the public health and health-care capacity and resources for different years and locations in China and SEA countries in response to dengue. Furthermore, due to the availability of monthly disease incidence in SEA countries and the absence of monthly travel data by land and water from SEA into China and within China, we only estimate the seasonal risk of introduction through air travel for nine SEA countries. Therefore, the total risk of dengue introductions from all SEA countries into China must be underestimated in this study. To solve these problems in future studies, the monthly dengue incidence for all countries could be estimated by mathematical models based on epidemiological and entomological parameters and climate data, and the seasonal and multiannual cross-border population movements could be further estimated by gravity-type spatial interaction models or using novel sources of data, e.g. mobile phone data or social media data [
