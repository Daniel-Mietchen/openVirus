<p>The number of imported cases reported in surveillance systems could be predicted by the estimated time series with one-month lag, which might be due to the longer period of travel, and the delay identification and reporting of imported infections by the routine surveillance. The gaps between the estimates and reported numbers found in this study also highlight the needs to improve the capacity of surveillance systems and formulate strategies to mitigate these imported contagions, and public health authorities and partners in areas with huge volume of imported infections and high risk of autochthonous transmission should consider implementing appropriate actions at an early stage of potential seasonal transmission. These could include health education in Chinese travelers and early identifying the infections in entry points, and improve the capacity of surveillance, vector control, laboratory diagnosis, and clinical management.</p>
