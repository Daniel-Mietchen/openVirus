<p>The annual numbers of DENV cases were available for 17 SEA countries, but monthly data were available for nine countries (Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam) to estimate the risk of dengue importation into China (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006743.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). To account for the substantial underreporting of dengue infections in official statistics, the monthly dengue data was further adjusted by an expansion factor (EF) and the proportion of asymptomatic infections (Table B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006743.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). The EF has been commonly used to estimate the total number of dengue incidence from officially statistics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006743.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the country-specific EF and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) were estimated as the total number of dengue episodes in a specified population divided by the episodes reported, with the necessary data obtained from systematic literature review or extrapolated for countries where no empirical studies were available. We also assumed that the apparent illness represents approximately 20% (SD 10%) of all dengue infections [
