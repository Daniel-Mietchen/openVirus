<p>The limitations of this study include ascertainment of cases through enhanced passive surveillance. Thus, some dengue cases may not have been detected due to participants not seeking healthcare. Another limitation is that serum samples for cohort-wide serological testing are only available for participants once per year so it will be better to have more seroprevalence data points in time but logistically this is difficult to manage. We did not test the yearly samples for inapparent infections for CHIKV and ZIKV given that it was not planned on the original protocol and also due to the cross-reactivity of DENV and ZIKV with the currently available serological assays. Also we did not use paired samples in all the symptomatic arboviral cases; this decision was made with the advise of the arbovirus State Laboratory of Yucatan. This study relies on Inhibition ELISA to assess inapparent infections. The gold standard to assess DENV infection is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) but it is very labor intensive and expensive so testing all the participants was not feasible.</p>
