<p>The analysis of the dengue infections was done in 1,890 participants who had a baseline and completed the first year of follow-up. The incidence rate for dengue infections was 36.55 infections per 1,000 person-years. This incidence rate is lower compared with other cohorts around the world but it concurs with the low transmission of dengue during this first-year of follow-up and the emergence of chikungunya in the state of Yucatan [

The group from 15-19 years of age is just 4.65% of the cohort and only 25.64% of them were naïve at baseline. More participants from this age group have been enrolled in the last months so it is expected to have better denominators for the next years of follow-up.
