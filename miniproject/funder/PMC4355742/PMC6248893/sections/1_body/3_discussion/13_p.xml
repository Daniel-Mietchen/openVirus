<p>In summary, this study reported baseline seroprevalence, incidence of dengue infections, dengue cases and other arboviral cases in a community-based cohort from three settings in Yucatan, Mexico using analytic methods. This is the first report of the results from this prospective cohort that allowed to determine the incidence of arboviral infections and to estimate the true rate of disease, which is usually underestimated by passive surveillance. These data will be used to estimate disease burden. The incidence estimates will be useful for policy makers and to evaluate interventions like vector control strategies and vaccines. Future analysis of household transmission, cluster analysis and effectiveness of interventions are planned.</p>
