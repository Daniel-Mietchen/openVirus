<p>To our knowledge this is the first prospective cohort study to describe the incidence rates of laboratory confirmed acute dengue and other arboviral infections in a population of healthy individuals in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. Our results confirm sustained dengue transmission and also the emergence of other arbovirus (chikungunya virus and Zika virus) since 2015 in the state of Yucatan. This cohort enrolled 767 families (3,400 participants) from three cities of the state of Yucatan, Mexico. The 3,400 participants contributed 3,480 person-years during the first year of follow-up. The estimated dengue baseline seroprevalence of the cohort was 70.28%. The city with the higher seroprevalence was Ticul (81.07%), followed by Merida and Progreso and these seroprevalences increased with age as expected for dengue endemic transmission settings. It is important to highlight that the seroprevalence in the age group from 9–14 years old in the three study settings were ≤ 70% and these findings could be relevant for the Mexican government to guide policies for dengue vaccine introduction.</p>
