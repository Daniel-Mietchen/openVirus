<p>The incidence rate of confirmed symptomatic dengue was 3.45 cases per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 1.87, 5.86). In the first year of the study, 12 symptomatic acute dengue cases were serotyped; DENV1 (52%) was the most isolated serotype, followed by serotype DENV4 (33.3%) and DENV2 (16.7%). DENV3 was not isolated during the analyzed period. No hospitalizations or deaths resulting from symptomatic dengue infection were reported during the first year of the cohort. The highest incidence of dengue was observed in the participants in the following groups: participants that were 15-19 years of age (IR: 6.88 per 1,000 person-years), females (IR: 6.3 per 1,000 person-years), and participants from Merida (IR: 4.2 per 1,000 person-years) (

The highest incidence of chikungunya was observed in the participants in the group 50 years old or older, females and in Ticul. (

The highest incidence rate estimated for Zika was also in Ticul (7.32 per 1,000 person-years). One case of co-infection of dengue and chikungunya was also identified. The majority of cases occurred from August to December 2015 which is historically considered the dengue season in Yucatan, Mexico. We explored the presence of clustering at the family level on this cohort but during this first year of follow-up in just one household were detected two dengue cases so the adjustment for clustering was not needed.
