<p>A Cox proportional hazard model was fitted for total dengue infections. The variables included in the model were: age, prior exposure to dengue, gender, city, household size of five or more people, and one or more infections in the same household. In the univariate analysis, age as a continuous variable was significant as a protective factor for dengue infections (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96, 0.99). There was no significant association between total dengue infections and overcrowding in the household but the remaining variables were significantly associated with having a dengue infection. The highest hazard ratios were estimated for baseline exposure to dengue (HR = 20.5, 95%CI: 10.30, 40.91) and having more people infected with dengue in the household (HR = 57.9, 95%CI:37.21, 90.08). Those two variables were included in the final model as potential confounders. In the final model, having a dengue infection during the first year of follow-up was significantly associated with female gender, living in Ticul or Progreso, and being dengue na√Øve at baseline. Age was not significantly associated with the outcome, as it was confounded by prior immunity to dengue that increases with age. (
