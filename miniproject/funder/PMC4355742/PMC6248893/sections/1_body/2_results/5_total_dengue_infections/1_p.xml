<p>For the analysis of dengue infections, we included only the participants who completed the first year of follow-up and contributed with a blood sample at the beginning of the study (starting in January 2015 through out 2015) and at the end of the first year of follow-up depending on the day of enrollment (up to October 2016). Of these 1,890 participants, 1,037 (54.8%) were from Merida, 379 (20.1%) were from Progreso and 474 (25.1%) were from Ticul. In total, these 1,890 participants contributed 2271.14 person-years and had 83 confirmed dengue infections, for an incidence rate of 36.55 infections per 1,000 person-years (95%CI 29.29, 45.07) (

From the total confirmed dengue infections, 14.5% (12/83) were confirmed using RT-PCR for dengue and the rest 85.5% (71/86) were confirmed by serology according to the protocol. The overall ratio of dengue infections to symptomatic cases was 8.22 dengue infections per dengue symptomatic case. The highest incidence of dengue was observed in the participants in the group of 15-19 years of age followed by the ≤ 8 year olds. High incidence rates were also observed in participants from Merida, females, and in the population of naïves (

The lowest rates of symptomatic cases were in the oldest age group(≥ 50 years-old) and the 9 to 14 years-old group with a rate of 6.66 cases per 100 infections (Additional tables by age and city can be found on the supplemental material
