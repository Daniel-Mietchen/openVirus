<p>The analysis of dengue infections was limited to those participants who completed the year and contributed a blood sample at the beginning and the end of the year. In order to provide estimates of dengue infection incidence, since the exact timing of the dengue infection could not always be ascertained, persons who experienced a dengue infection in the first year of follow-up contributed person-time for that entire year. For the analysis of dengue infections, the age of the participant was defined as the age when their annual sample was collected. The crude incidence per 1,000 person-years was 1,000 times the number of dengue infections divided by the number of person-years in the dataset as published elsewhere [
