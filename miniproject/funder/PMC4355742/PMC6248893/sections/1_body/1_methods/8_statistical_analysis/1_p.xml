<p>The age-specific baseline seroprevalence for dengue virus was estimated for the entire cohort. For the first year of follow-up, the follow-up time was estimated as the time between enrollment and the end of the reported study period (August 2016), or withdrawal from the study. For those who were lost to follow-up, person-years were calculated as the time between enrollment and the last contact with study personnel, plus one-half the time between the last contact and the date recorded as lost to follow-up.</p>
