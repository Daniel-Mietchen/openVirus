<p>Each area of transmission included several primary public schools from which the cohort of children from first to third grade was randomly selected. The randomization was done using stratified random sampling. First, we stratified the transmission risk of the neighborhoods on the three cities (Merida, Progreso and Ticul). These included two low-risk areas (one in the north of Merida and one in Progreso); two medium risk areas (one urban area in central Merida and one in Ticul); and one high-risk urban area in the south of Merida. The risk was defined based on historical epidemiological features: 1) the historical dengue cases reported to the epidemiological surveillance system; 2) the percent of cases reported every year in each setting; and 3) the continuous transmission during 6 to 8 or more weeks every year. Second, after selecting some areas randomly based on the transmission risk, the field team asked for the list of all the schools located on the randomized transmission settings and a simple random sampling procedure was done to select the schools. The next step was done with the list of the students from 1st to 4th grade from each school that were also randomized.</p>
