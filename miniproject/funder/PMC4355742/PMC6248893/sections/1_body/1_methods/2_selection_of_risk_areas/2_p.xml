<p>The school-based study is defined by a random selection of five extensive geographic areas (districts) with different dengue transmission risks (high, medium or low). The data obtained from the epidemiological surveillance system identified those areas where dengue has been historically higher and persistent and where the transmission risk is defined as high, medium and low. The sample includes low-risk areas in Merida and Progreso, medium-risk areas in Merida and Ticul, and a high-risk area in Merida. The sample size was estimated for the school-children from each transmission risk by city. The sample size was 150 school children from each transmission risk by city and then expanded to their families.</p>
