<p>The state of Yucatan is located in the southeast peninsula of Mexico, bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. As described elsewhere, the cities of Merida, Progreso and Ticul were selected as three settings with different epidemiological dynamics (low, medium, high dengue transmission) (

As these three cities also have different dengue incidence rates, this allowed us to explore possible differences in dengue transmission scenarios [
