<p>Surveillance systems based on the monitoring and notification of dengue symptomatic cases have low sensitivity and rarely detect low or sporadic transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006847.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The proportion of dengue asymptomatic infections varies widely by populations, geographical areas, and over different epidemiological periods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006847.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Underreporting of dengue cases to national surveillance systems hinders accurate local, regional and global estimation of disease burden [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006847.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Necessary steps to better understand dengue transmission in at-risk populations include strengthening passive surveillance systems by incorporating active surveillance methods (e.g., house-to-house visits, school absenteeism or self-identification of fever episodes) and improving the detection of inapparent infections to rectify the underreporting of unspecified febrile dengue infections.
