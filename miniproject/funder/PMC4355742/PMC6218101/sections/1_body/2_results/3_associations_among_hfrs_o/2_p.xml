<p>The potential contact 
 <italic>Î²</italic> matrix shows the relationships among the different land types, various rodent species, and HFRS occurrences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006881.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The main risk of HFRS occurrence on cultivated land was from all types of rodents in these areas. The main risk of HFRS occurrence in the forest was from other species (
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>losea</italic> and 
 <italic>Microtus fortis calamorum</italic>). Cases of HFRS in grassland areas resulted mainly from the presence of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic>, with 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>flavipectus</italic> being slightly involved. The main risk on built-on land was from 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>flavipectus</italic>. The other species (
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>losea</italic> and 
 <italic>Microtus fortis calamorum</italic>) were associated with the occurrence of HFRS in water-covered areas. We also noticed several negative values. Specifically, when species other than 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic>, 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>musculus</italic> and 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>flavipectus</italic> accounted for a relatively large proportion of the rodent population, the occurrence of HFRS on grassland and built-on lands tended to decline. Similarly, when the proportion of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>flavipectus</italic> was large, the occurrence of HFRS in forest areas was low.
