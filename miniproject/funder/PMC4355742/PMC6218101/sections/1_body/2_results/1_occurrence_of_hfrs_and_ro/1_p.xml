<p>In Chenzhou, 723 cases of HFRS were reported 2006â€“2015, of which 14 addresses (0.02%) could not be geocoded. The proportion of cases in association with each land type varied throughout the study period. Specifically, the highest proportion (&gt; 50 percent) of affected patients lived near cultivated land, followed by built-on land and grassland with similar proportions. Relatively few cases of HFRS occurred in areas of forest lands. Furthermore, very few cases were reported in water-covered areas during the study period (
