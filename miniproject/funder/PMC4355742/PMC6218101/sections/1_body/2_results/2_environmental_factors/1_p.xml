<p>During the study period, the temperature and relative humidity maintained a certain degree of balance, while the precipitation level, NDVI, and TVDI all showed distinct and continuous fluctuation among the months and years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006881.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The temperature during the 10-year period maintained a similar variety among the months from 2°C to 33°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006881.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and the relative humidity remained at 70% to 80% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006881.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), but none of these parameters showed substantial interannual fluctuations. However, the precipitation levels fluctuated continuously over the 10-year period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006881.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Additionally, although the NDVI and TVDI (the TVDI values in some months were abnormal and have been removed from the analysis) showed obvious fluctuations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006881.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), the variation coefficient for them for each year did not show a large difference.
