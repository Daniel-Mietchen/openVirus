<p>We found that the HFRS cases occurred predominantly in areas where the land has been cultivated, by grassland areas, built-on land, and forest. Very few cases were identified near water-covered areas in Chenzhou. This indicates that water bodies are relatively safe compared with the other land types we examined. The spread of hantavirus within different land types might be indirectly influenced by different environmental factors. In cultivated land, forest, grassland built-on land and water bodies, hantavirus transmission was influenced mainly by temperature, humidity precipitation, vegetation and soil moisture status; vegetation status; humidity, precipitation, vegetation and soil moisture status; temperature, humidity, precipitation and vegetation status; and soil moisture status, respectively.</p>
