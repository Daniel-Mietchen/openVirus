<p>Most HFRS cases were associated with cultivated land, possibly because it provides an environment with adequate food and an ideal habitat for rodent survival. Moreover, this type of land is closely linked with the presence of human beings. The rodent community composition was most strongly affected by relative humidity and the NDVI, followed by the TVDI, temperature, and precipitation. The TVDI is a complex variable that reflects the moisture condition, temperature, and vegetation lushness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006881.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We hypothesize that the TVDI is a useful indicator of food availability for rodents and is directly influenced by climatic forcing. The NDVI reflects the level of vegetation coverage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006881.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], is an accurate indicator of food and living conditions for rodents, and is related to the amount and productivity of vegetation and crops [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006881.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Most rodent species respond directly to fluctuations in food availability, and rodent species densities are driven by changes in food resources. Vegetation also provides shelter and safety from predators and other threats. Appropriate levels of precipitation and humidity not only provide ideal conditions for the plentiful growth of crops and help to boost rodent populations, but also influence rodent activity and thus affect hantavirus infectivity. Farmers working on cultivated land have more opportunities than humans elsewhere to come into contact with rodents, which increases of HFRS transmission risk [

 <italic>R</italic>.

 <italic>musculus</italic>, 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>musculus</italic> might prefer humid environments, so when the relative humidity increases, the occurrence of HFRS in forest and grassland regions would rise. We found built-on land posed an important risk for HFRS occurrence, and the predominant rodent species found there were 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>flavipectus</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>musculus</italic>. The risks from this land-use type might be related to urbanization and migrant workers. What should not be ignored is the fact that rodent abundances can be influenced by some specific activities, such as continuous pest control. Whether these activities have variable effects on the different rodent species needs to be investigated in future.
