<p>The environment and host population are important factors affecting the dynamics of the natural foci of many diseases. For example, a less hot and humid climate may promote the prevalence of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and other vectors, such as dengue [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006881.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], among many others. The growth of rodent communities may increase the risk of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006881.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We argue that clarification of the associations among the environment, host population, and disease dynamics is of great importance to the prevention and control of many types of disease epidemics. In this study, we quantified the relationships among the occurrence of HFRS, the environmental conditions, and the rodent species composition.
