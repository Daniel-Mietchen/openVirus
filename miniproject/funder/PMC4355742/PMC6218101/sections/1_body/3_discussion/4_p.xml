<p>In our comparison of the observed versus the predicted HFRS occurrence ratios, we found that the accuracy of the predictions for the different land-use types differed between 2014 and 2015. In 2014, the accuracy of our predictions was higher for cultivated land, built-on land, and water bodies and lower for the other two types of land. In 2015, however, the accuracy of our predictions was lower for cultivated and forest and higher for the other three types of land. In both years, the predicted occurrence of HFRS in grassland was higher than the observed occurrence, while the predicted occurrence of HFRS in forest was relatively lower than the actual observation. Continuous pest control was carried out during the study period, which might have brought some unavoidable influences on the rodent community composition and even to the occurrence of HFRS. The prediction errors for water bodies were small because of the sustained small total number of HFRS cases on the type of land.</p>
