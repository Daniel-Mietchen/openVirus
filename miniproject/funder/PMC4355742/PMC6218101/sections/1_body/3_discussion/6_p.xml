<p>This study has some limitations. First, the prevalence of hantavirus in rodents was not considered because proper data for this was unavailable. Second, some factors may have caused inaccuracy in the division of land-use types for the HFRS cases: 1) the residential addresses were geo-located via Google Earth, which may have led to inaccurate land-use types via spatial resolution issues; 2) the validity of our findings depends on the assumptions that the location of the residence determines the risk of infection but the site of infection maybe not coincide completely with the residency of the individuals; in fact, they might be infected accidently by exposure far away from their residency. Third, due to the limitation of the rodent surveillance data, it is quite difficult to apply the analysis on monthly or seasonal basis. Fourth, the generalist species should be detected and taken into consideration in a further study. Finally, the sex and age structure of both the rodent populations and the susceptible populations were not considered in detail, but these factors might influence the transmission of hantavirus and the occurrence of HFRS.</p>
