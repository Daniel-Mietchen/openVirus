<p>In this study, we assessed the distribution of rodent species across different land types and ascertained the primary species in regions with HFRS. Our findings can be used to support adjustments in rodent surveillance programs and to reduce the occurrence of HFRS in diverse environments. We also predicted the risk of HFRS for different land types in 2014 and 2015, and quantified the associations among the occurrence of HFRS, rodent species, and environmental factors by constructing and calculating matrices. These methods can be utilized to predict the risk of HFRS in the future, in Chenzhou and in other areas with similar characteristics. Our work has not only provided scientific data for improving HFRS prevention and control strategies but also serve as methodological advancement for use with similar zoonotic infections.</p>
