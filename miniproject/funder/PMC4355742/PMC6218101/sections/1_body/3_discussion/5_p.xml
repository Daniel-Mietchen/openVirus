<p>The influence of the rodent community composition on hantavirus transmission has been evaluated in previously studies [

 <italic>musculus</italic> and

 <italic>norvegicus</italic> were the predominant species in Chenzhou and both species played essential roles in hantavirus transmission, a finding similar to the situation for residential habitats in the Jiuhua Mountain area [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006881.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the present study, cultivated land and built-on land, which are known to be closely related with human activities, were also found to be associated with higher risks of HFRS incidence. Moreover, the different rodent species were primarily affected by different environmental factors, which may indicate that once an environment changes, the rodent community composition may also change in response, thus influencing the transmission of hantavirus. However, some rodent species are habitat generalists, and if these species account for large parts of the overall rodent population, the infectious risk of HFRS would more likely to be determined by the infectious ability of the habitat generalist.
