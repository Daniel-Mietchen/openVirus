<p>The purpose of this study was to determine how the rodent community composition influences the risk of contracting a human hantavirus infection in different environments. Various techniques for forecasting environmental changes, such as the ability to forecast trends in climate change, have advanced significantly. Therefore, constructing reliable models with which to quantify the relationships among the environments, rodent populations, and the occurrences of human HFRS is necessary to predict the risk of HFRS occurrence to help to prevent and control HFRS epidemics.</p>
