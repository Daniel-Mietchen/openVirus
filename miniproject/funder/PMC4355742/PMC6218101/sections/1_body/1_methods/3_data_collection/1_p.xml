<p>The data for the HFRS cases that occurred in Chenzhou (January, 2006 to December, 2015) were obtained from the Hunan CDC. All cases were initially diagnosed according to the clinical criteria of the Ministry of Health of China. The serum samples collected from patients with clinical signs of HFRS were sent to the Hunan CDC laboratory. The diagnosis was supported by detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to hantavirus in acute-phase serum specimens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In this study, HTNV and SEOV infections were not distinguished from each other. All cases were geo-coded according to the residential address using Google Earth (Google, Mountain View, CA, USA) and classified based on which type of land was nearest to the address.</p>
