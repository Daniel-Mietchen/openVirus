<p>From January, 2006 to December, 2015, meteorological data (daily precipitation, daily average temperature, and daily average relative humidity) were obtained from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System (

The data were integrated into monthly average values so as to prepare for the next calculation. To characterize the vegetation and soil moisture status, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), were extracted from multi-day composited Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from January 2006 to December 2015. The MODIS data (MOD11A2 and MOD13A2) were acquired with a spatial resolution of 1 km from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC/NASA,

The NDVI is an index relating to the amount and productivity of vegetation and is always used as an important environmental parameter in studies of epidemics [

We composited both of them into monthly data, cut the extent of Chenzhou City out, and calculated the mean NDVI value for Chenzhou City monthly. After that, the monthly NDVI and LST data were used to calculate the TVDI through a special tool of ENVI 5.0 (Esri Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). The TVDI, which ranges from 0 to 1, is used extensively in soil moisture estimation. A higher TVDI corresponds to lower soil moisture and vice versa. The TVDI is estimated using the following equation:
