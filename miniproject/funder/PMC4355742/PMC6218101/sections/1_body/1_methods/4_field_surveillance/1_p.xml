<p>From 2006 to 2015, the surveillance of rodent hosts in Chenzhou was conducted once per month over three consecutive nights. In total, 28 permanent trapping sites were established among the following three distinct environments: 14 in special industrial areas (restaurants and processing plants), 8 in residential areas, and 6 in rural areas. From 2006 to 2015, 72,039 effective trap-nights were set. At least 300 medium-sized peanut-baited steel traps were set each night and recovered in the morning for all the trapping sites. More than 100 traps were placed indoors and more than 200 traps were placed outdoors. The outdoors traps were set along the terrain at intervals of 10 m with the column spacing set at 50 m, and indoors trap interval was approximately 12 to 15 meters. The trapped rodents were coded, and their species and sex were identified [
