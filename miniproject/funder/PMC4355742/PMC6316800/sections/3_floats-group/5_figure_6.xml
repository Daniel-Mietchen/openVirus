  <p>Immunofluorescent localization of cellular NUMA1 and of viral NS1, M1 and M2 proteins in A549 cells infected with PR8 at MOI = 3. (
   <bold>A</bold>), Mock (top row), non-KD infected wild-type (2nd row), non-silencing KD infected (N-Si; 3rd row), and infected 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells (bottom row) were stained with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to detect nuclei (left-most column; blue), with anti-IAV NS1 (2nd column; red), and with anti-NUMA1 (3rd column; green). Merged images are shown in the 4th column and boxed regions are enlarged at far right. The NUMA1 merged box was rotated clockwise 90°. Scale bars are 25 µm for the low-magnification images and 5 µm for the enlarged images. (
   <bold>B</bold>), Mock infected N-Si (left), PR8-infected N-Si (middle) and PR8-infected 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD (right) A549 cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 546 anti-M1 (red; top) or with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-M2 (green; bottom) and analyzed by super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) at 20 hpi. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). White arrows indicate the cluster of M1 in 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells (top, right) or accumulation of M2 near cytoplasmic membranes of 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells (lower, right). Scale bars represent 10 µm for the 
   <italic>X</italic> and 
   <italic>Y</italic> axes, and 2µm for the 
   <italic>Z</italic> axis, respectively.
