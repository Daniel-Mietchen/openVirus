  <p>Identification of non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-interacting host proteins. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Western blot analyses of influenza A virus (IAV) NS1 immunoprecipitations. Samples were collected from the cytosols or nuclei of Mock- or PR8-infected cells in P150 dishes at indicated times and resolved in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) before (Input; 30 µg) and after (Immppt; 10% of total sample) treatment with Dynabeads to which the indicated antibodies (α-NS1 or Isotype-matched controls) had been pre-bound. Resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, probed with α-NS1 primary antibody, and re-probed with VeriBlot secondary α-mouse antibody. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Venn diagram indicating degree of overlap in protein identifications from 3 different biological replicates (Bio 1–3). Biological replicate #3 was repeated as 2 technical replicates (Bio 3 Tech1 and Bio 3 Tech 2).
