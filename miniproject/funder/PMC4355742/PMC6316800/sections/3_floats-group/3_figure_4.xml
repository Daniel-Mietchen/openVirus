  <p>Characterizations of protein, RNA, and infectious virus production in NUMA1 KD cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>), Upper panel: confirmation that NUMA1 is immunoprecipitated and recognized by α-NUMA1 antibody in Western blot. NUMA1 could not be detected in non-concentrated cell lysates. Cell lysates were prepared from P100 dishes of A549 cells, reacted with Dynabeads to which α-NUMA1 Abs had been coupled, and ½ of the reaction dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes, and probed with α-NUMA1 antibody. Lower panel: Cell extracts prepared from P100 dishes of A549 cells infected with PR8 at MOI = 5 PFU/cell were probed for NS1 prior to immunoprecipitation (Input; 30 µg), or were immunoprecipitated with beads to which NUMA1 or an irrelevant isotype control antibody had been bound. Co-precipitated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blots were immunoprobed with α-NS1 antibody. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Confirmation of NUMA1 KD efficiency in A549 cells. Sets of P100 dishes were treated with 25 nM of non-silencing (N-Si) control or with 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic>-specific siRNA twice, 24 h apart for a total of 48 h treatment. Cell extracts were prepared and a 1/40th dilution probed for β-actin to confirm equivalent starting amounts (middle panel). Extracts were then immunoprecipitated with α-NUMA1-Dynabeads. After washing, beads were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoprobed for NUMA1 (upper panel) or IgG heavy chain (lower panel). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Densitometry confirms NUMA1 was knocked down to ~16% of N-Si levels. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Percentages of infectious virus production from NUMA1 A549 KD cells compared to N-Si cells. Cells were infected at MOI of 0.05 and harvested at 43 hpi for plaque assay. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Percentages of indicated infectious IAV produced from 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD A549 and HBEC cells compared to N-Si cells at 43 hpi after MOI = 0.05 infection. The horizontal dashed line at 100% corresponds to each virus’ yield from matching N-Si cells. (
   <bold>F</bold>) mRNA levels of NS1 and of NP in A549 cells infected with PR8 at MOI = 5. 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and N-Si cell lysates were quantified by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to both 18S RNA and to NUMA1 quantities produced in the N-Si cells. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Cell extracts prepared from N-Si- and 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD-infected cells were immunoprobed with the indicated viral proteins (right) or with actin. (
   <bold>H</bold>–
   <bold>J</bold>) Analyses of infected supernatants from N-Si or 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells, before ultracentrifugal concentration (
   <bold>H</bold>; left-most pair of bars) or after concentration (
   <bold>H</bold>; rightmost pair of bars, and 
   <bold>I</bold> and 
   <bold>J</bold>). Concentrated viruses were tested for infectivity (
   <bold>H</bold>) and immunoprobed for indicated structural proteins (
   <bold>I</bold>). (
   <bold>J</bold>) Densitometry confirms 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells produce particles with ~20–40% protein content compared to N-Si cells. Error bars represent SEM from two independent replicates. *: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; **: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.
