  <p>Genetic knockdown of candidate genes by siRNA array screen. Reverse transfections of indicated genes in A549 cells grown in 96-well plates were checked for cell viability with WST-1 at (
   <bold>A</bold>) 48 h after knockdown, and (
   <bold>B</bold>) after knockdown and PR8 infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.05 for an additional 43 h. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Virus yields from PR8 infection after MOI = 0.05 infection at 43hpi were determined by plaque assay on canine kidney (MDCK) cells. All values were normalized to the corresponding non-silencing (N-Si) controls, which were set as 100%. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) from three independent replicates. *:

The 11 genes, knockdown (KD) of which significantly reduced the infectious virus production to between 2.6â€“30% of the N-Si controls, are depicted as black bars, and cell viabilities after 91 h of knockdown, and the ratios of virus production to cell viability for these 11 genes are shown in
