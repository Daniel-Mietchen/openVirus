  <p>Proposed model for the role of NUMA1 during IAV replication. Major trafficking pathway, involving NUMA1, tubulin and exocytosis via the Golgi are indicated in the right of each panel. Lack of NUMA1 on the right results in significant attenuation of this pathway. An alternate, presumably minor pathway involving microfilaments (left side of each panel in dashed box), accounts for minor amounts of progeny virus production in normal, wild-type infection and in
