<p>We report in the current study that NS1 interacts with host NUMA1 protein during IAV replication. NS1 works as a bridge between NUMA1 and M1 proteins. After that, the strong link between NUMA1 and microtubules facilitates the transfer of viral M1-associated proteins (vRNPs) to the cytoplasm using the exocytic pathway via trans-Golgi network for assembly and budding. We also propose that M1-vRNPs are not able to interact with the microtubule network in NUMA1 deficient cells; thus, the transportation of these essential proteins to the assembly site is obstructed. IAV RNPs can be routed to the cell periphery through the Rab11-dependent vesicular transport system [

 <xref rid="B82-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. These Rab11 and microfilament-mediated transport systems might contribute to the generation of some viruses (2.6â€“20% of the N-Si) in our PR8-infected
