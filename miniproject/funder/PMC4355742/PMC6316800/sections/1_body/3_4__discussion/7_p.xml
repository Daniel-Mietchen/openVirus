<p>During viral maturation, newly produced vRNPs need to be exported to the cytoplasm, and then transported to the cell membrane for progeny virus assembly and budding. Influenza M1 directly interacts with vRNPs and plays vital role in exporting these vRNPs into the cytoplasm [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The viral envelope proteins, HA, NA and M2, are independently transported to the cell membrane, where eventual interactions among the viral proteins and vRNPs lead to progeny virion assembly and budding. M1 acts as a linker between vRNPs and envelope proteins (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]). In addition, our previous study showed NS1 proteins were detected in the nucleus at early times of infection and later spread into the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. HA, NA and M2 use exocytic pathways to reach the cell membrane for assembly and budding through the

 <xref rid="B79-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. After the export of vRNPs-M1 complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, it is suggested that the vRNPs-M1 complexes can be transported to the cell membrane by piggy-backing on the HA and NA cytoplasmic domains or via cytoskeleton elements [

 <xref rid="B82-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Our SIM images of PR8-infected 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells showed IAV M1 proteins formed clusters within the cytoplasmic regions, in close proximity to the nucleus, whereas no clustering was seen within the N-Si cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). In PR8-infected 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells, NP levels were also higher than in the PR8-infected N-Si cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>H). Therefore, transport of M1-associated viral proteins to the cell membrane assembly and budding site was inhibited in NUMA1 deficient cells, which ultimately reduced the infectious virus production compared to the N-Si cells. However, an increase of IAV M2 proteins was also deposited near the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cytoplasmic region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f006">Figure 6</xref>B), which suggested that M2 was produced but could not participate in viral maturation with other structural proteins. EM results also showed significant reduction of virus budding in 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells compared to the N-Si cells (
