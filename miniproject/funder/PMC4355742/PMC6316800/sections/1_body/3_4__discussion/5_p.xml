<p>NUMA1, also known as NuMA, is an important structural component of both the nucleus and spindle poles, and it plays essential roles during the assembly and maintenance of the mitotic spindle in the cell cycle (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]). The NuMA protein is solubilized and modified extensively, including phosphorylation at unknown sites, during Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Knocking down NuMA expression in Hep-2 cells also decreased HSV production. NUMA1 has strong connections with microtubules. During mitosis, NUMA1 plays an important role in connecting the microtubules to the spindle poles [
