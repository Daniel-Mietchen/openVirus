 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD significantly reduced replication of several IAV strains in both A549 and HBEC cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>E), which has not been previously reported. We found no significant inhibition of PR8 viral mRNA synthesis in NUMA1 deficient cells compared to the control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>F,G). This suggests that viral entry into the cell, import of incoming vRNPs to the nucleus and viral transcription steps do not depend on NUMA1 proteins. NUMA1 deficient cells and N-Si control cells synthesized similar amounts of IAV structural and non-structural proteins, which indicates that viral mRNA transport to the cytoplasm and translation were not affected by 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>H). The levels of IAV structural proteins released into the supernatant were significantly reduced in 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells compared to the N-Si control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>I,J). Thus, viral transcription and translation steps are not inhibited, but viral maturation steps are inhibited within NUMA1 deficient cells.
