<p>IAV utilizes the host cell system for its gene expression. To initiate IAV transcription, viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) executes cap-snatching from host pre-mRNA and NS1 may play roles during this step [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Influenza viruses use the host’s splicing machinery to produce M1, M2, NS1 and NS2/NEP proteins [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. NS1 interacts with spliceosomal subunits U2 and U6 during viral replication, potentially favouring their splicing [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. NS1 interacts with the 5’ UTR of viral mRNAs and with translation initiation factors PABP1 and eIF4GI, which enhance viral mRNA translation [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. NS1 also interacts with factors involved in mRNA export, such as NXF1/Tap, and blocks host mRNA export [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In addition, NS1 interacts with viral RNP and regulates IAV replication [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Numerous NS1-interacting host factors we identified were enriched in gene expression, splicing, protein metabolism, nucleic acid binding, translational regulation and mRNA processing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f002">Figure 2</xref>A–E). IAV may use these host factors to favour viral replication. We also identified large numbers of RNA-binding proteins. NS1 contains two functional domains: an N-terminal RNA-binding domain and C-terminal effector domain. The RNA binding and effector domains interact with different cellular RNAs and host factors, respectively [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], potentially accounting for the large numbers of RNA binding proteins we identified.
