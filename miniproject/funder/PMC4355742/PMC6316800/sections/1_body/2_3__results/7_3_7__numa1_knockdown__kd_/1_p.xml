<p>Since infectious virus production was consistently reduced in 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells, we next tested specific steps in virus replication. NUMA1 is mainly a nuclear protein, but it is also found in the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. After infection, viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) need to enter the nucleus for transcription. We initially checked whether the import of incoming vRNPs or the transcription process was inhibited in 
 <italic>NUMA</italic> 1 KD cells by analyzing viral RNA production. 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and N-Si KD cells were infected with IAV-PR8 at MOI 3, infected cells were harvested at 18 hpi and total RNA was extracted. Synthesis of viral NP and NS1 RNAs were not reduced in 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>E). Thus, 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD did not affect early vRNP entry into the nucleus and transcription of NS1 and NP. After transcription, viral mRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm and translated by host cell machinery. Whole cell lysates were extracted from PR8-infected 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and N-Si cells at 18 hpi and analyzed by Western blot. Early (NS1 and NP) and late (M2) viral protein translation was not reduced in the infected 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD A549 cells compared to the N-Si cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). Therefore, 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD did not impede the transport of viral mRNAs to the cytoplasm and the translation process.
