<p>In order to test the roles of these potentially novel NS1-interacting host factors, we designed a high-throughput, 96-well-based custom siRNA array; 107 proteins were targeted based on their novelty, functions and high MS scores. These 107 proteins were identified as NS1 interacting partners in 2 or more different biological replicates with at least 2 peptides and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (unused score ≥2.0). Cell viabilities were determined after 48 h of knockdown (KD) and most remained &gt;80% viable compared to non-targeting control (N-Si) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f003">Figure 3</xref>, left). The lowest viability (62.8%) was seen in 
 <italic>SNRNP200</italic> siRNA treatment. The KD cells were infected with IAV PR8 at MOI 0.05 and the supernatants were harvested at 43 hpi to detect infectious viral yields to determine how efficiently the virus replicated. Cell viabilities after 48 h KD and 43 h infection were also measured (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f003">Figure 3</xref>, middle). Infected cell cultures remained &gt;70% viable compared to N-Si. In 34 KD cases, PR8 infection reduced the cell viability to 69.6–26.9%. The lowest cell viability was seen in PR8-infected 
 <italic>NOL6</italic> KD cells. In some KD cases, cell viabilities were highly increased after viral infection indicating that the KD may protect the cell from cytopathic effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f003">Figure 3</xref>, middle). Knocking down 11 genes significantly reduced the infectious virus production to between 2.6–30% of the N-Si controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f003">Figure 3</xref>, right). The lowest IAV yields were generated in 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells. Among these 11 KD gene candidates, 
 <italic>ILF2</italic>, 
 <italic>HNRNPUL2</italic> and 
 <italic>PRPF19</italic> were previously detected as NS1-interacting factors in the VirHostNet 2.0 database.

 <italic>RPF1</italic>, 
 <italic>SYNCRIP</italic>, 
 <italic>SF3B3</italic>, 
 <italic>UTP6</italic> and 
 <italic>SNRNP200</italic> were novel discoveries, and the role of PRPF19 was recently reported [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] while our study was underway. These 11 gene candidates play roles in various biological processes, molecular functions and pathways (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00731">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Some important biological processes and molecular functions include cellular macromolecular complex assembly and subunit organization; chromatin assembly, packaging and remodeling; nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism; mRNA splicing; mRNA processing; nucleic acid binding; structural molecule activity; and ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis. Some important pathways include spliceosome, gene expression and processing of capped intron-containing pre-mRNA.
