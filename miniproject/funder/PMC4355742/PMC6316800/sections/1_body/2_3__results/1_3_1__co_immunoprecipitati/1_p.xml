<p>We previously generated and characterized a panel of nine different broadly cross-reactive anti-NS1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that detect five different epitopes on native and denatured forms of IAV NS1 [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For this NS1 interactome study, a mixture of anti-NS1 mAbs 3F5, 4E10 and 7D11, which recognize three of these different epitopes [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], were used, as described in Materials and Methods, to increase potential molecular interaction coverage. The anti-NS1 mAb mixture successfully pulled down NS1 protein (~26 kDa) from both PR8-infected cytosol and nuclei (

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. No non-specific NS1 binding was seen in PR8-infected cytosolic or nuclear IPs with the isotype controls, nor in mock-infected control samples (
