<p>Host factor NUMA1 was selected for reciprocal IP, based on its ability to significantly reduce viral replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f003">Figure 3</xref>, right), its functional properties such as biological process, molecular functions and pathways and the availability of antibodies. A549 cells were infected with IAV PR8 at MOI 5 and harvested at 24 hpi. Cellular proteins were extracted from harvested cells and analyzed by co-IP using Protein G Dynabeads coupled to anti-NUMA1 antibody. IP products were analyzed by Western blot analysis using both anti-NUMA1 and anti-NS1 Abs. No NUMA1 signal was detected in non-concentrated cell lysates but a strong NUMA1 signal was seen near the 225 kDa region in immunoprecipitated cell lysates (
