<p>Once specific NS1 IP was confirmed, 90% of the IP products were processed and analyzed by MS for protein identifications. Three different biological replicates were performed and the last replicate was technically examined twice for a total of four replicates. Positive identification of NS1-interacting proteins was only considered when each protein was identified by at least 2 non-redundant peptides at unused scores â‰¥2 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). All protein IDs detected in the PR8-infected IP probed with isotype controls, and in mock-infected IP probed with anti-NS1 mAb mixture, were considered non-specific background binding and were subtracted from proteins in the PR8-infected IP probed with anti-NS1. 233, 138, and 324 NS1 interacting host factors were identified in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of biological replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively (

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] database, 59 of these 183 host factors (32%) had been previously reported to interact with IAV NS1 protein (indicated by # in 
 <xref rid="viruses-10-00731-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), whereas 124 host proteins represent potentially novel NS1 interacting partners. PR8 viral matrix protein 1 (M1) and nucleoprotein (NP) were also detected in the NS1 IP with high peptide and high unused scores, confirming numerous other reports and their interaction with NS1 in the VirHostNet 2.0 database.
