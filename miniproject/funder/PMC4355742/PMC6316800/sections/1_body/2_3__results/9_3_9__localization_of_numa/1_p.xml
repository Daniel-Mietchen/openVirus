<p>To further assess 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and to determine localization of various viral non-structural and structural proteins under our control and KD conditions, we infected A549 cells with PR8 at MOI = 3 and examined cells for various protein markers. Viral NS1 protein was found in both nuclei and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in most infected cells, but was primarily localized to perinuclear regions in the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). NUMA1 was found predominantly in nuclei, co-localizing with DAPI, except in the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells where the signal intensity was clearly reduced and the protein occupied only some of a few nuclei. As expected from the initial identification of NUMA1 (
 <xref rid="viruses-10-00731-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and reciprocal immunoprecipitations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>) indicating NS1/NUMA1 interaction, NS1 and NUMA1 co-localized in the nuclei as indicated by the pale blue/white color in wild-type and N-Si KD cells. However, this interaction was greatly reduced in the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells as indicated by the few pale blue/white patches (
