<p>Proteins in each identified GO pathway were visualized with STRING (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f002">Figure 2</xref>F–H and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00731">Supplementary Figure S1A–D</xref>) and all 183 proteins were collectively visualized to check their interaction network (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00731">Supplementary Figure S1E</xref>). Tight interactions among the proteins of different pathways, such as 3′-UTR-mediated translational regulation, ribosome and metabolism indicate the strong associations of these pathways with NS1 during Influenza virus replication.
