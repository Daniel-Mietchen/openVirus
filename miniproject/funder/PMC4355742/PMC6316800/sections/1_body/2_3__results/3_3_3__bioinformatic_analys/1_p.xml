<p>The multifunctional IAV-NS1 protein is expected to interact with a wide variety of host factors to serve its multiple functions. Therefore, categorizing the additional novel NS1-interacting host factors identified in our study may identify additional potential pathways and functions where NS1 plays vital roles during viral replication. DAVID and Panther analyses of the 183 genes showed various biological and molecular classes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). The top enriched biological processes were nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, mRNA splicing, pre-mRNA processing and protein biosynthesis. Similar molecular functions such as nucleic acid binding, mRNA splicing factor, mRNA processing factor and ribosomal protein were also enriched. The NS1-interacting host factors were involved in eight different pathways; gene expressions, 3â€²-UTR-mediated translational regulation, processing of capped intron-containing pre-mRNA, spliceosome, Influenza infection and metabolism of proteins (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f002">Figure 2</xref>D,E). The top biological processes enriched were RNA processing, mRNA metabolic process, RNA splicing and translation. Some top molecular functions enriched were RNA binding, nucleotide binding, DNA binding and structural molecule activity.
