<p>Nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1) was detected in all four biological and technical NS1 interactome replicates (
 <xref rid="viruses-10-00731-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the initial siRNA screens, IAV production was significantly reduced compared to the N-Si in all independent studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f003">Figure 3</xref>, right), which indicated an important role for NUMA1 in IAV replication. To validate the siRNA array results, KD was performed in larger dishes of A549 cells with 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> Smart Pool siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA). Optimization experiments indicated sufficient KD (NUMA protein expression reduced to ~16%) when cells were treated twice with 25 nM siRNA 24 h apart and infected 48 h post-initial KD. Transfected A549 cells were ~100% viable at 48 h post-transfection compared to untreated A549. Comparative IP of 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic>- and N-Si-KD cells, using identical concentrations of cell lysates, Protein G beads and anti-NUMA Ab, confirmed NUMA1 protein expression was reduced to ~15% of the N-Si treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). A 1/40th dilution of input cell lysates confirmed cell lysate loading control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) and equivalent band intensities of anti-NUMA Ab heavy chains confirmed equal Ab treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). After optimization and KD validation, both 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and N-Si cells were infected with IAV PR8 at MOI 0.05 and incubated 43 h. Knocking down 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> significantly reduced infectious PR8 production to ~21% compared to the N-Si in four independent experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>D), which validated the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD results from the siRNA array.
