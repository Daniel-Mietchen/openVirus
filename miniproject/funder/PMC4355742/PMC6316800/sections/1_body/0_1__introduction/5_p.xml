<p>Although NS1 proteins are not incorporated into virions, the high expression levels suggest that NS1 plays additional crucial roles during viral replication. According to the VirHostNet 2.0 [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (May, 2016), 202 cellular proteins were detected and/or reported to interact with Influenza A NS1 [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Some interactome studies employed yeast 2-hybrid systems [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Many other interactome studies involved insertion of tag sequences such as TAP, Strep, Flag, V5, or FS into the NS1 sequence, and targeting the tags to co-immunoprecipitate NS1 and interacting host proteins, which were identified by mass spectrometry [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Inserting tag sequences may interfere with native protein structure and may mask epitopes. Therefore, we developed and characterized a panel of 9 different broadly cross reactive anti-NS1 monoclonal antibodies [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and used them to identify host factors that interact with native IAV NS1 during natural IAV infection. We identified 124 novel putative NS1-interacting proteins and tested RNAi-mediated knockdown of most of these. Knockdown of the NS1-interacting nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1) had no effect on viral transcription or protein translation but significantly reduced infectious virus yield, suggesting NUMA1 plays important roles in IAV maturation.
