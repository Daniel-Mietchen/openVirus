<p>All viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. Successful viral replication requires cellular components and processes because viruses extensively use host cell machinery for productive replication. Influenza viruses also influence cell-signaling pathways to evade the hostâ€™s immune system. Numerous host proteins are differentially expressed during IAV infection compared to non-infected cells. These differentially regulated proteins, which are probably required to support the viral life cycle or maintain host cell stress responses, are involved in different cellular pathways and functions such as host cell immunity, cell adhesion, signal transduction and transcription [
