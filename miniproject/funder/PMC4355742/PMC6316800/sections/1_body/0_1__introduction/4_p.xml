<p>Influenza A non-structural 1 (NS1) protein plays a major role in the production of high levels of viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is a multi-functional protein and its main role is to antagonize the host innate immune system (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Influenza viruses with truncated NS1 induced strong interferon (IFN) secretion and reduced morbidity in several animal models including swine, mice, and macaques [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. NS1 protein inhibits the host’s RIG-I signaling cascade by blocking activation of transcriptional factors NFκB and IRF3, which are required for IFN transcription activation [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The NS1 effector domain (NS1-ED) binds PKR (protein kinase R) and inhibits its conformational changes, thereby inhibiting antiviral activity of IFN-induced PKR (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). OAS (2’–5’ oligo A synthetase), an IFN-induced protein, is activated by dsRNA to produce poly-A chains that activate RNase L expression. RNase L can cleave viral ssRNA and thereby inhibit viral replication [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The NS1 RNA binding domain (NS1-RBD) binds dsRNA and inhibits the activation of the OAS/RNase L pathway [
