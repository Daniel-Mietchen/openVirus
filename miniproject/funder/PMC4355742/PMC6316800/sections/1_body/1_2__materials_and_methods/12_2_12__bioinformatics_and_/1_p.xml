<p>Lists of IAV-NS1 interacting host proteins were generated from Protein Pilot analysis. The gene symbol and Uniprot IDs of all proteins were uploaded into the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] for functional tool analysis. NS1-interacting proteins were also uploaded into Consensus Path Database (CPDB) [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] for pathway and enrichment analysis. Groups of proteins identified in individual pathways in DAVID were uploaded into the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] to visualize the protein-protein interactions. Interaction among viral proteins and host factors were also analyzed by using VirHostNet 2.0 [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] database. All statistical analyses were calculated in Microsoft-Excel and SigmaPlot
