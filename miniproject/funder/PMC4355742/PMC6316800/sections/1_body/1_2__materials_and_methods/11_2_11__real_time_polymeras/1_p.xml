<p>PR8-infected A549 cells were harvested, washed 3× with cold PBS and total cellular mRNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s protocol; 250 ng of purified mRNA was used to synthesize cDNA with the Go Script TM Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using Luminaries Color HiGreen High ROX qPCR kit (Thermo Fisher). According to the manufacture’s protocol, PCR master mix (10 µL) consisted of: 5 µL 2× Luminaries Color HiGreen High ROX qPCR master mix, 4.4 µL (100 ng) template cDNA and 0.3 µL each of 10 µM forward and reverse primers (

The program of cycle condition was 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 2 min, and 50 cycles of (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s). The Ct values were normalized to 18S rRNA control and compared to non-targeting siRNA controls.
