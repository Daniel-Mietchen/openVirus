<p>A549 cells were grown overnight in Nunc 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides. The next day, cells were treated with individual siRNA. After 48 h knockdown, cells were infected at MOI 3, incubated 20 h, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed 4× with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 for 10 min, washed again 4× with PBS, blocked with 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h and probed with monoclonal mouse α-NS1 [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and with polyclonal rabbit α-NUMA1 (Bethyl Laboratory, A301-510A). Slides were washed 4 more times with PBS, then treated with Alexa Fluor® 546 (dilution of 1:250, Invitrogen)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, with Alexa Fluor® 488 (dilution of 1:250, Invitrogen)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen, dilution of 1:10000). Slides were washed three times with PBS, a drop of mounting media was added (Pro Gold, Invitrogen) to each spot and images obtained with a Zeiss LSM710 laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany), using 20× and 40× objectives.
