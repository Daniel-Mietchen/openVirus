<p>Cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates were initially pre-cleared with non-coupled protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) for 90 min at 4 °C. The pre-cleared lysates were clarified at 10,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 7 min. Dynabeads were washed 3× with TBST (Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20) and a mixture of anti-NS1 mAbs 3F5, 5F4 and 4E10, which recognize different NS1 epitopes [

Monoclonal α-Emprin (IgG2a), monoclonal α-SYN (IgG2b) and monoclonal α-HSA (IgG1) antibodies (gift from Dr. Wilkins, Manitoba Centre for Proteomics and Systems Biology) also were bound to Dynabeads to serve as isotype controls. Ab-coupled beads were washed 4× with TBST to remove unbound mAbs and mixed with the pre-cleared cellular fractions in a rotator overnight at 4 °C. The unbound fractions were discarded and beads were washed 4× and resuspended in TBST. The washed and resuspended bead-Ab-antigen complex represented immunoprecipitated (IP) products. Co-IPs were also performed after coupling anti-NUMA1 (Bethyl Laboratory, A301-510A), anti-PRPF19 (Bethyl Laboratory, A300-101A) and anti-UTP6 (Thermo Fisher, PA5-21716) antibodies to Dynabeads.
