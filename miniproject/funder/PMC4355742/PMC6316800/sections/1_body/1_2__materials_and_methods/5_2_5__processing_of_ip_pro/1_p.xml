<p>The IP products and beads were washed 2× with RIPA buffer, 1× with ammonium bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 0.1% NP40 and resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate buffer. 10% of the resuspended bead mixtures were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) running buffer and resolved in 4–12% gradient Novex NuPAGE Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) Gels (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) for Western blot analysis and 90% of the resuspended beads were saved at −80 °C for subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. For MS analysis, the immunoprecipitated beads were digested overnight with 1 µg of trypsin in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution at 37 °C. After tryptic digestion, equal volumes of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/Acetonitrile (ACN) (100% ACN &amp; 1% TFA) were added to the digested IP products and vortexed 10–15 min. Digested peptides were separated from beads by centrifugation at 17,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and were dried in a Savant SpeedVac vacuum dryer. Dried peptides were resuspended in 50 µL of 0.5% TFA and desalted with C18 ziptips. Eluted peptides were analyzed in an AB SCIEX (Concord, ON, Canada) Triple TOF 5600 mass spectrometer. Raw MS data were analyzed with Protein Pilot
 <sup>TM</sup> 3.0 (ABSciex, Concord, ON, Canada). The proteins were identified based on cumulative peptide numbers and scores (cut-offs of a minimum of 2 peptides with unused score ≥2.0).
