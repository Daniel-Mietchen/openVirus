<p>Human lung (A549; ATCC # CCL-185) and canine kidney (MDCK; ATCC # CCL-34) epithelial cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), respectively. Human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC-3KT; ATCC cat # CRL-4051; “HBEC”) were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in Airway Epithelial Cell Basal Medium (ATC PCS-300-030) supplemented with Bronchial Epithelial Growth kit (ATCC PCS-300-040). Influenza A virus (IAV) strains A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1) (PR8), A/WSN/1933(H1N1) (WSN), A/California/07/2009(H1N1) (pdm09), and A/New York/55/2004(H3N2) (NY55) were grown in MDCK cells by infecting at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for 48 h. Some clones were concentrated at 64,000×
