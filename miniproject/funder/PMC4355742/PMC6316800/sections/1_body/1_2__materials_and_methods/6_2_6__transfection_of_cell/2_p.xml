<p>For specific gene knockdown, larger numbers of A549 cells were transfected with individual ON-Target plus siRNAs (Dharmacon) targeting NUMA1 gene or with scrambled non-targeting control siRNA (N-Si) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Stock siRNAs and DharmaFECT
 <sup>®</sup>-1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) were diluted separately with Opti-MEM
 <sup>®</sup> I reduced serum medium (Life Technology, Waltham, MA, USA). A549 cells were transfected with siRNA every 24 h for 48 h. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were infected with IAV PR8 at MOI 0.05 or 3. Knockdown efficiencies of individual genes were checked by Western blot and IP using specific antibodies to relevant proteins.
