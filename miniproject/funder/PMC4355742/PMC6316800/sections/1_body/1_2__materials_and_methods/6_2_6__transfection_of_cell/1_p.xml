<p>For initial screening, a reverse transfection format (RTF) SMART pool siRNA library was designed targeting 107 genes and purchased in 96-well format from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA). Reverse transfection of this siRNA array was carried out according to manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, sets of siRNA plates were rehydrated with transfection reagent/DharmaFECT-1 cell culture media and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. 4 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> A549 cells were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h to allow knockdown. Cell viability was determined in one set of plates with the Roche cell proliferation reagent WST1 and another set was infected with IAV PR8 at MOI 0.05 for 43 h. Cell viabilities of PR8-infected knockdown cells were also measured at the end of infection.
