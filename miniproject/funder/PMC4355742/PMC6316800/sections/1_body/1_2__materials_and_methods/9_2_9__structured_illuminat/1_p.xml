<p>SIM was conducted according to the procedure described by Righolt et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A549 cells were grown overnight on 18 × 18 mm high performance cover glasses with restricted thickness-related tolerance, D = 0.17 mm ± 0.005 mm (Zeiss, cat # 474030-9000-000). The next day, cells were treated with individual siRNA. After 48 h knockdown, cells were infected at MOI 3, incubated 20 h, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed 4× with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 for 10 mins, washed again 4× with PBS, blocked with 3% BSA/PBS for 1 hour and probed with rabbit polyclonal α-M2 or mouse monoclonal α-M1 antibodies diluted in 3% BSA/PBS for 6 h at 4 °C. Cover glasses were then washed 4× with PBT (PBS, 3% BSA and 0.05% Tween20), treated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat α-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat α-mouse secondary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA/PBS (1:250) for 1 h, washed 4× with PBT, treated with DAPI for 5 min and mounted with Vectashield or Prolong gold (Life Technology) mounting medium. The cover glasses were sealed with nail polish. Images were taken with a Zeiss ELYRA PS1 in SIM mode equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63 ×/1.40 oil immersion objective and 2D and 3D images were processed as described [
