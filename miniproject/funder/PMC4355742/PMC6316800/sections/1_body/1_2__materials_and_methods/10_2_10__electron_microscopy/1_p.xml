<p>A549 cells were grown in P100 cell culture plates overnight and treated with individual siRNAs. At 48 h post-transfection, A549 cells were infected with PR8 at MOI 3. At 20 hpi, cells were harvested, and washed 3Ã— with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in EM grade Karnovsky fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and sent to the Histology Lab, Department of Human Anatomy and Cell Science, University of Manitoba for further processing. Images were obtained on a Philips CM10 Electron Microscope.</p>
