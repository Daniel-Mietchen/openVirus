<p>Serial 1:10 dilutions of viral stocks and experimental samples were titrated by plaque assay in MDCK cells, using a 1:1 mixture of 1.2% type 1 agarose and 2× DMEM, supplemented with 2.5 µg/mL Tosyl-L-lysyl-chloromethane hydrochloride (TLCK)-treated trypsin, as described [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Plates were incubated at 35 °C for 66 h, fixed with 2% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet to determine viral plaque forming units (PFU) per mL.
