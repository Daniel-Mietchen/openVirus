  <title>Hierarchical cluster maps of annual dengue transmission intensity in Fortaleza.</title>
  <p>Averages and ranges of parameter values by year and pattern are presented in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006990.s002">S2 Table</xref>. Patterns were ordered low-high by annual case rates. Highest level patterns, particularly during lower-transmission years (patterns 6 and 7 in 2013 and 2015; pattern 4 in 2014), classify 
   <italic>bairros</italic> with outlying case rates but shorter transmission intervals. Middle ranked patterns (patterns 2 and 3 in 2011; pattern 3 in 2012; pattern 5 in 2013 and 2015) were characterized by more populous 
   <italic>bairros</italic> with longer intervals with continuous transmission, typically exceeding 40 weeks annually, and higher total case counts.
