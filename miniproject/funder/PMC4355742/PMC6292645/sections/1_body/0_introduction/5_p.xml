<p>This cyclical, seasonal, and context-dependent nature of urban dengue transmission present challenges for targeting control, and a better understanding of possible differences in drivers of transmission within and between interepidemic and epidemic years is needed. This study addresses this need, and aims to assess the role of structural, environmental, and human factors in the spatial and temporal distribution of reported dengue cases in Fortaleza, the 5
 <sup>th</sup> largest city in Brazil. The analysis considers five consecutive years (2011 to 2015), capturing both epidemic and interepidemic transmission. Observing the ubiquity of reported dengue infections in Fortaleza during epidemic months of peak transmission, we hypothesize that ecological correlates of infection differ within and between years according to the scale of transmission (epidemic vs. interepidemic) and the season (low vs. high precipitation). If factors associated with dengue incidence in Fortaleza during periods of low transmission are different than those that characterize incidence during epidemic peaks, vector control efforts may inadvertently neglect issues that sustain local viremic circulation between epidemics. Since suppression of interepidemic transmission may be a means to forestall or avert epidemics, identifying conditions that are associated with incidence during each stage of the epidemic cycle represents much needed evidence to inform dengue prevention and control.
