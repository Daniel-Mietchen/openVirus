<p>The spatial distribution of SP types varied across the city (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006990.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows their location in 2015), and around 3,000 SP sites were inspected annually, on average, during the study period. The largest number of SP inspected by surveillance agents was 3,522 in 2014, the majority being tire repair shops and garages (Tires category in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Considering all types of SPs, the highest infestation indices were registered in 2011 (8.38%) and 2015 (8.91%) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There were large differences between infestation by site types: on average, sites in the “Others” category registered the highest monthly infestation indices, while those under the tire category had the lowest (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). SP infestation exceeded household infestation (LIRAa/LIA), on average, and was substantially more variable at the 
 <italic>bairro</italic> level. The monthly areal proportion of a 
 <italic>bairro</italic> within 150 meters of a positive SP varied by type of site, reflecting differences in SP prevalence and infestation rates by class. On average, about 5% of 
 <italic>bairro</italic> area was within 150-meter radius of a positive SP citywide, and more than half of this exposure was attributable to sites in the construction and tire categories.
