<p>Temperature in Fortaleza did not vary substantially over the course of our five year study period, but daily temperature averages were marginally higher earlier in the year; the lowest daily temperature average was 22.2 degrees on January 10, 2011 and the highest daily average was 29.4, on March 3, 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006990.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In contrast, precipitation differed seasonally, annually, and between 
 <italic>bairros</italic>. At least one 
 <italic>bairro</italic> registered no precipitation during 76% of our study period (197 weeks), and in 37% (96 weeks) no precipitation occurred anywhere in the city. The highest weekly sum precipitation (226mm) was recorded in the second week of March 2015, and precipitation exceeding 83mm was recorded during 10% of all 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-weeks. The largest 
 <italic>bairro</italic> differential in weekly precipitation was 124.2mm, with an average weekly differential of 16.2mm. Average deviation from monthly averages, measured at the 
 <italic>bairro</italic> level, was highest in February 2011, when average 
 <italic>bairro</italic> precipitation exceeded five-year averages for that month by nearly 240mm. This trend continued for the following three months (with positive deviations exceeding 100mm in March, April, and May), amidst the 2011 epidemic. In comparison, citywide averages during spring months of interepidemic years 2013 and 2014 were starkly lower than five-year averages (April 2013 = -137mm, and March 2014 = -101mm).
