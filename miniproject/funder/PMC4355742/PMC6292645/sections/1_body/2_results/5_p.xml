<p>This trend continued in subsequent years, when outlying transmission was either largely isolated (2014) or concentrated (2015) in 
 <italic>bairros</italic> of the southern periphery. Confirmed incidence was negligible in 112 
 <italic>bairros</italic> of pattern 1 in 2014, yet low level residual dengue circulation is evident in six 
 <italic>bairros</italic> of patterns 2 and 3 (Messejana, Jangurussu, Barroso, Maraponga, Bom Jardim, and Mondubim), where cases were confirmed for 38.5 and 44.5/52 weeks, on average. The scale of annual transmission in these six 
 <italic>bairros</italic> is comparable to pattern 1 
 <italic>bairros</italic> in 2011, 2012, and 2015, but occurred over much longer intervals (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006990.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Confirmed dengue incidence in three of these bairros (Messejana, Jangurussu, and Barroso) increased to epidemic levels in 2015 (identifiable in 2015 patterns 4 and 5), inflating case rates for the city as a whole.
