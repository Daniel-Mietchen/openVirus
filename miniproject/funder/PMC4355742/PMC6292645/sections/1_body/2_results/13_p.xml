<p>Models 4 and 5 (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) present results stratified by monthly transmission intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006990.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Though homicides were associated with dengue rates in all models, an additional 10 homicides per 100,000 was associated with a 7.3% higher incidence rate during high transmission months (Model 4), and 7.6% higher rate during epidemic years (Model 2), exceeding increases of 4.6% and 4.4% estimated for periods of lower transmission (Models 3 and 5). Income was a statistically significant protective correlate during both high and low transmission months (Models 4 and 5), and–though not statistically significant when corrected for multiple testing–models estimated stronger associations between regular garbage collection and dengue incidence during late-season months of residual transmission (Model 5). Finally, literacy was a statistically significant 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-level correlate of dengue incidence rates during low months (Model 5), but with divergent effects: male literacy was associated with increased dengue incidence rates, while female literacy was correlated with lower rates. The strongest associations between proximity to infested SPs and dengue incidence related to scrapyards and tire sites within both seasonal strata (Models 4 and 5); while the estimated effects were larger during residual months (Model 5), the corrected associations were not statistically significant. Movement from satisfactory (&lt;1% property infestation) to alert (1–3.9%) levels of larval infestation, as measured by cross-sectional LIRA and LIA surveys conducted in January, was a statistically significant correlate of incidence in 
 <italic>bairros</italic> across epidemic years (Model 2), but not when the sample was isolated to peak months (Model 4). Temperatures were slightly lower and more variable, on average, during epidemic years (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); nevertheless, a negative correlation between variability and incidence during months of seasonal transmission (Model 4) suggests lower temperature variance during peak months of epidemic years relative to interepidemic years.
