<p>With respect to SPs, a 1% increase in areal exposure to tires SP sites was associated with 3.3% increased dengue incidence during epidemic years (Model 2). Conversely, though unit increases in exposure to construction, recycling, scrapyard, and tire sites were all positively correlated with dengue rates during interepidemic years, none were statistically significant when corrected for multiple testing (Model 3). Unlike every other model, the continuous variable for monthly sum precipitation (mm) was not positively associated with incidence over the course of interepidemic years in our sample, reflecting the absence of typical dengue seasonality during those years.</p>
