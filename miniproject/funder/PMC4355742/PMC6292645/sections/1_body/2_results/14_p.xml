<p>Models 6, 7, and 8 are stratified by precipitation intensity and presented in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. Consistent with results for low-transmission months (Model 5), literacy and garbage collection were correlates of dengue incidence only during months with minimal rainfall (Model 6). Correlation between dengue incidence and income peaked during “transition” precipitation strata (Model 7)–where R$ 1,000 increases in income were associated with an 11% decrease in dengue incidence rates–but the effect was nearly halved during periods of high precipitation (Model 8). Relative to dry months (Model 6), during wetter months (Models 7 &amp; 8) the magnitude of the association with homicides doubled and a negative association with population density increased in magnitude. Though a relationship between tires SP sites and dengue incidence was observed during low precipitation months (Model 6), associations between dengue incidence and SP proximity were strongest amidst intermediate precipitation (Model 7), when marginal increases in the areal proportion for tire and scrapyard sites were associated with over 4% increased incidence rates. The estimated effect for these SP types declined to 2.9% and 1.1%, respectively, during high precipitation periods (Model 8). While temperature variability was a strong predictor of monthly dengue incidence rates during periods with minimal precipitation (Model 6), it registered a null association during wetter months (Model 8).
