<p>In the analysis of all 7,140 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-months (Model 1, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), amongst socio-ecological variables only 
 <italic>bairro</italic> homicide rates was a statistically significant correlate of dengue incidence rates: on average, increases in annual household income by R$1,000 were accompanied by an 8% decrease in dengue incidence rates, while an additional ten homicides per 100,000 people was associated with a 6% increase. Over the entire study period, a 1% increase in the areal proportion of a 
 <italic>bairro</italic> within 150 meters of a SP in the tires class was associated with 3% increases in 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-month dengue incidence rates. Indicator variables of epidemic year, peak transmission season, and of precipitation intensity were statistically significant, supporting stratified analyses.
