Results indicate that some covariates were strongly associated with dengue incidence rates during periods of low (Models 3 and 5), but not high (Models 2 and 4) transmission. Though income was not a statistically significant correlate of dengue incidence during epidemic years (Model 2), during years of interepidemic transmission a R$1,000 increase in average annual

Further, while exhibiting a negative, protective effect in all strata, the percentage of properties with regular garbage collection was only statistically significant during interepidemic years (Model 3).
