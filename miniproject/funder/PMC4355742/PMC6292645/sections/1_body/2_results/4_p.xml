<p>The 2012 epidemic and 2013 interepidemic years featured lower levels of transmission overall and fewer outlying 
 <italic>bairros</italic>, decreasing clustering distances between high and low patterns. As a result, clustering distinguished additional patterns at both high and low scales of transmission. Similar to the 2011 epidemic, transmission during the 2012 epidemic was spatially diffuse, with coastal, affluent 
 <italic>bairros</italic> grouped amongst peripheral communities in pattern 2. In contrast, in 2013 northeastern coastal 
 <italic>bairros</italic> were almost exclusively grouped in pattern 1 (
