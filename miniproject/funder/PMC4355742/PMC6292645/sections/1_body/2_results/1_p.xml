<p>Between 2011 and 2015, 130,430 dengue cases were reported in Fortaleza. In total, 98,339 cases were confirmed by clinical/epidemiological or lab criteria and had sufficient information to be geocoded to

 <italic>bairro</italic> exceeded 3,500 cases per 100,000 people in January 2011, April 2011, and June 2012. In total 26.5% (1,891 of 7,140) of 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-months did not register a case; 75.2% of
