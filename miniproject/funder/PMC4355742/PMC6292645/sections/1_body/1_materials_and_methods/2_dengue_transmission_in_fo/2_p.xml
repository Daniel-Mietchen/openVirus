<p>Following an absence of over fifty years, cases of DENV1 were first recorded in Fortaleza in 1986. DENV1 was the only serotype identified in the city until 1994, when DENV2 was associated with an epidemic of nearly 30,000 cases. DENV1 and DENV2 predominated until 2002, when DENV3 was first observed in the city. While reported annual incidence between 1994 and 2008 did not exceed 20,000 cases, recent epidemics of DENV2 (2008), DENV1 (2011) and allochthonous DENV4 (2012) all exceeded 34,000 reported cases [
