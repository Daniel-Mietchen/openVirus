<p>We defined the outcome variable as the monthly case incidence rate (dengue cases per 100,000 people) by 
 <italic>bairro</italic>, observed from January 2011 to December 2015, and used a zero-inflated negative binomial longitudinal regression model (hereafter, longitudinal model). The zero-inflated negative binomial model accounts for extra-variation (overdispersion) in the data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and was considered as an alternative to the negative binomial hurdle model given the likelihood that seasonally inflated zeros are attributable to both true changes in ecological dynamics that depress transmission, as well as reduced surveillance or misclassification during low seasons and interepidemic years [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The final model was selected based on comparison of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values for alternative distributions, including negative binomial, poisson, and zero-inflated poisson. We chose longitudinal models because our data are longitudinal at the 
 <italic>bairro</italic> level, and used Huber-White standard errors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Climatological and ecological independent variables–selected based on previously identified associations with 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne disease transmission and summarized by 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-month–included: mean household size; percentage of households with access to electricity; percentage of households with access to piped water; percentage of households with access to regular garbage collection; percentage of households connected to sewage network; male literacy rate; female literacy rate; household income; population density; proportion of a 
 <italic>bairro</italic> classified as a subnormal settlement; homicide rate; separate lagged strategic point proximity variables for each of the following types: construction, material fabrication, recyclables, scrapyard, tires, and others; lagged total infestation index for all SP categories combined; categories of infestation (LIA and LIRAa); lagged total precipitation (mm) and deviation from average precipitation (mm); and standard deviation of daily temperature averages (degrees Celsius). The AIC was used to select the final temperature covariate, and likelihood ratio test statistics (chi-square) were used to compare the full model with naïve intercept-only models, indicating that the full model was a better fit (p&lt;0.001) for all analyses.
