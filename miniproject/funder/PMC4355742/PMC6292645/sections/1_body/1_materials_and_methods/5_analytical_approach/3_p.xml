<p>Lastly, to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of epidemic intensity between years we used average linkage hierarchical clustering with an Euclidean distance dissimilarity measure, based on eight metrics, standardized as z-scores, reflecting the duration and burden of dengue incidence in a 
 <italic>bairro</italic>. The number of clusters selected for each year was determined with reference to the gap statistic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], reflecting the difference of within-cluster variability (as the within-cluster sum of squares around cluster means) at each number of 
 <italic>k</italic> clusters in the observed data from its expectation in a null reference distribution computed from repeated sampling using the package factoextra [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Values of the gap statistic indicate the strength of clustering at each quantity of clusters considered (i.e. sequential values 
 <italic>k</italic>). Maxima of the gap statistic may be local (in comparison to their immediate neighboring values 
 <italic>k</italic>) or global (in comparison to all possible or considered levels 
 <italic>k</italic>), and a plateau in the statistic indicates the negligible added value of additional partitions between clustering groups [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. We considered between 3–7 clusters for each year to preserve interpretative value, prioritizing global maxima of the gap statistic (for years 2012, 2013, 2015 –
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006990.s004">S1 Fig</xref>), or local maxima that distinguish between well-separated groups, where further divisions between clusters in the considered range would exclusively partition single-
 <italic>bairro</italic> clusters (2011). Though the gap statistic first plateaued at three clusters in 2014, we partitioned the middle cluster–with high within-cluster variability along the first principal component of our clustering parameters–to distinguish two clusters, each with low internal variability along that axis (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006990.s005">S2 Fig</xref>, clusters II and III). In addition to plots of the first two principal components of clustering parameters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006990.s005">S2 Fig</xref>), grouping decisions considered potential informational value to surveillance operations. After grouping, clusters were ordered by the average full-year case rate of clustered units. Clustering analysis and mapping were conducted with R version 3.3.2 [
