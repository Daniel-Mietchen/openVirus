<p>Considering the cyclical and seasonal patterns of dengue transmission, we run eight temporally stratified models. Model 1 contains all 7,140 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-months for which data were collected. Models 2 and 3 distinguish between epidemic (2011, 2012, and 2015) and interepidemic (2013, 2014) years. Models 4 and 5 stratify the analysis by transmission intensity, while Models 6, 7, and 8 are stratified by the intensity of precipitation (
