<p>Annual homicide counts by 
 <italic>bairro</italic> were collected from the Mortality Information System (
 <italic>Sistema de Informações de Mortalidade</italic>, SIM), and used to calculate a homicide rate per 10,000 people. It is established that interpersonal violence can deter and disrupt provision of human services by introducing risk for individuals providing and receiving health-related services [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. As such, we hypothesized that 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-level homicide rates are associated with spatial heterogeneity in access to health and vector control services, and with higher dengue transmission.
