<p>We acquired rainfall data from the Climate Hazards Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. CHIRPS has a spatial resolution of 0.05Â°, thus Fortaleza was covered by 15 pixels. Daily precipitation estimates were aggregated to weeks, and spatially joined to 
 <italic>bairros</italic>. Efforts to associate precipitation volume with dengue incidence must incorporate a time lag to adjust for vector development. While lags of zero [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], one [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and two months [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] were reported, the mechanistic role of precipitation in dengue transmission can be confounded by water storage behavior [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and with the potential for heavy rains to wash out exposed oviposition sites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. For the purposes of our analysis, precipitation was included as a continuous variable (monthly sum in millimeters), and lagged by two weeks, consistent with the lag used with the SP data. To assess potential effects of rainfall anomalies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] during the period, we calculated the average monthly rainfall by 
 <italic>bairro</italic> over the five years of study and computed the deviation of each 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-month from its five year average. This variable was included in all models, except those stratified by monthly precipitation volume.
