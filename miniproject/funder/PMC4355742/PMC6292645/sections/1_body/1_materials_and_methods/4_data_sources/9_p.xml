<p>We created two 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-level variables for each SP category: (i) positivity, defined as the proportion of successfully visited sites that were registered as positive for larvae/pupae; and (ii) proximity, defined as the areal proportion of the 
 <italic>bairro</italic> that falls within a 150-meter buffer area around a positive strategic point. We selected the buffer size using two criteria: (i) expected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito flight distance in an urban setting [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; and (ii) buffer size used by the Brazilian Ministry of Health to define the transmission block area around identified vector oviposition sites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. For the positivity variable, 
 <italic>bairros</italic> without an SP visit during an inspection cycle were coded as missing with a missingness indicator variable. The proximity variable was calculated in ArcGIS. To properly associate the presence of mosquito larvae/pupae with monthly dengue virus transmission, SP-related covariates were lagged by a 15-day cycle, as shown in
