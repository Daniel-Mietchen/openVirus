<p>We also used data from surveillance of strategic points (SP)–locations identified by the municipality as higher risk for harboring 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> breeding sites–to assess the epidemiological relevance of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> infestation at targeted non-residential locations. In Brazil, SP are a central component of national directives for vector control to prevent dengue. Municipal vector control operations agents are tasked with creating a roster of sites likely to be susceptible to mosquito oviposition and inspecting those sites every 15 days. These operations are coordinated locally, such that each municipality is responsible for its own roster of strategic points [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Vector control teams inspect SPs in 15-day cycles and code the visit as positive or negative for the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae or pupae. Between 2011 and 2015, surveillance agents identified 82 types of SPs in Fortaleza; we aggregated those into six categories: construction, industrial fabrication, recyclable processing, scrapyards, sites associated with tire storage–such as tire repair shops and garages, and an “other” category, which included sites associated with vacant lots, public and private facilities (e.g. hospitals and schools), husbandry (e.g. cattle pens, 
 <italic>vacarias</italic>), private residences, outdoor locations (e.g. cemeteries), and general commercial properties.
