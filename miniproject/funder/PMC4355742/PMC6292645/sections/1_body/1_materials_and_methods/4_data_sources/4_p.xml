<p>We obtained 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-level socio-ecological data from the 2010 Demographic Census [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These include: mean number of inhabitants per household; percent of households connected to electricity, piped water, sewage, and regular garbage collection; population density; average income per household in 
 <italic>Reais</italic> (R$); and literacy rates for men and women separately. Two new 
 <italic>bairros</italic> were created after 2010 (both originated from larger 
 <italic>bairros</italic> split into two). In those cases, socio-ecological data for the original 
 <italic>bairro</italic> in 2010 was extended to the new 
 <italic>bairros</italic>.
