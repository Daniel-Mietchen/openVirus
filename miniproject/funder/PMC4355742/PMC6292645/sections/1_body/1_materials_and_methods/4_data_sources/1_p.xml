<p>This study assembled data from multiple sources. Dengue cases recorded in Fortaleza between 2011 and 2015 were acquired from Brazil’s Notifiable Diseases Information System (
 <italic>Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação</italic>, SINAN) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. By law, suspected dengue cases are reported by clinicians and health professionals to SINAN within 24 hours of initial diagnosis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Suspected dengue cases include all episodes of fever lasting two to seven days which are accompanied by at least two symptoms including nausea, vomiting, positive tourniquet test (i.e. capillary fragility test), petechiae, leukopenia, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, or rash; and exposure to areas with active dengue transmission or presence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> during the prior fourteen days [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Within 60 days of reporting, suspected cases are coded by the Municipal Health Secretariat as discarded/inconclusive (when not all criteria for a suspect case, as described above, was met), or coded as confirmed dengue according to: (i) laboratory analysis–based on results of IgM serology (ELISA), NS1, viral isolation, RT-PCR, or postmortem immunohistochemistry; or (ii) clinical/epidemiological criteria–when a laboratory test was not performed, but all criteria were met [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The MoH recommends that as many cases as possible should be confirmed by laboratory analysis, except in epidemic periods, when about 10% of laboratory confirmation is consired to be sufficient to characterize the epidemiological situation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this study we considered only confirmed dengue cases.
