<p>We used data from years 2011 to 2015 to capture both the cyclical and seasonal patterns of dengue transmission: 2011, 2012, and 2015 were considered epidemic years, and 2013, and 2014 were interepidemic years. Case home addresses were geocoded and then aggregated to the 
 <italic>bairro</italic>-level. Sufficient information to geocode cases to 
 <italic>bairros</italic> was available for 97.5% of confirmed cases in 2011, 77.5% in 2012, 98.1% in 2013, 95.4% in 2014, and 77.7% in 2015. Temporally, cases had the exact date of first symptoms, which allowed aggregation to epidemiological weeks and to months. All data analyzed were anonymized.
