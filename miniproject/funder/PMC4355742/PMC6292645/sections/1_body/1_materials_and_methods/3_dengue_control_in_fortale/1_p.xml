Epidemiological surveillance and vector control departments carry out three to four sampled entomological surveys annually to estimate property infestation, and visit targeted surveillance sites (called strategic points) every fifteen days. In parallel with epidemiological surveillance, Vector Control Program agents conduct community canvassing operations throughout the year to identify and destroy breeding sites, chemically treat potential breeding sites that cannot be destroyed (e.g. elevated water tanks and cisterns), and implement public information campaigns to promote community-based vector control [
