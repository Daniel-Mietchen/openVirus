<p>With regard to 
 <italic>bairro</italic> structural factors, subnormal settlements were not associated with dengue transmission. This may reflect data limitations. Classification of a census tract as AS does not characterize the degree of subnormality, such as the proportion of houses that are subnormal, or the nature of the AS that predominates in a tract. Persistent negative correlations between population density and dengue incidence may reflect the dengue burden in Fortaleza’s peripheral 
 <italic>bairros</italic>–where large expanses without dense development and disconnected from proper urban planning are common (e.g. Prefeito José Walter)–and lower incidence rates in densely populated coastal bairros, whether affluent (e.g. Meireles) or not (e.g. Pirambu).
