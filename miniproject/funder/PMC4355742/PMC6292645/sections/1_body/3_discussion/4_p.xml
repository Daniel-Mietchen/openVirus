<p>Further, many of the socioeconomic, structural, and environmental factors expected to be associated with dengue transmission showed varied significance according to transmission and precipitation intensity. Among the factors related to access to public services, regular garbage collection was the most consistent correlate of dengue incidence, consistent with previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. However, we also show that the link is most pronounced during low transmission and low precipitation periods. Empty lots filled with abandoned trash–as well as discarded materials such as cans, plastic bottles, and debris commonly observed in yards of houses and along sidewalks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]–could preserve desiccation-resistant eggs, which hatch following intermittent late-season rains. Thus, closer property surveillance and scrutiny of empty lots may be an important component of targeted vector control during interepidemic periods to prevent the escalation to epidemic-scale transmission.
