<p>This study has some limitations. First, as any analysis that uses administrative records, data refer to passive surveillance, and do not include asymptomatic infections and/or mild cases that do not trigger search for care [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. This issue may be qualitatively dependent on the intensity of transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and communities with access to private healthcare providers may underreport at greater rates than low-income 
 <italic>bairros</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Second, given the circulation of ZIKV in Fortaleza in 2015, the fact that about 20% of cases were lab confirmed in 2015, and the lack of serological tests with high specificity, we expect that some dengue cases reported that year were, in fact, ZIKV infections. Yet, since both diseases are 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne, they are subject to the same socio-ecological factors, and thus their co-circulation should not detract from our conclusions. Third, some variables may not properly capture access and behavior. For example, while we might have expected associations between dengue and access to piped water during dry seasons (as a result of increases in water storage behavior), an ethnographic study in Fortaleza suggested that potable water storage is pervasive [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], such that 
 <italic>bairros</italic>-scale statistics on access to piped water may not be adequate to capture the phenomenon. Similarly, including socio-demographic covariates such as income, access to municipal services, interpersonal violence, and prevalence of subnormal agglomerations at the 
 <italic>bairro</italic> level may not satisfactorily control for socio-economic factors expected to be associated with dengue incidence. As a result, in addition to their role as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> breeding sites, the prevalence of strategic points–such as scrapyards and tire shops–in a 
 <italic>bairro</italic> may be a proxy for unobserved differences that are relevant to the transmission cycle. Fourth, we only have access to one weather station for temperature data; yet, considering the low variability in temperature observed in Fortaleza, we do not expect this to be a major limitation. Lastly, the entomological surveillance data may only be a partial depiction of the scale of infestation as a result of barriers that vector surveillance agents face when conducting their inspection. Since we are using data from a targeted surveillance program, we assume that some areas may be prioritized because of their known high risk for mosquito breeding.
