<p>Consistent and large correlations between dengue incidence and interpersonal violence, which was also observed for tuberculosis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], exemplify the difficulty of implementing effective population health measures in expansive cities such as Fortaleza, as well as the importance of involving different governmental sectors to address these challenges. In contrast to many other exposures, homicides were more strongly associated with dengue rates during epidemics and high transmission months. When violence deters actors tasked with providing municipal services it limits access to health services and implementation of responsive vector control [
