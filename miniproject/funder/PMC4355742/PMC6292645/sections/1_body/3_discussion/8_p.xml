<p>Though we did not analyze serological data, the Fortaleza Municipal Health Secretariat conducts limited sampling to monitor the introduction of allochthonous serotypes. All four serotypes circulated in Fortaleza between 2011–2015, but DENV1 and DENV4 predominated. DENV1 was reintroduced in 2011 after 10 years, and was the primary serotype in 2011, 2014 and 2015. DENV4 was first introduced in 2012, and was responsible for the majority of cases in 2012 and 2013. In all years, the predominant serotype was present in more than 90% of serological samples, indicating that spatial transmission dynamics may be driven by the degree of population susceptibility throughout Fortaleza’s neighborhoods. As a result of diminished population susceptibility, it is unlikely that DENV1 (which caused an epidemic in 2011) was solely responsible for the estimated disease burden in 2015. The Fortaleza Health Secretariat has found that a significant number of Zika virus (ZIKV) cases were misclassified as dengue in 2015, and that DENV1 and ZIKV co-circulated. Though imported cases of chikungunya (CHIKV) were detected by the surveillance of the City of Fortaleza in 2014, autochthonous cases were not confirmed until December 2015. Therefore, the circulation of ZIKV in 2015 offers one possible explanation for the epidemiological curve observed for that year. The epidemic peak in 2015 was lower than in 2011 and 2012, and incidence in 2015 extended into non-seasonal months at a scale that is more characteristic of interepidemic years (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is possible that the peak of 2015 transmission is attributable to seasonal misdiagnosis of ZIKV and CHIKV cases, in which protracted incidence would be characteristic of interepidemic dengue virus transmission in Fortaleza. Alternatively, it is possible that 2015 did have seasonal epidemic dengue transmission, and that protracted non-seasonal transmission is attributable to Zika misdiagnosis.
