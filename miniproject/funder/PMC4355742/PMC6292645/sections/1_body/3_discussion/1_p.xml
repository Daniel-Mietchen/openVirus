<p>This study analyzed five years of dengue incidence at fine spatial and temporal scales. One of the most important findings was the distinct seasonal pattern between interepidemic and epidemic years. Our results indicate that dengue epidemiological curves differed according to the intensity of annual transmission: while the pattern of transmission during epidemic years conforms to widely documented seasonality, during non-epidemic years low-level transmission persisted into climatologically inhospitable conditions. Sustained transmission after June could result from relaxed control activity following a high season with minimal transmission. Such lapses during interepidemic periods are likely to compound entomological and epidemiological challenges for the next annual cycle, and call for sustained vector control activities regardless of transmission intensity.

Socio-ecological indicators of poverty and deprivation were correlated with higher

 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In fact, the association between cross-sectional entomological surveys (LIRAa/LIA) and incidence during epidemic years was dependent upon the inclusion of the precipitation deviation covariate in the model, reinforcing the need for closer scrutiny of those surveys. These findings have direct programmatic implications, identifing places and stages of the epidemic cycle when targeted community interventions can be prioritized by the Fortaleza Municipal Health Secretariat.
