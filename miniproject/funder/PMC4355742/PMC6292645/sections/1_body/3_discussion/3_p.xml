<p>Infestation of SPs was spatially and temporally associated with dengue incidence in Fortaleza, and the magnitude of the associations differed by SP type and according to the scale of transmission and precipitation. Specifically, scrapyards and sites associated with tire collection and storage–such as repair shops and garages–showed associations with dengue incidence during periods of both interepidemic and epidemic transmission. The proportion of a 
 <italic>bairro</italic> proximate to sites known for storing tires was a strong and reliable correlate of dengue incidence within nearly all strata, but the magnitude of the coefficient was largest during transitional precipitation regimes (when rainfall was neither sparse nor extreme) and dry seasons. Further, after adjustment for FDR, scrapyards registered statistically significant correlations with dengue incidence rates during the same intermediate rainfall strata. These results, combined with the new findings regarding the seasonal pattern of dengue transmission in interepidemic years, strongly suggest that enhanced surveillance should be sustained during low transmission periods, in both epidemic and interepidemic years. The Municipal Health Secretariat could characterize scrapyards and tire repair shops as “high risk” strategic points; such a classification could entail more frequent and thorough surveillance proportional to the physical size of the site, and to the number of potential oviposition habitats. An enhanced program would also impose strict and transparent consequences for sustained infestation at these locations (such as revocation of licenses or more effective fine enforcement), and where operators exhibit disregard for vector control protocol during successive visits.
