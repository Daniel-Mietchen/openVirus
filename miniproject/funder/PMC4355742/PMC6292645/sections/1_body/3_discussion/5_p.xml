<p>With regard to income, negative [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] and null [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] associations between poverty and dengue incidence have been reported for Fortaleza. In contrast, with the exception of the epidemic year (Model 2) and high precipitation (Model 8) models, when incidence was shown to be more widely dispersed throughout the city, our results indicate a persistent concentration of dengue cases in lower income 
 <italic>bairros</italic>. The association is strongest during periods of intermediate precipitation (Model 7), where a unit increase in 
 <italic>bairro</italic> average household income (equal to one half standard deviation) is associated with 11% decrease in dengue incidence. The associations with income were highly statistically significant during months of high and low transmission (Models 4 &amp; 5), but not in the combined dataset (Model 1), demonstrating the importance of stratifying models by transmission scale. Nonetheless, these results need to be interpreted with caution: health care provided by the private sector is largely underreported in SINAN, despite the fact that notification is mandatory [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In Fortaleza, approximately 30% of the population uses private health services, and in more affluent 
 <italic>bairros</italic> this proportion reaches 85%. While the results observed may reflect underreporting of care provided to higher income populations, when stratified annually (Models 2 &amp; 3) correlations with poverty were isolated to non-epidemic years, suggesting that changing dengue transmission dynamics at different stages of the interannual epidemic cycle also underly this association.
