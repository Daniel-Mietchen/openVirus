<p>This study has many strengths. First, data are drawn from multiple years, permitting analysis of interepidemic and epidemic transmission patterns, with and without typical patterns of dengue seasonality. Second, by using temperature and rainfall information, seasonality by year could be properly characterized, accounting for possible weather anomalies. Third, the analysis combined entomological surveys with socio-ecological and climatological data to provide a comprehensive assessment of transmission patterns and correlates. Lastly, the study incorporates routine cross-sectional surveillance surveys of immature forms (considered to be a proxy of the concentration of dengue cases in an urban landscape).</p>
