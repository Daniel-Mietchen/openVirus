<p>We developed a simulation model with four demes in order to evaluate the ability of BEAST2 to identify and estimate birth rates, migration rates, and transmission risk ratios. This model includes two types of hosts, with low and high transmission risk. Additionally, each type of host progresses through two stages of infection, where the first stage is short but has higher transmission rate. The four demes are denoted
