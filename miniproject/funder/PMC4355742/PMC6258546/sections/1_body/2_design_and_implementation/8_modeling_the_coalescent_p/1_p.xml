<p>The coalescent likelihood is based on the conditional density of a genealogy given epidemic and demographic parameters. In BEAST2, the coalescent likelihood is used in tandem with evolutionary models that provide the probability density of a genealogy given a genetic sequence alignment and evolutionary parameters. But the coalescent likelihood can also be used if a time-scaled phylogeny has been estimated independently.</p>
