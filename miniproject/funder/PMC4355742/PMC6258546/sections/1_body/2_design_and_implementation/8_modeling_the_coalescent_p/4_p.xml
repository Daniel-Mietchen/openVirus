<p>In the PhyDyn package, we have developed likelihood approximations based on 
 <italic>QL</italic> which better account for correlation between lineages. These models, denoted 
 <italic>PL1</italic> and 
 <italic>PL2</italic>, work by solving a system of differential equations for each lineage while including terms similar to those in the 
 <italic>QL</italic> model that account for disparate coalescent rates between demes. While these models are demonstrably more accurate in simulation studies, they require more computation. All three likelihood approximations are provided in the PhyDyn package. The new 
 <italic>PL2</italic> model is the suggested default model choice, however the 
 <italic>QL</italic> model may be preferred for some large datasets or when fitting complex models due to computational advantages. The new models are derived in
