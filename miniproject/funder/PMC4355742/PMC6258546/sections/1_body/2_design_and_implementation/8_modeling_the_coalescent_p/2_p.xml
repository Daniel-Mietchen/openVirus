<p>Various approximations have been developed for computing the density of a genealogy conditional on a complex demographic history. These differ by the extent to which they account for correlation between co-existing lineages in the genealogy, the extent to which they account for finite size of the population, and the extent to which they account for differences in coalescent rates in different demes. There is a speed/bias tradeoff between these approximations, and consequently 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> makes several model variations available. The choice of likelihood approximation depends on time and computational resources available, sample size, and model complexity. Three likelihood approximations are described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006546.s001">S1 Text</xref>, and we derive a new approximation which has shown greater accuracy in some situations.
