 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the following sections, we give examples of simple compartmental models related to infectious diease dynamics and show how these models can be defined within this framework and code samples are also provided online. We provide examples of models fitted to data from seasonal human Influenza virus and Ebola virus as well as a simulation study.
