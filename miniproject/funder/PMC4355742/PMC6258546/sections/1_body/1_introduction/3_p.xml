<p>The 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> BEAST2 package provides new functionality to the BEAST2 phylogenetics platform by implementing a much more complex family of structured coalescent models. In a general compartmental model, neither the effective population size nor migration rate between demes need be constant, and in more general frameworks, coalescence is also allowed between lineages occupying different demes. The package includes a flexible markup language for defining compartmental models within the BEAST2 XML. This includes common mathematical functions making it simple to develop models which incorporate seasonality or which deviate from the simplistic mass-action premise of basic SIR models. Models defined with this special syntax can be directly incorporated into BEAST2 XML files for easily reproducing and modifying analyses. The 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> model markup language supports vectorised parameters (e.g. an array of transmission rates or population sizes) and simple conditional logic statements, so that epidemic dynamics can change in a discrete fashion, such as from year to year or in response to a public-health intervention. Commonly used phylogeographic models based on the structured coalescent are a special case of the general compartmental models implemented in the 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> package, and extensions to the basic phylogeographic model can be implemented, such as by allowing effective population size to vary through time in each deme according to a mechanistic model.
