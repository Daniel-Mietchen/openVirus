<p>We have demonstrated the utility of this framework using data from Influenza and Ebola virus epidemics in humans, finding epidemic parameters and epidemic trajectories consistent with other surveillance data. In both of these examples, simple structured models were fitted, but notably without using any categorical metadata associated with sampled sequences. This demonstrates potential advantages of structured coalescent modeling even in the absence of informative metadata. In the case of human Influenza A virus, the fitted model included a deme which accounted for evolution in the unsampled global influenza reservoir, which allowed estimation of epidemic parameters within the smaller sub-region which was intensively sampled. The use of a parametric mass-action model allowed 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> to correctly detect the time of epidemic peak and epidemic decline, whereas non-parametric skyline methods did not detect epidemic decline in this case. And in the application to the Ebola virus epidemic in Western Africa, models included un-sampled ‘exposed’ categories which accounted for realistic progression of disease among patients, as well as a ‘super-spreading’ compartment which accounted for over-dispersion in the number of transmissions per infected case.
