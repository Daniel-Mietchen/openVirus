 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> package greatly expands the range of epidemiological, ecological, and phylogeographic models that can be fitted within the BEAST2 Bayesian phylogenetics framework. Extensions enabled by this package include models with parametric seasonal forcing, non-constant parametric migration or coalescent rates between demes, state-dependent migration or coalescent rates, and discrete changes in migration or coalescent rates in response to perturbation of the system (e.g. a public health intervention). The package also provides a means of utilizing non-geographic categorical metadata which is usually not considered in phylodynamic analyses, such as clinical or demographic attributes of patients in a viral phylodynamics application [
