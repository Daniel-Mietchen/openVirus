<p>In developing 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic>, the focus has been on developing a highly flexible framework which is also computationally tractable for moderate sample sizes and model complexity. But flexibility and computational efficiency has come at the cost of some realism, notably in the deterministic nature of the models included in this framework. Future extensions may utilize stochastic epidemic models such as those described by [
