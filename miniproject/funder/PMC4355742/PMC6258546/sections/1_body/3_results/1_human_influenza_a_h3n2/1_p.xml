<p>The seasonal influenza SIR model which accounts for importations from the global reservoir was applied to 102 HA/H3N2 sequences collected from New York state during the 2004-2005 flu season. These data were previously analyzed using non-parametric models by [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006546.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the estimated posterior effective number of infections over the course of the influenza season, and the time of peak prevalence is correctly identified around the end of 2004. We also compared the model-based estimates to estimates generated in BEAST2 using a conventional non-parametric Bayesian skyline model which is also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006546.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The skyline model does not detect a decrease in prevalence towards the end of the influenza season and does not identify the time of peak prevalence. We carried out a further comparison with estimates using a GMRF skyride model fitted in BEAST 1.8 [

Use of a well-specified parametric compartmental model imposes a strong prior on the epidemic trajectory which leads to the correct identification of the shape and timing of the epidemic curve.
