<p>We applied the SEIR and superspreading-SEIR models to Ebola virus phylogenies based on data first described by [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and subsequently analyzed in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These phylogenies were estimated from whole genome sequences collected 2014-2015 during the West African Ebola epidemic. We derived the maximum clade credibility tree from the analysis by [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and extracted a subtree based on sampling four hundred lineages at random. The 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> package was used to fit the models with fixed tree topologies and branch lengths. Co-estimating the phylogeny and epidemic parameters is possible and may lead to more robust credible intervals because the tree prior can influence the topology of the estimated posterior distribution of trees, but this would also require substantialy more computational effort. The trees were fixed in this analyis in order to facilitate comparisons with other software and because of computational tradeoffs. With this fixed tree, 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> executes approximately one million MCMC steps per 17 hours using a typical CPU. We also ran the analysis using a fixed tree estimated by maximum likelihood and the 
 <italic>treedater</italic> R package as described in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], finding similar results.
