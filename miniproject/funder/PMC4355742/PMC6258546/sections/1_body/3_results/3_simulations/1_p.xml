<p>With simulated tree data, 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> recovers the correct transmission risk ratios and transmission rates, although performance depends on which structured coalescent model is used. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006546.g005">Fig 5</xref> compares estimates across 25 simulations using 
 <italic>PL2</italic> and 
 <italic>QL</italic> models on epidemics with 5,000 initial susceptible individuals and a sample size of 500 sampled heterochronously shortly after epidemic peak. The transmission risk ratio parameters were varied across simulations between and the per-capita transmission rate was kept constant. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006546.s005">S4 Fig</xref> shows performance of the 
 <italic>PL1</italic> model which was similar to 
 <italic>PL2</italic> but had slightly higher bias and lower posterior coverage of true parameters. Results for a smaller and noisier epidemic (2000 initial susceptibles) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006546.s006">S5 Fig</xref>. The running time of the 
 <italic>QL</italic> model was approximately five times faster than 
 <italic>PL2</italic> which required approximately 12 hours to complete 35,000 MCMC iterations, however 
 <italic>QL</italic> has considerable bias at the upper range of transmission risk ratio parameters and corresponding lower posterior coverage.
