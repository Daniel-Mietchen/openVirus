  <title>Influenza A virus infection affects pre-DC subset differentiation in the BM.</title>
  <p>(A) Gating strategy for BM pre-DC subset according to Siglec-F and Ly6C expression. (B) Mice were infected or not, with H3N2 virus and BM pre-DC subsets were analyzed at 7dpi. A representative dot plot was shown (
   <italic>left panel</italic>) and the absolute number of each pre-DC subset was then calculated (
   <italic>right panel</italic>). Means ± SEM of biological replicates from three experiments are represented (n = 12). (C) Mock-treated and IAV-infected mice were sacrificed at different time point post-infection and the absolute number of BM cDCs was quantified by flow cytometry (mean ± SEM, n = 5–8). *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.
