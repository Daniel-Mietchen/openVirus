  <title>Influenza A virus infection does not lead to DC progenitor intrinsic dysfunctions.</title>
  <p>(A-B) Mice were infected (or not) i.n. with H3N2 virus and sacrificed at 4dpi and 7dpi. Bone marrow cells were cultured for 9 days with recombinant Flt3-L (100ng/ml). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Bone marrow-derived cells were enumerated and (B, 
   <italic>left panel</italic>) the frequency of cDC subsets was assessed by flow cytometry. (B, 
   <italic>right panel</italic>) BM-derived cells were stimulated with LPS (100ng/ml) for 24h and cytokine production was quantified in the supernatant. Means ± SEM of 4 mice are represented. (C) Production of Flt3-L was quantified in the BM protein extracts (
   <italic>upper panel</italic>) and in the serum (
   <italic>lower panel</italic>). Means ± SEM of biological replicates from four experiments are represented (n = 17). (D) mRNA copy numbers of 
   <italic>Flt3l (upper panel)</italic> and Flt3-L production 
   <italic>(lower panel)</italic> in the lung were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR or ELISA, respectively. (E) mRNA copy numbers of 
   <italic>Csf2</italic> were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (
   <italic>upper panel</italic>) and GM-CSF production in the serum was quantified by ELISA (
   <italic>lower panel</italic>). (D, E) For quantitative RT-PCR, data were normalized to expression of 
   <italic>Gapdh</italic> and are expressed as relative expression. Results shown are the individuals and means of 8–10 mice/group *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.
