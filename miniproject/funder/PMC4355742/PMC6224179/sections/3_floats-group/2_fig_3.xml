  <title>Influenza A virus infection does not lead to DC progenitor apoptosis or egress.</title>
  <p>(A) Representative dot plots of BM CDPs and pre-DCs from mock-treated and IAV-infected mice (4dpi) labelled with annexin V and iodide propidium are shown (
   <italic>left panels</italic>). Bone marrow cells left several hours at 37°C in PBS are positively stained for Annexin V and iodide propidium (positive staining, 
   <italic>right panel</italic>). (B, C) Mice were infected i.n. with H3N2 virus and pre-DCs were quantified in peripheral tissues. (B) Example of gating strategy for blood pre-DC analysis. (C) The frequency of blood pre-DCs (
   <italic>left</italic>) and absolute number of spleen and lung pre-DCs (
   <italic>middle and right</italic>) were assessed by flow cytometry at 4dpi and 7dpi. Means ± SEM of 6–12 mice are represented. *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01.
