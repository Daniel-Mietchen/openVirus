  <title>Flt3-L overexpression during IAV infection enhances cDC generation and is associated with an increased expression of genes involved in lung barrier integrity.</title>
  <p>Mice were i.v. injected with 2μg of a control- or Flt3-L- encoding plasmid. Twenty four hours later, mice were infected, or not, with IAV. Mice were sacrified at 4 dpi. (A) The production of Flt3-L was quantified in the sera, (B) the numbers of CDPs, total pre-DCs and (C) pre-DC subsets were assessed in the BM by flow cytometry. (D) The numbers of cDC subsets and (E) other myeloid cells were determined in the lungs. (F)(
   <italic>left panel</italic>) Viral load (in log
   <sub>10</sub> viral M1 RNA copies/μg RNA) and (
   <italic>middle and right panel</italic>) mRNA expression of 
   <italic>Oas3</italic> and 
   <italic>Isg15</italic> genes were quantified in the lungs (RT-PCR). (G) mRNA copy numbers of genes associated with the barrier integrity (
   <italic>Ocln</italic>, 
   <italic>Tjp1</italic>) and tissue repair (
   <italic>Areg</italic>) were determined in the lungs (RT-PCR). All RT-PCR data are normalized to expression of 
   <italic>Gapdh</italic> and are expressed as fold increase over average gene expression in Ctrl-plasmid/mock animals. Data represent the means ± SEM of biological replicates (A-E) n = 6–12 and (F-G) n = 5. *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001, ns: not significative.
