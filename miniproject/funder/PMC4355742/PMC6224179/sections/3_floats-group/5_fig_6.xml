  <title>Neutralization of pro-inflammatory cytokines does not restore the DC progenitor compartment during IAV infection.</title>
  <p>(A) Age- and sex-matched WT and 
   <italic>Ifng</italic>
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice were infected (or not) i.n. with H3N2 virus. (B) Production of Flt3-L was quantified in the serum of 
   <italic>Ifng</italic>
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice infected or not with IAV (7 dpi) (n = 4). (C) Infected WT mice were treated at day 0, 2, 4 and 6 pi with anti-IFN-γ mAb or isotype control (300μg/mouse). (D) Age- and sex-matched WT and

   <italic>Ifnar</italic>
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice infected or not with IAV (7 dpi) (n = 9). (F) Infected WT mice were treated at day 0, 2, 4 and 6 with anti-IL-6, anti-TNFα or isotype (300μg/mouse). (A, C, D, F) The absolute number of BM CDPs and pre-DCs were assessed by flow cytometry at 7dpi. (A, C) Means ± SEM of biological replicates from two or three experiments are shown (n = 9–12). (D) Data are pooled from three experiments (n = 10–15). (F) Means ± SEM of biological replicates are shown (n = 5). *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.
