<p>We next hypothesized that influenza could interfere with the production of differentiation factors crucial for the differentiation of cDC. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, the concentration of Flt3-L in the BM (
 <italic>upper panel</italic>) and in the blood (
 <italic>lower panel</italic>) was significantly decreased at 7 dpi. Because the Flt3-L/Flt3 pathway is also critical for pre-DC differentiation towards mature cDCs in peripheral tissues, including the pulmonary compartment [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Flt3-L production was quantified in the lungs. Remarkably, a decreased expression of 
 <italic>Flt3l</italic> transcript and Flt3-L protein was noticed in the lung of infected animals (7 dpi) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Together with Flt3-L, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is also critical for non-lymphoid tissue cDC homeostasis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, relative to mock-treated animals, the expression of 
 <italic>Csf2</italic> transcripts in the lungs and GM-CSF levels in the serum were significantly decreased in IAV-infected animals. Hence, IAV infection alters the production of key factors for cDC differentiation, namely Flt3-L and GM-CSF.
