<p>To investigate whether influenza infection intrinsically affects the differentiation capacity of DC progenitors, BM cells from mock-treated and IAV-infected (4 dpi and 7 dpi) mice were cultured 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of Flt3-L, a key factor necessary for cDC differentiation. Relative to mock-treated mice, an increased number of Flt3-L-derived cells was generated from the BM of IAV-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that around 10% of these cells were plasmacytoid DCs and 80% were cDCs (

 <sup>+</sup>CD24
 <sup>high</sup>) and cDC2 (CD172α
 <sup>-</sup>CD24
 <sup>low</sup>) subsets (gating strategy in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007360.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) were unchanged between mock-treated and IAV-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, 
 <italic>left panel</italic>). Finally, upon LPS stimulation, DCs generated from IAV-experienced BM cells produced higher amounts of IL-6 and IL-12p40 relative to controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, 
 <italic>right panel</italic>); the IL-10 production being equivalent in both groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007360.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Thus, DC progenitors from IAV-infected animals do not display major intrinsic disorders that could block their differentiation.
