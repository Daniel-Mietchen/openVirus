<p>We next investigated influenza’s potential effect on the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> generation of cDCs. To this end, we quantified DC progenitors in the BM over the course of IAV infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g001">Fig 1B</xref> (gating strategy shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007360.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), the absolute number of MDPs did not change during infection, whereas the absolute CDP and pre-DC numbers were significantly lower between 4 dpi and 10 dpi. Interestingly, the remaining pre-DCs expressed higher levels of CD135 (the Flt3-L receptor) between 7 dpi and 16 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The CDP and pre-DC numbers returned to basal levels at 16 dpi. It is noteworthy that the numbers of CDPs and pre-DCs in the BM also fell during infection with H1N1 IAV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This finding indicates that the altered differentiation of cDCs in the BM is a general consequence of IAV infection, regardless of the viral subtype. As reported recently, the BM’s pre-DC population is heterogeneous, and four subsets can be identified according to the cell surface expression of Siglec-H and Ly6C (

 <sup>+</sup>Ly6C
 <sup>-</sup> pre-DCs (1) differentiate into Siglec-H
 <sup>+</sup>Ly6C
 <sup>+</sup> pre-DCs (2), which in turn give rise to cDC1- (Siglec-H
 <sup>-</sup>Ly6C
 <sup>-</sup>) or cDC2-biased pre-DCs (Siglec-H
 <sup>-</sup>Ly6C
 <sup>+</sup>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, the absolute numbers of pre-DCs (1), pre-DCs (2), and cDC1-biased pre-DCs decreased markedly at 7 dpi, whereas the number of cDC2-biased pre-DCs remained constant. Concomitantly with the changes in CDP and pre-DC counts, the number of cDCs in the BM also fell markedly between 4 dpi and 10 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Overall, IAV infection affects the number of cDCs in the lung tissue and significantly modifies the generation of DC precursors in the BM.
