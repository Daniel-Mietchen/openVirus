<p>It has previously been reported that IAV infection affects the number of DCs in the lung compartment; this phenomenon might influence the disease outcome [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, whether cDCs - cDC1 and cDC2 - are recruited or reduced upon IAV infection remains an open question. We first sought to revisit prior findings using CD64, a marker that allows one to distinguish between cDCs and monocyte-derived DCs [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007360.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), the frequency and absolute number of cDCs in the lungs of IAV (H3N2)-infected mice significantly decreased as early as 4 days post-infection (dpi) and peaked at 7 dpi. These changes were observed for both cDC1 (CD24
 <sup>high</sup>) and cDC2 (CD172Î±
 <sup>+</sup>) subsets. The number (but not the frequency) of cDCs and cDC2 returned to basal levels as early as 10 dpi whereas the number of cDC1 remained low at 10 dpi and returned to basal levels at 14 dpi (
