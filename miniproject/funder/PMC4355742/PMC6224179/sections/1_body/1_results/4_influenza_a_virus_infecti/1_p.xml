<p>A recent study found that in the context of a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system responds by promoting emergency monopoiesis at the expense of DC differentiation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We therefore looked at the influence of IAV infection on monopoiesis. In IAV-infected mice, the numbers of cMoPs (the direct progeny of MDPs) in the BM did not change significantly at any time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In stark contrast, the number of Ly6C
 <sup>high</sup> monocytes (often referred to as “inflammatory monocytes”) in the BM fell significantly at 4 dpi but not at 7 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, 
 <italic>left panel</italic>). These changes were associated with an elevated number of Ly6C
 <sup>high</sup> monocytes in the blood at 7 dpi, which is suggestive of enhanced egress from the BM (

 <italic>right panel</italic>). The expression of Ly6A/E (also known as Sca-1), a marker normally found on hematopoietic stem cells, on inflammatory monocytes in the BM and the blood was significantly higher in IAV-infected mice than in mock-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To gain further insight into the immunological features of Ly6C
 <sup>high</sup> monocytes, cells were sorted from the BM of control and IAV-infected mice (7 dpi). Analysis of gene expression profiles revealed the upregulation of both pro-inflammatory genes (
 <italic>Nos2</italic> and 
 <italic>Il6</italic>) and anti-inflammatory genes (
 <italic>Socs3</italic> and 
 <italic>Cd200</italic>) and the drastic downregulation of 
 <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> transcription (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This finding indicates that IAV triggers the generation of Ly6C
 <sup>high</sup> monocytes with a regulatory phenotype, as recently reported by Askenase 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Accordingly, Ly6C
 <sup>high</sup> monocytes from IAV-infected mice produced more IL-6 and IL-10 than control mice following stimulation with LPS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Lastly, IAV infection led to a significant fall in the number of Ly6C
 <sup>low/-</sup> (patrolling) monocytes in the BM (at 4 dpi and 7 dpi) and the blood (at 7 dpi) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Taken as a whole, these data suggest that IAV infection triggers emergency monopoiesis at the expense of DC differentiation.
