<p>We hypothesized that the change in the number of DC progenitors in the BM during IAV infection could be due to enhanced local apoptosis and/or egress. Whenever the time points analyzed (4 dpi is shown), the CDPs and pre-DCs were not stained by propidium iodide and annexin V (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, the frequency of pre-DCs in the blood did not fall significantly after the onset of IAV infection. Moreover, an analysis of pre-DCs in peripheral tissues revealed a significant decrease in the number of pre-DCs in the spleen (at 4 dpi) and in the lungs (at 7 dpi). It is noteworthy that during IAV infection, CDPs cannot be detected in the bloodstream or the spleen. These results suggest that the low number of cDC progenitors in the BM seen during IAV infection is not associated with an enhanced egress towards peripheral tissues.
