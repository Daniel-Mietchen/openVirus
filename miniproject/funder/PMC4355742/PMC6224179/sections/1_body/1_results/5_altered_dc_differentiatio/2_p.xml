<p>Next, we assessed the role of other pro-inflammatory cytokines including type I IFNs, TNF-α, and IL-6, all of which are known to trigger emergency myelopoiesis, in altered DC differentiation [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The abrogation of type I IFN signalling did not influence the numbers of CDPs and pre-DCs in the BM (
