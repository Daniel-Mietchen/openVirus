<p>We next sought to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the fall in DC progenitors in the BM during influenza infection. It was recently reported that IFN-γ signalling impairs cDC development after systemic infection with

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a significant decrease in CDP and pre-DC numbers at 7 dpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Moreover, the treatment of IAV-infected mice with anti-IFN-γ monoclonal Ab did not restore the number of CDPs or pre-DCs, when compared with isotype-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This suggests that the changes in cDC generation during IAV infection are IFN-γ independent.
