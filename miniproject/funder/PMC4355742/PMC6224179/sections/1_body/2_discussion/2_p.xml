<p>Very few studies have investigated the impact of IAV infection on BM cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Sedger et 
 <italic>al</italic>. reported a severe depletion of the B cell lineage during infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. With regard to myelopoiesis, several studies have suggested that IAV infection promotes monopoiesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The large observed decrease in the number of cDCs in the lungs during IAV infection prompted us to look at whether this infection influences DC differentiation in the BM. We observed a severe, transient (4–10 dpi) decrease in the number of CDPs and pre-DCs but not MDPs. It is noteworthy that this period coincides with the peak of susceptibility to bacterial superinfection. We next characterized the molecular basis of this drastic decline in DC progenitors in the BM. In contrast to the B cell lineage [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], our results suggest that apoptosis of DC progenitors in the BM was not affected by IAV. Moreover, the observed reduction in pre-DC numbers in the blood, spleen and lungs argued against increased egress of DC progenitors from the BM, although further investigations regarding for instance the entry/retention of pre-DCs in peripheral tissues would be necessary to draw a firm conclusion. A similar decrease in the number of DC progenitors was recently described in a model of systemic 
 <italic>Y</italic>. 
 <italic>enterocolitica</italic> infection; the authors showed that infection favoured monopoiesis at the expense of DC differentiation in a Toll-like receptor 4 and IFN-γ-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results are in line with this report, and demonstrate that IAV favours monopoiesis at the expense of cDC development. In contrast to Pasquevich 
 <italic>et al</italic>.’s report, however, the decrease in the CDP and pre-DC numbers during IAV infection did not depend on IFN-γ. This disparity might be due to the presence of

 <italic>enterocolitica</italic> in the BM [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In contrast, IAV which is restricted to the respiratory tract, is barely detectable in the BM during infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which suggests an indirect mode of action. We hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm following IAV infection is responsible for altering DC development in the BM. It has been reported that type I IFNs, IL-6 and TNF-α promote emergency monopoiesis in some settings [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Here, we found that the decrease in the number of CDPs and pre-DCs during IAV infection is independent of these cytokines. Although we cannot fully rule out the possibility of a combined mode of action, these pro-inflammatory cytokines do not appear to be important in the control of cDC generation during IAV infection. Type III IFNs represent an emerging family of cytokines that functions as a first-line of defence against influenza infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although the impact of type III IFNs on myelopoiesis is presently unknown, it might be interesting to investigate its potential role (in combination or not with type I IFNs) during the course of IAV infection.
