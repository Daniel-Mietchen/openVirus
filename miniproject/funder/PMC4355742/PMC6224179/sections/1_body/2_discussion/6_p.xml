<p>What are the consequences of the cDC drop during IAV infection? The disrupted differentiation of cDC progenitors described in the present report could account (at least in part) for post-influenza immunosuppression. The drop in the pulmonary cDC number during IAV infection might for instance hamper immune-based therapeutics directed against secondary infections. We have shown that treatment of IAV-infected mice at 7 dpi (but not at 14 dpi) with alpha-galactosylceramide, a potent agonist for invariant natural killer T cells, fails to protect against secondary pneumococcal infection [

Therefore, strategies designed to prevent cDC depletion in the lungs during IAV infection might be of value in controlling secondary bacterial infections. Previous studies of immunocompromised animals have highlighted the beneficial effects of DC transfer or the enhancement of DC production on susceptibility to secondary systemic or lung infections [
