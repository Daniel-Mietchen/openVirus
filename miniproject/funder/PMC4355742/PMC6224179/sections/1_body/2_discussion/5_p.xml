<p>To the best of our knowledge, a decline in cDC generation associated with a reduced systemic Flt3-L production upon infection has not been reported before. Abrogation of type I and type II IFN signaling did not influence Flt3-L level in the blood and thus argued against a role of these cytokines in the regulation of Flt3-L production. Although the underlying mechanisms are still elusive, an increased apoptosis/cell death of Flt3-L-producing cells (and GM-CSF) during the course of influenza infection may contribute, even partly, to this phenomenon. In line with this hypothesis, expression of Flt3-L in lymphoid organs (spleen, BM, lymph nodes) depends on hematopoietic cells (T, B, NK cells) [

We showed that inoculation of an Flt3-L-encoding plasmid in mock-treated and IAV-infected mice enhanced the systemic Flt3-L concentration and expanded BM DC progenitors and lung cDCs. Importantly, Flt3-L overexpression leads to similar numbers of DC progenitors in the BM regardless of infection, suggesting that Flt3-L is sufficient to boost the cDC differentiation - mainly the cDC1 pathway - in the BM of infected animals. In contrast, although Flt3-L treatment restored the cDC pool in the lung in IAV-infected mice, the level reached did not attain that of non-infected animals. This suggests that Flt3-L is necessary but that additional factors,
