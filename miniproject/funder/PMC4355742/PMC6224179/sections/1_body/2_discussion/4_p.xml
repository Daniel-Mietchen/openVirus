<p>Influenza infection does not cause intrinsic functional defects of BM progenitors/precursors upstream of CDPs, i.e. MDPs. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, BM cells collected from IAV-infected animals mainly differentiated into cDCs, including both cDC1 and cDC2 subsets, in the presence of Flt3-L. Interestingly, the number of cDCs generated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> from IAV-experienced BM cells was greater than BM cells from mock-treated animals. This process is probably due to the increased expression of Flt3 (CD135) on DC progenitors. In the present study, we observed a decrease in the production of Flt3-L in the BM, blood and lungs during IAV infection, a phenomenon that could account for the decrease in CDPs and/or pre-DCs. This finding contrasts with other pathological conditions where decreased DC number is associated with enhanced synthesis of Flt3-L [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In these contexts, Flt3-L promotes DC expansion. The decrease in Flt3-L production during IAV infection is counter-balanced by the enhanced expression of Flt3 on DC progenitors. The differentiation of pre-DCs into cDC1 and cDC2 subsets at peripheral sites requires Flt3-L [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. During IAV infection, it is likely that low Flt3-L production in the lung affects the 
 <italic>in situ</italic> differentiation of pre-DCs towards cDC1 and cDC2 subsets. We showed that the pre-DC differentiation towards the cDC1 lineage was severely impaired in the BM and the lungs of IAV-infected animals. Ginhoux 
 <italic>et al</italic>. previously reported that Flt3-L is a critical, limiting factor for the cDC1 lineage [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast, cDC2 differentiation in the BM (but not in the lungs) of IAV-infected animals was unaffected. It has been reported that M-CSF or GM-CSF act in concert with Flt3-L to promote cDC2 homeostasis in non-lymphoid tissues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In the same line, production of GM-CSF in response to respiratory viral infection (respiratory syncitial virus) rapidly promotes cDC2 differentiation from lung precursors (CD11c
 <sup>+</sup>MHCII
 <sup>-</sup>) and cDC2 expansion [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It is noteworthy to mention that in this study, this process leads to the further depletion of lung precursors. Along with the decreased Flt3-L production, we also observed a reduced GM-CSF production in the lung during IAV infection; this might also account for the alteration in lung cDC2 lineage. Although further investigations are required, our results suggest that M-CSF and/or GM-CSF are sufficient for the differentiation of pre-DCs towards the cDC2 lineage in the BM of IAV-infected animals.
