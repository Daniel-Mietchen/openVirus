<p>Total BM cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 5 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well in 4ml RPMI/10% FCS, in the presence of Flt3-L (100ng/ml). At day 4, half of the medium was discarded and new medium containing Flt3-L was added. BM-derived DC were used at day 8–9. Phenotypic analysis of BM-derived DC was done by flow cytometry using anti-Siglec H, anti-CD11c, anti-MHCII, anti-CD172α and anti-CD24. For functional analysis, BM-derived DCs were cultured overnight at 1 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in RPMI/5% SVF in the presence of endotoxin-free LPS (100ng/ml). Cytokine production was measured in the culture supernatants by ELISA.
