<p>Cell suspensions were prepared in PBS/2% FCS. Bone marrow were flushed from both femurs and tibias with cold medium and disrupted with a syringe/needle. The cell suspension was then filtered (90μm) and washed. Spleens were treated with type IV collagenase (1mg/ml) and 1 μg/ml DNase type I (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) at 37°C for 20 min, then disrupted in PBS supplemented with 2% FCS, filtered and washed. Lungs were perfused with PBS, excised and finely minced, followed by enzymatic digestion for 20 min at 37°C in RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg/ml type VIII collagenase (or type IV collagenase for pre-DC analysis) and 1μg/ml DNase type I. After washes, lung homogenates were resuspended in a 20% Percoll and centrifuged at 2000 rpm, without brake, at 22°C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed with medium. For all cell suspensions, red blood cells were removed with lysis buffer (Sigma) and mononuclear cells resuspended in PBS/2%FCS. The total number of cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion.</p>
