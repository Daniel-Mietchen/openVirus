<p>C57Bl/6 mice were injected with a Flt3-L- or control (pcDNA3)-plasmid diluted in 1.4 ml of Ringer solution via tail vein as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Plasmid injection was completed in less than 5 sec. Mice were infected with IAV (WSN, 100 PFUs) 24h later. The efficacy of the plasmid-mediated Flt3-L gene delivery in IAV-infected animals was assessed 5 days later. To this end, lung and BM cells were harvested and labelled with a cocktail of antibodies allowing cDC subset and cDC progenitors' identification by flow cytometry. To test the efficacy of the Flt3-L-plasmid delivery on superinfection, IAV-infected mice were superinfected with 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> at 4 dpi. Viable bacteria in the lungs and spleen were counted 36 h after the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> challenge by plating serial 10-fold dilutions of lung or spleen homogenates onto blood agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37Â°C overnight and CFUs were counted 24 h later. Survival and body weight were monitored daily after IAV infection and mice were euthanized when they lost in excess of 20% of their initial body weight.
