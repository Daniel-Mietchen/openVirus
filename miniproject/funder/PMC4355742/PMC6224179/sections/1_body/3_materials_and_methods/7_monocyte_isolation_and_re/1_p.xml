<p>Bone marrow cells were harvested from na√Øve or infected mice and cell suspensions were prepared as described above. Monocytes were sorted using a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Bone marrow cells were labelled with biotin-conjugated anti-Ter119, -CD3, -NK1.1, CD45R/B220 and PE/Cy7-streptavidin, Brilliant Violet 421-anti-CD45 antibody, APC-Cy7-conjugated Ly6G, Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated Ly6C, FITC-conjugated CD11b and PE-conjugated CD115. This protocol yielded &gt;98% cell purity as evaluated by FACS. Then, monocytes were cultured overnight at 1 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in RPMI/5% SVF in the presence of endotoxin-free LPS (100ng/ml). Cytokine production was measured in the culture supernatants by ELISA.
