<p>For histopathologic examination, lungs were fixed by inflation and immersion in PBS 3.2% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. To evaluate airway inflammation, we subjected fixed lung slices (5 Î¼m sections) to hematoxylin and eosin staining. Three evenly distributed sections per lung were microscopically evaluated by a certified pathologist who was blinded to genotype. To determine the degree of alveolitis, thickness of alveolar wall, alveolar protein exudate, inflammatory cells as well as the distribution of alveolar lesions were scored. The degrees of pulmonary alveolitis were classified into 4 grades. 0: absent; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: marked and 4: severe.</p>
