<p>All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. Unpaired T-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post T-test were used for statistical analysis when two groups or multiple groups were analyzed, respectively. When data did not follow a Gaussian distribution, the statistical significance was evaluated using non-parametric Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> or Kruskal-Wallis (followed by a Dunns post-test). We used two-way ANOVA when multiple parameters were studied. For body weight evolution, means of “area under the curve” of each individual were compared using a Mann–Whitney U test. The survival of infected mice was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and a log-rank test. *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.
