<p>Levels of IL-6, IL-12p40, and IL-10 were quantified in culture supernatants of TLR agonist-stimulated BM-DCs or monocytes using standardized sandwich enzyme-linked ELISA kits (eBiosciences, R&amp;D systems) and used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Similarly, levels of Flt3-L and GM-CSF were quantified by ELISA (R&amp;D systems) in sera as well as in BM and lung tissue lysates. Briefly, total lungs were lysed in 600 μL of lysis buffer (0.2% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, Anti-protease1X, PBS1X) and incubated for 30 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 3500 rpm and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. Bone marrow cells (2x10
 <sup>7</sup> cells) were resuspended in 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM tri-HCL, 150 Mm NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 1% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0,1% SDS, Anti-Protease 1X, PBS 1X) and incubated 15 min on ice with periodic agitation. Lysed cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 13000 rpm at 4°C and the supernatant transferred to a new tube.
