<p>Myeloid lineage cells are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow (BM). Studies in the mouse have provided a description of the successive steps leading to the generation of progenitors that give rise to both CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> (cDC2) and CD8α
 <sup>+</sup>/CD103
 <sup>+</sup> (cDC1) cDC subsets and monocytes/macrophages [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The macrophage/DC progenitors (MDPs) lose their ability to generate granulocytes but can develop into the common monocyte progenitors (cMoPs), restricted to monocytes and their descendants [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Importantly, these studies clearly showed that the BM contained pre-DC subsets having committed to cDC1 or cDC2 lineages. The pre-DCs subsequently leave the BM, enter the bloodstream, and migrate to peripheral tissues, where they give rise to cDC1 and cDC2 subsets [
