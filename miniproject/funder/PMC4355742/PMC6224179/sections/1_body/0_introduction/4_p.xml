<p>Very few studies have focused on the impact of IAV infection on emergency myelopoiesis in the BM. Early studies reported an increased number of mature (CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>Gr1
 <sup>+</sup>) myeloid cells in the BM of IAV-infected animals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The increase in myelopoiesis during IAV infection seemed to be regulated by CD137-CD137L interaction in the BM [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, Stiefter 
 <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that IFN signalling does not have a major role in regulating central myelopoiesis during infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the current study, we report that IAV infection transiently affects the number of cDCs (both cDC1 and cDC2) in the lung compartment. We show for the first time that IAV reduced the number of BM progenitors committed to the DC lineage, i.e. CDPs, pre-DCs and, most importantly, the cDC1-biased pre-DC lineage. This reduction was associated with an increase in the production of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the BM. The phenomenon was independent of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and was associated with a reduction in the production of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3-L). Overexpression of Flt3-L during influenza infection enhanced the number of cDC progenitors in the BM, restored the cDC pool in the lungs, reduced lung damages and partially protected against secondary bacterial infections as reflected by decreased bacterial counts (reduced systemic dissemination) and prolonged survival.
