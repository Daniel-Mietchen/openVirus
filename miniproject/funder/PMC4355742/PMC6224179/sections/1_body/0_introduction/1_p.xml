<p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) are responsible for acute respiratory tract diseases and represent a threat to human health worldwide. Infection with IAV is frequently complicated by secondary bacterial infections; these typically occur between 4 to 14 days after the primary IAV infection (depending on the pathogenicity of the virus and the host’s immune system). In the context of influenza, physical disorders (e.g. impaired barrier function) and immunological disorders are the two main causes of enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infections (for reviews, [

Indeed, inflammatory monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) are strongly recruited. Although monocyte-derived DCs are important for locally boosting the IAV-specific CD8

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A recent study suggested that alveolar macrophages depletion/persistence upon IAV infection is largely dependent of mouse genetic background and infection conditions [

The situation is less clear for conventional DCs (cDCs), a family of critical sentinel cells composed by two main subpopulations in the lungs, namely cDC1 and cDC2. We recently reported a drastic decrease of total cDCs in IAV-infected mice [
