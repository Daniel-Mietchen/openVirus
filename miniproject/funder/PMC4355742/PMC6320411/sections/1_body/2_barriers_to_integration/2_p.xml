<p>Economically, integrating NCD care into LMIC HIV systems is only viable with buy-in from the government, external donors, and national constituents. As with PEPFAR for HIV care, countries may require infrastructural capacity building before they become capable of supporting these larger health care systems on their own [

As countries transition from low-income to middle-income, an additional challenge is finding resources to support HIV programs as donor resources diminish in the face of competing health care demands. These demands include the need for additional financial and human resources in constrained situations. Finally, the integration of separate health systems creates a need for improved management practices. Standards to address selection biases, validity, and reliability of data sources are needed to ensure that robust data are collected. This will ensure that data from a variety of sources (eg, clinical systems, research, and M&amp;E) are standardized to some extent and will limit missing and unreliable data. M&amp;E systems must be expanded to include NCD screening and treatment services, and quality of care must be ensured through continued monitoring, evaluation, and medical education [
