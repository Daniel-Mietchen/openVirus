<p>As NCDs become more prevalent, resource allocation needs to be informed by knowledge of the burden of disease and evidence-based interventions. Cost-effective models of comprehensive care of HIV, a chronic disease when viral suppression is achieved and maintained, that integrates management of NCDs associated with HIV are needed. The first step is leveraging surveillance systems to enhance our knowledge of the NCD burden among PLHIV by collecting information on risk factors and related morbidity. Several strategies to improve knowledge of disease burden exist, allowing public health officials to design or enhance interventions to reduce years of life lost. Among these are case-based surveillance and population-level monitoring systems; registries, which use medical records data for clinical surveillance; cohort monitoring in LMICs; and population-based surveys.</p>
