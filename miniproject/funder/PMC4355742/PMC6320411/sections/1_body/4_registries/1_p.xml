<p>Registries collect clinical information of all patients diagnosed with a certain condition within a particular catchment area over a period of time and are particularly useful for patient care, especially in areas that lack population-level patient monitoring systems. Patients’ information from participating clinics is entered into the registry after diagnosis of a particular NCD or identification of a person with previously diagnosed NCD(s) of interest; this registry contains all patients under the same participating health care provider or in the same facility who have the same NCD. The clinic data collected at each visit is entered into the registry or, ideally, automatically flows from the patients’ medical records into the registry without additional resources required for data entry[

These data can then be aggregated at the regional or national level and can be used for cohort monitoring; program evaluation; tracking indicators for accountability to funders, policy makers, and stakeholders; and for performance reporting. Furthermore, at the patient level, registries can be used to track adherence, provide reminders for follow-up and preventative services as well as track health changes over time [
