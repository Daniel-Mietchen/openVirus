<p>Ethical considerations may prevent the inclusion of name-based HIV status in a registry, requiring unique identifiers. However, even with unique identifiers, confidentiality may be lost if systems are not created with checks to ensure privacy. Therefore, precautions to protect the identity of individuals in both name-based HIV case report databases as well as databases that use unique identifiers must be taken, particularly in contexts where stigma and discrimination against PLHIV are strong.</p>
