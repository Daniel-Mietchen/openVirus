<p>HIV surveillance has been shifting with the epidemic response over the past 2 decades. Reliance on sentinel surveys and AIDS case reporting was augmented with household surveys, community-based surveys, and HIV case reporting. The current trend is to move toward more routine data collection activities. Patient monitoring systems that capture a variety of health conditions, such as routine perinatal mother-to-child transmission surveillance, are becoming more important as increasing numbers of PLHIV are accessing care and treatment. Some comorbidities are already recognized as important to monitor, though these are primarily infectious, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. As effective ART continues to be scaled up across LMICs, chronic conditions will become more important to monitor because more PLHIV will achieve virologic suppression.</p>
