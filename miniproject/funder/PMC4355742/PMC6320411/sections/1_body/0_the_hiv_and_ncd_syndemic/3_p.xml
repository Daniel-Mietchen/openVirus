<p>Increasing patient awareness of the effects of long-term HIV infection and effective levels of antiretroviral treatment, that is, viral suppression, particularly the shift to a predominance of chronic diseases, is important because this improved awareness may prompt patients to report symptoms and request screening for related conditions. Therefore, patient education can improve our ability to detect NCDs as they become more prevalent. An effective public health response to HIV, now that the epidemic is maturing, requires treatment and prevention of NCDs among PLHIV in LMICs. It is imperative to understand the predominant risk factors, the consequent symptoms and complications, and the available appropriate treatments and preventative interventions for each NCD.</p>
