 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The emerging NCD epidemic presents a unique opportunity to leverage the tremendous investments made in the existing HIV health platforms so that these enhanced health systems can deliver improved HIV care, which includes the prevention and treatment of chronic comorbidities to achieve further reductions in preventable deaths. Additionally, lessons learned from the public health approach in response to the HIV epidemic could be applied to the care and treatment of NCDs, given the chronic nature of both conditions. To understand this emerging syndemic, improved surveillance and clinical monitoring of NCDs among PLHIV are necessary to estimate the burden of and risk factors for NCDs among HIV-infected persons.
