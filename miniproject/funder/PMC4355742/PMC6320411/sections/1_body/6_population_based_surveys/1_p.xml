<p>The WHO-UNAIDS Technical Working Group on HIV Surveillance has advocated the use of population-based surveys to understand the risk factors for HIV and to determine HIV incidence and prevalence. As the HIV epidemic matures in SSA, these surveys should include questions about NCDs and related risk factors. Basic screening for diseases such as hypertension would be easy to employ as well [

 <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; however, it is uncommon for DHS to routinely report on any associations. These data are publicly available and can be examined for associations, but this should become part of routine public health reporting. Additionally, the WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance should consider an HIV module for high-burden countries. This would allow for both general population and HIV-specific estimates of NCD burden, which would inform national policies and plans to address the growing NCD burden.
