<p>HIV case reporting has been a part of second generation surveillance, as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS, since 2000 [

The rapid expansion of ART and the promulgation of the 90-90-90 treatment targets have renewed the focus on case reporting, linked to patient monitoring systems, by WHO and UNAIDS. In settings where unique identifiers are available, HIV case report systems can be crossed with registries where they exist to link associated conditions; currently, cancer registries are the most prevalent [

Every effort should be made to protect patient privacy and ensure confidentiality as individual systems grow to collect more data elements and are linked to other systems. To strengthen overall patient care, the population-level HIV patient monitoring system, which is designed to track ART adherence and HIV viral suppression, can monitor conditions associated with both HIV infection and long-term exposure to ART. Population-level patient monitoring systems can capture risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well as outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and cancer [
