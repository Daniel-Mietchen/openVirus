<p>Given the limited data currently available concerning the NCD burden among PLHIV in LMICs, mathematical modeling could provide useful information about prevalence. The granularity of the prevalence rates may be limited based on available country-specific data for the models. However, with concerted efforts to collect meaningful data to inform these models, relevant figures could be generated. Currently, the Global Burden of Disease Study generates estimates for the prevalence of various diseases and has a Web-based tool that generates visualizations of these data [

As a next step, it may be imperative to develop a tool to generate the estimates of coburden of certain diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis or HIV and cardiovascular disease. Data of coburden can help us to identify syndemics and thus better focus our efforts and resources to prevent and treat these diseases.
