<p>The absence of the A226V may have had implication for transmission efficiency in the present outbreak, given that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>Albopictus</italic> is the unique competent vector circulating in Italy. This could explain the lower cumulative incidence compared with other urban outbreaks although the role of different background vector density or climate-dependent vector behavior cannot be excluded. The 2017 was characterized by an exceptional dry summer season. Despite the low cumulative incidence, this outbreak showed a very long duration (from June to November). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208896.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows a greater number of mutations that, considering E1 and E2 polymorphisms at sites relevant for vector fitness, provide the genetic signature of strains that use 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> as preferential vector. The role of these mutations in the virusâ€™ ability to better replicate and disseminate in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>Albopictus</italic> is still unclear. A comparison of the vector competence for the 2007 and 2017 Italian strains showed similar vector competence for both strains suggesting A226V could not be the sole responsible for ability of CHIKV to replicate in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>Albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, as already demonstrated for dengue and yellow fever [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the genetic background of the autochtonous 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>Albopictus</italic> could facilitate the competence for the virus despite the presence of the A226V mutation and should be further evaluated.
