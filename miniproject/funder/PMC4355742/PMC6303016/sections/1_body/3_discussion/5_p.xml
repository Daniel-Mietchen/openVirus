<p>As reported by Carletti et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the phylogenetic analysis shows that the virus involved in the current Lazio outbreak belongs to the East, Central, and South Africa (ECSA) clade, and clusters within the IOL. The sequences from the current outbreak are placed in a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree compared with the isolates from the 2007 Italian outbreak. Isolates from recent outbreaks in Pakistan and India are placed in the same branch, suggesting a more recent origin of the new epidemic strain. Given the molecular characterization of the strain and its phylogenetic characteristics, a possible introduction of the virus from the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan by travelers could be hypothesized [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This hypothesis is also supported by the seasonal synchronicity between Italy and India or Pakistan, as it happened also during the outbreak in Italy in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The concurrent 2017 French outbreak showed a sub-lineage of the ECSA clustering with lineage from Central African Region and carrying the A226V mutation [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This excludes a possible link between the two outbreaks. Finally, the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the imported cases prior to the outbreak rule out these cases as possible source of introduction. Of note, the characterization of E1 performed at various time points during the outbreak indicated a virtually complete identity of the virus sequences along the outbreak suggesting no additional introductions during the outbreak.
