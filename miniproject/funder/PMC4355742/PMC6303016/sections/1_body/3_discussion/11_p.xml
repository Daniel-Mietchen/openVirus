<p>The date of symptoms’ onset of first reported case was August 5, 2017 and the earliest symptoms’ onset was June 26. The surveillance system was able to detect the first autochthonous case only after the peak of the outbreak as it was in 2007 [

In Italy, the activity of the vector mosquitoes is mainly restricted to the summer season (usually between June and October) when outbreaks could be triggered by the arrival of imported cases from endemic areas and may result in secondary cases. This highlights the importance of an integrated surveillance system that should promptly identify autochthonous transmission. The integration of the passive surveillance with different surveillance tools (such as laboratory-based surveillance, syndromic surveillance, novel data stream) [
