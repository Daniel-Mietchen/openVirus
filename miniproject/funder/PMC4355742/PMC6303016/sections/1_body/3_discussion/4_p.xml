<p>Fever and joint pain, usually localized in both the arms and legs, is reported in 90% of patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Skin rash is usually reported in a variable proportion of cases (between 20% and 80%). The distribution of symptoms is similar to the one reported during the previous outbreak in Italy in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and during the 2017 outbreak in France [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The relative frequencies of fever, joint pain and rash were higher than those reported from the Pakistan 2016 outbreak (caused by the same clade), where fever and joint pain occurred in 85·9% and 88·4%, respectively, and rash occurred in only 29.1% of cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The case fatality rate was 2.5 per 1,000 clinical cases, lower than the one reported in the 2007 outbreak in Italy (0.5%) but consistent with those reported from la Reunion (1 death per 1,000 clinical cases) [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
