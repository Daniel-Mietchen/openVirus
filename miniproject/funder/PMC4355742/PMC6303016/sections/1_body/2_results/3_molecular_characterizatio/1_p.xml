<p>Preliminary molecular characterization, based on partial sequence of the E1, indicated that the sequences from samples collected at different time points of the outbreak were all identical, and belonged to the Indian Ocean subclade (IOL) of the ECSA lineage, as observed for the sequences from the 2007 outbreak in Italy. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208896.g004">Fig 4</xref>, phylogenetic tree of the complete genome sequence of the isolate CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017 is shown in the context of sequences representing the 3 major described CHIKV lineages: ECSA, Asia and Caribbean, and West Africa. As can be seen, CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017 is located on a branch of the IOL sublineage that is distinct from that comprising of the 2007 Italian autochthonous sequences, and clusters with recent strains originating from Pakistan and with an isolate obtained in China, from a traveler returning from India. Considering E1 and E2 polymorphisms at sites considered relevant for vector fitness, CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017 lacks the adaptive mutation A226V in E1, and, more generally, shows the genetic signature of strains using
