<p>CHIKV diagnosis was based on the detection of the viral genome by real-time RT-PCR and virus-specific antibodies by serologic tests on serum or plasma samples. For the qualitative detection of CHIKV specific RNA a commercial real-time RT-PCR kit (RealStar Chikungunya RT-PCR Kit 2.0, Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) was used. Serologic tests for the detection of CHIKV specific IgG and IgM were performed using indirect immune fluorescence assay (IFA) (Anti-Chikungunya Virus IIFT Euroimmun AG, Germany). Neutralization assay was performed according to Lindsey HS et al [
