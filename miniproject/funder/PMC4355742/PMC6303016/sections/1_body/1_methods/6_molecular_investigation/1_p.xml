<p>The molecular characterization of E1 was performed for confirmatory purpose on samples collected at various time points (from the first three notified cases, from three cases in mid-September, from two cases at mid-October) [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The complete genome sequencing of the isolate obtained from the acute serum sample of a patient living in Anzio, collected on September 11, 2017, was performed. A 11.604 nt long sequence was amplified in 23 overlapping RT-PCR amplicons and Sanger sequenced as described elsewhere (isolate CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017, GenBank accession number: MG049915) [
 <xref rid="pone.0208896.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree was built using Maximum-Likelihood method based on the full-length genome sequences of 46 isolates, including the CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017 sequence, representing the 3 major described CHIKV lineages: ECSA (including the Indian Ocean lineage, n = 29), Asia-Caribbean (n = 12), and West Africa (n = 4). Evolutionary distances were computed using the General Time Reversible model (GTR). The alphavirus O’nyong’nyong was used as an outgroup. Bootstraps were generated using 1,000 replicates. In addition, the CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI1-2017 sequence was compared to the reference sequence S27, the African prototype strain isolated in 1953 [
