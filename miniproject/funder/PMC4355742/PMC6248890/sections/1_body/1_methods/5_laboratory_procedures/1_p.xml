<p>Baseline serum samples were taken to test for IgG antibodies by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA-Panbio). A 5ml of peripheral venous blood was obtained with BD Vacutainer and centrifuged at 3000 rpm (Bio-Lion XC-L4). The serum was stored at 4±2°C and aliquots obtained with Scilogex micropette plus autoclavable pipettor of 500μl at -70°C (Eppendorf CryoCube F570-86 Upright). Following the reference values, negative, equivocal and positive results were determined as &lt;9, 9–11 and &gt;11 Panbio units, respectively.</p>
