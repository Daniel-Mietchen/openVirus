<p>Symptomatic dengue was detected through passive surveillance for dengue-associated symptoms and absenteeism from schools. The clinical team of FSD visited schools every week, checked attendance, and visited the homes of absentees. If absentees had a febrile illness in the previous week, they were evaluated with a physical exam and an acute blood sample to confirm infection. In addition, this population was monitored for febrile symptoms and suspected dengue illness through a toll-free number where parents could call for medical assistance when febrile disease appeared in any member of the family. This free of charge telephone line was directed only to the members of the cohort so as to voluntarily report febrile cases to the team (FSD) where a physician in charge would respond to their request.</p>
