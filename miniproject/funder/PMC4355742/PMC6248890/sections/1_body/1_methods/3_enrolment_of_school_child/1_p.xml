<p>The State Ministry of Education of Yucatan provided a list of elementary public schools located in the selected areas, and a cohort of children from 1
 <sup>st</sup> to 3
 <sup>rd</sup> grade (6 to 8 years old) was randomly selected from eight schools in Merida, four in Progreso and two from Ticul. A convenience sample of 50 children per grade was defined to gather 150 school children (index children) in each of the five risk areas (450 for Merida (150 in each low, middle high risk areas), 150 for Ticul (middle risk) and 150 for Progreso (low risk)). Because children from different grades could come from the same family, we restricted the selection to one child per family to have 50 different and independent families per grade. Recruitment of school-aged children (between 6 to 12 years) included invitation to all other members of the household of the children enrolled. Consent and assent forms were obtained individually from each adult and from parents in the case of children and participants younger than 18 years old and were signed before blood samples were taken. Exclusion criteria included refusal to participate or plans to move outside of the study area during the months following enrolment.
