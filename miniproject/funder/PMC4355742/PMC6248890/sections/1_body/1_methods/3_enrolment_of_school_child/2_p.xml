<p>The enrolment of new school children in the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> year (2016) was designed to incorporate 50 new 1
 <sup>st</sup> grade children per risk area from the same elementary schools or additional ones when required. Based on the results of the dengue vaccine trials [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] the target groups for the vaccine were children over 9 years old instead of under-five years old. Therefore, the recruitment scheme changed to include more children aged 9 to 12 years old from new middle schools. From the additional 150 new children required from middle schools in Merida, only 134 were recruited along with 37 from elementary schools (171 new index children). Ticul and Progreso recruited 50 middle school children each plus 19 and 16 new index children from elementary schools, respectively.
