<p>Prevalence found in this study were as expected and comparable to those from other endemic countries inside and outside the Americas, as reported in urban Nicaragua (2003) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In other states of the country similar prevalence have been also reported: 35.7% in 5 to 9 years old and 52.2% for 10 to 14 years old (2011) [
