<p>Dengue transmission is highly heterogeneous and the burden varies by geographic region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], age groups affected and serotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Significant heterogeneity in transmission intensity has been identified within districts, sub-districts and even finer spatial scales like schools [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The differences between risk areas was expected since social, economic and environmental conditions have all proven to have certain influence in infection risks of populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These conditions could also influence transmission within the different schools in the selected areas. The low risk areas selected in our study comprise one urban area in the capital city and a town (Progreso) with historical low and occasional reports of dengue cases. Overall seroprevalence in these sites was significantly lower than the reported for medium and high risk areas. The higher prevalence of dengue infection in all age groups in Ticul (medium risk) demonstrated that conditions for transmission were wider than expected. The under report of cases by local health services as well as less demand for care from the sick population could be some distinctive traits within this community. Population movements between Ticul and high risk areas of Merida due to economic dynamics could also be a contributing factor. On the other hand, we did identify certain household risk conditions (storage of water [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], bathroom and kitchen outdoors) in Ticul that could help explain this particular situation. Window screening has been suggested as an important feature to prevent 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> from entering houses in Merida and potentially affect dengue transmission risk as well [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In this study, having ample coverage of screens in windows and doors was protective and urban programs should promote the inclusion of this preventive measure in houses in high risk areas [
