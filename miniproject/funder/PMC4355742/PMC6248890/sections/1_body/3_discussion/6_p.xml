<p>Limitations in our cohort are linked to the problems arising from the difficulties to engage family members and individuals in this kind of study. Losses to follow-up were higher in Merida and drop-out families were larger than those who stayed participating and it could generate under estimations of the risk of dengue in this city. The coincidence of chikungunya and Zika epidemics virus produced competing conditions for diagnosis and promoted intensive control interventions that eventually diminished our capacity to identify dengue cases or lower the transmission of dengue infection in the community. Nevertheless, the enhanced surveillance strategies allowed us to identify the three infections in our cohort. We did not perform entomological surveys to establish potential differences in vector densities by risk areas and these data could provide additional to support our findings. Screening of doors and windows may behave as a proxy of entomological risk since areas with this kind of protection are prone to have higher mosquito densities.</p>
