<p>Prospective studies have become crucial for understanding dengue transmission in urban settings and are invaluable in providing the data required to effectively evaluate the impact of traditional and innovative control strategies [

They are generally susceptible to dengue infection; can be involved and followed-up for longer periods through their attendance to nearby schools; their families are responsive and supportive to health initiatives arising from the educational institutions, and their households are near the school facilitating logistics for follow-up and allowing for a febrile and absentee school-based surveillance system [
