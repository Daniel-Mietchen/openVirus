<p>The multivariate analysis of children with blood results showed no difference by sex but dengue risk increased with age, being four times higher for those 9 to 15 years old compared to children under five years old. While parents reported very few cases of dengue in the previous year, the history of dengue was significant as well as the report of dengue confirmation by health personnel. Regarding the risks derived from household conditions obtained by the questionnaires: sharing the domestic space with other families increased the risk 1.7 times over the individual families that own or rented their house, and the risk of dengue was significantly higher when kitchen and bathroom were located outside the house. Protection with screens of windows showed a good level of protection only when screens cover all the windows. While bivariate analysis of the prevalence of dengue by urban areas showed discrete differences, the analysis combining areas of risk (Progreso and low risk Merida vs. medium risk Merida and Ticul, and high risk Merida alone) pointed out that risk of infection was significantly higher in the medium and high risk areas compared to those in the low level risk (
