<p>Seroprevalence of 0 to 15 years old was 46.8 (CI 95% 44.1–49.6). Overall seroprevalence to dengue showed no difference in females (53.9%, 95% CI: 50.4–57.4) compared to males (49.4%, 95% CI: 45.8–52.9) and differences by age group or city were not significant except in Ticul (61%, 95% CI: 53.9–67.9) for female vs male (49.4% 95% CI: 45.82–52.87). Seroprevalence increased with age and was significantly lower in 0 to 5 years old (26.9%, 95% CI:18.4–35.4) compared with children 6 to 8 years old (43.9%, 95% CI:40.1–47.7) and 9 to 15 years old (61.4%, 95% CI:58.0–64.8). Seroprevalence by age group and risk area showed significant differences between the 0 to 5 years old compared to the 9 to 15 years old in low risk Merida (15.8%, 95% CI: -0.61–32.2 vs 61.5%, 95% CI:53.2–69.9), medium risk Merida (13.3%, 95% CI:1.2–25.5 vs 66.2%, 95% CI:58.9–73.6) and Ticul (30%, 95% CI:1.6–58.4 vs 69.0%, 95% CI:62.3–75.6) but not in Progreso or high risk Merida. Differences between 6 to 8 years old and the 9 to 15 age groups were significant in all risk areas except Progreso (
