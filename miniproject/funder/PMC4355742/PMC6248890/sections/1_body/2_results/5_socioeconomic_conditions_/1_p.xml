<p>House property patterns in Yucatan showed that most of the houses were privately owned (70.5%), few were rented (4.5%) and 25% shared with other families (usually kin). Construction materials of walls, floor and roof were cement (&gt;95%) although palm roofs in Progreso (7.7%) and Ticul (7.9%) described particular socioeconomic conditions of some families participating in the study. Most of the houses (72%) had 2 to 3 rooms while 18.8% of houses in Ticul, low risk Merida (18.2%) and high risk Merida (15.9%) had 4 to 5 rooms. Protection with screens in doors and windows was a common practice in this region with almost 95% of houses with at least one door or window protected. The presence of kitchen and bathroom outside the house was much more common in Ticul (25.7% and 24.1% respectively) than in Progreso (3.3% and 12.6%) and the high risk area in Merida (7.7% and 12.6%). Access to potable water was also a common feature (&gt;90%) in the three cities but the need to store water for several domestic activities was also very common (45.9%) in all sites, particularly in Ticul that reported a higher need to store potable water (78%). Garbage collection was a widespread public service in the areas, although in Ticul, 19.4% of households reported the need to burn or throw away the garbage (
