<p>Our immunization strategies successfully produced panels of mouse mAbs recognizing all 3 CHIKV genotypes currently in circulation around the globe. This breakthrough is expected to facilitate overcoming the challenges reported with the previously developed CHIKV antigen-detection IC test [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which showed diminished sensitivity caused by a single amino acid substitution in the 6K-E1 protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Most of the new mAbs described here exhibit no cross-reactivity against other arboviruses (such as DENV and ZIKV) that induce similar clinical manifestations, nor against the closely related alphavirus SINV, which is currently the only other alphavirus (aside from CHIKV) that has been found in Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Examination of cross reactivity with other alphaviruses such as ONNV, MAYV, RRV, VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV revealed that two of the novel anti-E1 antibodies (3D11 and 15B2) lacked cross reactivity with any of the alphaviruses we examined. In addition, another two anti-E1 antibodies (19B8 and RC5-3) weakly cross-reacted only with the most closely related ONNV. We also identified two clones (11E11 and CK119) that displayed cross-reactivity against all the alphaviruses we examined; this property may be of use for further applications.
