<p>Although studies have been conducted on both human and mouse mAbs against CHIKV, most of that work focused on protective and therapeutic applications [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. One paper described the production and characterization of anti-CHIKV antibodies for diagnostic applications, but that study focused on the development of an anti-CHIKV E2 protein for use in an ELISA platform [

Although the IC device showed excellent performance against ECSA-genotype CHIKV, further improvement was needed for application in detecting CHIKV of the other two genotypes (WA and Asian); our previous study revealed that the low sensitivity of this IC test against WA and Asian stemmed from one of mAbs in the IC platform [
