<p>Our western blot results showed that, in contrast to the anti-CHIKV C mAbs, most of the anti-CHIKV E1 mAbs were unable to recognize CHIKV-infected Vero cell lysates separated under either reducing- or non-reducing conditions. This result suggested that the target of these mAbs is a conformational epitope that does not persist in the denatured protein. Although one mAb, 11E11, failed to recognize E1 under reducing conditions, this mAb was able to bind E1 protein under non-reducing conditions. Based on the sequence of the ECSA-genotype CHIKV (CP10 strain) used in the present analysis, we previously demonstrated that the correct folding of CHIKV E1 during maturation in the ER involves 16 cysteine residues that form eight disulfide bridges [

In the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, disulfide bonds will be reduced, resulting in tertiary structure destabilization of proteins containing disulfide bonds, and eventually leading to abolishment of these proteins’ immunological properties [

This fact may explain why one of our anti-E1 protein mAbs (clone 11E11) was able to react with the E1 protein only under non-reducing conditions. Unlike the E1 protein, the CHIKV capsid protein, a cytosolic protein, requires the activity of a chymotrypsin-like protease domain to facilitate protein folding; thus, maturation of the C protein depends on a autocatalytic cleavage event. Therefore, maturation of the C protein is independent of ER-acquired disulfide bond formation [
