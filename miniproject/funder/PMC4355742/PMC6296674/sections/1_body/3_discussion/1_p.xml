<p>In the present study, we generated mouse anti-CHIKV mAbs that have broad reactivity towards all three genotypes of CHIKV; such mAbs might be of great value for further diagnostic test development. Using three strategies of immunization in combination with hybridoma technology, we generated new panels of mouse mAbs against the CHIKV E1 and capsid structural proteins. These mAbs recognized all three genotypes of CHIKV currently responsible for chikungunya outbreaks worldwide. We also verified that four of our new mAbs lacked cross reactivity with or significantly less affinity for the most closely related alphavirus, ONNV.</p>
