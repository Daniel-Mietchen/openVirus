<p>In response to the continuing global spread of CHIKV, a diagnostic tool that can accurately detect CHIKV in a simple and inexpensive way is of high importance. Here, we reported the production and characterization of panels of mouse-derived mAbs against CHIKV structural proteins; members of these panels recognized the currently circulating genotypes of CHIKV, including the ECSA, ECSA-IOL, and Asian genotypes. The incorporation of these antibodies targeting CHIKV structural proteins into the IC device, as well as their use in IC evaluation, are in progress. These tools may represent great improvements for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of CHIKV infection.</p>
