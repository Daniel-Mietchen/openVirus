<p>Beyond the possibility of amino acid variations selected during immune evasion, increased immune responses, especially Ig-mediated responses, may directly impact the sensitivity of antibody-based immunodiagnostic platforms. As has been confirmed in the detection of the dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1), the dissociation of NS1 and an anti-NS1 antibody improved the sensitivity of an antigen detection assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Anti-CHIKV E2 antibodies are likely to be present in the circulation of CHIKV-infected individuals, given that the E2 protein has more B-cell epitopes than does E1. Therefore, in the present study, two immunization strategies, A and B, were employed with the intent of identifying anti-CHIKV E1 antibodies rather than anti-E2 antibodies. This approach was expected to minimize the chance of recognition failure caused by mutation due to viral evolutionary forces, as well as avoiding potential interference by immune complexes.
