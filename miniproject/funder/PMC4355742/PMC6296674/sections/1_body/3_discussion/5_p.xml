<p>Among the three immunization strategies employed in the present study, immunization strategy A did not result in any single clone isolates when screening against cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the Asian-genotype CHIKV 6K-E1 protein (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208851.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). In the field of immunogen design in vaccine development, the whole organism (in theory) provides enhanced immunogenicity and evokes stronger immune reactions than those evoked by partial sub-units of the pathogen [

It is thus likely that immunization employing two rounds of boosting with SeV-infected cells increased the immune response against SeV but not that against CHIKV. In immunization strategy B, SeV/Asian-genotype 6K-E1 was administered to a mouse previously dosed twice with whole inactivated CHIKV, resulting in the generation of several clones that recognized the E1 protein (
