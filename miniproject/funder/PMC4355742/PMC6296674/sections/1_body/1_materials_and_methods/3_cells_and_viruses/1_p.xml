<p>African green monkey kidney epithelium-derived cells (Vero cells; ATCC CCL-81), glioblastoma-derived human cell line U251 (JCRB IFO50288), and BALB/c mouse-derived B7 cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Life Technologies, Inc., USA). The Human Embryonic Kidney cell line (HEK293T; ATCC CRL-3216) and the Baby Hamster Kidney fibroblast cell line (BHK; ATCC CCL-10) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies). The Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Makoto Takeda at the National Institute of Infectious Disease in Japan and was maintained in RPMI medium. PAI, a mouse myeloma cell line [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], was maintained in RPMI medium. For normal cultivation conditions, the base medium was supplemented to 10% (v/v) with heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Life Technologies); for cultivation of infected cells, the base medium was supplemented only to 2% FBS. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> environment. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>-derived cells (C6/36) were cultivated in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Hyclone; GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) supplemented to 10% FBS and 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) (Becton Dickinson, Franklin, NJ).
