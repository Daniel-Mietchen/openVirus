<p>CHIKV CP10 and Ross Low psg strains were used as representatives of the ECSA genotype, while ARUBA-1125 [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was used as a representative of the Asian genotype. One alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV; R68 strain), was kindly provided by Dr. Kohji Moriishi, University of Yamanashi. Alphaviruses O’nyong’nyong virus (ONNV, strain Ahero), Mayaro virus (MAYV, strain TC652), Ross River virus (RRV, strain 0005281v), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV, strains 78v and TrD), Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV, strain H178/99), SINV (strain EGAR339), and Western Equine Encephalitic virus (WEEV, strain H160/99) were purchased from National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (Public Health England, UK). Four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV; using strains Mochizuki, 16681, H87, and H241 as representatives of the DENV1 to DENV4 serotypes, respectively) were used to assess cross-reactivity. We propagated CHIKV, SINV, and DENV in Vero, BHK, and C6/36 cells, respectively.
