<p>To screen and determine the reactivity of anti-CHIKV mAbs, plasmids encoding CHIKV envelope and capsid proteins were employed as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, a codon-optimized complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding CHIKV C protein (37997 strain; NCBI Accession No. AY726732.1) and the envelope protein for each of the three genotypes of CHIKV (ECSA: CP10 strain, NCBI Accession No. AB857817.1; WA: 37997 strain, NCBI Accession No. AY726732.1; and Asian: CK12-686 strain, NCBI Accession No. CWIH01000001.1) were commercially synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). Notably, the synthetic cDNAs for the envelope protein genes of CP10 and 37997 strains were designed to encode the proteins with HA tags at their C-termini. To express the C or envelope proteins (expressed either as E3-E2-6K-E1, 6K-E1, or 6K), these cassette cDNAs were inserted (individually) into the expression plasmid pCAGGS MCSII [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To generate a plasmid encoding E1 without 6K, we inserted the sequence encoding HA-tagged E1 into pFUSE2ss-CLIg-mk (an IL2 signal sequence-providing plasmid) using flanking EcoRI and NheI sites (Invivogen, USA). To study the reactivity of mAbs towards envelope proteins harboring an amino acid substitution, we used overlapping primers (as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) to introduce mutations into the DNA sequence encoding amino acid 350 of the CHIKV 6K-E1 protein. Specifically, a mutant version of the CP10 gene was generated to encode a glutamic acid-to-aspartic acid substitution (E350D), while mutant versions of the 37997 and CK12-686 genes were generated to encode an aspartic acid-to-glutamic acid substitution (D350E).
