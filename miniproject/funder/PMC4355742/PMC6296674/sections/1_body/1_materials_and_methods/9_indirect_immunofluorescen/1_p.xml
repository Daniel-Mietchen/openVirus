<p>To determine reactivity and cross-reactivity of mAbs, we performed IIFT according to the procedure described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To test reactivity, we prepared 96-well plates containing Vero cells infected with CHIKV or HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding CHIKV envelope or C proteins. To test cross-reactivity, we prepared 96-well plates containing one of the following: BHK cells infected with SINV virus, or Vero cells infected with ONNV, MAYV, RRV, VEEV, EEEV, SINV, or WEEV. We also prepared 96-well plates containing Vero cells infected with each of the four serotypes of DENV or with Zika virus (ZIKV) (SV0010/15; kindly provided by Akanitt Jittmittraphap, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University). After an 80% cytopathic effect was observed (in viral infection) or at 48 hours post-transfection, infected or transfected cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with formaldehyde (3.7% (v/v) in PBS), and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (1% (v/v) in water). After another 3 rounds of washing with PBS, 50 μL of primary antibody (culture supernatant for screening, or purified anti-CHIKV mAbs (2 μg/mL) for characterization) was applied to the infected or transfected cells and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The liquid was removed by aspiration and PBS was added to each well three times to ensure that the unbound antibody was removed. Fifty microliters of the secondary antibody (green-fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 488; Invitrogen) -conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG) was dispensed into each well and the plates were incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C, followed by another washing step. To detect HA-tagged protein in plasmid-transfected cells, cells were incubated with 50 μL of rat anti-HA peptide mAb (0.5 μg/mL high-affinity anti-HA antibody; Roche Applied Sciences) for 1 hour, followed by incubation with red-fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 555; Invitrogen) -conjugated goat-anti rat IgG for another hour. To visualize cell nuclei, 50 μL of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Sigma-Aldrich) (1 μg/mL in PBS) was dispensed into each well. The reactivity of the anti-CHIKV antibody, reactivity of the anti-HA antibody, and presence of nuclei, indicated by green (excitation/emission at 488 and 525 nm, respectively), red (555 nm/568 nm), and blue (360 nm/460 nm) fluorescence, respectively, were observed using a fluorescence microscope (IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan or Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany, or ECLIPSE Ti2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images from IIFT experiments with multiple fluorescent colors were overlaid using ImageJ 1.5Oi (National Institutes of Health USA).
