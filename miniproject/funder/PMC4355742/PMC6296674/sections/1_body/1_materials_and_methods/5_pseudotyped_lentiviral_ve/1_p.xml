<p>To increase the efficacy, safety, and convenience of the neutralization assay, a well-established pseudotyped lentiviral system was employed. The construction of CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector was performed as described previously by Kishishita 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], with some modifications. Briefly, a mixture containing three plasmids [pCAGGS MCSII containing a cDNA encoding CHIKV Asian-genotype CK12-686 (2.6 μg); pLenti CMV Puro LUC (w168-1), which carries a firefly 
 <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene (9 μg); and psPAX2, a lentivirus packaging vector (9 μg)] was prepared in one milliliter of serum-free DMEM medium. The plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using a nucleic acid delivery reagent, polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences, Inc.; Warrington, PA). The resulting transfected HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for another 48 hours. Culture supernatant containing CHIKV envelope protein-pseudotyped lentivirus was harvested, and the viral titer was determined by measuring the level of HIV-1 gag p24 protein using the RETROtek HIV-1 p24 antigen ELISA kit (ZeptoMetrix; Buffalo, NY), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
