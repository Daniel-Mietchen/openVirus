<p>Mouse mAbs against CHIKV were generated according to the procedure described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with some modifications, Briefly, three mice (BALB/c CrSIc, 4 weeks, female, specific pathogen free, 15–20 g each; Japan SLC, Inc.) were used for immunization. Each mouse was housed individually in a plastic mouse cage (KN-600, Natsume Seisakusho Co., Ltd.) with paper chips (Paper clean, Japan SLC, Inc.) and free access to rodent diet (CE-2, CLEA Japan Inc.) and water in a standard laboratory environment. Body weights were recorded once weekly; no abnormalities were observed during the in-life interval. Three distinct immunization strategies (A, B, and C) were employed in each of the three mice (

 <sup>6</sup> cells) infected with ECSA-genotype CHIKV or SeV expressing the Asian-genotype CHIKV 6K-E1 were mixed with an equal volume of complete (for priming) or incomplete (for boosting) Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). In all three strategies, mice were prime-immunized intraperitoneally with ECSA-genotype-infected B7 cells and boosted at two-week intervals. In strategy A, the mouse was boosted twice with B7 cells infected with SeV expressing the Asian-genotype CHIKV 6K-E1. In strategy B, the mouse was boosted once with ECSA-infected B7 cells, followed by B7 cells infected with SeV expressing the CHIKV Asian-genotype 6K-E1. In strategy C, the mouse was boosted twice with CHIKV ECSA-infected B7 cells. Three days after the final booster, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation performed by a well-trained personnel and the spleens were harvested and processed. Hybridomas were generated by fusing splenocytes from individual mice with PAI fusion partner cells, a process facilitated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1500 (Roche Applied Sciences, Germany). To select hybridomas, fused cells were seeded in 96-well plates and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and hypoxanthine-thymidine (HT) (Invitrogen). The culture medium was changed every three days for two weeks. Culture supernatants from successfully fused cells were subjected to primary screening, using an indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT), to identify hybridomas secreting CHIKV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig). Cells positive in the primary IIFT screen then were subjected to limiting dilution to isolate single parental cells that produced mAbs. All selected parental cells were subjected to a second round of screening prior to being scaled up.
