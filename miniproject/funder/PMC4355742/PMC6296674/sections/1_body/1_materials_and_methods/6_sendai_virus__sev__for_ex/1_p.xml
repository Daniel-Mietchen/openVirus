<p>The construction of a recombinant SeV expressing foreign genes was performed as described previously [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, the 6K-E1-encoding codon-optimized gene of CHIKV Asian-genotype strain CK12-686 was inserted into the parental pSeV18b(+) plasmid [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] at the NotI site, yielding a construct capable of generating a SeV expressing the Asian-genotype CHIKV 6K-E1 protein. The resulting construct (5 μg) and plasmids encoding viral nucleocapsid (N) and RNA polymerase (P and L) trans-acting proteins (pGEM-N, 2 μg; pGEM-P, 1 μg; and pGEM-L, 2 μg, respectively) were cotransfected into a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line (CHO) infected with a vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The resulting cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% FBS for another 72 hours. SeV expressing CHIKV 6K-E1 envelope protein then was propagated in embryonated chicken eggs for another two passages and used for further experiments.
