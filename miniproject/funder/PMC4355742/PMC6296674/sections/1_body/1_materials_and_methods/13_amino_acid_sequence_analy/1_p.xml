<p>To determine amino acid variation of the CHIKV C protein among genotypes, we retrieved representative CHIKV capsid protein sequences from the NCBI database. For CHIKV Asian-genotype strain ARUBA-1125, the amino acid sequence was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the viral genome. A double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated from the viral RNA of a low-passage isolate of CHIKV strain ARUBA-1125 using primer pCMV-CHIK-R (
 <monospace>TGCCATGCCGACCCTGAACATTA</monospace>) for reverse transcription and primer pair CHIKV-5605F (
 <monospace>AGCGACTGGTCCACGTGCT</monospace>) and CHIK-R-long (
 <monospace>GAAATATTAAAAACAAAATAACATCTCCTACGTCCCTGT</monospace>) for PCR-amplification. The nucleotide sequence of the C protein gene in the amplified fragment was determined using primers 7449F (
 <monospace>TCAGAGGACCCGTCATAACC</monospace>), 7817F (
 <monospace>CCAAAAAGAAACCGGTTCAA</monospace>), and 8435R (
 <monospace>TTCTCCGGCTCTTTTTCGTA</monospace>). The capsid protein-encoding DNA sequence then was translated to yield the amino acid sequence. Multiple sequence alignment was performed to compare amino acid variations among representative strains from all three genotypes using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) software, version 7.0 [
