<p>We prepared two different kinds of immunogens: B7 cells infected with ECSA-genotype CHIKV and those infected with SeV expressing the Asian-genotype CHIKV 6K-E1 protein. Briefly, confluent B7 cells were seeded in 10-cm culture dishes at approximately 6.5 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/dish and grown overnight. ECSA-genotype CHIKV (at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1) or SeV expressing the Asian-genotype CHIKV 6K-E1 (at a MOI of 10) was inoculated to the B7 cells for two days or until cell-infection rates exceeding 90% were observed. Infected cells were collected and washed by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min) with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After the supernatant was discarded, the cells were resuspended in 10 mL of 0.4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and the suspension was incubated at 4°C for 48 hours. Paraformaldehyde-treated cells then were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. After the final washing, the infected B7 cells were resuspended at 2.5 x 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/mL in PBS and held at -80°C pending use in mouse immunization.
