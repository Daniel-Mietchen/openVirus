<p>To determine the linear epitopes recognized by the mAbs, western blot analysis was performed. CHIKV- or mock-infected cell lysates were mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer under reducing or non-reducing conditions (with or without β-mercaptoethanol, respectively) and heated at 95°C for 5 min. Prepared samples and pre-stained protein marker (10–250 kDa, Kaleidoscope; Bio-Rad) were separated in a 4–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (NuPAGE, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred onto methanol-pretreated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). To prevent non-specific binding, membranes with transferred proteins then were incubated with 5% (w/v) skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour, with gentle agitation, at room temperature. The membrane then was cut into small slices and reacted with individual anti-CHIKV mAbs (culture supernatant (1:2 v/v) or purified mAb (2 μg/mL)) in blocking buffer, overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, individual slices were washed three times (5 min each) with TBST and then incubated for 1 hour in the presence of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL antibody; SeraCare Life Science, Inc., Mildford, MA), diluted 1:10,000 (v/v) in blocking buffer. After another three washes with TBST, the reactivity of mAbs to CHIKV protein was detected by chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham ECL western blot; GE Healthcare) and imaged using a charge-coupled device (CCD) imager (ImmageQuant LAS 500; GE Healthcare).</p>
