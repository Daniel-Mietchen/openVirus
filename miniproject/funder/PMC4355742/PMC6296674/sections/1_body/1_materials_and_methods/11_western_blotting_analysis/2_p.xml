<p>Besides CHIKV-infected cells lysates, our mAbs also were tested against two other types of antigen: plasmid-transfected cells lysates and viral (CHIKV) particles. To generate plasmid-transfected cell lysates, plasmid encoding CHIKV C protein was prepared. Two hundred and fifty microliters of a mixture of plasmid (2 Î¼g) and PEI nucleic acid delivery reagent (Polysciences, Inc.) were transfected into each well of a 6-well plate containing HEK293T cells. At 72 hours post-transfection, cells were lysed using NP-40 lysis buffer. Viral particles were isolated from the culture medium by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 x g for 2.5 hours (Optima MAX-XP; Beckman-Coulter, IN, USA) and viral titers were adjusted to 2 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) per mL with PBS. Subsequent western blotting analyses with the cell lysates and particles were performed as described above.
