<p>To determine the neutralizing activity of anti-CHIKV envelope proteins, a system of pseudotyped lentiviral particles harboring a 
 <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter gene and CHIKV envelope proteins was employed in a neutralization test [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Individual anti-CHIKV E1 mAbs (0.7 mg/mL) were subjected to a four-fold serial dilution, yielding mAb at concentrations ranging from 1:200 to 1:204800. Pseudotyped lentivirus bearing Asian-genotype CHIKV envelope proteins were pre-incubated for 2 hours with each set of mAb dilutions prior to infection of U251 cells. Infected cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 2% (v/v) FBS for another 72 hours. Finally, culture medium was replaced with 100 Î¼L of PBS and an equal volume of luciferase assay reagent (Bright-Glo Luciferase assay system; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added prior to quantifying luminescence using a Synergy H1 microplate reader with Gen5 software (Biotek Winooski, VT, USA). Neutralizing activity of anti-CHIKV envelope protein against the pseudotyped lentivirus was determined as the percentage of infection of pseudotyped lentivirus, calculated using the following equation: (relative luciferase units (RLUs) of cells infected with pseudotyped lentivirus and mAb mixture divided by RLUs of cells infected with pseudotyped lentivirus alone) x 100%.
