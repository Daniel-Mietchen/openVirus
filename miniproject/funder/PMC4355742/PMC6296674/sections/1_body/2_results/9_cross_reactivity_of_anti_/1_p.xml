<p>We evaluated (using IIFT) the cross-reactivity of the newly isolated anti-CHIKV mAbs against the closely related alphaviruses ONNV, MAYV, RRV, VEEV, EEEV, SINV, and WEEV (

This result is consistent with the fact that the C proteins of CHIKV and ONNV share more than 88% identity at the amino acid level, and that E1 proteins in these 2 viruses share more than 87% amino acid identity. However, it is a surprising that CK47 cross-reacted with ONNV, RRV, and two strains of VEEV (
