<p>We then evaluated the cross-reactivity of the newly isolated anti-CHIKV mAbs against flaviviruses [including DENV serotype 1 (Mochizuki), 2 (16681), 3 (H87), and 4 (H241), as well as ZIKV (SV0010/15)] that have overlapping geographical and clinical presentations with CHIKV. mAb 4G2 was used as a positive control for detection of DENV and ZIKV. Notably, despite their broad reactivity towards all 3 CHIKV genotypes, none of our mAbs displayed apparent cross-reactivity against DENV or ZIKV (
