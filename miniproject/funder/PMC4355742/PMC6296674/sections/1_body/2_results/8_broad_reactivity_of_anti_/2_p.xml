<p>We then tested (using IIFT) reactivity of the anti-C mAbs towards the different genotypes of CHIKV. Notably, two of these five mAbs (clones 24B3 and 26A2) displayed broad reactivity towards Vero cells infected with CHIKV CP10 (ECSA-IOL), Ross Low psg (ECSA), or ARUBA-1125 (Asian) strains. The other three mAbs (clones 32A3, 37C7, and 41G5) showed slightly stronger reactivity against the ECSA genotype, especially the CP10 strain, than against the ARUBA-1125 strains (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208851.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Among the three genotypes, the WA genotype showed the highest level of amino acid variation in the C protein compared with the prototype. To determine whether our anti-C mAbs also react with the WA capsid, we constructed a plasmid expressing the WA-genotype (37997 strain) CHIKV C protein and tested reactivity of anti-C mAbs against the transfected cells. We found that all of the anti-C mAb clones were able to recognize the WA-genotype C protein, despite the numbers of amino acid variations in the WA C protein (
