<p>To know whether the newly generated anti-capsid mAbs also show broad reactivity against all three CHIKV genotypes, we first examined reported variations among the C proteins of different CHIKV strains. The CHIKV C protein comprises 261 amino acid residues. The N-terminal 113 residues are involved in viral RNA binding as well as nucleocapsid oligomerization. The C-terminal portion, extending from residues 114 to 261, forms capsomeres and is present in the outer shell, covering the nucleocapsid core [

To explore amino acid variation of the C protein among CHIKV of different genotypes, we retrieved (from the NCBI database) the amino acid sequence of this protein in CHIKV strains selected to represent each genotype, and subjected these protein sequences to multiple sequence alignment. We also determined the nucleotide sequence of the C-encoding gene of the ARUBA-1125 strain of CHIKV and incorporated the corresponding deduced amino acid sequence into the multiple alignment. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, using the C protein from the prototypical CHIKV S27 strain as the reference sequence, we observed amino acid variation among the 3 genotypes at 6.13% (16 out of 261) of the residues. Of those positions with variation, two (residues 23 and 27) occurred in ECSA and ECSA-IOL strains, five (residues 37, 55, 63, 78, and 93) occurred in Asian strains, and nine (20, 71, 74, 77, 80â€“82, 99 and 124) occurred in WA strains. Interestingly, all but one of these amino acid variations (15 out of 113 positions, 13.3% variation rate) were located within the N-terminal 113 residues, which function primarily in RNA binding. In contrast, only a single amino acid variation (at position 124; 1 out of 148 positions, or 0.7% variation rate) mapped to the C-terminus, which contributes to the outer shell of the virion; this variation was present only in the WA genotype.
