<p>Finally, these mAbs were used as probes in western blot analysis of reactivity towards all three genotypes of CHIKV. For ECSA and Asian genotypes, viral particles of the CP10 and ARUBA-1125 strains, respectively, were normalized to 1x10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL and subjected to western blot analysis under reducing conditions. Since a live WA-genotype virus was not available in the present study, we used a lysate of cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the capsid protein of CHIKV strain 37997 for this analysis. Our western blot results showed that these mAbs strongly recognized C protein (a band running at 35 kD), both in samples of live virus (ECSA and Asian genotypes;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that all five anti-C mAbs exhibited broad reactivity towards all three genotypes of CHIKV. Furthermore, two of the five mAbs showed no apparent difference in reactivity against the C proteins from CHIKVs of different genotypes.
