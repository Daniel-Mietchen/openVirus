<p>We then examined reactivity (using IIFT) against cells transfected with plasmids expressing full-length CHIKV envelope proteins (E3-E2-6K-E1) from each CHIKV genotype, including those from ECSA (strain CP10), WA (strain 37997), and Asian (strain CK12-686) genotypes. We found that all six clones of the newly generated anti-E1 mAbs exhibited comparable binding activity towards each of the three genotypes, although there were small differences in reactivities among the clones (
