<p>We previously showed that CK47 reacted strongly with 6K-E1 protein harboring a glutamic acid (E) at amino acid position 350 but only reacted weakly with 6K-E1 protein harboring an aspartic acid (D) at this position [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We further explored the binding reactivity of our newly produced mAbs towards 6K-E1 proteins selectively mutated at amino acid 350. Specifically, plasmids encoding mutant CHIKV envelope proteins (E3-E2-6K-E1) of each of the three genotypes (E350D-mutated ECSA-genotype 6K-E1 protein, and D350E-mutated WA- and Asian-genotypes 6K-E1 proteins [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) were transfected into 293T cells, and mAb reactivity then was examined by IIFT together with the semi-quantitative measurement of the signal detected in individual photos (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g006">Fig 6</xref>). CK47 was used as a reference for 350E-restricted reactivity, while CK119 was used as the transfection control. As expected, CK47 demonstrated low reactivity against cells transfected with the plasmids encoding 6K-E1 with D at position 350 (including the ECSA mutant (6K-E1 E350D) and the unmutated WA and Asian 6K-E1 proteins) compared to reactivity against cells transfected with the plasmids encoding 6K-E1 with E at position 350 (including the unmutated ECSA protein and the WA and Asian mutants (6K-E1 D350E)). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g006">Fig 6</xref>, reactivity against 6K-E1 proteins of the new mAbs were not affected by mutation at amino acid 350.
