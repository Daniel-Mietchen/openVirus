<p>To determine whether our newly generated mAbs against CHIKV E1 protein (3D11, 11E11, 13H11, 15B2, 19B8, and RC5-3) showed broad-spectrum reactivity towards all three CHIKV genotypes, we first tested their reactivity (using IIFT) against Vero cells infected by each of three strains of CHIKV: CHIKV CP10 (ECSA-IOL), Ross Low psg (ECSA), and ARUBA-1125 (Asian) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g002">Fig 2</xref>, the reactivity of individual mAbs towards CHIKV-infected cells varied among clones. However, each of the newly produced anti-CHIKV E1 mAbs, as well as CK119, showed comparable reactivity towards the CP10, Ross Low psg, and ARUBA-1125 strains (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208851.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). In contrast, CK47 strongly reacted with CP10 but only weakly reacted with Ross Low psg and ARUBA-1125, as we reported previously [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208851.s004">S3 Fig</xref>), although CK47 showed reactivity against ARUBA-1125 comparable to that obtained with the newly generated mAbs. It is possible that epitopes recognized by the newly generated mAbs are masked by immobilization and/or blocking procedures of the ELISA protocol, although the epitope recognized by CK47 was not affected by those procedures (given that CK47 previously was shown to react strongly with immobilized CHIKV in ELISA) [
