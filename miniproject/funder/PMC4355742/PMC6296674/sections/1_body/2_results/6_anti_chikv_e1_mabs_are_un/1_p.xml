<p>Six anti-CHIKV E1 mAb clones were tested for their ability to neutralize viral infection at the entry step. For this purpose, we employed a system of pseudotyped lentiviral particles harboring a 
 <italic>luciferase</italic> reporter and envelope proteins of Asian-genotype CHIKV (strain CK12-686). Four-fold serial dilutions of mAbs, at concentrations ranging from 1:200 to 1:204800, were prepared and individually incubated with pseudotyped lentiviral particles prior to infection of U251 cells. Anti-CHIKV E1 antibody (clone CK47), previously shown to exhibit neutralizing activity in this particular assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], was used as a positive control, while anti-CHIKV C protein antibody (clone 24B3) was used as a negative control. Viral infection following pre-incubation with mAbs was normalized against infection following pre-incubation without mAbs (
