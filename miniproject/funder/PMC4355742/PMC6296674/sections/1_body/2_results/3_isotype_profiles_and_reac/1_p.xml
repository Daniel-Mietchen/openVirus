<p>The fifteen selected clones derived from strategies B and C were subjected to Ig subtyping. As detailed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the isotype profile of Ig heavy and light chains was performed using a commercial isotyping kit. Among the 15 selected clones, 66.7% (10 clones) were IgG1, 13.3% (2 clones) were IgG2a, and 6.7% (1 clone) each were IgG2b, IgM, and IgA. All of the clones produced kappa (Îº) light chains. We excluded 6B6 (IgA) and 35B7 (IgM) from the subsequent analyses since our aim was to obtain IgG antibodies against CHIKV. The reactivities of the remaining 13 antibody clones towards CHIKV-infected Vero cells are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Although the binding affinity of individual mAbs towards CHIKV-infected cells varied among clones, all 13 clones showed positive reactions. There was a tendency for the antibodies obtained from strategy C (24B3, 26A2, 32A3, 37C7, and 41G5) to show stronger staining than did the antibodies obtained from strategy B (3D11, 4E3, 9E3, 11E11, 13H11, 15B2, 19B8, and RC5-3).
