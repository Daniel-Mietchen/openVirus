<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the mAbs generated in the present study recognized proteins of different sizes. To confirm their binding specificity, we first tested (by IIFT) reactivity of the mAbs from strategy B with cells transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged full-length (E3-E2-6K-E1) or truncated (6K-E1, 6K, or E1) versions of the CHIKV (CP10-strain) envelope protein. We excluded clones 4E3 and 9E3 from this assay, given those mAbsâ€™ relatively low reactivity in IIFT and lack of specific binding in western blot analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208851.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, in accordance with the control anti-CHIKV E1 (clone CK47), our IIFT results demonstrated that mAbs 3D11, 11E11, 13H11, 15B2, 19B8, and RC5-3 were able to recognize cells transfected with plasmids encoding CHIKV envelope proteins, including E3-E2-6K-E1, 6K-E1, and E1. Notably, none of the anti-CHIKV mAbs tested here recognized the (HA-tagged) 6K protein, the expression of which was confirmed by staining with an anti-HA antibody.
