<p>Taken together, these data demonstrated the successful production of two panels of mAbs with reactivity against structural proteins of CHIKV. Specifically, mAbs derived from immunization strategy B targeted the E1 protein, while those derived from strategy C targeted the C protein. Results from western blot analysis of CHIKV-infected cells and IIFT of plasmid-transfected cells also are summarized in
