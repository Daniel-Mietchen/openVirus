<p>We next used IIFT to confirm the targets of the mAbs derived from strategy C. Purified mAbs of five such clones (24B3, 26A2, 32A3, 37C7, and 41G5) were tested for reactivity against cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the CHIKV C protein (CP10 strain). As expected, each of these 5 clones recognized the CHIKV C protein (

Luciferase counts within culture supernatants expressed from a co-transfected luciferase-secreting plasmid (pMetLuc-Control, Ready-To-Glow Secreted Luciferase Reporter Assay, Takara Bio USA, Inc.) verified that transfection efficiency was virtually the same among different wells in the 96-well plates (
