<p>To determine the linear epitopes targeted by the new mAbs, western blot analysis was conducted under reducing (R) and non-reducing (N) conditions. Specifically, proteins of CHIKV (CP10 strain) -infected Vero cell lysates boiled in the presence and absence of Î²-mercaptoethanol (R and N, respectively) were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes; the resulting blots were probed with individual mAb-containing culture supernatants. One mAb derived from strategy B (clone 11E11) reacted with an approximately 48-kDa protein, corresponding to CHIKV E1, under non-reducing conditions (

On the other hand, 5 clones obtained via strategy B (3D11, 4E3, 9E3, 19B8, RC3-5, and 13H11) reacted with neither CHIKV-infected nor mock-infected cell lysates. However, one clone derived from strategy B (15B2) reacted with several proteins from both CHIKV-infected and mock-infected cell lysates (
