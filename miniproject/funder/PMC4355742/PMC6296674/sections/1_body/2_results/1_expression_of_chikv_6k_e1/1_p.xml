<p>The SeV vector is a powerful tool for gene delivery/expression and has been used to express a number of exogenous genes [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the study presented here, we employed the SeV vector for expression of CHIKV envelope 6K-E1 proteins for use in mouse immunization. Prior to production of recombinant SeV encoding CHIKV 6K-E1, a synthetic 6K-E1-encoding region from an Asian-genotype CHIKV was subcloned into the pCEP4 expression plasmid. The expression of 6K-E1 protein from the resulting plasmid (pCEP4/CK12-686 6K-E1) was confirmed by a positive reaction in IIFT using an anti-CHIKV E1 protein antibody (mAb CK119) [
