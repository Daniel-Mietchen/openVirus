<p>To ensure that all positive clones retained the function of antibody production during the scaling-up process, culture supernatants of clones were tested with the same antigen as that used in the primary and secondary screenings. For clones derived from strategy B, 35.3% (12/34) displayed strong reactivity against cells transfected with a plasmid encoding Asian-genotype 6K-E1 protein. None of the clones reacted with mock-transfected HEK293T cells, but 17.6% (6/34) showed cross-reactivity with SINV. For clones derived from strategy C, 64.7% (11/17) exhibited strong reactivity against cells infected with the CP10 virus; one clone (5.9%, 1/17) reacted with uninfected Vero cells, and 64.7% (11/17) displayed cross-reactivity to SINV. For further characterization, we selected nine and six clones derived from immunization strategies B and C, respectively, based on their strength of reactivity and specificity (the 3
