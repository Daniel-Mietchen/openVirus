<p>Three immunization strategies (designated A, B, and C) were employed using each of 3 mice (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208851.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). The fusion efficiency between splenocytes and PAI cells was assessed as the ability of cells to grow in the HAT selective medium. We observed fusion efficiencies of more than 50% in all three strategies (

In the primary screen to identify anti-CHIKV Ig-positive clones, culture supernatants from clones generated from strategies A and B were tested by IIFT for reactivity against HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the Asian-genotype 6K-E1 protein (pCEP4/CK12-686 6K-E1). Supernatants of clones obtained by strategy C were screened for reactivity against CHIKV (CP10 strain) -infected Vero cells. Immunization strategy C gave the highest number of CHIKV-specific Ig clones (21 clones), followed by B (19 clones) and A (2 clones) (
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Compared to virus-infected cells, plasmid-transfected cells had lower levels of antigen expression. Since we screened clones from immunization strategy B with plasmid-transfected cells, we may have missed clones expressing antibodies with relatively low affinity for CHIKV.
