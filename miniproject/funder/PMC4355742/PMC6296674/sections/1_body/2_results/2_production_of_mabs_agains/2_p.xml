<p>To obtain single antibody-producing cells, we performed limiting dilution on all positive clones. From each, 16 subclones were subjected to secondary screening by IIFT with the same antigen as that used in the primary screen. Secondary screening of the 32 strategy-A clones (derived from the 2 clones generated by strategy A) failed to detect a single positive hybridoma. On the other hand, secondary screening of the clones obtained from strategies B and C yielded 11.18% (34/304) and 5.04% (17/337) positive clones, respectively (
