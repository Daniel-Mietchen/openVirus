<p>Here, we describe the successful generation and characterization of superior anti-CHIKV mAbs targeting the E1 and C proteins of CHIKV. These mAbs were shown to exhibit broad reactivity towards all genotypes currently in circulation around the globe. Given these promising properties, these new mAbs might be further applied to the development of an improved CHIKV antigen-detection diagnostic test.</p>
