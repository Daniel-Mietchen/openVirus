<p>Both the structural and non-structural proteins of CHIKV have been reported to contain B-cell epitopes. However, E2 and (to a lesser extent) nsP3 contain the epitopes most frequently targeted by antibodies from infected individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Studies of alphaviruses have indicated that the recognition of the E1 protein by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) depends on several conditions, including the dissociation of the E2-E1 heterodimer [
