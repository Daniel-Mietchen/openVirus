<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arthritogenic mosquito-borne virus, was first documented more than six decades ago in Tanzania, East Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since then, CHIKV has caused sporadic outbreaks throughout the African and Asian continents. Although only one serotype of CHIKV exists, the virus is classified into three genotypes named after the geographical location where the respective genotype was first recognized: East/Central/South/African (ECSA), West African (WA), and Asian [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CHIKV was considered a neglected tropical agent until a massive outbreak was reported on islands of the Indian Ocean in 2005. The outbreak affected one-third of the population in this region and caused more than 200 mortalities [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although the causative agent was shown to originate from the ECSA genotype, in-depth analysis confirmed that this virus showed characteristic genomic microevolution, and so isolates of this clade were designated as ECSA genotype Indian Ocean Lineage (ECSA-IOL) [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Following its initial detection in the Indian Ocean islands, ECSA-IOL also was identified as the cause of several CHIKV outbreaks in India and South East Asia (including Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia), and ECSA-IOL was introduced for the first time into European countries (including Italy and France) [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, Asian-genotype CHIKV subsequently gave rise to a novel clade, designated as Asian/American [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This clade now is considered a public health concern in several countries/territories in the Caribbean and in the Central American mainland [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Approximately one billion people are estimated to live in areas where CHIKV is in circulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, despite originally being considered a tropical infectious agent, CHIKV is now considered a global health challenge. As of 2018, there is no specific treatment for chikungunya disease, and a chikungunya vaccine is still under development [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Given these limitations in prevention and control, it is highly likely that CHIKV (along with its insect vector) will continue to spread, increasing the risk of CHIKV infection world-wide.
