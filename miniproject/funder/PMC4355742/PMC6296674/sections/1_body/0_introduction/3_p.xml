<p>CHIKV E1 protein consists of approximately 439 aa residues (CHIKV reference strain, S27 strain, Accession Number NC004162.2). CHIKV E1 protein is a type-I transmembrane protein comprising three domains: DI, DII, and DIII. The central domain, DI, contains two long insertions that form DII, a domain that includes a hydrophobic fusion loop. DIII connects to DI via a linker region and to a transmembrane region that attaches the co-domain of the E1 protein to the viral membrane [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. E2-E1 heterodimers form on the surface of the intact virion, such that DII of the CHIKV E1 protein lies laterally alongside E2, with the fusion loop of E1 buried in the groove-forming domains A and B of E2 [
