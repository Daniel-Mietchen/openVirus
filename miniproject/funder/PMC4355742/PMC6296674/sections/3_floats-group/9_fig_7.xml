  <title>Broad reactivity of anti-CHIKV capsid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the amino acid variation among genotypes.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(a)</bold> Amino acid variation of CHIKV capsid protein. To analyze amino acid variation among genotypes, multiple sequence alignment was performed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) software, version 7.0. The first 131 amino acid residues shown in bold indicate the N-terminal portion, while the remaining residues (aa 132â€“261) correspond to the C-terminal portion of the CHIKV capsid protein. The amino acids highlighted in yellow, green, and blue indicate the ECSA-, WA-, and Asian-genotype-specific amino acid residues. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Reactivity test of anti-CHIKV capsid protein mAbs towards the WA genotype by indirect immunofluorescence test. Five mAbs were tested against HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding the CHIKV capsid protein of the WA genotype. 19B02 was used as an anti-C control antibody. Cells that reacted with the 2
   <sup>nd</sup> antibody only were used as a negative control. The reactivity of each mAb was detected by the green labeling indicating Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Images were taken under 40x objective magnification using an Axio observer Z.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss). 
   <bold>(c)</bold> Linear epitope-binding profiles of anti-CHIKV capsid protein antibodies by western blot analysis. The five indicated mAbs were tested against concentrated chikungunya virions of ECSA (CP10 strain) and Asian (ARUBA-1125) -genotype viruses under reducing conditions. Concentrated culture supernatants of mock-infected cells served as a negative control (Mock). 
   <bold>(d)</bold> The five indicated mAbs were tested against the lysate of HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the CHIKV capsid protein of the WA genotype (37997 stain) or mock-transfected cells. Antibody labeling was detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated secondary antibody and was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate. Transferred PVDF membranes were sliced for individual mAb reaction and re-combined during the detection process.
