  <title>Reactivity of anti-CHIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).</title>
  <p>Indirect immunofluorescent test was performed against CHIKV (ECSA, CP10 strain) -infected Vero cells using anti-CHIKV mAbs generated by strategies B (left) and C (right) in the present study. The reactivity of each mAb was detected by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green color), while DAPI nuclear counterstain was used to stain nuclei of cells (blue color, right-hand panels). Anti-CHIKV E1 mAb (CK47) was used as the control antibody for CHIKV infection, while the antibody diluent (PBS) was used as the negative control. Images are representative of results obtained from three independent experiments with similar results and were taken under 40x objective magnification using an inverted microscope (Axio observer Z.1, Carl Zeiss). The images of Alexa Fluor 488 and DAPI staining were merged using ImageJ 1.5Oi, National Institutes of Health USA (left-hand panels).</p>
