  <title>Western blot analysis of mAbs against CHIKV.</title>
  <p>Western blotting was performed using the indicated anti-CHIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs); labelling was detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate. (
   <bold>a and c</bold>) Western blot profile of mAbs against CHIKV (CP10 strain) -infected Vero cell lysate under reducing (R) and non-reducing (N) conditions from immunization strategy B (panel a) and strategy C (panel c). Anti-CHIKV E1 protein, mAb CK47, was used as an experimental control. (
   <bold>b and d</bold>) Western blot profile of mAbs against CHIKV (CP10 strain) -infected (I) and mock-infected (M) Vero cell lysate from immunization strategy B under non-reducing conditions (panel B) and from strategy C under reducing conditions (panel d). After the transfer, the PVDF membranes were sliced for individual mAb reactions, with each slice spanning two lanes. Images of slices represent two independent experiments.
