  <title>Expression of CHIKV 6K-E1 proteins by recombinant Sendai virus.</title>
  <p>Indirect immunofluorescent test was performed using anti-CHIKV E1 (monoclonal antibody CK119); labeling was detected with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green color). DAPI nuclear counterstain was used to stain nuclei of cells (blue color). (a) HEK293T cells transfected with plasmid encoding CHIKV Asian-genotype 6K-E1 protein (pCEP4/CK12-686 6K-E1) or mock-transfected. (b) Vero cells infected with Sendai virus expressing the Asian-genotype CHIKV 6K-E1 protein or mock-infected. Images represent two independent experiments with similar results, taken under 40x objective magnification using an Axio observer Z.1 microscope (Carl Zeiss). Merged images of anti-CHIKV E1 and DAPI (Merge) also are shown.</p>
