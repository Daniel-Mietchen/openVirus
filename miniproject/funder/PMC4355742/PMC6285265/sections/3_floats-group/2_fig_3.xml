  <title>Susceptibility of intrathoracically injected mosquitoes for Shuni virus (SHUV).</title>
  <p>Mean infection rates (A) and transmission efficiencies (B) of 
   <italic>Culex pipiens pipiens</italic> (N = 50) and 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (N = 50) intrathoracically injected with SHUV after 10 days incubation at 25째C and 28째C, respectively. Infection rate represents the percentage of females with virus-positive bodies out of the total number of injected female mosquitoes that were alive at the end of the incubation period. Transmission efficiency represents the percentage of females with virus-positive saliva out of the total number of injected female mosquitoes that were alive at the end of the incubation period. Error bars indicate the SEM as calculated for technical replicates. SHUV titers of virus-positive body samples (C) and saliva samples (D) of

   <italic>aegypti</italic> (body samples: N = 14, saliva samples: N = 4) intrathoracically injected with SHUV after 10 days incubation at 25째C and 28째C, respectively. Each dot represents an individual sample, and the black bar indicates the median. The detection limit of the endpoint dilution assay is indicated with the dashed line.
