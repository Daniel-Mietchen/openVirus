<p>To evaluate the susceptibility of two species of biting midges (
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>nubeculosus</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>sonorensis</italic>) for SHUV, groups of individuals of both species were orally exposed to an infectious blood meal with a mean SHUV titer of 3.0 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml. SHUV titers of ingested blood were determined for a selection of 10 fully engorged females for each species, that were directly stored at -80Â°C after feeding. Both species ingested low amounts of SHUV that were below the detection limit of the endpoint dilution assay of 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
