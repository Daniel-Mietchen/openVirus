<p>SHUV infection and replication in biting midges seems more efficient compared to other biting midge-borne viruses such as SBV and bluetongue virus (BTV), which generally show infection rates up to 30% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Both SBV and BTV have caused sudden and large-scale epizootics in Europe, with devastating consequences for the livestock sector [
