 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This knowledge, in combination with evidence of successful dissemination of SHUV to the heads indicates that the biting midge species evaluated in the present study are likely competent vectors of SHUV. Importantly, the finding that SHUV replicates efficiently in two biting midge species from a different geographic background suggests that various species of
