<p>Recent outbreaks of SBV and BTV exemplified the tremendous impact of midge-borne viruses on animal health [

 <italic>nubeculosus</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>sonorensis</italic>). However, conclusive evidence for SHUV transmission by biting midges should be provided by experiments with infected biting midges and susceptible mammals, although these kind of experiments are costly and complex. We cannot exclude that results obtained with laboratory-reared vectors are different from those obtained with field-collected vectors. Therefore, future studies should test vector competence of field-collected 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midge and mosquito species exposed to different quantities of SHUV, to more accurately predict the risk of SHUV transmission in specific areas. These experiments in combination with behavioural and ecological research will contribute to our understanding of the transmission cycle of SHUV.
