<p>In this study, we determined infection, dissemination, and transmission of SHUV by infectivity assays and virus titers by EPDA (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>. assays based on inoculation of samples on Vero cells which are then screened for CPE). Such infectivity assays and EPDAs have the advantage of detecting infectious virus particles, whereas other methods like qPCR that quantify genome equivalents, may include defective virus particles and thereby not accurately represent infectious virus. Of note, observed CPE in the infectivity assays and EPDAs was found to invariably correspond with SHUV RNA as determined by RT-qPCR (
