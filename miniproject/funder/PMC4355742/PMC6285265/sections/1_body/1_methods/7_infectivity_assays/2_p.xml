<p>Mosquitoes were anesthetized with 100% CO
 <sub>2</sub> to remove legs and wings. Mosquito saliva was then collected by inserting the proboscis into a 200 μl yellow pipette tip (Greiner Bio-One) containing 5 μl of a 1:1 solution of 50% glucose solution and FBS. The saliva sample was transferred to a 1.5 ml micro tube containing 55 μl of fully supplemented HEPES-DMEM medium. Mosquito bodies were individually stored in 1.5 ml Safe-Seal micro tubes containing 0.5 mm zirconium beads.
