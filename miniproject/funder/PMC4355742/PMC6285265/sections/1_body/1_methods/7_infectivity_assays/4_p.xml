<p>Infection rate (virus-infected whole body) and dissemination efficiency (virus-infected head) were determined for biting midges, whereas infection rate (virus-infected whole body) and transmission efficiency (virus-infected saliva) were determined for mosquitoes. Infection rate, dissemination efficiency, and transmission efficiency were calculated, respectively, by dividing the number of females with virus-infected bodies (infection), virus-infected heads (dissemination), or virus-infected saliva (transmission) by the total number of females tested in the respective treatment and that survived the incubation period. The values were subsequently expressed as percentages by multiplying with 100. Two biting midge samples of which only the head was virus-positive, but not the body, were considered to be uninfected.</p>
