<p>After 1 h, insects were anesthetized with 100% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and kept on a CO
 <sub>2</sub>-pad to select fully engorged females. For each species, five fully engorged females were directly stored at -80°C for each replicate. These samples were used to determine the ingested amounts of SHUV for each species. All remaining and fully engorged females were placed back into buckets with a maximum group size of 110 individuals per species per bucket. All insects were provided with 6% glucose solution via a soaked ball of cotton wool on top of the netting
