<p>Vero E6 cells that were used in biting midge and mosquito infection experiments in the biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, United States), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Prior to infections in the BSL3 facility, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-buffered DMEM medium (HEPES-DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), fungizone (50 μg/ml; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, United States), and gentamycin (50 μg/ml; Gibco).</p>
