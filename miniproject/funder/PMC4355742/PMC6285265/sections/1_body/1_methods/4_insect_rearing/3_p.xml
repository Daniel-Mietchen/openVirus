 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from the Rockefeller strain (Bayer AG, Monheim, Germany) were used in all experiments. The mosquito colony was maintained as described before [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In short, mosquitoes were maintained at 27Â°C with 12:12 light:dark cycle and 70% relative humidity. Adult mosquitoes were kept in Bugdorm-1 rearing cages and maintained on 6% glucose solution 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Human blood (Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) was provided through a Parafilm M membrane using the Hemotek PS5 feeding system for egg production. Eggs were transferred to transparent square larval holding trays (19 x 19 x 20 cm, Jokey), filled for approximately one-third with tap water and three drops of Liquifry No. 1. Hatched larvae were fed with Tetramin Baby fish food (Tetra). Larval trays were closed with fine-meshed netting, to allow adult mosquitoes to emerge inside larval trays. Twice a week, adults were aspirated from the larval trays and collected in Bugdorm-1 insect rearing cages.
