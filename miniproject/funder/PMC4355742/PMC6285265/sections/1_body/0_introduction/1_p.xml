<p>Arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses continue to pose a threat to human and animal health [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In particular the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> comprises emerging pathogens such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has included both CCHFV and RVFV to the “Blueprint” list of ten prioritized viruses likely to cause future epidemics and for which insufficient countermeasures are available [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the veterinary field, prioritized viral diseases of animals, including RVFV, are notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties, OIE). Apart from pathogens that are recognised as major threats by WHO and OIE, many have remained largely neglected. Before the turn of the century, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus were among these neglected viruses until they reminded us how fast arboviruses can spread in immunologically naïve populations [
