<p id="par0040">First, we explored the temporal signal in the sequence alignments using TempEst (
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref>). The main analysis of both data sets was done within the Bayesian MCMC framework BEAST2 (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>). We assume that the phylogeny spanned by the genomic samples is a suitable approximation of the transmission tree, such that we can estimate epidemiological parameters simultaneously with the phylogenetic tree. Since we do not intend to estimate direction of transmission this assumption refers to the branching times of the phylogenetic tree approximating times at which transmissions occurred only. We employ two phylodynamic methods, the birth-death skyline plot (BDSKY) (
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Stadler et al., 2013</xref>) and the multi-type birth-death model (MTBD) (
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Kühnert et al., 2016</xref>). Both assume that an infection event can be considered as the “birth” of a newly infected individual, while a recovery event (successful treatment) is a “death”. While the BDSKY model assumes that an infected individual is immediately infectious upon infection, the MTBD model allows us to incorporate the fact that
