<p id="par0045">In both analyses, we employ a general time reversible substitution model with gamma distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR+I+Γ). A relaxed lognormal clock is used to model the variation of evolutionary (substitution) rates across branches, such that we estimate a mean clock rate θ (per SNP per year), from which we compute the number of SNPs per genome per year, and standard deviation σ for the lognormal branch rate distribution. In addition to the SNP alignments we specify the proportions of A, C, G and T’s as constant site weights. All parameters are estimated jointly. The prior distributions used are summarized in
