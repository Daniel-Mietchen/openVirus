<p id="par0050">The birth-death skyline model (
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Stadler et al., 2013</xref>) describes a prior distribution for a transmission tree and is based on a stochastic birth-death process, with birth (λ), death (μ) and sampling (ψ) rates. Individuals become non-infectious upon sampling with probability r ∈ [0,1] (
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Gavryushkina et al., 2014</xref>). Typically, the probability r is close to 1 if sampling is accompanied by successful treatment. To investigate the change of epidemiological dynamics, the period covered by the phylogeny is divided into intervals, and parameters are constant within an interval but may change between intervals. We can estimate the effective reproduction number R
 <sub>e</sub>, through the alternative parametrization of the model using the effective reproduction number R
 <sub>e</sub> = λ /(μ + rψ), the rate at which individuals become non-infectious δ = μ + rψ and the sampling proportion s = ψ / (μ + ψ). We employ m = 5 intervals to estimate potential changes in R
 <sub>e</sub>, and assume that δ is constant through time. The sampling proportion s is set to zero before the first sample, and assumed to be a positive constant thereafter.
