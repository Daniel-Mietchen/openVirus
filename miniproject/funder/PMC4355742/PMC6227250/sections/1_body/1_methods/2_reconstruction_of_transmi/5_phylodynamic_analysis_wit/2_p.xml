<p id="par0055">The MTBD model allows us to incorporate and investigate the exposed phase. In the following we use the terms ‘latent’ and ‘exposed’ interchangeably, referring to the time during which individuals are infected but not yet infectious. The multi-type version of the birth-death skyline model (
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Kühnert et al., 2016</xref>) allows us to distinguish between two types of infected individuals: (i) those who are not yet infectious (typically assigned to a compartment E), and (ii) those who are infectious (compartment I). Previous work has indicated that phylogenetic tools can estimate the overall infected period (including the exposed and infectious phases), but that it is difficult to estimate the exposed and infectious periods separately (
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Stadler et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, we run three versions of this analysis, with the infectious period fixed to either 6 months (δ=2), 3 months (δ=4) or 2 months (δ=6) and report the results for each of those setups.
