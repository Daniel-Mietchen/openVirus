In brief, we used the Illumina platform to sequence 68 patients associated with the Bernese outbreak and 46 from the WTK outbreak spanning more than 10 and 36 years, respectively. Only one isolate per patient was included and the isolation dates of the strains were used as sampling times. The isolates obtained from the Bernese outbreak were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000, with single-end reads of approximately 50 bp as described in (
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Stucki et al., 2015</xref>). The WTK outbreak was sequenced using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx, with single-end reads of also approximately 50 bp as described in 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Coscolla et al. (2015a)</xref>. In both cases, reads were mapped against an inferred common ancestor sequence to all main lineages of the

Only positions consensual to both methods were considered. SNPs were determined with SAMtools (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Only SNPs with a coverage of at least 10 reads and a phred-scaled mapping quality value of 20 were considered. In addition, SNPs falling in genes annotated as PE/PPE/PGRS, “maturase”, “phage”, “insertion sequence” or “13E12 repeat family protein” were removed due to the uncertainty of mappings.
