<p id="par0150">Both models employed for analysis of the Bernese outbreak (BDSKY and MTBD) suggest that the average infected period lasted about 4–5 years. While in BDSKY the infected period is equivalent to the infectious period, the infected period in the MTBD model is the sum of the infectious and exposed periods. In the latter we assume an infectious period of 2, 3 or 6 months (

While this means that both models agree on the overall infected period to last around 4–5 years, we know that MTBD is the more realistic model. Hence, we conclude that – on average – an infected patient in the Bern outbreak was in the latent/exposed stage of the disease for about 4 years before becoming infectious and consequently being diagnosed and treated shortly after (
