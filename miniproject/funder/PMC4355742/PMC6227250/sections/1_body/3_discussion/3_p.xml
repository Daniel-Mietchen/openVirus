<p id="par0120">The Bernese outbreak is characterized by (i) the outbreak being restricted to the medium size Swiss city Bern and (ii) a large sampling proportion. Indeed, many cases were sampled shortly after infection and subsequent cases have been recovered by a SNP screening assay and targeted WGS, such that an estimated 90% of secondary (i.e. infectious) cases linked to this outbreak are included in the data set. This high sampling proportion and the geographical containment of the Bernese outbreak are the likely cause of the higher confidence of the estimates obtained for this dataset, because the sampling times of sequences in a densely-sampled outbreak â€“ combined with the genetic variation among them - are very informative for the age of an outbreak, and thus allow to time-calibrate the phylogeny and quantify transmission and recovery rates.</p>
