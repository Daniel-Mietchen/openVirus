<p id="par0155">For the WTK outbreak, we estimated an infectious period of eight years, which is significantly higher than the infectious period estimated for the Bernese outbreak (p-value &lt;2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16</sup>). This may be due to a delay in sampling and treatment, due to the sampling having taken place in California after immigration from Thailand, such that patients were likely sick and infectious for longer. Furthermore, while the Bernese outbreak was caused by a sensitive strain, the WTK outbreak was caused by an MDR strain. Multidrug resistance is generally associated with poorer treatment success and prolonged infectiousness (
