<p id="par0130">Our analyses were conducted using phylodynamic methods implemented in the Bayesian MCMC framework BEAST version 2.4 (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>), which means that we are estimating so-called time-trees using molecular clock models. Before using such models, one should explore the temporal signal in sequence alignments, which can be done using TempEst (
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref>). While both data sets exhibit a positive correlation between genetic divergence and sampling time, there is a moderate level of temporal signal only in the WTK data set (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.35). The WTK data set belongs to Lineage 2, for which Duchene et al. (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Duchêne et al., 2016</xref>) were unable to reliably determine the evolutionary rate. As outbreak data sets are often not suitable for long-term mutation rate estimation this estimate should be taken with a grain of salt. For a robust long-term estimate, one would want to collect longitudinal data over a longer time period (
