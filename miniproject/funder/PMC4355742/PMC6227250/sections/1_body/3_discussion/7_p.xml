<p id="par0140">We hypothesize that the two data sets are an example of the time dependency of molecular rate estimates (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2005</xref>): the estimates of the evolutionary rate for the Bernese outbreak represent a high short-term rate of evolution, whereas due to the delayed sampling, the WTK estimate is a lower intermediate-term mutation rate of evolution. Hence, our evolutionary rate estimates are not suitable for comparison between the two
