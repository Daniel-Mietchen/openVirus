 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> outbreaks. The first outbreak was detected around 1991 in the city of Bern, Switzerland, where twenty-two related cases, mainly homeless individuals and substance abusers, were identified initially (
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Genewein et al., 1993</xref>). Using a novel combination of strain-specific SNP screening assay and targeted WGS, a tuberculosis cluster spanning 21 years and involving 68 patients was identified (
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Stucki et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al., 2006</xref>). The genomic analysis revealed that this outbreak was caused by a Lineage 4 strain (Euro-American) of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and all but one showed no evidence of antibiotic resistant conferring mutations. The analysis revealed three sub-clusters within the outbreak, one of them associated to HIV coinfection (13 patients were coinfected with HIV).
