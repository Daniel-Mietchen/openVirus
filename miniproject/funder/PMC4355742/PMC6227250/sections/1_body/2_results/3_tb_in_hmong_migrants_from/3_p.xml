<p id="par0100">We analysed this data set under the BDSKY model, and allowed m = 4 intervals to estimate changes in the effective reproduction number R
 <sub>e</sub>. The temporal origin of this data set is estimated around 1976 with the 95% HPD interval ranging from 1935 to 1993. There is much uncertainty in the estimate of the effective reproduction number R
 <sub>e</sub>, its median and 95% HPD interval are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The rate δ at which infected individuals become non-infectious is estimated to be 0.13 (median), suggesting an infected period of 8 years. The median sampling proportion estimate is 8% (95% HPD, 4–15%). We estimate that the data set contains no sampled ancestors (95% HPD, 0–2), with the probability to be removed upon sampling r = 64% (95% HPD, 10–100%). The mean number of SNPs per genome per year is estimated to be 0.36 (95% HPD, 0.11–0.57).
