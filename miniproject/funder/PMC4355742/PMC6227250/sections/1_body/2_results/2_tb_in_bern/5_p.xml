<p id="par0090">Explicit incorporation of the exposed period in the MTBD model allows us to distinguish the average duration that infected individuals remain infectious. Due to the computational complexity of the model we only allowed one change in the effective reproduction number R
 <sub>e</sub> to have occurred in 1992. A more general setup (with more intervals for R
 <sub>e</sub>) leads to identifiability issues. Before 1992, we estimate median R
 <sub>e</sub> values around 2.25 and afterwards the median estimates are significantly below the epidemic threshold 1. Under the MTBD model we fixed the rate δ at which infected individuals become non-infectious to 2, 4 or 6 per year, suggesting an infected period of 6, 3 or 2 months. The median rate σ at which infected individuals become infectious is around 0.25, that is, on average infected individuals became infectious after 4 years in each of the three scenarios. Again, we estimate that the data set contains one sampled ancestor, with infected individuals being removed upon sampling with 98% probability. The mean number of SNPs per genome per year is estimated to be 0.72 (95% HPD, 0.40–1.24) when δ=2, 0.8 (95% HPD, 0.41-1.50) when δ=4 and 0.83 (95% HPD, 0.42-1.60) when δ=6 (
