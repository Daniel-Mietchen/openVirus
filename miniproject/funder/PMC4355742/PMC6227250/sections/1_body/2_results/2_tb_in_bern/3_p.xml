<p id="par0080">The epidemiological parameter estimates we obtain for the Bernese outbreak largely agree among the different model specifications. We estimate that the temporal origin of the Bernese data set was around 1986 with the 95% highest posterior density intervals (HPD) ranging from 1985 to 1988.</p>
