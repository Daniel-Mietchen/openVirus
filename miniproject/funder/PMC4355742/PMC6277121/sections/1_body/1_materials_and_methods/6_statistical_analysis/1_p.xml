<p>The standard curve between C
 <sub>T</sub> values and DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml) was analyzed by linear correlation regression with regression equation and the DENV-2 RNA concentration (copies/ml) in each mosquito were calculated by the C
 <sub>T</sub> value according to the regression equation. All the DENV-2 RNA concentration (copies/ml) in each group were presented by the key parameters, including the median, 75
 <sup>th</sup> percentile (P
 <sub>75</sub>), 25
 <sup>th</sup> percentile (P
 <sub>25</sub>), maximum (Max), minimum (Min) and inter-quartile range (Q). For the DENV-2 RNA copies, the differences among the eight groups were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test (K-W test), and then were further analyzed by the Turkey studentized range test to determine exactly which two groups had significant difference. According to the detection reagent protocol, when the C
 <sub>T</sub> value of mosquito was less than or equal to 40.00, the mosquito was judged to be positive with DENV-2, and the infection rate in each group was calculated. For the infection rates, Chi-squared test (

 <sup>2</sup> test) was used to examine the statistical significances among the eight groups, and Duncan multiple range tests were used to determine pair-wise differences, and then linear correlation regression method was used to further analyze the correlation between the infection rates and ivermectin concentrations. P &lt; 0.05 was considered to be significant.
