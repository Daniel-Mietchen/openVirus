<p>After being frozen to death at −20°C, each mosquito was collected in a grinding tube with 350 μl lysis buffer and then was fully grinded by tissue grinded instrument. The DENV-2 RNA was isolated with RNeasy plus Mini Kit (250) (Qiagen, German), and quantitatively tested with the dengue virus 2 real-time fluorescent RT-PCR kit (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech, China). The Master Mix volume for each reaction was pipetted as follows: super mix 18 μl, enzyme mix 1 μl, internal control 1 μl, extraction RNA 5 μl. PCR reaction conditions were: one cycle of 45°C for 10 minutes and 95°C for 15 minutes, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 60 seconds, fluorescence measured at 60°C. During the bioassay, the standard curve between C
 <sub>T</sub> values and DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml) was also detected as described previously [
