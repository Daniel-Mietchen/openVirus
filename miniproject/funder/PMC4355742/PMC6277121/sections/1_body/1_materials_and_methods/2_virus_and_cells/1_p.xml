<p>C6/36 mosquito cell and BHK-21 cell lines, derived from 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and Baby Hamster Syrian Kidney respectively, were used in this study. The cell lines were maintained and propagated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco by Life technologies, Australia) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco by Life technologies, Australia) and 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco by Life technologies, Australia). Cultured C6/36 was incubated at 28°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified chamber, and was passaged every 2~3 days. At the time of virus multiplication, the serum concentration was reduced to 2% and temperature was increased to 33°C. DENV-2 was propagated using C6/36 cell line and harvested after CPE presentation on day five post-infection. Supernatants containing DENV-2 were collected, centrifuged at 4,000 xg for 10 minutes to clear cellular debris, and then were stored at -80°C until further use. The titer of viral stocks was measured by TCID (50) % using serial dilutions of 10
 <sup>1</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> of the viral stocks inoculated into BHK-21 cells. The viral titer was calculated according with Reed and Munch [
