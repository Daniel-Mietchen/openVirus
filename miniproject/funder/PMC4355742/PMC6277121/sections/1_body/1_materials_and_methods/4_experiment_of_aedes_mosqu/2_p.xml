 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> aged between three and five days post emergence from larvae were fed together with human whole blood containing the same titer of DENV-2. After blood feeding, all fully engorged mosquitoes were gently transferred by aspiration to a new 3L cardboard cartons and held in an incubator at 26±2°C, 60~80% relative humidity, and a 12:12 light: dark cycle. Engorged mosquitoes were held for four days with access to human whole blood, and then were randomly divided into eight groups. Seven of them were held for six days with access to 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng/ml ivermectin, respectively, and the last one was set as a historical control group. The mosquitoes in the historical control group were stored at -80°C until being detected at the same time with mosquitoes in the other groups. In this way, one parallel control group (0ng/ml), one historical control group and six treatment groups were set. Three replicates were performed for each group/concentration, with at least 20 mosquitoes per replicate being analyzed. The human whole blood was obtained from Jiangxi International Travel Healthcare Center, which provided healthy physical examination for community.
