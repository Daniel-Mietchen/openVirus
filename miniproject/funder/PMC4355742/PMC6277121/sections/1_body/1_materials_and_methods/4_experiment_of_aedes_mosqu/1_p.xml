<p>The powdered ivermectin formulation was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Ivermectin was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 10 mg/ml and aliquots were frozen at −20°C. Frozen aliquots of ivermectin were thawed and serially diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to addition to human whole blood heated to 37°C prior to mixing. 10 μl of varied concentrations of ivermectin in PBS were added to 990 μl of human whole blood meal to reach 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng/ml concentrations offered to mosquitoes.</p>
