<p>The results of our study may be quite meaningful for the dengue control program in terms of blocking the dengue transmission by using ivermectin. On one hand, the inhibiting effect on dengue virus in vivo means ivermectin which has been proved to be safety in human [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] has the potential to be developed as a drug for curing dengue patients. On the other hand, its antiviral effect inside the dengue vectors may lead to stopping the epidemics of dengue transmission in the field. Moreover, apart from the observed antivirus effect, ivermectin also is of insecticidal action [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For an example, about 32.22% (29/90) of mortality was observed in the mosquitoes fed with 64ng/ml ivermectin, which was much higher than 5.79% (4/69) of mortality in the mosquitoes fed with 0ng/ml ivermectin (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The data illuminates that these two strategies may be still suitable for the dengue control program. Because of the antivirus and insecticidal effect, ivermectin using in endectocides can not only kill a number of blood-sucking vectors, but also inhibit the development of the dengue virus in the survived vectors, playing an unexpected role in reversing dengue’s growing trend in the world. However, the exact antivirus effectiveness and eventually being used in blocking dengue transmission need to be further validated with field 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes or even other three serotypes dengue virus. Moreover, the actual concentration for application in zooprophylaxis needs to be confirmed in the field trials.
