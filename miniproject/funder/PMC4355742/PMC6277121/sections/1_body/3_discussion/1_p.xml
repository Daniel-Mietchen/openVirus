<p>In the past decades, dengue fever was a neglected vector-borne tropical disease, with few of control efforts to reduce the burden of the disease at national or international levels [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With more outbreaks occurred every year around the world [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], people are being faced with the problem of difficulty in blocking the growing trend of dengue transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, it has been a consensus that vector control is a key component in the dengue control programs. However, the rapid rise and spread of insecticide resistance have become major threats to the efficiency of insecticide-based vector control activities [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is an urgent need to develop innovative control tools for dengue vector control. It was our first try in the laboratory to find out whether ivermectin was able to effectively inhibit the DENV-2 multiplication in

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006934.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The results give us a hint that using ivermectin in some strategy (e.g. zooprophylaxis [
