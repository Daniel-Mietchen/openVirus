<p>Dengue fever is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease over the past 50 years, with a 30-fold increase in global incidence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To reverse the growing trend, comprehensive technical strategies involving diagnosis and case management, integrated surveillance and outbreak preparedness, sustainable vector control and future vaccine implementation are necessary. Apart from the other technical elements, effective vector control is a critical component to achieve and sustain reduction of morbidity attribute to dengue. There are well-documented and various historical examples of dengue elimination or significant reduction through control of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Linnaeus and Hasselquist, 1762) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While bioassay demonstrates that resistance to organophosphates and pyrethroids are widespread in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, innovative vector control tools are badly needed for current control programs on dengue fever [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many new tools in vector control have been developed, such as insecticide-treated materials [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], lethal ovitraps [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], spatial repellents [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], genetically modified mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and so on. But effective tools able to block the transmission of dengue inside vector are still lacking. Therefore, we are trying to find an innovative avenue to inhibit dengue virus development inside 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito in order to block the cycle of dengue transmission.
