<p>The average of infection rates in the seven groups treated with 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 ng/ml ivermectin from 4 to 10 days post ingesting infectious blood were 84.62%, 85.29%, 82.54%, 74.24%, 63.33%, 54.29% and 42.62%, respectively, And the average of infection rates in historical control group was 81.67% (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Compared with the parallel control group or historical control group, infection rates in the mosquitoes fed with 2, 4, 8 ng/ml ivermectin were not significantly lowered; while infection rates in the mosquitoes fed with 16, 32, 64 ng/ml ivermectin were much lower (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with infection rate being reduced by as much as 49.63% (

What might confuse us here was that infection rate (85.29%) in mosquitoes fed with 2ng/ml ivermectin was seem to be higher than that in the historical control group (81.67%) or parallel control group (84.62%), but this differences were meaningless for being without statistical significance. In this part of experiment, antivirus effectiveness on DENV-2 in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was observed in the ivermectin treatment groups at certain concentration, and the more ivermectin mosquito ingested, the lower the infection rate was.
