<p>The DENV-2 RNA concentration of positive control sample from the commercial kit was 10,000,000 copies/ml, which was serially diluted to 1,000,000, 100,000, 10,000, 1,000, 100 copies/ml. They were synchronously detected with mosquito samples. Three replicates were performed for each concentration. The relationship between C
 <sub>T</sub> values (X
 <sub>1</sub>) and log
 <sub>10</sub> values of DENV-2 RNA concentrations (Y
 <sub>1</sub>) was expressed by the regression equation, which was obtained from the experimental data as Y
 <sub>1</sub> = 12.70â€“0.28*X
 <sub>1</sub> with R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.99. Thus, we got the concentration of DENV-2 RNA in each mosquito by the standard curve.
