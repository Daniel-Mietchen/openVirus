Compared with mosquitoes fed with 0 ng/ml ivermectin, mosquitoes fed with 2, 4, 8 ng/ml ivermectin carried the same level of DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml), and mosquitoes fed with 16, 32, 64 ng/ml ivermectin exhibited much lower DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml) (

 <sub>25</sub> of DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml) being reduced by up to 85.89%, 99.99%, 99.99% and 84.06%, respectively (

On the other hand, compared with mosquitoes in historical control group, DENV-2 had well developed inside mosquitoes fed with 0, 2, 4, or 8 ng/ml ivermectin showing significantly higher DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml), and was effectively inhibited in mosquitoes fed with 16, 32, or 64 ng/ml ivermectin showing the same level of DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml). The evidences confirmed the observation of antivirus effectiveness that virus loads in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> were statistically reduced by treatment of ivermectin when concentration of ivermectin was more than 16ng/ml. (
