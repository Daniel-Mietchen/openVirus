  <title>Comparison of interventions in response to three different sizes of epidemic.</title>
  <p>The baseline is R
   <sub>0</sub> = 1.26. Another two severe epidemics (R
   <sub>0</sub> = 1.9 and R
   <sub>0</sub> = 2.6) were simulated as well. Red lines indicate the case of R
   <sub>0</sub> = 1.26; green lines show intervention results when R
   <sub>0</sub> = 1.9, and blue lines present the case when R
   <sub>0</sub> = 2.6. (a) Vaccination. (b) School closure.
