<p>We simulated the epidemic spread in Forsyth Country, NC, USA (see Methods). Simulations of local epidemic spread are conducted using our heterogeneous graph model (HGM) approach. Generally, the HGM consists of two layers. The first layer describes the social structure of studied region using open-access synthetized populations that capture the demographic and geographic heterogeneities of population in this region. The second layer is an ABM that embedded in the HGM to describe how the virus is transmitted through individuals' interaction and social behavior, taking into account the influence brought by individuals' cognition and reaction to the epidemic, climate, degree of social network, and other environmental factors. In the model, individuals were assigned to child care centers, schools, workplaces, and public areas based on their ages. A day is divided into Outside Time and Family Time. In outside time, people's contacts occur at child care centers, schools, workplaces, and public areas. Family time is from the moment people enter home to the moment they leave home in the next morning. We simply assume that during this period, they only have chance to contact with their family members. The interactions between people who go into public areas after work hours are considered as activities in Outside Time as well. We assume a certain proportion of individuals go to public areas after work hours and the number is influenced by daily infection rate. In severe epidemic, individual tends to avoid staying in public area in order to protect themselves. According to our clinical data, the simulated epidemics were from the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week of the year (beginning of October) to the 13
 <sup>th</sup> week of the next year (end of March). Public holidays and schools' winter break were involved in the simulation as well. Individuals' activities and social behaviors during holidays were set the same as on weekends. Children at schools had winter break during the 52
 <sup>nd</sup> week of the year and half of the 1
 <sup>st</sup> week of the next year. During this period, their activities were also set the same as on weekends.
