 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows the impact of school closure duration on R
 <sub>0</sub>. Baseline is no school closure at all. In any case, school closure starts when more than 0.1% population goes to the hospital due to influenza infection. The duration of school closure is one week, two weeks, and four weeks, respectively. In all of the three epidemics, all values of R
 <sub>0</sub> dropped even though school was only closed for one week. However, if the epidemic was moderate, for instance, R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.26, the value of R
 <sub>0</sub> did not reduce appreciably if schools were kept closed for more than 2 weeks. On the other hand, closing schools for four weeks helped reduce R
 <sub>0</sub> from 2.6 to 1.52 in a very severe epidemic. School closure was especially useful in a severe epidemic
