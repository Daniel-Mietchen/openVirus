<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4(b)</xref> we have an interesting finding. We have mentioned that holidays were already considered in our simulation. Individuals' activities and social behaviors during holidays were set the same as on weekends. Red line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4(b)</xref> is the simulated epidemic under this condition. The other three lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4(b)</xref> represented the simulated epidemic when conducted school closure interventions. Interestingly, with school closure intervention the weekly infections dropped extremely, but during holidays and winter breaks there is no obvious decline of weekly infections. From these results we reached different conclusion from some existing claims that holidays lead to a reduction of influenza transmission
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Our conclusion is holiday cannot help reduce virus transmission if individuals' activities and social behaviors during holidays are the same as on weekends. It is because individuals have different recognition of holiday and school closure. During holiday, people do not need intentionally avoid crowded places. On the contrary, they are more likely to travel around, which might aggravate the epidemic. School closure often happens when the epidemic is server. People will consciously avoid place where many people gather. There is a tight association between human cognitive behavior and virus transmission. That is why school closure and holiday have essential difference in the control of disease spread and holiday cannot replace the role of school closure.
