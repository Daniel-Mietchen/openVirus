<p>We also simulated two other severe epidemics (R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.9 and R
 <sub>0</sub> = 2.6) by increasing the social network degree and exotic infections that come into the studied area by air traffic. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> presents the comparison of interventions in response to moderate and severe epidemics. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5(a)</xref>, we modeled the efficiency of vaccination adopted in four targeted groups under the three epidemics. In Group 1, we assumed 80% of children in child care centers and schools were vaccinated; in Group 2, we assumed 80% of children were vaccinated; in Group 3, we assumed 80% of children and 80% of people in the workplace were vaccinated; and in Group 4, we assumed 80% of the whole population was vaccinated. The baseline was the officially reported coverage (46.27%, 35.53%, and 67.07% for persons 0.5–17 years, 18–64 years, and 65+ years of age, respectively). In a severe epidemic (R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.9 and R
 <sub>0</sub> = 2.6), interventions on Group 1 helped reduce R
 <sub>0</sub> from 2.6 to 1.96, or from 1.9 to 1.50. In both cases, the epidemics were still out of control. Such a strategy is not enough in a severe epidemic. If we enlarged the vaccination range to all children (Group 2), in the very severe epidemic (R
 <sub>0</sub> = 2.6), R
 <sub>0</sub> was reduced to 1.58 and the epidemic was still out of control, but this strategy prevented the epidemics of both R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1.9 and 1.26 very well. These results suggested that vaccination is more suitable when the epidemic is not very severe. In Groups 3 and 4, 80% vaccination resulted in a sharp decrease of R
 <sub>0</sub> in each simulated epidemic, while R
 <sub>0</sub> had almost the same reduction pattern in both groups. These results indicated that a vaccination strategy targeting children and people in the workplace can mitigate an epidemic; urging mass vaccination of a whole population is not necessary.
