 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4(b)</xref> presents the simulation of school closure. The interventions started when more than 0.1% of the population goes to a hospital due to influenza infection since the beginning of the influenza season. Generally, the rate of infection is bigger than 0.1% because a large number of infected patients choose stay at home and use nonprescription medicines. It was reported that closing school was very effective within the first 30 days and the infection rate was hardly to be reduced if the closing lasts more than 30 days

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Here we only simulated this intervention within four weeks. Three scenarios were simulated in which the length of school closure was one week, two weeks, and four weeks. In any scenario, when schools were reopened, the number of infected patients increased again and the outbreak recurred eventually. The simulation results showed that closing school for two weeks can only reduce the R0 from 1.26 to 0.95. School closure may not be an appropriate intervention in moderate epidemic. We can choose other low-cost interventions since the epidemic is controllable.
