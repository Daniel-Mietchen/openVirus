 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4(a)</xref> shows the predicted epidemic curves given different coverage of vaccination. National reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States showed that from 2009 to 2012, the average influenza vaccine coverage was 46.27%, 35.53%, and 67.07% for persons 0.5–17 years, 18–64 years, and 65+ years of age, respectively
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. It indicates the vaccination coverage still can be increased. We therefore simulated the scenarios when the vaccination coverage is increased by 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% in the whole population. Additionally, research has shown that in clinically-confirmed cases, influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in persons under 4 years of age, 5–17, 18–64, and 65+ was 63%, 56%, 51%, and 36%, respectively
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. VE differs substantially in different age groups. Here we modeled the efficiency of intervention when only a specific age group is 80% vaccinated. We set the maximal percentage of the vaccinated population as 80% because some individuals cannot be vaccinated due to a health condition. The simulations suggested vaccinating only toward children can prevent the outbreak. This finding is reinforced by 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, showing that the illness attack rate among children under 4 years old is 59.60% and among children with 5–17 years old is 14.98%. The numbers are far bigger than those among adults and older adults. Thus, immunizing children and adolescents with influenza vaccine could significantly protect them from influenza virus and prevents their infecting family members
