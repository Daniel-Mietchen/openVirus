 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> is the bar chart showing the percentage changes of infected individuals when varying parameters with respect to the values using default parameters listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table S2</xref> for the simulation of 2010â€“2011 influenza season. Each bar represents the mean percentage changes of infected individuals calculated from 300 simulations. The error bars represent the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the means. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(a)</xref>, the sensitivity analysis was done on single parameter. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows the results of multi-parameter sensitivity analyses based on deviations in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m1">Equations (1)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m2">(2)</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(c)</xref> shows the results of multi-parameter sensitivity analyses based on coefficients in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m1">Equations (1)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="m2">(2)</xref>. We did not mix deviations and coefficients together to make multi-parameter sensitivity analyses because coefficients are positively correlated with number of infections, while deviations have reverse correlation with them. In the three figures, the tick labels along the x-axis indicate which parameter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(a)</xref>) or which groups of parameters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(b)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(c)</xref>) are varied. We only varied one parameter or one group of parameters by reducing and increasing their values 1% and 5% from their default values, with the rest of parameters fixed.
