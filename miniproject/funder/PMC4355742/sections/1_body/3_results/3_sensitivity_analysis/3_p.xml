 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(b)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2(c)</xref> show that, if a group includes parameters related to local temperature (
 <italic>c
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> or 
 <italic>b
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>), varying the parameters in the group results in bigger change of the infection number. Hence, changes in illness attack rate and climate, especially temperature, impact the epidemic more than other factors. In fact, links between climate and influenza virus transmission have been identified

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Cooling of the nasal mucosa is thought to increase the viscosity of the mucous layer and reduce the frequency of cilia beats
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. In this way, breathing cold air would slow mucociliary clearance and thereby encourage viral spread within the respiratory tract
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Additionally, in cold weather, the duration of peak viral shedding is longer than warm weather
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The increased shedding may lead to the increased transmission.
