<p>The epidemics of influenza in 2009–2010, 2010–2011, and 2011–2012 were simulated separately. Blue lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> show the number of patients who went to hospital in the studied area weekly. They had very different patterns in the three influenza seasons. In the 2009–2010 influenza season, the number of infected individuals rose rapidly within four weeks, from the 40
 <sup>th</sup> week to the 44
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2009. It then remained almost stable for 15 weeks, from the 44
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2009 to the 7
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2010. In the 2010–2011 influenza season, the number of infected individuals rose gradually and reached a maximum in the first week of 2011, and dropped slowly until the end of the influenza season. Different from the two epidemics, however, the epidemic of 2011–2012 influenza season had two waves. Red lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> are the predicted epidemic dynamics of the three influenza seasons, obtained from the average of 300 simulations (gray lines). Compared to the existing network modeling methods
