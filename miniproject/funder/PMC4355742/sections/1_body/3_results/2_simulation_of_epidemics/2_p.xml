<p>Individuals' cognitive behavior toward an epidemic can impact their interaction and virus transmission, resulting in dynamic changes of the epidemic. This feedback process has been included in our ABM. To measure the function of individual's cognition and caution against the disease, we conducted experiments by setting 
 <italic>H</italic>(
 <italic>i</italic>,
 <italic>t</italic>) and 
 <italic>J</italic>(
 <italic>i</italic>,
 <italic>t</italic>) (see Methods) as constant throughout the influenza season (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref> online). The results showed that HGM with constant cognition functions could not represent the dynamic change of the epidemic and failed to model the epidemics with multi-waves, because no cognitive and protective behavior was evoked to prevent the increasing of infections.
