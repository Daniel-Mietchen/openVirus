<p>In the simulation of 2010â€“2011 influenza epidemic, the basic reproductive number R0, the average number of individuals a typical infected person infects during his or her infectious period, was 1.26. The average connections per person and illness attack rate with respect to different places and age groups were listed in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S3</xref> online. All simulations showed children were the most vulnerable group. The younger a child was, the more possibly he or she got infected. Children have more connections than adults; this high connectivity resulted in a high probability of virus transmission and illness attack rate. This finding was proved by our clinical data. In the studied county, the percentage of persons under 18 years is 23.8%

Once they are infected, they will spread the virus to family members and people around them. Therefore, extent and severity of epidemic influenza largely depends on virus transmission in children
