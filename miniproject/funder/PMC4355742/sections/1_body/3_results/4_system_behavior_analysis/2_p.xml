<p>We perturbed the two input variables to see whether the output of the system can reach stable status eventually. The perturbation was under three conditions, with the degree of 6.7, 8.7, and 10.7, respectively. Network degree is defined as the average connections between individuals. 6.7 was its default value in our simulation, computed through the optimized system under the supervision of clinical data (see Methods). We varied both of the input variables from 0.01% to 0.12% of total simulated population. In each simulation, we only perturbed one variable and fixed the other at its default value.</p>
