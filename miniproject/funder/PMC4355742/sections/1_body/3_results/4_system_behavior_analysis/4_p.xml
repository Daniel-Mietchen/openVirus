 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3(b)</xref> is the change of R
 <sub>0</sub> with respect to weekly exotic infections, showing that R
 <sub>0</sub> was eventually stable with the increasing of weekly exotic infections. Same as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, in this figure, red, green, and blue curve represents the case with the degree of social network being 6.7, 8.7, and 10.7, respectively. In the first case (degree = 6.7), R
 <sub>0</sub> converges to 2.16 when the 
 <bold>State Point</bold> is 0.07%. In the second case (degree = 8.7), R
 <sub>0</sub> converges to 2.73 when the 
 <bold>State Point</bold> is 0.08%. And in the last case (degree = 10.7), R
 <sub>0</sub> converges to 2.79 when the 
 <bold>State Point</bold> is 0.05%.
