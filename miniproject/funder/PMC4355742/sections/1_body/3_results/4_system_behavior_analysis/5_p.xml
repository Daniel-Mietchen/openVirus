<p>In summary, both of the figures showed that, (1) R
 <sub>0</sub> reaches a maximum at 
 <bold>State Point</bold> and trends to a stable status. During an epidemic, once infected individual is recovered, he or she will be immune to subsequent infections. When more and more individuals are immune, viruses have low chance to spread. Therefore, the number of infections can hardly increase, and the accumulation of total infections tends to be a fixed number. (2) R
 <sub>0</sub> is positively correlated to social network degree. In the region with higher social network degree, individuals have more chance to contact with each other, increasing the possibility of virus transmission between individuals. It will lead to a larger size of epidemic. Therefore, severe epidemic often happens in the region where individuals have more connections, because viruses are transmitted much easier and faster in the region. (3) Different degree leads to different 
 <bold>State Point</bold>. Generally, smaller social network degree results in bigger 
 <bold>State Point</bold>. It means in the region individuals have fewer connections, influenza viruses have low chance to spread. Therefore, severe epidemic does not frequently and easily happen unless initial infection number or exotic infection number is extremely large. Consequently, social network degree is a critical factor determining the magnitude of an epidemic. The reduction of network degree is important in the control of epidemic. In fact, many interventions against the epidemic are related to the decrease of network degree, such as school closure and patient self-isolation.
