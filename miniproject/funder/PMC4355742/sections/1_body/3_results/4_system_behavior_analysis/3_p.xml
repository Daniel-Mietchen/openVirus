 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the analysis results. The output of the system was characterized by R
 <sub>0</sub>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3(a)</xref> shows the change of R
 <sub>0</sub> with respect to the initial infection numbers. The relationship between initial infections and R
 <sub>0</sub> approximately follows a sigmoid function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). In general, R
 <sub>0</sub> rose with the increase of initial infection numbers until a certain initial infection numbers has reached. We call the rate of “certain initial infection number” over total simulated population as a “
 <bold>State Point</bold>”. The red curve in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3(a)</xref> represents the case with the degree of social network being 6.7. The simulation shows R
 <sub>0</sub> converges to 2.12 when the 
 <bold>State Point</bold> is 0.1%. Similarly, the green curve represents the case with the degree of social network being 8.7, showing R
 <sub>0</sub> converges to 2.76 when the 
 <bold>State Point</bold> is 0.08%. And the blue curve shows R
 <sub>0</sub> converges to 2.79 when the 
 <bold>State Point</bold> is 0.05% with the degree of social network being 10.7.
