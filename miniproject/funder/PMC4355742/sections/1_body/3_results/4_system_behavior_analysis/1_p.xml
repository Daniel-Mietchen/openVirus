<p>Two inputs of the system, initial infection number at the beginning of simulation and number of weekly exotic infections may influence the output of the system. Initial infection number is the number of infected individuals on the first day of simulated influenza season. We assigned the default value of initial infection number to 0.01% of total simulated population by referring the record of our clinical data. Number of weekly exotic infections is the total number of infected individuals that come into the studied area by air traffic in a week. We assigned the default value of weekly exotic infections to 0.04% of total simulated population based on our investigation on the passenger capacity of the airport around the simulated area.</p>
