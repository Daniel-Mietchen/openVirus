<p>Through system behavior analysis, we found that social network degree is a critical factor determining the magnitude of an epidemic. In the region with higher population density, individuals have more chance to contact with each other, increasing the possibility of virus transmission. Therefore, the interventions related to the decrease of social network degree, such as school closure and patient self-isolation are critical to prevent the epidemic.</p>
