<p>Finding the best way to prevent an epidemic is a very challenging task because interactions between individuals are highly connected and complicated in today's world. Network modeling can be a flexible tool to build a plausible world, to re-enact past epidemics and simulate future outbreaks, and to analyze the major causes leading to spread of the disease. In our future work, we will improve the HGM to increase the reliability and accuracy of prediction by gathering data on contact patterns of typical places in schools and workplace to draw a general law for the reproducing of contact patterns among the county and collecting survey data about people's perception and cognition toward an epidemic to improve our agent-based model. It will help us systematically understand the virus transmission between individuals.</p>
