<p>In order to illustrate the importance of the individual's cognitive behavior to an epidemic, we conducted experiments to systematically compare our proposed HGM with the existing epidemiological models. The results showed that, these methods only can simulate epidemic with one wave, but failed to simulate multiple waves. The main reason is, their mathematical models did not describe the feedback of the epidemic. In our model, however, agents' perceptions were influenced by daily virus attack rate. They may adopt protective behaviors in order to avoid being infected, resulting in the fluctuation of epidemic curve.</p>
