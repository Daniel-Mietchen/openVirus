<p>Our simulations suggested that vaccination is the best method in a moderate epidemic. It brings little economic and social cost compared with school closure. Current VE is not very high and still can be improved, especially in older adults. As a result, we proposed a targeted vaccination strategy that only includes children and people in workplace. School closure can significantly moderate the stress on the health care system when the epidemic is severe. As a temporary and isolated intervention, however, its action is very limited and is not necessary when the epidemic is moderate. However, when the epidemic is severe, school closure is more effective than vaccination. It can rapidly reduce the daily infection cases. The effectiveness and impact of this strategy depends on the epidemiological characteristics
