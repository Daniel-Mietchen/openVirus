<p>In an influenza season, many factors work together leading to an influenza epidemic. These factors may include individuals' awareness of the disease (i.e. they might have strong reactions to media reports or to observing infection among their contacts), activity (i.e. people coming from infected areas may bring virus to their contacts), social behavior (i.e. higher contact frequency makes transmission faster), discrepancies between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain of influenza virus leading to decreased vaccine effectiveness, and climate (cool weather enhances the transmission of virus)

Understanding the influences of these factors on the spread of influenza can be critical to improving the control strategies. While the studies about human's cognitive and behavioral responses to an epidemic have been reported for several years, there has been relatively little systematic investigation into their function and role in the spread of the disease
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In this paper, we systematically studied the influence of human cognition and behaviors to an epidemic by building a mathematical framework for incorporating above factors into an agent-based epidemic model. We built the relationship between the simulated epidemics and individuals' cognition toward an epidemic by embedding the ABM into a HGM and simulating the epidemics in three influenza season.
