<p>An epidemic is a dynamic process. In this process, daily infections are caused by people's contacts, and the frequency of contacts can be mainly influenced by their cognition to the disease. The cognition is in turn influenced by daily illness attack rate reported by media broadcasts

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, showing highly daily virus attack rate evokes people's precaution to the disease. They may adopt protective behaviors in order to avoid being infected, resulting in the reduction of the daily virus attack rate. However, few existing methods considered the dynamic process in their models. Therefore, their prediction results can hardly be explained by the mechanisms of epidemic spreading. In this paper, we develop a heterogeneous graph modeling approach (HGM) to describe the dynamic process of influenza virus transmission in order to increase the validity, interpretability, and utility of network modeling by taking advantage of our unique clinical data.
