<p>We have enrolled 4870 patients including both clinical information and demographic information in two hospitals of Forsyth County, North Carolina, USA serving more than 94% of residents in this area for four consecutive influenza seasons of 2009–2010 through 2012–2013
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. We also used the 2005–2009 U.S. Synthetic Population Database from RTI International to build social network of this county
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The population information we used includes each household's geographical location and family members, each family member's workplace and school, each individual's demographic and socioeconomic information and locations for their activities, as well as the assignments of students to schools and assignments of workers to workplaces. We then embedded an Agent-Based Model (ABM) in the HGM to describe the dynamic change of an epidemic influenced by individuals' cognition and reaction to the epidemic, climate, and degree of social network. The most important is, our HGM approach was trained and validated by clinical data. This approach can be used to create the transmission of influenza
