<p>After contacting with an infected patient, the individual may or may not be infected, depending on the ability of his or her immune system. Mucosal immunity is the first line of body defense blocking influenza virus from infection, which differs by age
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. When individuals have contact with infected patients, the strength of their mucosal immunity is used to determine the probability they will be infected. The protective status of the mucosal immune system is measured by IgA antibodies, which are secreted by mucosal surfaces and found in saliva
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Secretion rates of IgA indicate the level of protection offered by IgA in efficiently coating the mucosa. Research showed that the mean secretion rates of IgA in children, adults 18–64 years, and adults 65 years and older decrease with increasing age with secretion rates (Sr) of Sr = 3.84, 3.62, and 3.25 (log 
 <italic>μg</italic>/2 min), respectively
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. We therefore used the normalized secretion rate of IgA to determine the strength of an individual's mucosal immunity. We defined

 <italic>i</italic>) as the index of mucosal immunity for each person according to his or her ages and use the following equation to determine whether the individual is infected or not.

 </disp-formula>A discrete time step (half a day) was set to count the number of individuals in the four states. Every morning, before people went out, their states were recorded and updated. Every night, before they went home, their states were updated as well.
