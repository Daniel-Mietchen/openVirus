<p>People who are infected with the influenza virus typically undergo four states: 
 <italic>Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious</italic>, and 
 <italic>Recovered</italic> (SEIR)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Individuals in each SEIR state were coded as 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively. A state matrix 
 <italic>S

 <sub> × 
  <italic>N</italic>
 </sub> stores each individual's SEIR state every day, where 
 <italic>N</italic> is the amount of simulated individuals and 
 <italic>M</italic> is number of days across the whole influenza season. Vaccinated individuals have a probability of moving a susceptible (S) individual into the recovered (R) state. We assume a portion of individuals has already been vaccinated. Influenza vaccine effectiveness
