<p>Infectivity of children is different from that in adults and aged individuals
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. For the latter group, we obtained infectivity risk based on research data where viral shedding was measured in volunteers challenged with wild-type influenza viruses

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> and rescaled the infectivity curve according to the length of infectivity period. For children, we obtained their infectivity curve and the length of infection from previous work

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Studies confirmed that for influenza, the infectious period in adults is 5–8 days, and in children under 10 years old 7–15 days
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. For children between 10 to 17 years old, we assumed the viral load and duration had a linear relationship with their age. We therefore rescaled the mean viral load curve to match the duration of viral shedding. Then we used the equation: 
 <italic>τ</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>′) = 0.02
 <italic>V</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>′) to calculate the corresponding infectivity (
 <italic>τ</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>′)) of children and adults
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, where 
 <italic>V</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>′) is the viral load during infection. To calculate the distribution of duration of viral shedding in infectious patients, we inferred the percentage of patients who still have detectable virus in infectious period from the studies in Refs.
