<p>Due to the annual recurrence of influenza, mathematical and computational models have been used widely in epidemiology to describe pandemic and seasonal transmission of virus and to conduct the simulations for the analysis and control toward it. One classical approach is to use statistical agent-based modeling to build likelihood functions with respect to person-to-person transmission probabilities to describe the spread of influenza globally

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. This method often assumes individuals are homogeneous and does not account for interpersonal interactions and individuals' personalities, which are key factors influencing the transmission of influenza virus. Another classical approach is using stochastic network model by incorporating interactions based on geography, demography and migration information to discover transmission patterns within heterogeneous populations
