<p>Clustering analysis for human cases was done with SaTScan v9.3 (Martin Kulldorff, Boston, USA), using data of human cases from February 2013 to 31 March 2014 and county level demographical data. Retrospective Space-Time analysis was conducted, using the Discrete Poisson model. For the spatial window, the maximum spatial cluster size was 10 percent of population at risk and 50 km in distance; for the temporal window, the minimum temporal cluster size was three days and the maximum 15 days.</p>
