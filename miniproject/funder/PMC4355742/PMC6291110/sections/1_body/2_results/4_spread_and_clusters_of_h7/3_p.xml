 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208884.g004">Fig 4</xref>: cluster W2-1 to W2-4). Similarly, onsets of the first cases in the clusters of W2-1, W2-1 and W2-3 were in the early stages (before 10 January 2014) of the second wave, while the cluster W2-4 in Hunan province was formed in the later stage (

The onset dates of the first human cases in each cluster were in sequence and the sequence was associated with the distance of following clusters to the original one. It is worth noting that the cluster in Hunan (W2-4) started late January 2014, just 1â€“2 weeks after increased live poultry movement from the other two clusters in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces (W2-1 and W2-3) to Hunan province (Figs
