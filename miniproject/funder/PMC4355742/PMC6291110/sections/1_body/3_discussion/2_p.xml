There is a shortest highway pathway from Nanjing city (center of the cluster W1-1) to Shaoyang city, the location of the first human case in Hunan province, and Nanchang city is between these two cities and on the same highway. The change in poultry movement of the yellow broiler trade platform in Anhui during March to May 2015 may explain the fact that new human cases of H7N9 influenza were reported in Beijing, Henan and Shandong provinces in April 2013 (
