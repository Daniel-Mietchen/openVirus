<p>Closure of LBMs in areas with human cases had been considered as the most successful measure in H7N9 control. Nonetheless, there are still many obstacles in implementing LBM closure policy. Firstly, citizens living in southern and eastern China prefer fresh chicken meat and this dietary habit is hard to change in a short time [

 <xref rid="pone.0208884.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The main reasons for this preference are better flavor with on-site slaughtered meat and concerns about the safety of chilled poultry meat [

 <xref rid="pone.0208884.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thirdly, illegal trade is often seen after LBM closure in an area, which makes it even harder for authorities to supervise H7N9 in poultry. Last but not least, LBM closure and disinfection in closed LBMs are found not to be sufficient in eliminating environmental contamination [

Multidisciplinary studies with joint efforts from the human health sector, veterinary sector, poultry industry and other stakeholders are called for the improvement of H7N9 control in China.
