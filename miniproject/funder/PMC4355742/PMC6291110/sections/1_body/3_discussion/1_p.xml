<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that has presented evidence that closure of live bird markets, adverse publicity and reduced prices has resulted in sudden changes in movements of live poultry during H7N9 influenza epidemics. This has resulted in significant increases in movements to neighboring provinces and other places without human cases at a time when H7N9 influenza virus was at a seasonal peak. In these places biosecurity and movement controls were limited and ineffective in limiting the spread of virus in poultry markets and thus resulted in human cases of the disease. The poultry transportation data from Anhui and Hunan province supports this assumption.</p>
