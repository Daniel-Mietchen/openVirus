The role of live bird market (LBM) closure on the spread of N7N9 influenza following the closure of LBMs during March to May 2013 (the first wave) and October 2013 to March 2014 (the second wave) is described in this paper. Different provinces implemented closure actions at different times, and intensive media reports on H7N9 in different provinces started at different times. Local broiler prices dropped dramatically in places with outbreaks and more live chickens were transported to other LBMs in neighboring areas without human cases from infected areas when live bird markets were being closed. There were six clusters of human infection from March to May 2013 and October 2013 to March 2014 and there may have been intensive poultry transportation among cluster areas. These findings provide evidence that the closure of LBMs in early waves of H7N9 influenza had resulted in expansion of H7N9 infection to uninfected areas. This suggests that provincial authorities in inland provinces should be alert to the risks of sudden changes in movement patterns for live birds after LBM closure or increased publicity about LBM closure.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017YFC1200500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Baoxu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the National Key R&#x00026;D Program of China (2017YFC1200500).

There have been five epidemic waves of H7N9 influenza in humans in China since 2013 and a total of 1507 human cases (as of June 17, 2017) have been reported in mainland China [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208884.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There were at least 732 cases recorded between October 2016 and June 2017. The sudden increase in human cases has caused global concern about the potential of a pandemic threat from H7N9 [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>H7N9 infection in humans is associated with exposure to live poultry [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Poultry infections with the low pathogenic H7N9 influenza virus were confirmed soon after the first human case reports and virus isolates from human were highly homogenous with isolates from poultry [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Poultry infection was found mainly in live bird markets (LBMs) and H7N9 positive results were also detected on a few poultry farms. Surveillance results showed that yellow broiler [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] was the most infected type of bird in LBMs [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. After genetic evolution over the last five years, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 has recently been detected in the field [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>National, provincial and local animal health and public health authorities have been taking active measures to try to control the emergency. One of the main measures taken by provincial and local government authorities has been the closure of LBMs in response to the detection of new human cases. This measure was considered successful because it appeared to decrease the number of human cases in these places for a short time [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A typical example was in Shanghai, where LBMs were closed in the middle of April 2013 and after two weeks there were no further human cases reported [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) released an official guideline on 29 January 2014 and suggested that LBMs should be closed in an area where human cases were identified [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As a result, live poultry trade was suspended in many affected provinces and cities for weeks or even months and in some places longer term closures and restructuring of the live chicken markets were implemented. However, the traditional demand by Chinese people for consumption of freshly killed poultry seems difficult to change in the short term, and unauthorized live poultry trading has continued after the closure of local LBMs [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the winter of 2016&#x02013;17, there has been a sudden increase in reports of H7N9 human cases in rural areas and the virus appears to have been spreading more widely [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208884.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The reasons for these changes are still not clear.</p><p>In this study, we describe the impact of the closure of LBMs, the resulting poultry movement patterns and the clustering of human infection in new areas in south eastern parts of China during the first two waves of H7N9 influenza. We hope this analysis can provide recommendations to reduce the spread of H7N9 influenza in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data collection</title><p>Detailed information on all human cases from February 2013 to March 2014 was collected from provincial CDC websites, FluTrackers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flutrackers.com">http://flutrackers.com</ext-link>) and official media reports. This included onset date, confirmation date, report date and patient&#x02019;s exposure location. Data on poultry positives were collected from the website of the Veterinary Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture. The poultry H7N9 surveillance data was generated from surveillance projects conducted by county, municipal and provincial veterinary authorities and was reported to the Veterinary Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, and then was updated monthly.

The broiler trading platform was owned by a commercial broiler company in Hefei city (capital city of Anhui province) and supplied more than 4.8 million live broilers to wholesale LBMs in other provinces in 2013. The LBMs were in Shaoyang City, Loudi City and Chenzhou City, the locations of 62% (13/21) of human cases in Hunan province in the first two waves.

The onset dates of the first human cases in each cluster were in sequence and the sequence was associated with the distance of following clusters to the original one. It is worth noting that the cluster in Hunan (W2-4) started late January 2014, just 1&#x02013;2 weeks after increased live poultry movement from the other two clusters in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces (W2-1 and W2-3) to Hunan province (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208884.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208884.g004">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that has presented evidence that closure of live bird markets, adverse publicity and reduced prices has resulted in sudden changes in movements of live poultry during H7N9 influenza epidemics. This has resulted in significant increases in movements to neighboring provinces and other places without human cases at a time when H7N9 influenza virus was at a seasonal peak. In these places biosecurity and movement controls were limited and ineffective in limiting the spread of virus in poultry markets and thus resulted in human cases of the disease. The poultry transportation data from Anhui and Hunan province supports this assumption.</p><p>Changes in transport destinations for live yellow chickens may have induced new human clustering in the uninfected areas. Six clusters of human cases were identified, which show that the spatial-temporal distribution of human infection was not random. During the first wave, the first cluster was formed in the early stage and the second one was formed in the late stage. There are no data available to support the opinion that there was poultry transportation from the first clustering area to Nanchang city. However, the first human case in Hunan province in the first wave, whose onset date was 14 April 2013, was exposed to chickens transported from the first clustering area [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208884.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There is a shortest highway pathway from Nanjing city (center of the cluster W1-1) to Shaoyang city, the location of the first human case in Hunan province, and Nanchang city is between these two cities and on the same highway. The change in poultry movement of the yellow broiler trade platform in Anhui during March to May 2015 may explain the fact that new human cases of H7N9 influenza were reported in Beijing, Henan and Shandong provinces in April 2013 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208884.s003">S1B Fig</xref>).</p><p>In the second wave, the clusters of human cases moved from eastern China to southern and central China. This is in line with another spatio-temporal study on H7N9 influenza in China [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The last human case cluster in Hunan province in the second H7N9 influenza wave started soon after increased poultry importation from the other two clustering areas, which suggests there might be intensive poultry transportation from former cluster areas to new clustering areas. However, transportation data between the clusters in Zhejiang and Fujian (the first two clusters in the second wave) were not available.</p><p>H7N9 influenza was spread to many inland provinces and rural areas contributed more cases [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here we also report that more farmers were infected in the second wave than in the first one. This may be due to the extension of H7N9 influenza virus to small cities and rural areas nearby, where LBMs may have lower biosecurity standards and consumers have less awareness about H7N9. There was a media report that panic buying occurred in Maoming city, Guangdong province in April 2013, because of the attractive low price, when many LBMs had closed in neighboring big cities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://news.ycwb.com/2013-04/14/content_4412992.htm">http://news.ycwb.com/2013-04/14/content_4412992.htm</ext-link>).</p><p>Closure of LBMs in areas with human cases had been considered as the most successful measure in H7N9 control. Nonetheless, there are still many obstacles in implementing LBM closure policy. Firstly, citizens living in southern and eastern China prefer fresh chicken meat and this dietary habit is hard to change in a short time [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208884.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The main reasons for this preference are better flavor with on-site slaughtered meat and concerns about the safety of chilled poultry meat [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Secondly, LBM closure policy is not welcomed by most of the stockholders from the poultry industry and many local consumers [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Poultry farmers and traders have higher risk of contracting avian-sourced influenza viruses but they perceive H7N9 as a low personal risk [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0208884.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thirdly, illegal trade is often seen after LBM closure in an area, which makes it even harder for authorities to supervise H7N9 in poultry. Last but not least, LBM closure and disinfection in closed LBMs are found not to be sufficient in eliminating environmental contamination [<xref rid="pone.0208884.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One health approaches are vital for further improvement of H7N9 control policy. Multidisciplinary studies with joint efforts from the human health sector, veterinary sector, poultry industry and other stakeholders are called for the improvement of H7N9 control in China.</p><p>The most challenging part in studying a public health policy from multiple angles is combining pieces of data from different aspects. In this study, we only analyzed the data from the first two waves, because the resolution in open-access data of human and poultry infection had decreased after the first two waves. Nonetheless, this study, providing evidence from a variety of perspectives, provides an important understanding of the risks of spreading H7N9 influenza as a result of long distance transport resulting from LBM closure in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec011"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Closure of live bird markets, adverse publicity and reduced prices has resulted in sudden changes in movements of live poultry in waves of H7N9, and these appear to have resulted in new clustering of human cases in neighboring provinces and other uninfected places. Our findings suggest that authorities in uninfected districts should be alert to the risks of sudden changes in movement patterns for live birds after LBM closure or publicity about LBM closure. They should take care to strengthen biosecurity systems and movement controls and to prevent the risks to poultry and humans in their places.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208884.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Official actions on LBMs closure in provinces.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208884.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208884.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Trade volume of the platform in Anhui to provinces during February to May 2013.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208884.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208884.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Yellow broiler price changes in neighboring provinces.</title><p>Arrows indicate the start dates of LBM closure in provinces with higher prices (Price Unit: RMB/500g).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208884.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208884.s004"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Human case distributions in different stages in the first two waves.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208884.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0208884.s005"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Original data used in this study.</title><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0208884.s005.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Sirenda Vong for his valuable comments at the design stage of this study.
