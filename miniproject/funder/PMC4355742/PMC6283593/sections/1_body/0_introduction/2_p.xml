<p>Vaccination offers the most effective way to prevent influenza/pneumonia-related hospitalization and death. Thus, the Korean government has subsidized the influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) for the elderly aged ≥65 years since 1997 and 2013, respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite such high uptake rates, there have been concerns with respect to vaccine effectiveness in the elderly population. Moreover, vaccine effectiveness for influenza varies according to the dominant influenza virus subtype and degree of mismatch between the vaccine and circulating virus strains each season. Nevertheless, influenza vaccination is expected to decrease disease severity, even if laboratory-confirmed influenza itself is not prevented. On the other hand, the effectiveness of PPV23 against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia remains controversial. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines against pneumonia and acute exacerbation of cardiopulmonary diseases among the elderly aged ≥65 years with influenza-like illness (ILI).
