<p>Although influenza disease burden might vary according to regional climate, population density, and seasonal viral antigenic changes, the clinical impact of influenza epidemics has been high worldwide. In the United States, influenza epidemics are responsible for approximately 20,000 to 40,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations annually [

Globally, the estimated mean annual influenza-associated excess mortality rate ranges from 0.1–6.4 per 100 000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2.9–44.0 per 100 000 individuals for people aged 65–74 years, and 17.9–223.5 per 100 000 for people aged ≥75 years [

Influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths are mainly caused by accompanying complications, including pneumonia, acute exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. Among influenza-related complications, pneumonia is the most common and serious complication, and pneumococcal pneumonia is especially common following influenza infection [
