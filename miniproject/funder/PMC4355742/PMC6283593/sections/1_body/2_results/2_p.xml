<p>During the study periods in South Korea, A/H3N2 subtype influenza was most prevalent in the 2014–2015 and 2016–2017 seasons, while A/H1N1 subtype viruses predominantly circulated in the 2015–2016 season [

 <xref rid="pone.0207918.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. During the 2014–2015 season, the influenza vaccine showed no significant effectiveness. In comparison, the overall VE of the seasonal influenza vaccine was statistically significant during the 2015–2016 (31.4%) and 2016–2017 seasons (60.8%). Specifically, VE was 30.3% for influenza A and 44.5% for influenza B during the A/H1N1-dominant 2015–2016 season and 58.3% for influenza A and 73.9% for influenza B during the A/H3N2-dominant 2016–2017 season.
