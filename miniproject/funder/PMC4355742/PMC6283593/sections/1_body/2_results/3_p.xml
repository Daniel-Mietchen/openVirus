<p>As for VE in preventing influenza-related complications, hospitalization, and 30-day mortality, both the influenza vaccine and PPV23 were assessed (
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Overall, seasonal influenza vaccination lowered the risk of pneumonia (35%), acute exacerbation of cardiovascular disease (51%), hospitalization (36%), and 30-day mortality (62%) in the elderly aged ≥65 years, but PPV23 did not. Neither the influenza vaccine nor PPV23 was significantly effective against acute exacerbation of chronic airway disease. These cases were further analyzed according to the dominant influenza viral subtype and influenza VE for laboratory-confirmed influenza (vaccine matching) in each season. During the A/H3N2-dominant season with poor influenza vaccine effectiveness (2014–2015 season), neither influenza vaccination nor PPV23 showed significant effectiveness against pneumonia or acute exacerbation of cardiopulmonary disease. During seasons with good influenza vaccine effectiveness (2015–2016 and 2016–2017), the influenza vaccine was effective in preventing pneumonia, but PPV23 was not (
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In particular, influenza vaccination was effective at preventing acute exacerbation of chronic heart disease (75.0%) and death (81.0%) during the A/H1N1-dominant 2015–2016 season. Crude VE of influenza vaccine and PPV23 are presented in
