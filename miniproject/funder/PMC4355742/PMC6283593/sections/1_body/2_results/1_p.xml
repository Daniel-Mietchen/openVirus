<p>During the study periods, 2,165 cases with ILI were registered, of which 46 were excluded because of uncertain vaccination records (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207918.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The demographic and clinical characteristics of cases with ILI varied by influenza season (
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the 2,119 enrolled cases, 1,181 (55.7%) were laboratory-confirmed as having influenza, 880 (41.5%) were hospitalized, and 70 (3.3%) died. Type A influenza infection was predominant across all three influenza seasons (88.2%, 1,042 among 1,181 laboratory-confirmed cases). Among severe cases, 21.8% (463 among 2,119 cases) were accompanied by diverse complications of pneumonia (370, 17.5%), acute exacerbation of chronic heart disease (65, 3.1%) or chronic airway disease (52, 2.5%), acute renal failure (55, 2.6%), rhabdomyolysis (18, 0.8%), encephalitis (2, 0.1%), or myocarditis (2, 0.1%). Forty cases (10.8%) of pneumonia were caused by
