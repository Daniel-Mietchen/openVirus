<p>Vaccination is considered as the primary strategy to prevent influenza infection, post-flu pneumonia and other complications. However, the value of influenza vaccination has been questioned with respect to the vaccine mismatch and low efficacy in old adults. Nevertheless, influenza vaccination is highly recommended, and free vaccination has been provided for the elderly aged 65 years and older in South Korea since 1997 [

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine for preventing pneumonia and acute exacerbation of cardiopulmonary disease in older adults across three influenza seasons. We also examined the dominant influenza viral subtype and vaccine match in each season. Consistent with US reports [

 <xref rid="pone.0207918.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although expected to lower the risk of post-influenza pneumonia irrespective of vaccine mismatch, the influenza vaccine was only effective against pneumonia during seasons with good VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza. Meta-analyses showed 25–53% effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against pneumonia- or influenza-related hospitalization, but results were not always consistent because of the variable degree of vaccine mismatch during the study periods [

 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, the selection of vaccine strains is very important, and each country should refer to regional influenza virus information in deciding the viral composition of influenza vaccines licensed in their country.
