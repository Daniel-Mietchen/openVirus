<p>In contrast with its effect on chronic heart diseases, influenza vaccination was not significantly effective in preventing acute exacerbation of chronic airway diseases consistently over the three influenza seasons in this study. However in the Cochrane analysis, influenza vaccination significantly reduced post-flu exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with placebo (37%, 95% confidence interval 11 to 64%)[

As for asthma, there are few published data, and most cases are limited to children. In a single study with low risk of bias conducted in a pediatric population, influenza vaccination induced no significant reduction in the number, duration, or severity of influenza-related asthma exacerbations [
