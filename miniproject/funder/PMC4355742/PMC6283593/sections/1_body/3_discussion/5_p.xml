<p>The primary strength of this study was that vaccination records were reliably identified using national immunization registry data of the KCDC. Laboratory tests and clinical data collection were conducted following the standardized HIMM surveillance protocol. On the other hand, there were some limitations to this study. First, PCR-based influenza viral subtyping was not carried out for all laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. Second, as reported previously, some complicated influenza cases might not present typical ILI, so they may have been missed [

Third, in H3N2 virus dominant seasons, the low number of events limited the statistical power to evaluate the VE against acute exacerbation of chronic lung and heart diseases. Finally, late exacerbation (cases occurring at â‰¥4 weeks from ILI) of cardiopulmonary disease was not considered in this study.
