<p>In addition to pneumonia, post-influenza hospitalization and mortality are related to acute exacerbation of cardiopulmonary disease. In a US study, approximately 25% of adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection had evidence of acute cardiac injury within 30 days, and the majority occurred within three days [

 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Influenza/pneumonia is known to induce endothelial dysfunction, hyper-coagulation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, which may make patients vulnerable to acute coronary events and exacerbation of heart failure. Influenza vaccination may prevent or mitigate these vicious cascades, thereby reducing acute cardiovascular events [
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, influenza vaccination significantly lowered acute exacerbation of chronic heart disease during the vaccine-matched A/H1N1 influenza-dominant season, but not in A/H3N2 influenza-dominant seasons. It is unclear whether these inconsistent results are related to viral subtype, the degree of vaccine matching, neuraminidase activity or other virulence factors of circulating influenza viruses. Previously, several studies reported the positive relation between cardiovascular events and increased serum levels of sialic acid and neuraminidase activity [

 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given the importance of neuraminidase activity, neuraminidase antigen should be better optimized in developing influenza vaccines.
