<p>To prevent post-flu pneumonia and cardiovascular complications, pneumococcal vaccination is also recommended for the elderly and patients with chronic illnesses [

 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Despite controversies regarding the effectiveness of PPV23 against non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia, several recent studies have shown short-term (within three years after vaccination) significant effectiveness (27.4–63.8%) of PPV23 against pneumococcal pneumonia [
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, the proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia was quite low (11%) owing to the herd effect from childhood PCV13 immunization, which already reached around 65% in late 2012 [

As for cardiovascular complications, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination significantly reduced the risk of acute coronary events by 17% (95% CI 3–29%) on meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, PPV23 did not show significant effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular complications in this study. Two points need to be considered in this study. First, most cardiovascular events were acute exacerbations of heart failure (95.4%), so most post-flu acute coronary events might be missed without clinical suspicion. Second, we only evaluated VE against post-flu cardiovascular events, not for pneumonia-related cardiovascular events.
