<p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated by using the case-control method. Test-negative control was used for the laboratory-confirmed influenza, while ILI patients without each complicated outcome was used as matched control for pneumonia, acute exacerbation of chronic airway diseases, acute exacerbation of chronic heart diseases, hospitalization, and fatality (within 30 days), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio for events (laboratory-confirmed influenza, pneumonia development, acute exacerbation of chronic airway diseases, acute exacerbation of chronic heart diseases, hospitalization, and 30-day fatality) in vaccinated versus unvaccinated subjects. Covariates included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities and month of illness onset. In multivariable logistic regression model for each event, we included factors with a p ≤ 0.05 in univariate analysis and potential confounders that might modify the VE. In univariate analysis, the significant difference between cases and controls was estimated by the Chi-squared or the Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and student-t test for quantitative variables. VE was defined as [100 × (1- odds ratio for event in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated persons)].</p>
