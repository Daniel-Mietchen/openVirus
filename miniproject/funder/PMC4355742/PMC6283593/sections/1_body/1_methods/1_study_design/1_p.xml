<p>During three influenza seasons (2014–2015, 2015–2016, and 2016–2017), a multicenter prospective cohort study was performed at 10 university hospitals that participated in a hospital-based influenza surveillance system (Hospital-based Influenza Morbidity and Mortality, HIMM)[
 <xref rid="pone.0207918.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During the study periods (from October 1 to April 30 each season), patients aged ≥65 years with ILI were enrolled when they visited emergency room with symptom onset ≤7 days. A rapid influenza detection test was performed at the bedside, and respiratory specimens were collected prospectively. Nasal/throat swab specimens were transported to the central HIMM laboratory for multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical data were obtained using a structured case report form that included demographics, underlying diseases, influenza/pneumococcal vaccination, influenza-related complications, hospitalization, and 30-day fatalities. Vaccination status was verified using immunization registry data from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC); each case was defined as vaccinated if they received influenza/pneumococcal vaccines at least 21 days before the ILI event. The study was approved by the ethics committee of each participating hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled subjects.
