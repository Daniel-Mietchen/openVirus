<p>Regulatory considerations are required early in the development process to ensure data requirements are met for safety and use (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If a tool under investigation does not fall under an existing product category (i.e., is a new class), a new regulatory framework and/or data requirements may be warranted. It is important to note, regulation can be as substantial an obstacle to an effective intervention as any gap in research and development (R&amp;D). Where regulations are prohibitive, options for arbovirus control will become even more constrained; this may be most evident when a lack of expertise and/or infrastructure exists around the new tool (e.g., biotechnology and gene drives).
