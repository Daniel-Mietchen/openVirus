<p>Despite the potential for ITMs to control arbovirus vectors, current application techniques and formulations have limited efficacy under general use as permethrin washes out of material after several washes and is degraded by UV and heat exposure [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Novel formulations are needed to achieve long-lasting, effective release of permethrin under anticipated use. A technology being developed to address this challenge is microencapsulation, which binds deeper within the fabric and increases insecticide stability, allowing for a more consistent and extended release of the active ingredient [

Novel active ingredients that have far-ranging efficacy compared to permethrin and/or represent a different chemical class (including natural ingredients) will be needed to overcome biting on exposed skin not covered by ITMs, as well as to address pyrethroid resistance, respectively [
