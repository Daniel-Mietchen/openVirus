<p>The sterile insect technique (SIT) is based on the release of sterilized male insects, traditionally by means of irradiation, to suppress vector mosquito populations. SIT induces random lethal dominant mutations in the germ cells, which acts on the eggs in the female to prevent fertilization [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The concept is that sterile males will mate with wild females without producing any offspring. A major challenge to scale implementation has been building infrastructure in endemic settings to support mass rearing of the target vector. New technologies for mass rearing of mosquitoes, especially

 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; however, improvement in the sterilization process is still needed to avoid somatic damage, resulting in reduction of longevity, problems with sexual vigor, and overall male activity [
