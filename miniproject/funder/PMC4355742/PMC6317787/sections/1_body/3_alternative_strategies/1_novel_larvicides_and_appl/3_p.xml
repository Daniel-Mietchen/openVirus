<p>An efficacy trial recently conducted in the United States showed a decline of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations following the field release of males contaminated with pyriproxyfen compared to untreated field sites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the combination of pyriproxyfen autodissemination with the SIT (see below), a concept termed “Boosted SIT,” is being explored [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Pilot interventions with pyriproxyfen have given promising results [
