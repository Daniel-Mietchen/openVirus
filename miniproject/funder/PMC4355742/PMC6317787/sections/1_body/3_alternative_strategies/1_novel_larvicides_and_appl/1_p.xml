<p>Entomopathogenic Ascomycetes fungi, especially 
 <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic> and 
 <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>, have been suggested for control of both larval and adult stages of dengue vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Fungal longevity (duration of efficacy once applied) may be one obstacle, with another being delivery of killing dose to target insect; therefore, formulation optimization is critical. Additionally, entomopathogens have fared badly in agriculture because they simply cannot compete with the costs and efficacy of chemical insecticides. This may change as insecticide regulation becomes more difficult and IR begins to dominate.
