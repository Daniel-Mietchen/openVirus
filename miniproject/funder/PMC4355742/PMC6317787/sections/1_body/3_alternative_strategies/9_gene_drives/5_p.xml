<p>Gene drives can also be applied in population replacement strategiesâ€”using a drive construct to confer mosquito resistance to a given pathogen resulting in a population that becomes pathogen resistant as the genetic invasion progresses. Proof-of-principle has been demonstrated in the laboratory using the Asian malaria vector 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, antiviral constructs could be designed similarly, targeting one or several viruses. Candidate antiviral factors include RNA interference (RNAi) constructs, overexpressed components of the antiviral response, or RNA-targeting molecular scissors such as the recently identified CRISPR-Cas-like system C2c2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In all cases, it will be important to ascertain increasing resistance to a given virus does not render mosquitoes more susceptible to another.
