<p>Two strategies are under evaluation in VCAG Step 1 based on gene drives—population replacement and population suppression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006822.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the latter, a drive element can be designed to insert into and inactivate a sex-specific fertility gene, suppressing the population as the resulting “sterility allele” increases its frequency. This approach was illustrated by a recent proof-of-principle laboratory study in the African malaria vector 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] and could rapidly be adapted to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. Gene drives may prove to function less efficiently in the field than in the laboratory [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] due to the selection of pre-existing refractory variants in the guide RNA (gRNA) targets. Should gene drives function almost as efficiently in the field as in theory, the suppression approach carries the potential to eradicate the target species altogether, although insect population substructuring would probably allow the existence of residual pockets of intact populations [
