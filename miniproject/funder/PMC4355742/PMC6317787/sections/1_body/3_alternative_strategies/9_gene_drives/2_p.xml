<p>Current gene drive designs are based on the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats—CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system. The transgenic element must be inserted precisely in the sequence that it is designed to cleave. To achieve this, a “cassette” is integrated by “gene knock-in” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The drive cassette thus becomes heritable and able to “drive” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006822.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Alternatively, docking sites can be knocked in the gene of interest and subsequently serve as acceptors for the gene drive cassette [
