<p>The release of insects with dominant lethality (RIDL) strategy reduces vector populations (self-limiting approach) through individuals carrying a transgenic construct, which acts on the late larval stage and the pupae to prevent survival to imago. In contrast to both SIT and 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based population suppression (see “Gene drives” section), for RIDL technology, eggs must become fertilized for subsequent impact. The engineered effector gene is homozygous, repressible dominant lethal, and activates its own promoter in a positive feedback loop but can be regulated using an external activator. The construct also includes a reporter gene resulting in RIDL insects expressing a visible fluorescent marker for easy screening of transgenic and hybrid individuals before and after an intervention [
