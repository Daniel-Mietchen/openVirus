<p>RIDL transgenic constructs have been successfully integrated into

 <italic>aegypti</italic> laboratory strains by Oxitec,which has performed open release trials with the OX513A strain since 2009 in Brazil, Cayman Islands, and Panama, with approvals pending for trials in the US and India. In Brazil, Panama, and Cayman, wild

 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations were reduced by more than 90% after release of the OX513A strain [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The sustainability of this reduction will depend on methods to avoid a new population increase from the remaining insects, hatching of dried eggs, and migration from uncontrolled areas. A continued monitoring system will provide a better overview of the impact of this method in long-term suppression of
