<p>Regarding population suppression, though it was reported almost 50 years ago that 
 <italic>Culex pipiens fatigans</italic> was eradicated via CI in a village in Myanmar (then Burma), it was only in 1971 that the involvement of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Successes in species-specific suppression using inundative male releases have been demonstrated in semifield and full-field trials involving 
 <italic>Aedes polynesiensis</italic> in French Polynesia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in Lexington, Kentucky, US [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Releases involving 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>âˆ’
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> have also started in California, Thailand, Singapore, and Australia. The safety of the approach has been thoroughly evaluated and reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Although results of field studies have been promising, full-scale sustainable deployment of a 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strategy requires more developmental efforts. Besides the need for an arsenal of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> vector strains that offers excellent CI, there is a need for active community engagement to gain public acceptance and a need to scale up the production of large numbers of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> mosquitoes through automation and optimization.
