 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a natural intracellular bacterial symbiont found in at least 60% of insects known to alter reproduction of its host. Present in the female germline of an infected insect, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is maternally transmitted to offspring. It can induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), where mating between 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected males and uninfected females yields eggs that fail to develop. Regular releases of male mosquitoes infected with a 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain not present in the wild-type mosquito could theoretically reduce the viability of eggs in the field and lead to population suppression. Alternately, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains may cause a decrease in the vectorial capacity of the vector (pathogen interference)â€”directly by interfering with competence or indirectly by shortening lifespan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The wMel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain currently being assessed by VCAG, in Stage 3 of evaluations, is intended for population replacement that interferes with ability to transmit pathogens (
