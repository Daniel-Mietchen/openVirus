<p>IR in arbovirus vectors, such as 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, is considered a major obstacle to successful control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The incidence of IR has increased rapidly in recent years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], and concerns regarding environmental impact caused from insecticide residues continue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This highlights the need for alternative methods to better manage arbovirus vector populations while mitigating selection pressure on existing IR genes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Other WIN reviews will describe IR distribution, mechanisms, and management; we present here complementary considerations on the integration of alternative strategies for resistance. The use of nonchemicals, or chemicals with completely different MoAs (i.e., alternate target site), will potentially have a greater impact on insecticide resistance management (IRM), such as using IGRs for larval and pyrethroids for adult 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> control, respectively [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Combination or rotations of unrelated compounds can (in theory) mitigate the occurrence of resistance and/or delay the selection process if already present at low levels. This may not hold true when considering metabolic resistance mechanisms by which one enzyme degrading one insecticide with a particular MoA may also degrade another insecticide with a different MoA. Reciprocally, two insecticides with the same MoA may not be degraded by the same enzymes (no cross metabolic resistance). The authors acknowledge that any tool is vulnerable to resistance development; therefore, robust monitoring and evaluation should accompany implementation.
