<p>Strategies used for IRM and the introduction of new VCTs is adopted from agricultural practices [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], which is defined as the rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] and includes the use of multiple complementary tools. An important point to stress is that a novel vector-control product may be more useful via its role in IRM in a certain setting with high levels of resistance risk, even if it is of a similar efficacy to existing interventions (“non inferior”).
