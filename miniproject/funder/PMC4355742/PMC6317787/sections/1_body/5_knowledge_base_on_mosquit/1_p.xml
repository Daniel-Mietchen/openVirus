<p>The importance of characterizing the biological profile (genetic structure, insecticide susceptibility) of the local vector population should be considered in the context of IVM and IRM using alternative strategies. For instance, the first release of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, did not succeed, because the spread of the bacteria was not self-sustained. Although 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was already hosted by around 60% of the local 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> after 20 weeks of insertion, this frequency rapidly dropped when releases stopped. This may likely have occurred because the released w
 <italic>Mel</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> strain was susceptible to pyrethroids, the class of insecticide largely used by residents in dwellings. It was known that the natural 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population of that locality was highly resistant to pyrethroids. When a new colony of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, as resistant as the field population, was infected with w
 <italic>Mel</italic> and released in the field for 24 weeks, 80% of local 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> presented the bacteria, and this index is continually increasing [
