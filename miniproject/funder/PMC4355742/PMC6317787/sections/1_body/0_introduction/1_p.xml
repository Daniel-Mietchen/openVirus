<p>International public health workers are challenged by a burden of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases despite best efforts in control programs. An estimated 4 billion people live in areas at risk for dengue virus transmission alone [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Well-documented successes indicate that rigorously applied vector control using existing interventions can reduce arbovirus transmission and disease [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; however, the degree to which such strategies may have prevented epidemics and the spread of arbovirus diseases is not well understood due to lack of evidence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite existing interventions, epidemics and spread of arbovirus diseases continue. The reasons for this are complex but include inadequate program implementation; ineffective coverage; lack of human, financial and infrastructural capacity; insecticide resistance (IR); political will; and inability to scale. Integrated approaches and advancements in development of alternative strategies have been of renewed focus. This review provides an overview of strategies under development for the control of arbovirus mosquito vectors, focusing primarily on
