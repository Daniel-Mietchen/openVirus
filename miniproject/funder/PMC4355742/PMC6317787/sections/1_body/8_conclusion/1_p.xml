<p>Arboviruses transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes represent major international public-health concerns that will surely require a range of integrated interventions to be effectively controlled. As the scope of arboviruses continues to grow, development and evaluation of alternative vector-control products and strategies are critical to pursue. Following endorsement by global, national, and local authorities, effective strategies will have to be locally adapted to take into account the biology of the vector and virus transmission intensity, as well as human and financial resources. This review focuses on alternative strategies mainly for control of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> because these two species are arguably the primary arbovirus vectors in the world. Alternative strategies will provide additional options for arbovirus control and potentially add value to existing strategies; however, until operational effectiveness and frameworks for use are in hand, further optimization of current strategies is warranted, to include innovative delivery methods of existing products (e.g., targeted indoor residual spraying [
