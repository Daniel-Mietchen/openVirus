<p>The qRT-PCR was conducted according to Zeng et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] for the detection of RVA using the NSP3 segment of RVA as the target gene sequence. The assay was conducted in a mixture containing: RNAse-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O, TaqMan RT-PCR Mix (2x), TAqMan RT Enzyme Mix (40x), primers for the NSP3 gene, Primer NSP3 Forward (20mM), Primer NSP3 Reverse (20mM), probe NSP3 S (10nm), Template (RNA) 3μL, having a total reaction volume of 17μL and reverse transcription cycling of 50°C, 30 minutes, denaturation of 95°C, 10 minutes, annealing of 45 cycles of 95°C, 15 seconds and extension of 60°C, 1 minute.
