<p>When assessing the infected animals in relation to the uninfected animals in both the forest fragment and the peridomicile, considering as animals of the forest fragment the birds, the chiroptera and the small rodents and as animals of the peridomicile the canines, bovines, pigs, felines and horses, a percentage of 37.07% infected peri domestic animals (86/232) and 22.12% infected forest fragment animals (92/416) were obtained. Applying the selected statistical analysis, a Pearson x2 Chi-square value was obtained: 16.7159, df = 1 and p &lt;0.001, meaning that the hypothesis was corroborated, that is, the greater the degradation of the environment, the more likely it will be the search for food by wild animals in adjacent areas, or in the edge of the forest or even in the peri domiciliary region. In this sense, the possibility of contagion with other species of animals, even humans, should be considered because of the capacity of the rotavirus to be transmitted via the fecal / oral route or through direct contact with the environment. It is important to point out that the animals detected in this study are important sources of viral strains.</p>
