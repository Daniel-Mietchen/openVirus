<p>The average deforestation index in the three study areas was calculated from data obtained from INPE information systems. It was observed that in the years of 2013 to 2014 there were no changes in these regions; in the period from 2014 to 2015 about 4.1% of the city of Viseu was changed and 1.6% of the city of Peixe Boi. In relation to the period of 2016, great changes were observed in Peixe Boi (79%) and in the city of Viseu (70%), thus demonstrating that changes in the natural ecosystem may be associated with the frequencies for RVA in the studied areas, according to
