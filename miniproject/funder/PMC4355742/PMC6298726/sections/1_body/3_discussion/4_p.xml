<p>Barquez et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Desmodus rotundus</italic> is one of the three hematophagous species of the 
 <italic>Phyllostomidae</italic> family, found throughout South America, Central America and Mexico. Of the positive chiroptera for RVA in the present study, a prevalence of 28.12% was of 
 <italic>Desmodus rotundus</italic>. This species feeds on birds, can feed on mammals, mostly medium or large, facilitating the dissemination of viral spores among the community within the habitat, as observed in the present study. These findings show the importance of epidemiological data on the studied species due to the lack of studies involving species of neotropical chiroptera, and it is not possible to establish comparative parameters for these animals.
