<p>Diarrhea associated with RVA infections in pigs is an important cause of increased mortality and economic losses in Europe. The most prevalent genotypes isolated from feces of Belgian diarrheal and non-diarrheal piglets in 2012 [
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] demonstrate a wide range of combinations of genotypes G / P including; G3P[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], G4P[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], G5P[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], G4P[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], G5P[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], G9P[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], G9P[

 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand, in the present study it was possible to detect only P[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] genotype, since majority of samples was asymptomatic for diarrhea.
