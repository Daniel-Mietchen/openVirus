<p>Regarding the genotype P [
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], itwas most detected in our samples in bats, dogs, swine and feline. This genotype is not common in animals, being more detected in human and environmental samples in various parts of the world and included our region [
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It is important to emphasize that the indicators of environmental contamination in Brazil are significant and contribute to the possibility of human-animal transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Such data need further investigation in later work to better characterize the interspecies transmission, since the occurrence of enteric viruses in different matrices demonstrates the anthropogenic impact of the exposed population around and points to the potential risk of infection by the possible exposure of individuals susceptible. Our findings may be useful for tracking fecal contamination in the environment using animals as possible sources thus minimizing the risk of infection by exposure to susceptible individuals, in this case different animal species or even human populations.
