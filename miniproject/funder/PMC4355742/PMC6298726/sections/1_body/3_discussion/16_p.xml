<p>In the population of animals studied the zoonotic transmission can be frequent, since the animals live in contact with humans and in precarious sanitary conditions. In Brazil, this genotype was described in animal and human populations in studies of Luchs et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; Ara√∫jo et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]; Mascarenhas et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and Lorenzetti et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0209005.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] such studies corroborate the importance of continuing to monitor genotypes to verify if uncommon strains or new strains are emerging and can infect animal populations or inter-species transmissions.
