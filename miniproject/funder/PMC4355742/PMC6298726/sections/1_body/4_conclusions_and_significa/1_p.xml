<p>RVA were detected in wild and domestic animals using a RT-qPCR assay that analyzed samples that had low viral load for RVA. Although the samples are asymptomatic for diarrhea, it is necessary to conduct strategies for the monitoring and control of the animals in the areas studied in the human population as well as in other species of animals, as well as the implementation of preventive measures aimed at future outbreaks in communities animals in the resident population in these impacted areas. Therefore, the present study is unprecedented in the region and in the country in relation to the research of RVA in wild animals. It is noteworthy that, although the quality of the analyzed samples is characterized as low detectable viral load, the technique presented a good analytical response in the detection of the source animals for RVA, facilitating the selection of the samples for future genetic characterization tests.</p>
