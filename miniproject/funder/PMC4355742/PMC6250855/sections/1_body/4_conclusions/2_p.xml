<p>It is essential to have reliable observed data in order to calibrate models well to specific settings and hence accurately replicate past trends in order to predict future trends. While our score proved to be robust, there are some data items that are both difficult to model and obtain reliable data on. Surveys like the DHS and ZIMPHIA are invaluable in terms of the information they provide and are a good indication of whether treatment programmes are working. However, it is likely that some of the outputs reported in these surveys, for example, the proportion of people diagnosed with HIV, and the proportion of people receiving treatment are underestimated due to stigma surrounding a HIV diagnosis and hence failure to disclose status. Further data collection, perhaps in the form of complete healthcare provider records, together with commitment to the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan as outlined in the National Strategic Plan

Considerable efforts are needed to reach the benchmarks suggested by the UN when calculating the HIV transition metrics, and in particular, to achieve the recommended 75% reduction in the number of new HIV infections. It is important to recognize that while continued efforts in testing are likely to reduce the number of people with undiagnosed HIV, the proportion of these people that are hard to reach is likely to increase and hence increased resources may be required for outreach testing to maintain current testing rates. Furthermore, while continued efforts are needed to diagnose and treat those with HIV, resources also need to be used to maximize prevention of HIV
