<p>In the second phase of the analyses, we made projections to 2020 to describe trends in prevalence, incidence, proportion diagnosed, proportion on treatment, proportion virally suppressed and proportion with resistance. Trends in the number of PLHIV, number of new infections per years, number of new diagnoses per year and number of AIDS deaths per year were also described. We reported medians and 90% ranges, calculated by taking the 10th and 90th centile across the range of runs used. To make these projections, each time the model was run one of the 500 parameter sets that had a calibration score below 0.30 was selected at random and used to replace the original random probability distributions for these model parameters. Each parameter set had an equal probability of being chosen. We ran the model 1500 times and again only selected runs for which the calibration score was &lt;0.3. This latter criterion was not fulfilled for all runs, despite using the 500 selected parameter sets due to stochastic variation.</p>
