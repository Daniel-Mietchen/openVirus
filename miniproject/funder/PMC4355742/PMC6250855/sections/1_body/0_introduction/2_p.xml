<p>In 2014, the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS introduced the 90‐90‐90 targets by 2020, 90% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) will be diagnosed, of those diagnosed 90% of people will be receiving antiretroviral treatment and among those receiving treatment, 90% will be virally suppressed

While it is arguable whether the 90‐90‐90 targets should be a primary target for a healthcare system, in so far as they do not distort rational resource allocation between healthcare options in countries, such targets can have a galvanizing effect and much progress has been made to meet them. However, there is still room for further advancement. In Zimbabwe, a 2016 population‐based survey (Zimbabwe Population‐Based HIV Impact Assessment (ZIMPHIA)) suggests that a quarter of PLHIV were not aware of their HIV status in 2016
