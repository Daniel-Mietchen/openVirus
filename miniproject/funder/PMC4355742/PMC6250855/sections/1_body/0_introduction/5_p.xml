<p>Using the HIV Synthesis Model 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, we here aim to mimic the epidemic in Zimbabwe and compare outputs from this individual‐based model to a range of observed data and describe recent trends in the HIV epidemic. We also project future trends in key indicators to 2020 with the aim of assessing whether Zimbabwe is on track to meet the 90‐90‐90 targets by 2020. Finally, we calculate the HIV transition metrics to assess the extent to which they appear to be consistent with the 90‐90‐90 targets.
