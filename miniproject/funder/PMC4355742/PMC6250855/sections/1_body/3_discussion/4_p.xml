<p>Our modelled estimate of prevalence of HIV in women who had greater than three condomless sex partners in the past three month period was lower than observed data among FSWs 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. This may be due to differences in the make‚Äêup of these two groups: for example, our modelled estimate for the number of FSWs was markedly higher than the empirical estimate on the number of FSWs, which itself is difficult to accurately estimate. To reflect this uncertainty, we allowed substantial variability over model runs in sexual behaviour parameter values which determine the number of women with greater than three condomless sex partners within the model.
