<p>Using an individual‐based model and a range of observed data in Zimbabwe, we were able to mimic the current HIV epidemic and project future trends in key indicators, including the 90‐90‐90 targets. The UNAIDS 90‐90‐90 targets in 2020 are within reach according to our projected trends, given increased efforts in diagnosing men in particular. While we predict 90.7% of adults with HIV overall will be diagnosed in 2020, the respective estimates for men and women are 84% and 95%. We estimate that 92% of people diagnosed will be receiving treatment, and of these, 86% will be virally suppressed (although may potentially be biased due to people under‐reporting treatment). Ninety per cent is within our uncertainty range; and continued commitment to the Extended Zimbabwe National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan
