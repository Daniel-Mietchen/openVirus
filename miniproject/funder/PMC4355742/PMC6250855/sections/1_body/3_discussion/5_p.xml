<p>When projecting forward to 2020 using the original calibration score, HIV incidence was projected to drop by 0.06 per 100 person‐years. Given the uncertainty around the incidence estimate, the degree of decrease is difficult to accurately quantify. We project that by 2020, the proportion of people diagnosed with HIV will increase, particularly in men, assuming the rate of testing remains at the current level. This may be due to a lower proportion of men diagnosed in 2017 compared to women, and hence, there is more scope for this estimate to increase. It is hoped that these estimates may increase even further, in line with increased efforts in testing for HIV in men, within for example the circumcision programme currently underway in Zimbabwe

The proportion of people with NNRTI resistance at ART initiation is also projected to increase by 9% to an overall 15% by 2020. This is of particular concern in this setting, given the limited access and availability of alternative first line regimens. Adherence counselling and efforts to increase testing have, and are currently taking place but continued effort in these areas is needed to ensure transmitted drug resistance does not become an issue that is unable to be effectively addressed. WHO guidelines have changed the national first line ART regimen in new initiators to be dolutegravir, rather than efavirenz, containing in countries with pre‐ART NNRTI resistance &gt;10%
