<p>When comparing observed and modelled outputs, we found a good fit across the majority of components included in the score. We did however see a higher predicted HIV incidence (within the 95% observed CI for women but not for men) and a higher predicted proportion diagnosed compared to those reported in ZIMPHIA. There is particular uncertainty over the current incidence since the only data source to inform this is the recent ZIMPHIA estimate 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, which was calculated using the recent infection algorithm 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. There are concerns of using a single method to estimate incidence 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>; hence, the ZIMPHIA estimate should be interpreted with caution. In contrast, the prevalence estimates are informed by three DHS surveys as well as ZIMPHIA 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, and we did indeed see a good fit when comparing our modelled prevalence data to observed data. Our estimate for proportion of PLHIV who have been diagnosed is higher than that seen in ZIMPHIA 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, which was the only data source available for this item. Our modelled estimate was a result of a good agreement of all other components of the score. Furthermore, the results from ZIMPHIA on HIV status are based on self‚Äêreported data and hence must be interpreted with caution. It is highly likely that not all people diagnosed with HIV report as having been diagnosed when asked; this has been demonstrated in other surveys 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> and if this is the case, it would result in an underestimation in the proportion diagnosed.
