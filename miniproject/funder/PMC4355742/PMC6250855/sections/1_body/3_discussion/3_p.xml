<p>The United Nations Assembly have suggested a target of a 75% reduction in new infections and AIDS‐related deaths between 2010 and 2020. In Zimbabwe, the percentage reduction for both these modelled outputs was &lt;30%, with wide variability around the estimates suggesting that we cannot rule out a percentage increase. While this transition metric does not take into account the achievements made prior to 2010, it does suggest that there is still considerable work to be done to reduce the number of new infections and AIDS‐related deaths. The modelled absolute rates of HIV incidence and AIDS‐related deaths in 2020 were both above 1/1000 person‐years. Rates below 1/1000 person‐years have been used to define elimination of HIV

 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>. Potential issues with our projected incidence measure are discussed later in this section and so though it is considerably higher than 1/1000 person‐years our model may not reflect the true incidence. Our modelled incidence–mortality ratio was 1.05. UNAIDS do state a benchmark of one for this transition metric; however, this is only relevant with a measure of low mortality among PLHIV or high ART coverage, defined as &gt;81% of PLHIV (P Ghys, personal communication). Zimbabwe, according to the ZIMPHIA estimates, does not currently meet the 81% ART coverage. However, using estimates from our model, we predict 84% ART coverage and in this case, the incidence–mortality ratio implies that there are more new infections than deaths per year. Hence, it is likely that, despite the reduction in prevalence, the number of PLHIV is on the rise, due to population growth. The modelled incidence–prevalence ratio takes into account duration of life after HIV acquisition. Our projected output was below the target suggested, of 0.03, based on an average survival of people with HIV of 33 years after acquisition. This transition metric suggests that the total number of PLHIV will eventually fall, and hence, the epidemic is in a “state of control.” This interpretation is not in line with the interpretation of the three metrics prior to this (percentage reduction in new infections/AIDS‐related deaths, the absolute rates of new infections/AIDS‐related mortality and the incidence–mortality ratio) which suggest that increased efforts are needed to bring the HIV epidemic under control. This also suggests that even if the 90‐90‐90 targets were achieved, the HIV transition metrics are unlikely to all be met, and hence, there may be a lack of consistency between the two sets of targets, certainly in the short term.
