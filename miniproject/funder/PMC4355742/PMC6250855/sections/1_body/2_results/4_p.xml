<p>In the second phase of the analyses, we projected forward to 2020 and analysed results at 2017 and at 2020 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225205-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We predict little change in the prevalence of HIV from 2017 to 2020, though predict incidence to fall by a mean of 0.06/100 person‐years, albeit with substantial uncertainty in this trend (90% range: −0.16, 0.03). With continuation of current testing rates, the overall predicted proportion of PLHIV diagnosed by 2020 is estimated to be 0.91 (90% range: 0.87, 0.94). We predict a mean 0.05 absolute increase (90% range: 0.02, 0.07) in the proportion of men diagnosed and a 0.02 absolute increase (90% range: 0.00, 0.04) in the proportion of women diagnosed, resulting in an overall proportion of 0.84 (90% range: 0.78, 0.90) of men diagnosed with HIV and 0.95 (90% range: 0.91, 0.97) of women diagnosed in 2020. The proportion of HIV‐positive people diagnosed with HIV receiving ART is expected to increase by 0.02 (90% range: 0.01, 0.06), resulting in 0.92 (90% range: 0.90, 0.93) of diagnosed people on treatment in 2020. Of those receiving ART, there is minimal predicted change in the proportion of people with viral suppression. The overall proportion of people with viral suppression in 2020 is predicted to be 0.86 (90% range: 0.81, 0.91); 0.87 (90% range: 0.78, 0.92) of men and 0.86 (90% range: 0.82, 0.91) of women had viral load suppression in 2020. Of those aged 15 to 49 living with HIV (undiagnosed as well as diagnosed), 0.37 (90% range: 0.31, 0.43) had unsuppressed viral load in 2017, compared to a predicted 0.30 (90% range: 0.25, 0.36) in 2020. The proportion of people with non‐nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance at time of starting ART is expected to increase markedly in three years time, from 0.05 (90% range: 0.01, 0.13) in 2017 to 0.13 (90% range: 0.05, 0.23) in 2020; a change of 0.07 (0.01, 0.16). Modelled estimates in 2017 and in 2020 using the three alternative calculations were in line with those calculated using the original score and are shown in
