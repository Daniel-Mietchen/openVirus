<p>Comparison of the modelled data items using the original score with the latest available observed data is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="jia225205-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The modelled estimates for incidence of HIV (median over 500 runs: 0.50/100 person‐years (90% range: 0.20, 0.96) for men and 0.76/100 person‐years (0.27, 1.53) for women) and proportion of HIV‐positive people diagnosed (0.77 (90% range: 0.70, 0.84) for men and 0.92 (0.87, 0.96) for women) were higher than the observed data (0.28/100 person‐years for men, 0.67/100 person‐years for women and 0.70 for men and 0.77 for women respectively 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>). However, these modelled values were a result of a good fit of all other items in the score and the extent to which the observed data are underestimates is unclear. The modelled estimate for number of female sex workers (FSWs) was also higher than the observed data, though the observed data did fall within the 90% modelled range. Table 
 <xref rid="jia225205-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> also shows selected comparisons between other data items of interest and, in particular, the proportion with viral suppression of those on ART. Again, there is a good concordance between observed data and model outputs; 84% of males have viral load suppression while on ART according to the ZIMPHIA survey, compared to 88% in our model outputs and the respective proportions for females are 88% (observed) and 86% (modelled). Further comparisons with a broad range of data items are given in the Description of Model Calibration document.
