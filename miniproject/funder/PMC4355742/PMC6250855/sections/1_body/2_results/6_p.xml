<p>Finally, we calculated a modelled percentage reduction in new infections from 2010 to 2020 of 36.5% (90% range: 13.7% increase to 67.4% reduction), and in AIDS‐related mortality of 30.4% (90% range: 9.7% increase to 56.6% reduction. The interim impact target for both these measures agreed by the United Nations Assembly was a 75% reduction. The absolute rates of modelled incidence and AIDS‐related mortality in 2020 were 5.48 (90% range: 2.26, 9.24) and 1.93 (1.31, 2.71) per 1000 person‐years respectively. The modelled incidence–mortality ratio and incidence–prevalence ratios in 2020 were 1.05 (90% range: 0.46, 1.66) and 0.009 (90% range: 0.004, 0.013) respectively.</p>
