<p>In conclusion, we divide the influenza strains of H1N1 epidemic and pandemic events into different periods chronologically. Mutation pattern analysis of HA1 of influenza A H1N1 proves that the amino acid changes and antigenic variation of strain pairs differ across periods. The single prediction models constructed show clear poorer performance when tested in the antigenic relation with other types. Therefore, the construction of the stacking model of prediction antigenic variants of influenza H1N1 overcomes the challenge of diverse mutation variations, combining all the situations. Residue-based, five epitope region-based and ten regional band-based feature vectors applied in the training process prove the feasibility and reliability of the stacking model built on chronological epidemic and pandemic periods by achieving a good performance on the prediction of antigenic variants. This study not only paves a path on the study of distinct antigenic evolution of influenza H1N1 virus, but also gives insight on the potential mutation sites that distinguish past epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. It also provides a new perspective for the antigenic variants prediction with reliability and accelerates the selection of vaccine strains.</p>
