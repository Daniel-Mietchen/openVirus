<p>The purpose of applying three different methods of feature generation for antigenic variants prediction is to validate the feasibility and reliability of the model constructed based on epidemics and pandemics. The residue-based method converts the number of amino acids changes in each residue site between a pair of sequences as one feature and all the sites are taken for generating feature vectors. Although not all sites are closely correlated with antigenic variation, we obtain impressive performance in the prediction of antigenic relation between strains. The features extracted from five epitope regions focus on the regions that encompass the sites at which antibodies bind to HA1 [

Different from residue-based method, epitope region-based method would more directly reflect the relation between antigenic sites and variants. Moreover, some researchers regard that the evolutionary selective pressure has varied over time on some specific amino acid position [

 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and the features generated from ten regional bands not only contain many residues in epitope regions but also implicate potential crucial sites that locate outside five antigenic epitopes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207777.g003">Fig 3</xref> suggests that the model using residue-based features achieves better prediction results than regional band-based and epitope regional-based features. We might infer that the more features applied for the prediction of antigenic variants, the better performance will be.
