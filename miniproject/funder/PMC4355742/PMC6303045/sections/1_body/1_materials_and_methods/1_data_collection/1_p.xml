<p>We used two types of data in this study, including antigenic data and sequence data. Antigenic data was based on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and collected from diverse sources, such as World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), The Francis Crick Institute (FCI), U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and relevant literature. In total, 1772 pairs of HI assay data of HA1 viral strains were obtained for influenza H1N1. As for the sequence dataset of HA1, it was obtained from Influenza Virus Resource (IVR) [

 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] on 31 Dec, 2016. The sequence collection was filtered by minimal length 327 (HA1 length) and human host. The dataset comprises 9859 sequences in total after removing duplicate sequences for H1N1. Because hemagglutination inhibition assay was developed in 1940s as the method for quantifying the relative concentration of viruses, bacteria or antibodies [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], no antigenic data is available and there are only scarce sequence data for period 1. Thus we only consider period 2 to 6 in subsequent analysis.
