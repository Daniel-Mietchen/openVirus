<p>As we know that the influenza strains in different periods may lead to various levels of disease such as epidemics or pandemics. We first investigated the distinct mutation patterns of strains from different periods regardless of whether they were caused by antigenic drift or antigenic shift. We took the distinctions as facts, focusing on highlighting the variation patterns across periods. To validate that the strains in different periods went through distinct antigenic variations, the mutation patterns of HA1 proteins were analyzed by calculating the moving average position information entropy of amino acid sites on HA1, which could reflect the variant patterns of influenza virus antigens. Then, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) analysis was performed on the information entropy of amino acid positions between periods in terms of moving average position information entropy. These analyses suggested that the H1N1 viruses in different periods have most likely experienced diverse mutation variations. Therefore, we first built models on each type to predict its antigenicity, described as a single model, illustrating potential evolutionary patterns from periods 2 to 6 in the following way.</p>
