<p>MAFFT [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was applied to the collected sequences for multiple sequence alignment. Because of different lengths of HA proteins of H1N1, the aligned sequences showed many insertions and deletions. Thus we only kept the HA1 residues and deleted others including signal peptide in each strain. Moverover, the sequences with a gap ratio greater than 10% were also removed by manual check. The remaining samples comprised 107 strains, 28 strains, 2247 strains, 5099 strains and 2208 strains for periods 2 to 6 respectively shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The antigenic and sequence data of each period can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207777.s001">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207777.s002">S2</xref> Files after cleaning and preprocessing.
