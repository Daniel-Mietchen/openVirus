  <italic>ij</italic>

 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> is greater than or equal to 4 (a threshold defined by Liao et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]), the antigenic relation between the two strains is considered to be distinct, otherwise it is similar. If the HI titer of the same pair was measured in multiple independent institutions, the median titer value was taken [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After removing duplicate pairs, we obtained 937 antigenically distinct pairs and 636 antigenically similar pairs in total.
