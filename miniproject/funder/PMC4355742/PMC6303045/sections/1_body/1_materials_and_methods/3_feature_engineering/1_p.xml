<p>According to our analysis, HA proteins of H1N1 in different periods were probably subject to distinct mechanisms generating antigenic variations at the site level. To build a computational model for the prediction of antigenic variants, three different feature engineering methods were applied to the construction of model built on epidemics and pandemics to test its feasibility and universality, namely, residue-based, ten regional band-based and five epitope region-based methods. Residue-based method uses all the sites on HA1 protein to generate features. By extracting features on single sites between strains, 327 different features were obtained for every pair of strains, where 0 represents the same animo acid between strains on the site and 1 otherwise. The regional bands, defined based on Lees et al. [

The number of amino acid changes in each regional band between a pair of sequences was extracted as features. Similarly, epitope regions of H1 [
