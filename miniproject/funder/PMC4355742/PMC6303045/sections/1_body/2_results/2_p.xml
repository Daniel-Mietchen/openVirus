<p>The correlation analysis between residues’ information entropy on HA1 proteins in different periods further verified distinct mutation patterns shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The correlations of residues’ entropy variations of HA1 protein ranged from 0.03 to 0.69 among periods, which was measured by Pearson Correlation Coefficient. These results indicated a medium (0.3-0.8) or low (0-0.3) correlations of mutation patterns between periods. Especially, the correlation coefficients of period 3-4 and 3-5 were quite low, only attaining 0.05 and 0.03 respectively. It may infer the influenza H1N1 strains appeared in 1977 Russia flu yielded drastic and frequent mutations during the years from 1978 to 2008, when there were intermittent epidemics occurred all over the world. However, compared with strains in period 3, the strains in period 4 are less disparate than those in period 5 that the correlation reached 0.67. It also reasonably accounted for the low correlation of strains between period 3 and period 5. In combination, the results above suggested the diversity of mutation patterns of influenza H1N1 in terms of pandemic and epidemic events, and gave a better insight for understanding the mutation patterns for H1N1 strains.
