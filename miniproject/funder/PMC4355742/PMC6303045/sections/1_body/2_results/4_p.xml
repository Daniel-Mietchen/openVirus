<p>We further studied how the partition of different periods of HA1 proteins made the impact on the model of antigenic variants prediction. Due to the rapid antigenic shift or drift that brings about the occurrence of antigenic variants, the effects on antigenicity of specific mutations have not been clear painted. The changes of antigenicity depend not only on the property and number of the amino acid substitutions but also on the amino acids currently encoded at certain key positions in HA1 [

The performance of the models based on different feature vectors didnâ€™t show much difference, which indicated that the generation of new features from residue sites was probably not the main factor in influencing the prediction results. Some more elements, such as environment and individual immune system, need to be considered for the possibility of H1N1 variation mechanism that distinguishes epidemics and pandemics, which is out of scope in this paper.
