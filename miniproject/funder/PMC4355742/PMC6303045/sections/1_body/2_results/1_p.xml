<p>The HA1 viral protein, as the main antigen of influenza viruses, is the immunodominant part of HA segment [
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The analysis of mutation patterns of HA1 proteins in different periods was implemented by the calculation of information entropy in each residue position. Because of the conserved sites in aligned sequences of HA1, the value of information entropy would be 0 that caused steep distribution values on different sites when plotted in the figure. Therefore, we used the moving average position information entropy with the window size of 11 to reflect variation patterns of HA1 proteins. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207777.g002">Fig 2</xref> presented a diverse patterns of entropy variations of the HA1 residues. For example, the peaks of the curve in period 2 located at site 156 and 190, while the same position in period 3 or 4 was in the valley. Some other similar situations could also be found in the figure such as site 75, 145, 160, 200 and 275. These sites could have undergone diverse mutation patterns in different periods. Although some sites reflected similar mutational tendency in all periods, like site 103 and 210, the overall variation patterns tended to be distinct in different periods. However, the accumulation of these mutation sites in distinct variation patterns could lead to different extent of influenza outbreaks through years.
