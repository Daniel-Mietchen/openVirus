<p>Our analysis suggested that HA1 proteins of influenza H1N1 in different periods probably experienced distinct variation patterns. The single models, trained and tested in each type, were constructed by several basic classifiers. These classifiers consisted of logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), naïve bayes (NB), neural network (NN) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN). The predicting accuracy of single models on average was shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> by three feature generation methods. Logistic regression, neural network and naïve bayes classifiers were selected for the construction of stacking model according to the superior experimental results shown in red. Furthermore, we also explored whether the single model in one type could perform well applied to others. We only presented the results with best classifiers, that is, logistic regression, neural network and naïve bayes, corresponding to residue-based, regional band-based and epitope region-based features respectively, to test the performance of all types. The model performed quite well when tested within the same type that was highlighted in bold but relatively poor on other types in most cases shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207777.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. For example, the single model on Type III achieved an accuracy over 0.9 on average based on three different feature generation methods, but it only obtained the accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 for others. Similar cases can be found in other single models, which further validated the relative insufficient performance to predict the antigenic variants for mutation patterns of different types using single models.
