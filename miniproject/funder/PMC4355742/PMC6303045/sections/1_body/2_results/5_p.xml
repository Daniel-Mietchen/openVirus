<p>The pilots above prompt the construction of a comprehensive model that can contain all different types for antigenicity prediction. Therefore, a stacking model was built to predict the antigenic variants of HA1 proteins of influenza H1N1 for all circumstances. Logistic regression, neural network and na√Øve bayes were selected as base classifiers to constitute the models at level 1 of stacking model due to their performance in single models. Except for these three classifiers, we also introduced two ensemble classifiers, random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB), to jointly form the models at level 2, adding diversity and strengthening the robustness. The stacking model at level 3 was built by logistic regression because of the small dimension for new training dataset obtained from level 2. The performance of the stacking model was presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207777.g003">Fig 3</xref> in comparison with other classifiers used at the level 2 for the prediction of antigenic variants by three different feature vectors. We calculated the mean value of each type obtained by these models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The details of the results could be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207777.s003">S3 File</xref>. Accordingly, the best predicting accuracy was 0.908, achieved by stacking model with residue-based features. The sensitivity and specificity of the stacking model also displayed competitiveness, which was 0.755 and 0.811 respectively. We may infer that the more residues we used, the better performance it would achieve on the antigenic variants prediction. Although the results based on five epitope regions and ten regional bands performed not as well as residue-based method, we observed that the stacking model still slightly outperformed other models.
