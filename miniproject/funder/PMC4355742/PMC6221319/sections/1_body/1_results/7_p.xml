<p>To determine the potential influence of study bias, we created a separate ensemble of models, trained on the same data-splits as the models in our primary ensemble, that included the log-transformed number of PubMed citations for each virus as a predictor, a measure of research effort. Study effort was relatively influential in these models (mean relative influence = 20.685, 2nd highest of all predictors), but its inclusion did not improve overall predictive performance, and the rankings of the most influential variables were highly similar between the two ensembles (Kendall rank-order correlation = 0.929). Comparing partial dependence plots between the two ensembles shows that including study effort as a predictor does not meaningfully alter the predicted trait profile of transmissible viruses (

Furthermore, rankings of individual virus species by their predicted transmission probability were similar between models that do and do not include study effort, with a Kendall rank-order correlation of 0.86. These comparisons suggest that the primary model ensemble is not severely confounded by study bias.
