<p>A number of structural features were also associated with human transmissibility, including the absence of a lipid envelope, small virus particle size (&lt; 75 nanometers (nm) in diameter), and limited genome segmentation (â‰¤ 2 segments). These relationships have been identified in a previous analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Non-enveloped virions are often more stable in the extra-host environment than enveloped particles, and can therefore remain infectious in the air, in water, and on surfaces for longer periods of time [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This corroborates previous findings [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The elevated stability of non-enveloped viruses could partially explain the association between smaller virion size and human transmission in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g003">Fig 3</xref>, since the lipid envelope contributes to the diameter of the virion; in our dataset, the average diameter of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses was 109 and 52 nm, respectively. The negative relationship that we observed in our models between number of genome segments and transmission likelihood does not contradict Geoghegan 
 <italic>et al</italic>, which classified genome segmentation as a binary variable and found that segmented viruses are collectively less likely to be transmissible between humans [
