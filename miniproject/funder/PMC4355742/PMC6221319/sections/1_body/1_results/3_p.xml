<p>Virus presence in certain human tissues was also predictive of human transmissibility in our model. Virus detection in the liver, the central nervous system, and the upper and lower respiratory tracts was associated with an increased likelihood of transmission between humans. The respiratory tracts support successful viral entry and establishment, as they place a large surface area of exposed mucosal membrane in direct contact with the environment [

 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As the livers and central nervous systems of living patients are relatively inaccessible to diagnosticians, false negatives among under-sampled viral zoonoses could bias the observed relationships between viral presence in these locations and transmission ability.
