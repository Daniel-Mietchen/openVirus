<p>Our models identified certain non-human hosts of zoonotic viruses as strong predictors of secondary human transmissibility. Zoonoses carried by nonhuman primates were more likely to be transmissible between humans than other zoonotic viruses, while viruses found in rodents and birds were less likely to be transmissible. Arthropod-borne viruses also showed a significantly reduced probability of being transmissible between humans compared to directly transmitted viruses, corroborating previous findings [
