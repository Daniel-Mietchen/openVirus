<p>In this analysis, viruses capable of spreading between humans directly, environmentally, or through an intermediate arthropod vector are labeled as “transmissible.” To assess the robustness of our findings to different definitions of the “transmissible” label, we fit a separate ensemble of GBM models with a modified response variable definition. For these models, we labeled viruses as “transmissible” (binary response = 1) if they are capable of spreading between humans directly or through the environmental, while viruses that are not known to spread between humans at all or require an intermediate vector to spread are classified as “non-transmissible” (binary response = 0). This change in definition had the effect of reclassifying the response of 5 arbovirus species (chikungunya, yellow fever, dengue, o’nyong-nyong, and Oropouche) from “transmissible” to “non-transmissible”. The rankings of predictors by mean relative influence were almost identical between ensembles (Kendall rank-order correlation = 0.985), and a comparison of partial dependence plots shows that the trait profiles of directly transmissible viruses and transmissible viruses as a whole do not significantly differ (
