<p>Using our primary model ensemble, we ranked viruses by their mean predicted probability of being transmissible between humans (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g002">Fig 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206926.s006">S3 Table</xref>). Of the 85 human viruses not currently known to spread between humans, 47 were assigned higher probabilities than Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, the lowest ranked species with known transmissibility between humans. Within this subset, the viruses with the highest probability of secondary human transmission were Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Hendra virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Cardiovirus A [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Rosavirus A [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], HTLV-3 and 4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Simian Foamy virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These pathogens may be predisposed to developing human-to-human transmissibility, and some may already be capable of transmission between humans, as underreporting and misdiagnosis of infections often allow viruses to spread unobserved [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Future epidemiologic studies of these pathogens should make efforts to identify potential human-to-human transmission.
