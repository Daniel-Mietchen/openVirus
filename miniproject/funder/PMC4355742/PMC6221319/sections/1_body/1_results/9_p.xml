<p>Not all viruses were accurately classified by our model. In particular, some viruses with known human-to-human transmissibility were assigned a low predicted transmission probability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The 10 human-transmissible viruses with the lowest predicted response values belong to 5 families: 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206926.s006">S3 Table</xref>). These families contain relatively high numbers of individual virus species, few of which are known to be transmissible between humans (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206926.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Further molecular characterization of these viruses may identify factors that distinguish human-to-human transmissible “outlier” viruses from their non-transmissible relatives.
