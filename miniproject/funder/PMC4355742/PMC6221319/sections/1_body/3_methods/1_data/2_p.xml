<p>Based on published epidemiological information, we assigned a binary response variable to indicate whether or not there is evidence of human-to-human transmission for each virus. Our operational definition of “transmissible virus” is a pathogen which has spread via direct contact with an infectious human, as well as viruses which may be indirectly transmitted between humans through an intermediate arthropod vector or environmental source (i.e., transmission through the fecal-oral route or following contact with surface fomites). This definition does not encompass infection resulting from organ transplantation.</p>
