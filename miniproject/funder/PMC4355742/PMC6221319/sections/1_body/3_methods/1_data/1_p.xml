<p>We compiled data on all viruses suspected to infect humans and candidate predictive features associated with each viral species. Our list was initially derived from the viral pathogens listed in GIDEON [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], ViralZone [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We further supplemented this list by searching the literature for publications describing additional viruses which have had genetic material isolated from humans, obtaining a total of 224 viral species recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We also extracted information from the literature on a variety of biological features, including the genetic and structural attributes, animal hosts, arthropod vector status, and human tissue presence of each virus, and encoded this data as 19 predictor variables (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206926.s004">S1 Table</xref>). Because their histograms showed highly skewed distributions, we log-transformed the variable for number or genome segments. To measure the influence of taxonomic grouping on transmission ability, we included each unique family and genus (using the taxonomic groupings recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]) represented among our list of human viruses as 104 separate binary variables, for a total of 123 predictor variables. This dataset contains no missing or incomplete values (100% data coverage), and to our knowledge is more extensive in the number of viruses and viral features than past studies of the association between pathogen traits and transmission ability [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
