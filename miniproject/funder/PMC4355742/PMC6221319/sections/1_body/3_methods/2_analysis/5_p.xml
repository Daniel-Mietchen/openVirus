<p>To investigate the differences in predictive performance between our tree-based machine learning approach and more rigid logistic regression models, we fit a comparable generalized linear model (GLM) to each of the 40 train-test partitions. On average, testing AUC was higher in the primary GBM models than the primary GLM models by 0.149. When evaluated by a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, this provides statistically significant evidence at p &lt; 0.00001 that the median of the distribution of testing AUC scores is greater for primary GBM models than primary GLM models. When taxonomy variables were excluded from models, testing AUC was higher in GLM models by an average of 0.001 relative to GBM models, a statistically insignificant difference (p = 0.9808 under a Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These results indicate that the predictive performance of our machine learning methodology is equivalent to or greater than that of parametric logistic regression models in this situation.</p>
