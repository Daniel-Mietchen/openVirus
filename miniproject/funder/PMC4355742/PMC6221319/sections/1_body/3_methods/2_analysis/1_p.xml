<p>Of the 224 virus species confirmed to infect humans, we randomly selected 80% and 20% to create the training and testing sets, respectively. We repeated this process to create 40 unique data-splits, and built our primary model ensemble by fitting a single model to each unique training set using the gradient boosting machine (GBM). The GBM fits a boosted regression tree comprising a sequence of decision trees [

 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Within each tree, predictors are associated with the response (here, a binary indicator of human-to-human transmission) by recursively breaking down the total pool of training observations by randomly selected splitting variables. At each step (or “split”), groups become smaller and more homogeneous. After a specified number of splits, the mean response of each group is recorded and assigned to the associated terminal node. This process is iterated to create a set of thousands of trees. Our models were built with 5500 trees and specify a Bernoulli error distribution for the binary response variable. We applied ten-fold cross validation during the fitting process to prevent overfitting. To further investigate the effect of phylogeny on transmissibility, we built and analyzed a second ensemble of 40 models that did not include any taxonomy variables. All partitioning, model building and subsequent analysis was done in R [
