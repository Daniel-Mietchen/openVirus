<p>The structure of these tree ensembles was analyzed to gain insight into the relationships between predictor and response variables. To determine the relative contribution of each predictor to classification performance, we computed relative influence scores using Friedmanâ€™s algorithm [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For each predictor variable in a given model, this algorithm sums the reduction in error across all nodes in the collection of trees that use the variable for splitting within a single model. These raw influence scores are then normalized as percentages and the average and standard deviation of scores across all 40 models in the ensemble were derived. We also constructed partial dependence plots, which show the marginal impact of individual predictors on the model response by integrating over the influence of all other variables [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g003">Fig 3</xref> show the median effect across all 40 models in the primary ensemble, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
