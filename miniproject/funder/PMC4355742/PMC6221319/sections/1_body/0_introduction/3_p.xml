<p>In this study, we use a predictive machine learning model to identify specific virus species that may have undocumented potential for human-to-human transmission. The tree-based machine learning method we employ in this analysis, known as gradient boosted regression trees, offers a number of distinct advantages over more parametric statistical models. Boosted regression trees accommodate diverse data types and are robust to hidden interactions, missing data, and co-linearities among variables (e.g., correlated viral traits that arose through shared evolutionary history) [

Additionally, a machine learning approach also allows us to model and interpret complex nonlinear relationships between predictor variables and the response, which can be obscured in parametric regression models. Finally, these methods identify viruses that best fit the trait profile of a zoonotic virus with secondary transmission in humans, giving more precise targets (particular viruses, or viral clades) for surveillance and future research.
