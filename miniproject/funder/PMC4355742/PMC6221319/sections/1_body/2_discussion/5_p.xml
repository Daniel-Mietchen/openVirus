<p>Few quantitative studies have investigated the associations between viral traits and human transmissibility. Our findings corroborate the results of one such study (Geoghegan 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) in several important ways: both analyses found that DNA-based genomes were associated with human transmission, while genome segmentation, presence of lipid envelopes, and associations with arthropod vectors predicted dead-end spillover. Beyond these physical attributes, our model ensemble also shows how the human-to-human transmissibility of viral zoonoses is shaped by ecological and evolutionary context, with virus isolation from non-human primates and the human respiratory tract and CNS being positively associated with human transmission (
