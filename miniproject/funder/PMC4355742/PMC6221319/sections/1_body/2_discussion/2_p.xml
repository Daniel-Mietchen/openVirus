<p>In this study, we show that the human-to-human transmissibility of zoonotic viruses can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy by ensembles of machine learning models trained on observed viral features. This data-driven modeling framework could allow public health workers to broadly characterize the epidemic risk posed by novel viral pathogens. Linking these models with those trained to predict the zoonotic capacity of animal viruses [
