<p>These results are subject to two key qualifications. First, by considering viruses at the species level, our approach does not account for variation in human transmissibility within individual species. For example, the H1N1 subtype of Influenza A has caused several human pandemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], whereas the H3N8 subtype within the same species primarily infects dogs and horses, and has never been isolated from humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Second, our approach does not consider the efficiency of observed human transmission per se, and handles viruses with supercritical (R
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1) and subcritical (0 &lt; R
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1) transmission identically. Future research aiming to preempt novel viral spillover events will depend on building mechanistic understanding at these smaller scales.
