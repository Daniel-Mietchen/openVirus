  <title>Variable partial dependence plots, supplementary models with a modified response definition.</title>
  <p>Partial dependence plots show how the model-predicted probability that a virus is able to spread between humans is affected by individual viral traits when the effects all other predictors are controlled for. In these models, we modified our definition of the response variable such that viruses that require an arthropod vector to spread between humans are relabeled as “non-transmissible” The relationships between predictors and the transmission response are not meaningfully changed from those in our primary model, in which the “transmissible” response group includes viruses that exclusively pass between humans indirectly through arthropod vectors (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This indicates that our decision to not differentiate between direct transmission and indirect vector-borne transmission in the response variable did not significantly affect the trait-profile of transmissible virus we present in this study.
