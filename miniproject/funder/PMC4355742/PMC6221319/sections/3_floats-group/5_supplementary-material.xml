  <title>Family characteristics of false-negative virus species.</title>
  <p>Each point represents a virus family that contains one or more species known to infect humans. Points represent the families of viruses included in our dataset (those known to infect humans). Red points are the 5 virus families containing the ten known-transmissible species with the lowest model-predicted transmission probability (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These families contain relatively high numbers of individual virus species known to infect humans, few of which are known to be capable of human-to-human transmission.
