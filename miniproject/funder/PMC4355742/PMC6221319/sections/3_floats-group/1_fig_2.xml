  <title>Predicted viral risk index.</title>
  <p>This figure contrasts the observed transmission ability of all 224 viruses in our dataset (red = human-to-human transmission observed, blue = human-to-human transmission not observed) with their average model-predicted response probabilities, as assigned by the primary boosted regression tree models. This model ensemble accurately discriminates transmissible and non-transmissible viruses, as illustrated by the lack of “overlap” of the two groups in the rank-ordering. The highest ranked viruses that are not currently known to be transmissible between humans were Carnivore amdoparvovirus 1, Hendra virus, Cardiovirus A, Rosavirus A, Human T-lymphotropic viruses 3 &amp; 4 (HTLV-3/4), and Simian Foamy virus. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus was the lowest ranked species for human-to-human transmission has been documented.</p>
