  <title>Relative influence of predictors, averaged across 40 models.</title>
  <p>For each of the 40 boosted regression tree models in our primary ensemble, the normalized relative influence of each predictor variable was computed using Friedman’s algorithm 
   <sup>45</sup>. This figure shows the average of these scores (mean relative influence) for each predictor variable in our dataset that was included in at least one model of the ensemble (mean relative influence &gt; 0). Horizontal lines represent the interval formed by ± 1 standard deviations. Exact relative influence values are listed in
