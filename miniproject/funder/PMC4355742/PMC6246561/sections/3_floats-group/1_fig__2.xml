  <p>Anomalies. The distribution of types of tweet spreading articles from 
   <bold>a</bold> low-credibility and 
   <bold>b</bold> fact-checking sources are quite different. Each article is mapped along three axes representing the percentages of different types of messages that share it: original tweets, retweets, and replies. When user Alice retweets a tweet by user Bob, the tweet is rebroadcast to all of Alice’s followers, whereas when she replies to Bob’s tweet, the reply is only seen by Bob and users who follow them both. Color represents the number of articles in each bin, on a log scale. 
   <bold>c</bold> Correlation between popularity of articles from low-credibility sources and concentration of posting activity. We consider a collection of articles shared by a minimum number of tweets as a popularity group. For articles in each popularity group, a violin plot shows the distribution of Gini coefficients which measure concentration of posts by few accounts (see Supplementary Methods). In violin plots, the width of a contour represents the probability of the corresponding value, and the median is marked by a colored line. 
   <bold>d</bold> Bot score distributions for a random sample of 915 accounts who posted at least one link to a low-credibility source (orange), and for the 961 “super-spreaders” that most actively shared content from low-credibility sources (blue). The two groups have significantly different scores (
