  <p>Bot strategies. 
   <bold>a</bold> Early bot support after a viral low-credibility article is first shared. We consider a sample of 60,000 accounts that participate in the spread of the 1000 most viral stories from low-credibility sources. We align the times when each article first appears. We focus on the 1â€‰h early spreading phase following each of these events, and divide it into logarithmic lag intervals. The plot shows the bot score distribution for accounts sharing the articles during each of these lag intervals. 
   <bold>b</bold> Targeting of influentials. We plot the average number of followers of Twitter users who are mentioned (or replied to) by accounts that link to the most viral 1000 stories. The mentioning accounts are aggregated into three groups by bot score percentile. Error bars indicate standard errors. Inset: Distributions of follower counts for users mentioned by accounts in each percentile group
