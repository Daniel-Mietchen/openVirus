  <p>Dismantling the low-credibility content diffusion network. This analysis is based on a network of retweets linking to low-credibility articles, collected during the 2016 US presidential campaign. The network has 227,363 nodes (accounts); see Methods for further details. The priority of disconnected nodes is determined by ranking accounts on the basis of the different characteristics shown in the legend. The remaining fraction of 
   <bold>a</bold> unique articles from low-credibility sources and 
   <bold>b</bold> retweets linking to those articles is plotted versus the number of disconnected nodes
