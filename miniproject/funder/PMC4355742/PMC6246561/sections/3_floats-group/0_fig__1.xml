  <p>Online virality of content. 
   <bold>a</bold> Probability distribution (density function) of the number of tweets for articles from both low-credibility (blue circles) and fact-checking (orange squares) sources. The distributions of the number of accounts sharing an article are very similar (see Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). As illustrations, the diffusion networks of two stories are shown: 
   <bold>b</bold> a medium-virality misleading article titled “FBI just released the Anthony Weiner warrant, and it proves they stole election”, published a month after the 2016 US election and shared in over 400 tweets; and 
   <bold>c</bold> a highly viral fabricated news report titled “Spirit cooking”: Clinton campaign chairman practices bizarre occult ritual, published 4 days before the 2016 US election and shared in over 30,000 tweets. In both cases, only the largest connected component of the network is shown. Nodes and links represent Twitter accounts and retweets of the article, respectively. Node size indicates account influence, measured by the number of times an account was retweeted. Node color represents bot score, from blue (likely human) to red (likely bot); yellow nodes cannot be evaluated because they have either been suspended or deleted all their tweets. An interactive version of the larger network is available online (

Note that Twitter does not provide data to reconstruct a retweet tree; all retweets point to the original tweet. The retweet networks shown here combine multiple cascades (each a “star network” originating from a different tweet) that all share the same article link
