<p id="Par15">Another way to assess the impact of bots in the spread of low-credibility content is to examine their critical role within the diffusion network. Let us focus on the retweet network
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>, where nodes are accounts and connections represents retweets of messages with links to stories—just like the networks in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>, but aggregating across all articles from low-credibility sources. We apply a network dismantling procedure
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>: we disconnect one node at a time and analyze the resulting decrease in the total volume of retweets and in the total number of unique articles. The more these quantities are reduced by disconnecting a small number of nodes, the more critical those nodes are in the network. We prioritize accounts to disconnect based on bot score and, for comparison, also based on retweeting activity and influence. Further details can be found in the Methods. Unsurprisingly, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows that influential nodes are most critical. The most influential nodes are unlikely to be bots, however. Disconnecting nodes with high bot score is the second-best strategy for reducing low-credibility articles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). For reducing overall post volume, this strategy performs well when about 10% of nodes are disconnected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Disconnecting active nodes is not as efficient a strategy for reducing low-credibility articles. These results show that bots are critical in the diffusion network, and that targeting them would significantly improve the quality of information in the network. The spread of links to low-credibility content can be virtually eliminated by disconnecting a small percentage of accounts that are most likely to be bots.
