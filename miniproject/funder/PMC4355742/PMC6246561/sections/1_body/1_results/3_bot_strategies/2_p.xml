<p id="Par13">We find that another strategy often used by bots is to mention influential users in tweets that link to low-credibility content. Bots seem to employ this targeting strategy repetitively; for example, a single account mentioned @realDonaldTrump in 19 tweets, each linking to the same false claim about millions of votes by illegal immigrants (see details in Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). For a systematic investigation, let us consider all tweets that mention or reply to a user and include a link to a viral article from a low-credibility source in our corpus. The number of followers is often used as a proxy for the influence of a Twitter user. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, in general tweets tend to mention popular people. However, accounts with the largest bot scores tend to mention users with a larger number of followers (median and average). A possible explanation for this strategy is that bots (or rather, their operators) target influential users with content from low-credibility sources, creating the appearance that it is widely shared. The hope is that these targets will then reshare the content to their followers, thus boosting its credibility.
