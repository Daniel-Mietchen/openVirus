<p id="Par9">On average, a low-credibility source published approximately 100 articles per week. By the end of the study period, the mean popularity of those articles was approximately 30 tweets per article per week (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). However, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, success is extremely heterogeneous across articles. Whether we measure success by number of posts containing a link (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) or by number of accounts sharing an article (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), we find a very broad distribution of popularity spanning several orders of magnitude: while the majority of articles goes unnoticed, a significant fraction goes “viral.” We observe that the popularity distribution of low-credibility articles is almost indistinguishable from that of fact-checking articles, meaning that low-credibility content is equally or more likely to spread virally. This result is similar to that of an analysis based on only fact-checked claims, which found false news to be even more viral than real news
