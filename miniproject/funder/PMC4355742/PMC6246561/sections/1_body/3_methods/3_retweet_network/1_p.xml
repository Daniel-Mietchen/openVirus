<p id="Par36">The network studied in the dismantling analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) is based on retweets with links to articles from low-credibility sources, posted before the 2016 US presidential election (16 May–7 November 2016). The network has 227,363 nodes (accounts) and 816,453 directed edges. Each edge is weighted by the number of retweets between the same pair of accounts. When an account is disconnected, all of its incoming and outgoing edges are removed. When we disconnect a retweeting node 
 <italic>i</italic> that was in turn retweeted by some node 
 <italic>j</italic>, only 
 <italic>i</italic> is removed because in the Twitter metadata, each retweet connects directly to the account that originated the tweet. Given the directionality of edges, retweeting activity is measured by node in-strength centrality (weighted in-degree) and influence by out-strength centrality (weighted out-degree).
