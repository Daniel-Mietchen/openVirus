<p>It was recognised that HIV prevention and care programmes with KPs are different in important ways from those designed for the general population; the latter aim to test as many people as possible at least once (‘know your status’), link them to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and support high retention to suppress viral load.

Programmes with KPs, on the other hand, require sustained, high-intensity interventions to address behavioural, biomedical and structural factors, tailored to local context and led by KP communities.
