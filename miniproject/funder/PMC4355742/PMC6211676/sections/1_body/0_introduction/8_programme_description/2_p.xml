<p>PEs are expected to conduct regular outreach with the KPs they are responsible for. While the expectation is for at least monthly contacts, high-risk situations often require more frequent contacts, while high KP mobility may reduce the frequency. During outreach contacts, PEs provide information, build trust in the programme, and supply condoms and lubricants according to need. PEs also promote preventive and curative services and mobilise KPs to visit the programme clinic quarterly for routine checkups (

Support to report and address any incidents of violence is provided as and when needed. To deliver these services effectively, PEs need to be familiar with the “hotspots” where sexual contact is commonly made, and to understand the needs of KPs in those spots. Micro-planning provides PEs with skills to determine how to reach the KPs they are responsible for, assess the needs of the KPs, and address these needs effectively. Simple tools for collecting and using data empower PEs to monitor their work at local hotspot level, find solutions to challenges and contribute to overall programme efficiency [
