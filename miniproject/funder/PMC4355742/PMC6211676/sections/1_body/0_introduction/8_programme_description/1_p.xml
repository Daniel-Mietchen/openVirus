<p>Peer-led outreach, a core component of KP programmes in Kenya, is both a behavioural change intervention, and a means to link KPs to clinical services and structural interventions. PEs work part-time as incentivized volunteers and are expected to conduct regular outreach (providing risk-reduction information, skills, and commodities), through one-to-one contacts with KPs in hotspots where the PE normally operates. Micro-planning provides a structured approach to outreach work and sets operational standards (

If a hotspot or cluster of hotspots has more than 80 FSWs or 40 MSM, the programme is expected to recruit a second PE to maintain KP:PE ratios. The Kenya national guidelines mandates programmes to pay an honorarium of Ksh 3500 (35 USD) per month to every peer educator [
