<p>Kenya was affected early and severely when the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic erupted in eastern Africa in the 1980s. Low condom use in sex work and high rates of ulcerative sexually transmitted infections (STIs) combined to drive extremely rapid HIV transmission rates. [

 <xref rid="pone.0205056.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSWs) surpassed 80% by the late 1980s, and more than 40% of uncircumcised men with genital ulcers seroconverted to HIV after a single sex work exposure. [

 <xref rid="pone.0205056.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] HIV continued to decline nationally as FSW programmes were extended to other towns. However, programme focus then shifted to the general population, in Kenya and the region, in part because research underestimated the contribution of sex work to overall HIV transmission in mature HIV epidemics.
