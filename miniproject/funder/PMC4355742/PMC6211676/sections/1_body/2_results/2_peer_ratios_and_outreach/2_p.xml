<p>The KP:PE ratio reflects an important input that has varied over time and by implementing partner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205056.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Data from a subset of consistently reporting counties (22 for FSW and 18 for MSM, as described in Methods), shows that the KP:PE ratio declined over the years, while average regular outreach contacts increased. In 2013–14, with a high KP:PE ratio of 147:1, regular contacts averaged only 55% of FSWs each quarter. By 2015–16 with a KP:PE ratio of 91:1, 100% of the FSWs against the donor target were receiving regular contacts at least quarterly. Similarly, for MSM, in 2013–15, with a KP:PE ratio of 79:1, only 55% of the MSM population against the donor target were being reached regularly. By 2015–16 when the KP:PE ratio was 58:1, 96% of MSM were receiving regular contacts.
