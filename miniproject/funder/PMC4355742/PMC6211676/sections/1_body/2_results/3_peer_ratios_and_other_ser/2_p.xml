<p>Similarly, we stratified the MSM programmes across consistently reporting counties into clusters with a KP:PE ratio of 60:1 or lower, and of higher than 60:1. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205056.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows that the lower KP:PE cluster reported significantly higher regular contacts with MSM (p&lt;0.001), higher uptake of risk reduction counselling (p&lt;0.001), higher STI screening in clinics (p&lt;0.001), and higher HIV testing (p&lt;0.001). As with the FSW clusters, the findings were less consistent for condom distribution and violence reporting.
