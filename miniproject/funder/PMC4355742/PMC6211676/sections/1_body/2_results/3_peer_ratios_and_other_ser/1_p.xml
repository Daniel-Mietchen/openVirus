<p>We also looked at peer ratios for evidence of an effect on other important KP service outcomes. Using the same sub-sample of consistently reporting counties, we stratified the FSW groups into two clusters, one with an FSW: PE ratio of 90:1 or lower, the other higher than 90:1. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205056.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows that in all three years, the clusters with a KP:PE ratio of 90:1 or lower reported significantly higher regular outreach contacts (p&lt;0.001), higher uptake of risk reduction counselling (p&lt;0.001), higher STI screening in clinics (p&lt;0.001) and higher HIV testing (p&lt;0.001). These findings were somewhat less consistent for condom distribution and violence reporting.
