<p>Available routine monitoring data did not permit extending the above analysis of peer ratios to other areas of service delivery, such as antiretroviral treatment (ART) linkage and retention. However, population-based annual survey data conducted by NASCOP show high linkage to care and ART for KP identified as HIV-positive. [
 <xref rid="pone.0205056.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Performance along the treatment cascade has progressively strengthened. Of those newly testing HIV-positive in 2015â€“16, 80% of female sex workers and 85% of MSM were reported to have started ART. Cross-sectional data from an anonymous polling booth survey in 2017 conducted by NASCOP found 26% of FSWs to be HIV-positive, among whom 79% said they were enrolled in care and 73% on ART. For MSM, 17% were HIV-positive, 69% of whom were enrolled in care and 63% on ART [
 <xref rid="pone.0205056.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since the entry point for the HIV treatment cascade is knowledge of HIV status, the more frequent testing rates in areas with low KP:PE ratios, and more frequent outreach contacts, would be expected to result in higher coverage at subsequent steps of the cascade. Moreover, regular repeat HIV testing and STI screening provide quarterly evidence of programme effectiveness in reducing and maintaining low HIV/STI incidence.
