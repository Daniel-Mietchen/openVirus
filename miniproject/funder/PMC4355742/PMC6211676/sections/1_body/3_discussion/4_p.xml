<p>Micro-planning empowers peer workers to systematically plan, conduct and monitor their work at the local level. [
 <xref rid="pone.0205056.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Methods and tools facilitate targeting, reaching and retaining KPs in prevention, care, and treatment. By building PE skills to plan and monitor, micro-planning also builds accountability and empowers KPs to take decisions. Yet, while micro-planning guidance provides a general framework, there has been limited evidence to inform guidance on operational details. Questions such as ‘how many KPs should a PE be responsible for’ and ‘how often should KPs be contacted through outreach’ are examples. This study addresses this gap by analysing routine data from a national programme implementing standardised micro-planning methods.
