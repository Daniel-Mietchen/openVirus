<p>Several limitations are apparent in this study of routine programme data. Quarterly data did not permit analysis of more frequent activities such as monthly outreach contacts. Limited data also impede further analysis of the weaker correlations seen between KP:PE ratios, and condom distribution and violence reporting. Our analysis of available aggregate programme data was limited to trend and stratified analyses. Additional regression analyses to identify other factors that may have influenced the outcomes, as well as cost-benefit analysis, would have been useful. However, limited number of cases, and unavailability of information on costs impeded these analyses. Despite these limitations, the effect of lower KP:PE ratios on outreach and clinical service utilisation is strong and highly significant, with important programmatic implications.</p>
