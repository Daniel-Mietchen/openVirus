<p>The Kenya KP programme has adopted a combination prevention approach, requiring implementing partners and donors to offer a standardised set of behavioural, biomedical and structural interventions. Emphasis is placed on prevention skills, use of clinical services, and preventing violence. Performance targets are set by the national programme and donors, for a range of priority programme indicators of coverage, process, and outcomes. Micro-planning is used as a standard approach to strengthen outreach for all implementing partners. A Technical Support Unit provides training and mentoring support to all the implementing partners to ensure that the programme is of high quality and adheres to the national guidelines. After three years of systematic implementation, national-level programme data show, in addition to high levels of scale and coverage, significant increases in regular outreach to both FSWs and MSM. These more regular contacts in turn have resulted in more frequent use of clinic services, including HIV counselling, STI check-ups, and HIV testing.</p>
