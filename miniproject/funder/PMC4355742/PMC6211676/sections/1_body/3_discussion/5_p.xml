<p>In Kenya, despite overall progress in scaling up the KP programme, important differences were apparent across different settings. Since the logic of micro-planning is that stronger relationships between peer educators and KPs–more frequent contacts, closer relationships, more time to promote prevention and clinic check-ups–result in better outcomes, we looked for evidence of this in the data. The results were striking, with large and significant differences seen for programmes where KP:PE ratios were less than 90 (for FSWs) and 60 (for MSM). For both FSWs and MSM, KP:PE ratios below the observed thresholds not only were associated with significantly improved outcomes such as outreach contacts, for which PEs are directly implicated, but also regular clinic attendance for a range of complementary prevention, screening, and treatment services.</p>
