<p>Bivariate analysis in the form of percentages and means was used. All the percentages and means were calculated for each quarter and then averaged to arrive at an estimate for the year. Along with the mean KP:PE ratio, the inter-quartile range (IQR: 25th and 75th percentiles) was calculated. We also grouped the counties into two clusters, above or below/equal to the average KP:PE ratio, and compared primary and secondary outcomes for those clusters. A two-sample proportion test using Z-statistics was performed to detect the statistical significance of the difference in service uptake between the two clusters. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA software (version 14.0).</p>
