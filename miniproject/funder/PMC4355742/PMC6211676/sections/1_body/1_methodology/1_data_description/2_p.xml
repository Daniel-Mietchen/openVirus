<p>We performed data cleaning and smoothing prior to data analysis. In the course of programme scale-up from 2013â€“16, new counties and implementing partners were added and dropped due to reorganisation and reprioritisation of donor funding. In some counties, new implementing partners were added/replaced, or targets of existing partners were revised, resulting in inconsistent data. To overcome these inconsistencies, data smoothing was done by excluding data from counties lacking reliable data for all three years (12 quarters). We used mapping data from 2012 for estimates of FSWs and MSM in the counties [

 <xref rid="pone.0205056.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises the data used for the KP:PE ratio sub-analysis. Data from 22 FSW counties and 18 MSM counties with consistent data represent about 90% of the total estimated KPs in the country.
