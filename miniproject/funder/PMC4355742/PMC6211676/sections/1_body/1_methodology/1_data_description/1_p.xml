<p>We used routine programme monitoring data for the period October 2013 to September 2016 to describe the scale-up of KP programmes in Kenya. We then used a subset of these data, as detailed below, to assess changes in the key population to peer educator (KP:PE) ratio and its relationship with key outcomes related to use of HIV/STI programmes and services. Each implementing partner monitors the uptake and utilisation of clinical and non-clinical services. These individual-level data on outreach, service uptake, and violence reporting are aggregated at implementing partner and county-level and reported to NASCOP on a quarterly basis in a standard format. These data are collected using paper-based registers/formats and are updated continuously by data entry operators hired by implementing partners. Monitoring and evaluation officers from the NASCOP Technical Support Unit provide support and conduct quality checks. Aggregate data submitted quarterly by implementing partners to NASCOP were used for the present analysis.</p>
