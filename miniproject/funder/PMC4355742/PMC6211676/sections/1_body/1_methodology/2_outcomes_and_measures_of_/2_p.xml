<p>The variable for ‘regular outreach contact’ comes from quarterly data and indicates the number of individual KPs contacted (at least once) during each quarter. Although monthly PE contacts are recommended by the Kenya KP programme, individual-level data on monthly contacts were not available for analysis. The condom distribution indicator was calculated using the total number of condoms distributed during the quarter (through direct distribution by the peer educators and indirect through venues and condom depots that the peer educators fill regularly) divided by the number of KPs contacted during the same quarter.</p>
