<p>The symptoms of MAYV infection include rash, fever, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, headache, diarrhea, and arthralgia, which may persist for months or even years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and are similar to those caused by others arboviruses such DENV or chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Due to the absence of routine differential diagnostics, reported cases of MAYV likely underestimate the real prevalence, and the circulation of the virus can pass undetected in areas with ongoing DENV or CHIKV outbreaks [
