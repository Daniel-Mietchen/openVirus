<p>Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> (family Togaviridae) which was first isolated from the blood of five febrile workers in Mayaro County, Trinidad, in 1954 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Genotype D (dispersed) includes strains isolated in several South American countries, whereas genotype L (limited) includes strains isolated only in Brazil. In 2010, a minor genotype called N (new), was isolated in Peru, but it is limited to one known sequence. Since its first isolation, MAYV has caused sporadic outbreaks and small epidemics in several countries in South and Central America (reviewed in [
