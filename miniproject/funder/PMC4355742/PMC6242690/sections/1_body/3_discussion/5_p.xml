<p>We found that

 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> can be infected with MAYV strain BeAr 505411, but is not able to transmit the virus. Conversely, another study found MAYV-positive 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> during an outbreak of DENV in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and suggested that this species could sustain the transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The MIRs obtained for the pools of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> collected in two of four study areas seems to indicate a quite low prevalence of infected mosquitoes (MIRs = 1.39 and 16). These results highlight the important point that merely detecting virus in a mosquito does not necessarily implicate it as a vector.
