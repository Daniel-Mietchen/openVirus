<p>The global expansion of CHIKV demonstrates how rapid virus adaptation may alter the transmission potential of alternate arthropod vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The adaptation of MAYV to 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> has been analyzed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and the emergence of hybrid genotypes D and L suggests that 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes can play an important role in the urban diffusion of MAYV. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> are well adapted to urban and peri-urban habitats, and, contrary to 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes, consistently have anthropophilic feeding behavior. Our results confirm that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is a possible (if potentially inefficient) vector for MAYV, but more studies are needed to understand the differences in the VC for the genotype D and genotype L strains.
