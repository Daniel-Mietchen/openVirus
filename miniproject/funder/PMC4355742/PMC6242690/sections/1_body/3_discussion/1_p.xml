 <italic>stephensi</italic>, the strain BeAn 343102 had a statistically higher titer in body and leg samples than BeAr 505411. Conversely, strain BeAn 343102 has a statistically lower body titer in

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and was not detected in legs, likely indicating the presence of a midgut escape barrier. Strain BeAn 343102 failed to infect 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic>, likely due to the presence of a midgut infection barrier. The VC differences between the strains may be explained by the theory of the host genotype and pathogen genotype (G × G) interaction [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. G × G interactions have been found in many systems, including DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, Lambrechts et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that DENV vector competence varied greatly depending on the specific 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population and DENV genotype combination. This provides evidence that G × G interactions may be responsible for the adaptation of a lineage/strain to a specific population.
