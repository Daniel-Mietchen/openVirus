<p>With the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> strain tested here, we obtained similar IR and DIR results compared to those previously described with a different strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the MAYV TR in this study is considerably lower than that described by Long et al. using a field population from Peru [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (6.7% vs. 88%) or Wiggins et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with a field population from Florida (6.7% vs. ~25%). This discrepancy could be due to the genetic differences in the mosquito population (salivary gland infection barrier in the strain tested) or in the viral strain used for the experiment. Is important to highlight that results presented by Wiggins et al. are obtained by RT-PCR, which allows identification of viral RNA but does not ensure the presence of infectious viral particles in the saliva producing in some cases an overestimation of the TR.
