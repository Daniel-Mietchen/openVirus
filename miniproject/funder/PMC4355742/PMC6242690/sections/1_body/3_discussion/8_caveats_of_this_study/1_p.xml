<p>It should be noted that all results were conducted with laboratory mosquito strains. Results with other laboratory strains or wild mosquitoes that differ in their nuclear genotype or microbiome may differ from those we obtained. All mosquitoes in our experiments were infected with approximately 7 logs of virus; for mosquitoes that did not readily become infected it is possible that higher viral titers might result in higher infection rates. In our experiments we only tested two timepoints post-infection (seven and fourteen days). It is possible that longer incubation times may result in different infection and/or transmission rates.</p>
