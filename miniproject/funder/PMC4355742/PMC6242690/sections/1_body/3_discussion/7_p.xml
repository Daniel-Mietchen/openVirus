<p>We tested 4 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species (2 from North America, one from Africa, and one from Southeast Asia) for MAYV VC, and all were able to transmit the virus. Our results illustrate the knowledge gaps that remain about this important emerging virus. 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in general are currently neglected as potential vectors of arboviral pathogens, however they are widely dispersed worldwide (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Our data suggest that 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. may be important vectors driving the emergence and invasion of MAYV (and potentially other arboviruses) across geographically diverse regions of the globe, and their epidemiological role in virus invasions should be further studied.
