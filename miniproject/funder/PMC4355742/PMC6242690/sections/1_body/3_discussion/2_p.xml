 <italic>stephensi</italic> were able to transmit the virus at 7 dpi but we did not detect transmission at 14 dpi. The short extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of MAYV for these species might represent a notable increase in their vectorial capacity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and must be considered when establishing a future surveillance plan. In 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic>, the absence of transmission at 14 dpi corresponds with a decrease of the viral titer in the legs between 7 dpi and 14 dpi. These data suggest that in 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic>, MAYV infection may not persist, and may be progressively eliminated or limited by the vector. Similar results were recently published for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> infected with DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], where a progressive decrease in transmission began at 14 dpi and continued until 25 dpi, at which point no viral transmission was recorded. To test this hypothesis and to better understand the kinetics of MAYV infection, a study with a longer EIP and more intermediate timepoints should be performed. 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> also is a competent laboratory vector for MAYV but the longer EIP (14 dpi) required for the transmission of the virus might limit the role of this species in the transmission cycle.
