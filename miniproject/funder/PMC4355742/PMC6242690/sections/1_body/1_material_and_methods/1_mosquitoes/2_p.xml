<p>Mosquito colonies were reared and maintained at the Millennium Sciences Complex insectary (The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA) at 27°C ± 1°C, 12:12 h light:dark diurnal cycle at 80% relative humidity in 30×30×30-cm cages. Ground fish flakes (TetraMin, Melle, Germany) were used to feed 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> sp. larvae. A 1:1:1 mixture of bovine liver powder (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA), koi pellets (TetraPond Koi Vibrance; TetraPond, Prestons, Australia), and rabbit pellets (Kaytee, Chilton, WI, USA) was used for 
 <italic>Culex</italic> sp. larvae. Adult mosquitoes were provided with 10% sucrose solution
