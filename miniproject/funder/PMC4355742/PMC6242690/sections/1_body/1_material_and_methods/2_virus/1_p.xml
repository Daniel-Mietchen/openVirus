<p>Two strains of MAYV were used for the experimental infections: BeAr 505411 (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA), a genotype L strain isolated from 
 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> mosquitoes in Para, Brazil, in March 1991, and BeAn 343102 (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA), a genotype D strain originally isolated from a monkey in Para, Brazil, in May 1978. Both viruses were passed once in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. Virus-infected supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70°C until used for mosquito infections. Viral stock titers were obtained by the focus forming unit (FFU) technique, as described below.
