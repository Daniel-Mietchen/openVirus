<p>Five- to seven-day-old females that had not previously blood-fed were used for experiments. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed on human blood spiked with virus via a glass feeder jacketed with 37Â°C distilled water for 1 h. Aliquots of the infectious bloodmeals were collected and titers of MAYV were determined by FFU (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After blood feeding, mosquitoes were anesthetized and fully engorged females were selected and placed in cardboard cages. Infection rate (IR), dissemination rate (DIR), transmission rate (TR), and transmission efficiency (TE) were assessed at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi). IR was measured as the rate of mosquitoes with infected bodies among the total number of analyzed mosquitoes. DIR was measured as the rate of mosquitoes with infected legs among the mosquitoes with positive bodies. TR was measured as the rate of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among the mosquitoes with positives legs, and TE measured as the rate of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among the total number of analyzed mosquitoes [
