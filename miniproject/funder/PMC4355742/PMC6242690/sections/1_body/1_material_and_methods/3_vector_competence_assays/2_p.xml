<p>At 7 and 14 dpi, mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Legs were detached from each body and placed in 2-mL tubes filled with 1 mL of mosquito diluent (20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [FBS] in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 50 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μg/mL gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/mL fungizone) and a single zinc-plated, steel, 4.5-mm bead (Daisy, Rogers, AR, USA), and tubes immediately placed on ice. Saliva was collected by forced salivation into a capillary tube as previously described [

Body and leg samples were homogenized at 30 Hz for 2 min using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and centrifuged for 30 sec at 11,000 rpm. All samples were stored at −70°C until tested.
