 <p>Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a mosquito-borne Alphavirus responsible for outbreaks in South America and the Caribbean. In this study we infected different species of mosquito (belonging to the genera 
  <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
  <italic>Anopheles</italic> and 
  <italic>Culex</italic>) with MAYV and tested their capacity to transmit the virus at different time points. Results show that 
  <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes were competent vectors for 2 genotypes of MAYV, while 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
  <italic>Culex</italic> were poor vectors. The capacity of 
  <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes to transmit MAYV highlights their importance as neglected vectors of arboviruses. These data suggest that 
  <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes have the potential to sustain transmission cycles of neglected pathogens in na√Øve regions, including the United States.
