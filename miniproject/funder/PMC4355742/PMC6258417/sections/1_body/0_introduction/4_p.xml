<p>Evidence of RVFV circulating in Tanzania during an IE period has been shown previously in the Kilombero river valley, where various livestock species had RVFV antibodies (cattle 11.03%; sheep 11.86% and goats 11.37%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], although Kilombero river valley was among the sites that experienced the 2006/07 RVF outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additional surveys in areas without previous history of RVF outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or clinical cases in humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] show related prevalence rates in livestock and humans respectively. In addition, the role of mammals as maintenance hosts for RVFV remains largely unknown [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the detection of antibodies in areas where no clinical disease has been reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] raises the question of whether the disease is overlooked due to lack-of effective surveillance systems, or whether there are strains of RVFV with low pathogenicity. This study aimed at determining the involvement of non-vaccinated cattle in the IE maintenance and transmission of RVFV in areas with no history of RVF outbreaks in Tanzania.
