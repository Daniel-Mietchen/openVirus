<p>In RVFV enzootic/endemic regions, outbreaks occur with 3 to 17 year intervals [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The RVFV maintenance between the long IE periods is not fully understood. Although it has been widely hypothesized that the virus is maintained via transovarially infected
