<p>To specifically detect RVFV IgM antibodies, the RVFV antibody positive samples analysed by the cELISA method were subjected to an IgM capture ELISA. Of the 104 analyzed samples, 30 (29%) were positive for RVFV IgM antibodies. In total 8.4% (30/356) of all cattle sampled in the two districts had RVFV IgM antibodies. When segregated by districts, the IgM antibody seroprevalence was 2.0% (3/147) and 12.9% (27/209) in Kyela and Morogoro districts respectively. In the Morogoro district, the RVFV IgM seroprevalence was 11.7% (12/103), 1.5% (1/68) and 36.8% (14/38) for Magadu, Mazimbu and Mikese wards respectively while in Kyela district, the IgM seroprevalence was 2.9% (2/70), 0% (0/37) and 2.5% (1/40) in Bujonde, Kajunjumele and Katumba Songwe wards respectively (
