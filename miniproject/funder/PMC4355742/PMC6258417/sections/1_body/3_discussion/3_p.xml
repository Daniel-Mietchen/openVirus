<p>To summarize, we detected RVFV IgM antibodies in all study wards except Kajunjumele, with Morogoro district having a relatively high IgM seroprevalence compared to Kyela. These findings indicated the presence of active RVFV infection at the time of sampling, during the dry season, at least in the wards examined. Despite the small number of wards and animals tested for IgM, these findings clearly demonstrated the circulation of RVFV during IE periods in non-outbreak areas. It is not clear why the circulating RVFV in these areas did not lead into clinical disease, and the possible mechanisms for the virus maintenance remain to be elucidated. However, possible explanations could be circulation of non-virulent strains of RVFV in these areas or misdiagnosis excluding RVF for other febrile conditions with similar clinical features of fever and abortions. A limitation of the present study was that we unfortunately did not attempt to isolate RVFV from the IgM-positive animals, due to biosafety issues. RVFV is classified as a biosafety level-3 agent and demands biosecurity measures not available during the study. Furthermore, we did not perform any RT-PCR analysis to detect virus RNA.</p>
