<p>The observed RVFV transmission hotspots during the sampling period in Magadu and Mikese point to locally existing factors playing a major role in RVFV maintenance and transmission dynamics. Although, entomological surveys were not conducted, the existence of suitable mosquito breeding habitats was evident. The presence of water in farms throughout the year provides suitable habitats for the breeding of RVFV mosquito vectors. Persistent water in aquaculture ponds and waste lagoons close to animal bans and grazing fields at Magadu farm may serve as important breeding habitats for the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species. The presence of old machinery like tractors, discarded combined harvesters, old automobile tires and water storage containers may serve as water holding places thus providing harbour and breeding habitats for mosquitoes and continuous low-level transmission of RVFV to vertebrate hosts.
