<p>The relatively high RVFV general seroprevalence recorded among cattle in Kyela (32%) and Morogoro (27%) districts could in some part be attributed to the physical characteristics of the respective district. The study site in Kyela is a low-lying area, close to Lake Nyasa, with many swamps and rivers and is subjected to regular flooding during the rainy seasons [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ecology of low altitude and proximity to perennial water bodies were found to be associated with RVFV seropositivity in ruminant herds in Senegal and Madagascar, as well as in humans in Gabon and Tanzania [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Such an ecology provides good breeding habitats for mosquito vectors involved in the transmission of the RVFV. Furthermore, a large part of the study site in Kyela is used for wetland paddy cultivation with frequent water logging, suitable for mosquito breeding. In the Kyela district, cattle are usually grazed by tethering in open grassland, communal grazing land, near the wetlands and paddy farms, thus increasing the risk of acquiring RVFV from mosquitoes. On the other hand, the Kyela district is characterized by the abundance of banana and cocoa plantations. One study in Ngorongoro district, Tanzania, trapped more

 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, the banana and cocoa plantations in Kyela could form additional breeding habitats for mosquitoes that may transmit the virus to the animals and thus the observed high seroprevalence in this area.
