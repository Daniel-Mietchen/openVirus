<p>The results reported in this study indicated that domestic cattle from the two studied districts have been exposed to RVFV infection during the IE period and could function as virus amplifiers, although the two study districts have no previous history of RVF outbreaks. The cELISA method detected both IgG and IgM RVFV specific antibodies. The RVFV IgG antibodies are believed to persist in animals for life following infection, and therefore its detection provides a reliable index of previous exposure to RVFV (5, 6), but does not indicate when the animals were infected. The detection of RVFV IgM antibodies indicated that the virus was actively circulating sub-clinically in the both the Kyela and Morogoro districts during the time of sampling, although mainly in the Morogoro district. This is supported by the fact that IgM antibodies persist for only 6 to 8 weeks after initial infection [

In the Morogoro district, the Mikese ward had the highest RVFV IgM seroprevalence followed by Magadu and Mazimbu, indicating that RVFV infections have recently occurred in the region and especially in the Mikese ward with 14 RVFV IgM positive cattle out of 38 analyzed. Other studies have also detected RVFV activity in cattle and humans in areas where the disease has never been reported before [
