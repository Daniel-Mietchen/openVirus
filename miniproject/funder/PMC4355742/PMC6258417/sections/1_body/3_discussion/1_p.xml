<p>We found IgG and/or IgM antibodies to RVFV in 29.2% of cattle sampled during 2014–2015 in Tanzania, from two districts with no RVF outbreaks. All samples were collected during an inter-epizootic/inter-epidemic (IE) period from animals born after the large RVF outbreak in East Africa 2006/2007. The finding of both IgG and IgM positive cattle suggests both long-term persistence of RVFV antibodies and a low level of recent circulation of RVFV. In previous studies from Kilombero, Tanzania and Ijara Kenya the seroprevalence in livestock born after the 2006/2007 outbreak was only 5.5% and 13.1% respectively, while in a study in Tanzania from 2013 in the Kajunjumele ward in the Kyela region, 25.8% had RVFV IgG antibodies [

Interestingly, we detected a RVFV seroprevalence of 40.5% (15/37) in the Kajunjumele ward from samples collected 2014–2015, but none of the fifteen seropositive animals were RVFV IgM positive. This suggested that new infections have occurred in the Kajunjumele ward between the previous study, ending August 2013, and our study, starting June 2014. This should then have occurred at least 6–8 weeks before our sampling, since IgM antibodies only persist for that time (25), but no reported animal or human cases were reported from that region during the period. On the other hand, cattle samples collected from Tanzania during the 2006/2007 outbreak had a seroprevalence of 38.7% [
