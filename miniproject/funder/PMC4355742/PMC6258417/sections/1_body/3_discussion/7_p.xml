<p>Older cattle (&gt;2 years old) were found to be at a higher risk of having RVFV antibodies than younger cattle (OR = 0.19, 95% CI (0.1–0.35)). These findings agree with reports from studies which found higher seroprevalence in older animals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The exotic breeds and their crosses are more susceptible to RVFV infection than local breed which are resistant and well adapted to the environment (12,13). However, in this study indigenous zebu breed appeared more likely to be RVFV seropositive than crosses (OR = 2.5, 95% CI (1.57–4.05). Sampled crossbred animals were from dairy farms with frequent use of acaricides to control tick infestation. The acaricides use could possibly prevent cattle from mosquito bites as well (Mnyone, 2018, personal communication) thus reducing the RVFV transmission in these animals. No significant difference between sex or the type of holding was observed.
