<p>The results demonstrated widespread prevalence of RVFV antibody among cattle during an inter-epizootic period in regions without previously reported RVF outbreaks. Therefore, it is important for animal health officers in these areas to be aware of the current RVFV circulation so that preventive measures such as vaccination could be implemented. It would be interesting to perform further studies in other similar areas with no history of RVF outbreaks, since it is likely that undetected low-level RVFV is occurring in many places. This would help to identify and target RVF hot spots by control measures, aiming for prevention of RVFV transmission to animals and humans.</p>
