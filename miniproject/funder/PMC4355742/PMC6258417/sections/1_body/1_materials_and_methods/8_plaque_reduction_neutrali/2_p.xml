<p>Each PRNT assay included the test sera, and a known RVFV antibody positive serum sample and a RVFV antibody negative serum sample from cattle. Each serum sample was diluted in Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with one % each of HEPES, penicillin and streptomycin and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). The dilutions sera samples were made in 96 well plates beginning with a 1:5 dilution in the first wells followed by 4-fold serial dilutions of 1:20, 1:80, 1:320, 1:1280, and 1:5120 in each of subsequent wells. Each diluted serum sample was then mixed with an equal volume of 60–80 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MP-12 vaccine virus. The quantification of PFU was confirmed by a plaque assay based on testing a mixture of equal volumes of the 60–80 PFU and HBSS to confirm that the final virus dose ranged from 30–40 PFUs. The antibody positive control consisted of a mixture of equal volume of 60–80 PFU and a 1:10 dilution of antibody positive cattle serum. The antibody negative control consisted of a mixture of equal volume of 60–80 PFU and a 1:10 dilution of RVFV antibody negative cattle serum. The virus/serum dilution mixtures were incubated at 37°C in the absence of CO
 <sub>2</sub> for one hour. Next, 50 μl of the virus/serum dilution mixtures were inoculated onto each of two Vero E6 cell monolayer cultures propagated in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated for one hour at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Virus mixed with the antibody-positive control serum, was inoculated onto twenty separate Vero E6 cultures. Virus mixed with antibody-negative control serum mixture was inoculated onto four Vero E6 cultures. After incubation for one hour at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2,</sub> each cell culture was overlaid with 0.5 ml of a Seakem agarose (1%) with an equal volume of 2X Eagle’s Basal Medium with Earle’s salts (EBME) supplemented with 8% FBS and one % penicillin/streptomycin, and Glutamine+8g/l HEPES. After two more days of incubation at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, each culture was overlaid with 0.5 ml of a mixture of an equal volume of agarose (1%) and 2X EBME supplemented with 5% neutral red, 8% FBS, and penicillin and streptomycin (1%) and Glutamine + 8g/l HEPES and incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The PFUs were counted and recorded for both the controls and cattle serum samples. An 80% reduction in the number of PFUs was used as the endpoint for antibody virus-neutralization titers (PRNT80). Wells with too high number of PFUs, that were impossible to count at that dilution, were recorded as TNTC (too numerous to count).
