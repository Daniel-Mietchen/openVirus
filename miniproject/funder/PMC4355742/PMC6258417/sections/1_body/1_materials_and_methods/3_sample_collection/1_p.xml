<p>The local breed of zebu cattle (
 <italic>Bos indicus</italic>) and the crosses with exotic breed (
 <italic>Bos taurus</italic>) were sampled by collecting 5 ml of blood from the jugular vein into plain vacuitaner tubes. The criteria for selection of animals included a history of non-vaccinated status against RVFV, animals born after the 2006/2007 outbreak, calves above 6 months of age, and owners consent to using the animals for study. Herd and individual animal epidemiological data were obtained from the household head and herders as well as through clinical examination. The data collected included the breed, sex and age and feeding practices. In addition, a history of animal movements into the herd and whether the animals were born within the herd or introduced (moved) into the herd from another district was recorded. Sampling was based on only those herds with restricted animals without history of movements to high RVF risk areas.
