<p>Individual animal age was estimated from epidemiological data collected from household heads and herders, and where possible, by review of available records on date of birth and dentition. Records were available from farms keeping crossbred dairy cattle. Dentition was used in determining the age of cattle divided into young or adult, depending on the eruption of the permanent incisors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. All cattle that had at least a permanent middle incisor were categorised as adult, while those without were categorised as young. Normally, the permanent incisors in cattle erupt at about 18 months of age and by 24 months they are fully developed. To exclude sampling young animals less than six months old, age was estimated by asking the head of the household, herd boys and other members of the household for the month, season and year of birth. Also, we performed physical observation of animal size and asked if they still were suckling. To avoid sampling animals present during the 2006/2007 RVF outbreak, animals that had initial wear on their incisor teeth (5 to 6 years old) and those which had noticeable wear (7 to 8 years old) were excluded from the study.
