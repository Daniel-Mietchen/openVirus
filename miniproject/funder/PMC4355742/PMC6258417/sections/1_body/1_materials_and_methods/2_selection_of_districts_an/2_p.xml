<p>Based on the above, the Kyela and Morogoro districts with no previous history of RVF outbreaks were selected. In both districts, all veterinary officers were consulted to identify wards within each district considered to be at highest risk of RVF occurrence. Criteria used included areas subject to regular flooding, ecological features suitable for mosquito breeding, relatively high concentration of domestic ruminants, proximity to rivers, ponds and lakes. The wards within the districts that were identified with most of these epidemiological characteristics were selected for the study.</p>
