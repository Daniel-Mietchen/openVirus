<p>The IgM ELISA test was employed for cELISA positive samples only. These samples were analysed with the commercial ID Screen RVF IgM Capture kit (IDvet, MOntpelier, France) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 40 μl of the diluent buffer was dispensed into each well of a labelled microwell plate pre-coated with anti-bovine-ovine-caprine IgM polyclonal antibodies. Then, 10 μl of the internal positive control (freeze-dried anti-RVFV recombinant NP bovine serum supplied by the manufacturer) and the internal negative control (supplied by the manufacturer) were added in duplicates. To the remaining wells, serum samples were added in duplicate and the plate with all samples was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The microplate wells were then washed three times with 300 μl by a microplate washer as above. Next, 50 μl of RVFV nucleoprotein or diluent buffer was added and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The wells were washed three times followed by addition of 50 μl of anti-RVFV nucleoprotein horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate solution to each well and incubation for 1 hour at 37°C. Again, the wells were washed three times as above and 100 μl of the substrate solution, TMB, was added to each well and then incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Then, 100 μl of stop solution was added to terminate the reaction.</p>
