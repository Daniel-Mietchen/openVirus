<p>The data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and imported into STATA version 12 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) for cleaning and statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics was carried out followed by univariable analysis to assess initial association between potential risk factors and the outcome variable defined by RVFV seropositivity. The mixed effects logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the association between various potential risk factors and the outcome variable defined by RVFV seropositivity. The models included districts, age, breed, sex and the type of holding. The analysis was conducted in two steps. The statistically significant variables were included in a mixed effects multivariable logistic regression analysis based on a forward variable selection approach, utilising the likelihood ratio statistic and a

Because of the differences in the sample sizes and agro-ecological features between Kyela and Morogoro districts, RVFV seropositivity was compared among the wards within the respective district. The Chi-square test was used to compare the RVFV seropositivity among the wards, by using the Rstudio statistical software at
