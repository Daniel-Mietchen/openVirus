<p>Kyela is one of the districts in Mbeya region, located in south-western part of the country. Most of the Kyela district is lowland situated in the Great Rift Valley at 505m above sea level, in the flood plains of Lake Nyasa. It receives heavy rains, of about 2000-3000mm per annum and floods are common in March through May. The district has a warm and humid climate, with a mean daily temperature of 23°C. Together with Lake Nyasa, the district also has four large rivers, (Songwe, Mbaka, Lufilyo, and Kiwira), and many streams (Mkalizi, Kampala, Mgaya, Chiji, Kandete, Masukila, Njisi, and Kubanga). Agriculture dominates livelihoods and economic activities of the Kyela district. In addition to rain fed paddy farming, other crops include banana and cocoa cultivation. Other livelihood activities include livestock farming and fishing. Because of the water logging condition, few sheep and goats are kept in the district. Few (1–5) cattle are kept per household by tethering in communal grazing areas during the day and on the doorsteps of their houses at night for fear of theft, providing an animal reservoir of RVFV in proximity of humans.</p>
