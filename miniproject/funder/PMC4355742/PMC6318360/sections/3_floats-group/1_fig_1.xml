 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic tree based on complete genome sequences of representative proposed HEV reference strains. Each branch is labeled with the subtype designation, the strain name, and the GenBank accession number. The Nigerian NG/17-0503 strain in this study is marked with a solid circle. A maximum likelihood method based on the general time-reversible model with gamma distributed with invariant sites was inferred. The values at nodes indicate the bootstrap values (using 1,000 replications).</p>
