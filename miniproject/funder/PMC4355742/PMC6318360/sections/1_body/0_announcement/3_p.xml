<p>The complete genome of NG/17-0503 is 7,284 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail, with a G+C content of 57.6%. The genome contains three ORFs (ORF1, 1,693 amino acids; ORF2, 660 amino acids; ORF3, 123 amino acids) encoding the HEV viral proteins. NG/17-0503 shared the highest identity of 94.2% with the T3 strain from Chad, followed by 88.7% with an HEV-1d Moroccan strain (GenBank accession no.
