<p>Viral RNA was extracted from serum using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit with the QIAcube BioRobot workstation (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by cDNA synthesis using SuperScript first-strand synthesis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the HEV open reading frames (ORF) 2 and 3 showed viremic HEV infection, with a viral load of 2.22 × 10E+6 IU/ml. Sequence analysis of partial ORF1 (307 bp) and ORF2 (401 bp) implemented using the BLASTn search engine (

Real-time RT-PCR and consensus nested RT-PCR were conducted as previously described (

All HEV amplicons were sequenced using Sanger sequencing with a BigDye Terminator 3.1 kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) in sense and antisense directions. The whole-genome sequence was assembled and analyzed using Geneious software 10.0.5 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) (
