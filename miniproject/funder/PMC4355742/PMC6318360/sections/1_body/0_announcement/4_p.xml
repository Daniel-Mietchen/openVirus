<p>In conclusion, we identified and characterized the full-length genome of an HEV-1e strain circulating during an outbreak in Nigeria in 2017. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that NG/17-0503 is the second full-length HEV-1e genome available to date. Since the Chad HEV-1e strain from 1983 was from a neighboring country of Nigeria, the detection of NG/17-0503 is strongly suggestive of local transmission of this endemic virus over decades.</p>
