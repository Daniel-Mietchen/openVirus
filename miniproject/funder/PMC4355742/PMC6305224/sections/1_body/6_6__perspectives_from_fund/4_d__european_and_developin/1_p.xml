<p>The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) funds clinical research to accelerate the development of new or improved drugs, vaccines, microbicides and diagnostics against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria as well as other poverty-related infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. An important EDCTP goal is to help foster collaborative interactions within the TB vaccine development field. An example of this is the collaboration between TuBerculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI), Aeras, the European Commission (EC), BMGF and EDCTP in developing stage gate criteria, designed to promote an efficient and coordinated approach to managing the TB vaccine portfolio by selecting the best TB vaccine candidates and advancing them through development in an optimized and non-redundant fashion.</p>
