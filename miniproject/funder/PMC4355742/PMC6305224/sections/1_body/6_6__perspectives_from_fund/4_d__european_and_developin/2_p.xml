<p>The EDCTP believes that it is imperative to continue conducting clinical trials of TB vaccine concepts and candidates. To further this effort, the EDCTP is contributing to the support of three clinical trials of TB vaccines in the upcoming years. These include 1) a pivotal, phase 3 study of VPM 1002 in African infants (conducted by Vakzine Project Management, Hannover, Germany and the Serum Institute of India, Pune, India); 2) a phase 2a dose-defining safety and immunogenicity study of MTBVAC in South African infants (sponsored by Biofabri, S.L.); and 3) a phase 2b PoR trial of H56/AS01E in adolescents and adults in South Africa and Tanzania (sponsored by the Statens Serum Institute and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative [IAVI]). Additionally, the EDCTP will help support development of a human challenge model for TB, given the potential utility of such a model in driving the TB vaccine development effort forward.</p>
