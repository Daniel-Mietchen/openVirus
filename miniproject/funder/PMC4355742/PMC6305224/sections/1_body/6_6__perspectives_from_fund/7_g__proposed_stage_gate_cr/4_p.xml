<p>Four different indications for TB vaccines will be addressed under the stage-gate criteria: 1) prevention of TB disease in pediatric, adolescent and adult/elderly populations; 2) BCG replacement in infants; 3) prevention of TB disease recurrence; and 4) immunotherapy of active TB disease. Stage gating criteria for these indications may differ in pre-clinical immunogenicity, efficacy and safety requirements; in clinical development strategy, including safety, immunogenicity and efficacy targets, and target populations; and in regulatory and marketing targets. Commonalities between indications will be found in process and manufacturing criteria, and well as in the overall precut characteristics. These differences and commonalities ultimately will be reflected in the stage gating criteria. Efforts towards the finalization of the stage gating document are underway.</p>
