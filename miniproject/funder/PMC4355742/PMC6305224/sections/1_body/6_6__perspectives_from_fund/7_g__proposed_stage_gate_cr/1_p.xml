<p>Projects stages, stage gates, and stage-gate criteria are a suite of tools that allow effective management of large R&amp;D programs by sponsors and funders. An R&amp;D program can be divided into segments referred to as stages, wherein multiple mostly related activities are conducted in parallel. Stage gates are defined as check points that separate the stages and the stage-gate criteria constitute a set of objective, pre-defined data targets upon which continuation of the project into the next stage is decided. A stage-gating tool has been in use by TBVI and AERAS since 2010
