<p>The Global TB Vaccine Partnership (GTBVP) is a five-year-old initiative which is comprised of the leading organizations conducting and supporting TB vaccine research and development. The goals of the GTBVP are to enhance communication between key members of the TB vaccine R&amp;D community, as well as between members of the community and the public at large—particularly public and private decision-makers responsible for allocating resources in support of critical global health issues – in an effort to attract new funding to this under-resourced initiative. The GTBVP is made up of a leadership forum, a technical advisory group and a communications group. Under the direction of the GTBVP, a document describing the current state of the TB vaccine development effort, as well as future directions in TB vaccine R&amp;D, is being drafted. Current plans call for this document to be revised every two years to reflect the rapid changes occurring in this dynamic field.</p>
