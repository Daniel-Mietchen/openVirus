<p>Balance also needs to be achieved between support of “upstream” (basic research and discovery) and “downstream” (assessments of vaccine concepts and candidates in animal challenge models and human clinical trials) efforts. Increasingly, the scarce research dollars that exist are flowing upstream at the expense of support for downstream initiatives, particularly clinical trials. It will be critical to continue to move forward with animal challenge studies and clinical trials utilizing a diversity of vaccine candidates and vaccine strategies, with a commitment to challenging dogma. It will be important to recognize, however, that TB vaccine development is challenging, and many efforts will lead to failure. Failure must be accepted if success is to be achieved.</p>
