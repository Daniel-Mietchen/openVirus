<p>Aeras, for years a nonprofit organization dedicated to the development of TB vaccines, had its assets transferred to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative as of October 2018. Aeras/IAVI representatives stressed that TB vaccine R&amp;D efforts are extremely resource constrained, with the burden falling on a few donors. The human impact of the disease in terms of suffering and death, along with the $19.2 billion annual cost in treatment, care and loss of productivity, is far out of balance with the small and inadequate investment currently being made in TB vaccine development and testing.</p>
