<p>1. To understand the natural immune response associated with protection against infection and disease: Efforts are underway to better understand the workings of the granuloma, the histopathologic signature of

 </sup>. Ongoing research seeks to understand the immunological mechanisms underlying permissive and non-permissive granulomas, and correlating results with those found in human granulomas obtained from surgical resections. Prospective cohort studies focus on outlier populations, such as persons who do not develop 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection despite presumed prolonged exposure to household contacts with active TB disease. Differences in host control between these persons and individuals who become infected are being investigated. Smaller experimental medicine studies will address specific immunological hypotheses. Knowledge generated from these efforts should inform rational vaccine design.
