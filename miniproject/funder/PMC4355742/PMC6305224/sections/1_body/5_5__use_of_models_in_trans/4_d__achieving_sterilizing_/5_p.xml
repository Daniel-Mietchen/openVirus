<p>The DC transfer proved to be more effective in inducing sterilizing or near-sterilizing immunity in mice that had received the mucosal Ag85A vaccine in addition to BCG, as compared to mice that only had received BCG. Gene expressions studies revealed that the gene expression signature of T-cells induced by the vaccines and antigen-pulsed DCs were enriched for the mucosal/airway phenotype. When the experiment was repeated using a multi-drug resistant 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> strain as the challenge strain, however, sterilizing immunity was not achieved. Additionally, endogenous, host DCs could be induced to generate near-sterilizing immunity through the administration of a select activation of innate mechanisms including CD103 and CD40 pathways. Delivery of amph-CpG adjuvant and CD40 agonist at the time of challenge, rather than through the transfer of pre-stimulated DCs also provided complete 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> control, providing additional support for the possibility of stimulating this type of response through vaccination
