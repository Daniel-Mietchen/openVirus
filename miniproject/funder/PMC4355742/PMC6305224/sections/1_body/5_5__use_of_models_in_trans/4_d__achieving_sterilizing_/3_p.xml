<p>Challenge studies in vaccine-naïve mice reveal that the pulmonary accumulation of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cells during primary 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is delayed by approximately 21 days, with peri-granulomar B-cell follicles – inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) – appearing at 24 days

 </sup>. Vaccinating the mice with BCG accelerates the 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cell response by one week, with these cells appearing in the pulmonary parenchyma between 12–14 days following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge and with iBALT appearing at day 17. In either case, 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> is capable of establishing viable and progressive pulmonary infection, albeit with fewer organisms following BCG vaccination.
