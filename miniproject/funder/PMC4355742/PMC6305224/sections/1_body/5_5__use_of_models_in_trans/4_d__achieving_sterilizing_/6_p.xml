<p>Hints at the possibility of achieving near-sterilizing immunity against 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> through vaccination have occurred with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge experiments in rhesus macaques following vaccination with a CMV-TB vaccine construct 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
 </sup> and in mice following vaccination with the ΔMosR and ΔechA7 vaccine concepts 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>
 </sup> or the ΔSigH vaccine concept 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>
 </sup>, all live, attenuated 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> vaccines. If ongoing experiments continue to demonstrate sterilizing or near-sterilizing immunity with these or other vaccine concepts, this would suggest that a “limited dynamic range” of murine immunity was not the explanation for the limited degree of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> suppression noted with other vaccine candidates. The location and timing of the vaccine-induced immune response to 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> (i.e. developing an 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific immune response in the lungs within days of initial infection, rather than weeks) may be the keys to a successful vaccination strategy against TB.
