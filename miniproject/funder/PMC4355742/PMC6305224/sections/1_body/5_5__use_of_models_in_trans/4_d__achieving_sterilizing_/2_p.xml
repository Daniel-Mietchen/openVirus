<p>The standard mouse model of vaccination and 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge calls for vaccination at time 0, permitting 30 days to pass to allow the generation of a memory response, and then administering an AE 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge. Subsequently, the degree of protection afforded by the vaccination, and the 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cell responses are assessed.
