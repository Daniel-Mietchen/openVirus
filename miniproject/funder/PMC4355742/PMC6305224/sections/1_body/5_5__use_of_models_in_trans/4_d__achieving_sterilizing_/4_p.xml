<p>It is possible that the delay in appearance of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cell responses in the lungs may represent a critical bottleneck to developing effective TB vaccine-induced immunity, a bottleneck that could be overcome if 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific T-cells could arrive at the initial sites of infection earlier. To test this hypothesis, dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens were transferred intra-tracheally one day before and then four days after AE 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge to mice that had received BCG vaccination, and some of which had also received a mucosal boost with Ag85B administered intranasally. This DC transfer overcame the TB vaccine bottleneck, resulting in the presence of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific, cytokine-producing T-cells on the third day following challenge, inducing iBALT 8 days following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, and resulting in rapid lung macrophage induction in the vaccinated mice

 </sup>. The rapid vaccine-induced T-cell responses limited early 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> growth, reducing 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU by 2 logs or more over vaccinated animals that had not received the DC transfer, with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> undetectable in approximately 50% of the mice upon sacrifice on day 20.
