<p>Most TB vaccine candidates reduce

 <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU in mouse lungs following a standard 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge experiment, the question is whether this is a sufficient degree of CFU reduction to suggest the potential success of the vaccine candidate. The acceptance of this degree of post-vaccination pulmonary 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> CFU has been largely based on the idea that this may be the full extent of suppression that TB vaccines can produce in mice, given the “limited dynamic range” of the murine immune system. It is unclear, however, whether this assumption is correct, or whether sterilizing immunity, or something approximating this, can, in fact, be generated in mice through manipulations of murine immunity that might be achievable through vaccination.
