<p>Additional studies of TB vaccines administered via the AE route are due to begin soon, including a first-in-human study comparing AE and ID administered ChAdOx1.85 (University of Lausanne, Switzerland) and aerosolized Ad585B (McMaster University, Canada). A clinical trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of increasing doses of BCG administered via the AE route based on encouraging protection and immunogenicity data in rhesus macaques, is ongoing, with no apparent safety issues raised and with encouraging, early immunogenicity data. It will be important to expand AE vaccination studies to sites endemic for TB to fully assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of this vaccine administration strategy.</p>
