<p>In a phase 1 clinical trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of 1Ã—10 
 <sup>7</sup> plaque-forming units (pfu) of the MVA85A TB vaccine administered via inhalation or ID in 22 BCG-vaccinated adults, Ag85A-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in fluid obtained via bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) were found to be stronger after AE than ID administration

 </sup>. Systemic Ag85A CD4+ T-cell responses were at least as strong after AE vaccination compared to ID administration. Additionally, no systemic anti-MVA vector IgG, IgA or IgM responses were detected following aerosol, but did develop following ID vaccination.
