<p>TST reversions following initial conversion occurred in 15% of convertors, more commonly than had been anticipated. Repeat TST conversion following initial reversion was completely eliminated by irradiating the air from the patient unit, suggesting that the reversion and repeat conversion events were due to subsequent re-infection rather than non-specific reactions to non-viable

 <italic>Mtb</italic> exposures and subclinical infections, many which initially resolve but which ultimately result in established infection and disease.
