<p>Preventing disease due to re-infection with new 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> strains represents an important target for TB vaccines but a difficult one to assess given the absence of a biomarker for 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> reinfection. A continuous exposure, natural transmission animal model that mimics human exposure in many high-burden settings, such as the human to GP exposure model described here, can serve to address this need. Vaccine suppression of transient TST or IGRA conversions seen in this model may represent an important target. A clinical study also is being implemented to assess the role that BCG vaccination may play in preventing IGRA-negative, BCG-na√Øve individuals who will be working in TB-endemic areas from acquiring 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. This investigation, called the Tuberculosis Immunization to Prevent Infection (TIPI) study, will enroll 2,000 USA-based healthcare and humanitarian workers (e.g., Peace Corps workers, persons entering service with Doctors without Borders or other NGOs). Half will be will vaccinated with BCG, and IGRA conversion rates will be compared against the unvaccinated arm over the period of exposure. Blood samples also will be collected to permit an assessment for correlates of immune protection if a difference in IGRA conversion rates is found between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.
