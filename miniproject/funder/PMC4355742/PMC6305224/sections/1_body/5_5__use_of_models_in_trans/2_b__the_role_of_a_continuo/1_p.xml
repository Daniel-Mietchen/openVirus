<p>Standard animal challenge models of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection differ from natural infection in a number of ways, including challenge with a higher 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure than the very low exposures that characterize natural infection; a single challenge as compared to the repeated exposures associated with natural infection; and exposure to a naturally occurring form of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> rather than laboratory-grown strains. Laboratory-grown strains are usually treated with mild surfactants such as Tweenâ„¢ that prevent clumping and permit accurate quantification of dose, but strip the outer lipid capsule off of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> and thereby potentially alter its immunogenicity

 </sup>. To overcome these issues, a human to guinea pig (GP) continuous natural exposure model was established 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
 </sup>. In this model ambient air from a specially built patient unit caring for individuals with active TB is removed via negative pressure and exhausted into a neighboring facility harboring GPs, with each GP receiving an average 4-month exposure to the stream of air laden with naturally occurring, uncultured 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>. A total of 362 GPs have been exposed over 12 years: 91 (25%) remained free of infection while 271 (75%) became infected as determined by tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion. Of the 271 TST converters, 53 (15%) experienced a reversion of their skin test, with 33 (9%) of the reverters subsequently reconverting, presumably due to re-infection. Only 54 (15%) of the infected or re-infected GPs went on to develop TB disease.
