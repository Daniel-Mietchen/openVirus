<p>Small animals can be experimentally manipulated to provide a reproducible challenge model capable of screening vaccine modulated vertebrate immune responses to limit 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in the lung. Mice and guinea pigs (GPs) have been the main small animal species utilized for assessing vaccine candidates

 </sup>. Mice are inbred, easily manipulated, inexpensive, and there are extensive reagents for immunological studies. Both mice and GPs provide the opportunity to compare vaccine efficacy by assessing bacterial load and survival following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge. GPs are susceptible to very low dose 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge and can be used for natural transmission or repeated low- and ultra-low-exposure models. It may be feasible to utilize GPs in a post-exposure model as well. The pulmonary pathology of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in GPs is similar to that of human primary TB
