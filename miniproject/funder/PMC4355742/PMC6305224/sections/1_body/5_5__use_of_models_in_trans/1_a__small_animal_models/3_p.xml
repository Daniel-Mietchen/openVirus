<p>Potential indications for TB vaccines in humans include prevention of TB disease (PoD), prevention of relapse or reinfection following treatment (PoR), and prevention of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (PoI). To discriminate between potential PoD vaccines, TB challenge in vaccinated small animals provides a direct measure of an anti-mycobacterial host response as well as the opportunity to detect pathological outcomes. For meaningful PoD efficacy, the optimal outcome in a small animal would be to reduce bacterial burden below the level of detection. Assessment of PoR vaccines can also be performed in small animals, but due to the variability in outcomes, large numbers of mice are required
