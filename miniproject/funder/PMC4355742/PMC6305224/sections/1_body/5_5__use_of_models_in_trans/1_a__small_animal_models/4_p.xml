<p>Other factors, such as the nutritional status of the animals, corticosteroid stress, the animal microbiome and the genetic background of the animal can influence the outcomes of challenge experiments. The development of “collaborative cross” (CC) mice, a multiparent panel of recombinant inbred mouse strains derived from eight founder laboratory strains

 </sup>. Additional factors that can affect outcomes are the bacterial strain selected for the challenge
