<p>Effective natural immunity against developing TB exists, given that 90â€“95% of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected individuals fail to develop active TB disease

In order to effectively manipulate the human immune response to TB we require new and diverse vaccine candidates and we need to correlate the immune responses induced by these vaccines with the degree of protection conveyed. Small animal models of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection can assist in this effort
