<p>Another major improvement in NHP models of TB has been the development of low-dose 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge (&lt;25 CFU) and very-low-dose 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge (&lt;10 CFU), doses that more closely approximate natural human exposure to 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> than did the 500â€“3,000 CFU exposures previously used. Additionally, the development of advanced tools for studying immune responses, permitting detailed studies of adaptive immune responses as well as assessments of diversified components of the rhesus immune response, have increased our understanding of NHP immune responses to vaccination and its effect on controlling an 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge before the candidate under study is selected for clinical evaluation.
