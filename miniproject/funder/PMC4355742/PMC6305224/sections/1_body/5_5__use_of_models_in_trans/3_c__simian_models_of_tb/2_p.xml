 </sup>. One major advance in improving NHP models of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge applicable to vaccine candidate assessment has been the development and application of advanced, non-invasive imaging techniques to serially track disease progression in a sensitive and quantifiable manner. The simultaneous application of computerized tomography (CT), which provides detailed images of internal structures and permits the quantification of pulmonary disease burden, in combination with positron electron tomography (PET), which demonstrates the spatial distribution of metabolic activity, thereby providing fundamental information relevant to TB pathogenesis, have proven valuable in assessing the degree of protection provided by newly-developed vaccine candidates
