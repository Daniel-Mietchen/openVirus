 </sup>. TB-induced pathology in NHPs is reflective of human pathology, including caseating granulomas and other granuloma types, as well as cavitary lung disease

 </sup>. Additionally, NHPs are immunologically closer to humans than other animal models as they possess unconventional T-cell subsets, including CD1a-d and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to BCG and TB

 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge experiments. Sequential sample collections from blood and mucosal sites also are possible, permitting time course studies of systemic and mucosal immunity that enable studies of biomarkers and immune correlates of protection.
