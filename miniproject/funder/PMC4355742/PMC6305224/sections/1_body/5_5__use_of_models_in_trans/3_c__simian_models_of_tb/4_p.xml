<p>As macaque populations demonstrate different responses to 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, it is important to select the rhesus species most relevant to the target product profile of the candidate vaccine when designing challenge experiments. It is also important to consider the species in which the experiments have been done when attempting to draw comparisons between challenge studies. For example, cynomolgus macaques demonstrate a greater degree of disease control following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge than do rhesus macaques, making the former potentially more representative of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in adults, and the latter modeling 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in infants and young children, where 
 <italic>de novo</italic> infection tends to have more serious consequences

 </sup>. The ability to control 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection also varies within species; among cynomolgus macaques, the Asian sub-species controls 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection better than those of the Mauritian sub-species. Among rhesus macaques, Chinese rhesus control 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> better than do those of the Indian subspecies. To further facilitate inter-study comparisons, a greater degree of harmonization and standardization of experimental methods must be achieved, including challenge strain selection, use of imaging, scoring gross pathology specimens and identifying priorities as to future experimental directions, such as assessing AE delivery of vaccines. This harmonization and standardization effort is underway within the Collaboration for TB Vaccine Development (CTVD), led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). CTVD recommendations regarding NHP-based study design for TB vaccine development have recently been published
