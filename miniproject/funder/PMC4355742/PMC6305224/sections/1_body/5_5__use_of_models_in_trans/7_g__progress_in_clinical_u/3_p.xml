<p>There are two key elements to developing a human challenge strain of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> for a CHIM: 1) developing a control system to elicit bacterial death; and 2) developing a system to detect viable 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> in the days and weeks following challenge. When developing a system to control 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> death, consideration must be given to the need to permit 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> survival for multiple generations to permit an assessment of the effect of the vaccine on 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> survival. At the end of the experiment, the killing control system must be able to eliminate all bacteria without relying on a lengthy course of antimycobacterial agents, and without the possibility of clinical relapse. Currently, three potential viability control systems are being assessed. The first strategy relies on the degradation of non-canonical amino acids upon which 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> auxotrophs are dependent for survival. Another approach is the insertion of “kill switches” into the 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> genome, which are inducible through the administration of exogenous molecules, such as tetracycline, that induce a gene that codes for a mycobacterium-directed toxin. Thirdly, a strategy involving protein degradation targeting is under investigation. It is possible that more than one of these approaches could be used in combination to improve safety.
