<p>Detection systems for viable 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> will need to measure the levels of bacterial load in the lungs without relying on a CFU count. Moreover, the detection strategy must be non- or minimally invasive. Detection systems being assessed for a TB CHIM include skin detection of fluorescent proteins, serum detection of metabolites engineered to be expressed by the 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge strain, and breath detection of engineered volatile organic compounds.
