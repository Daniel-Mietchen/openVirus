<p>Many questions regarding a CHIM for TB vaccine development remain to be answered, questions that will confront both CHIM developers and regulators tasked with assuring the safety of the mycobacterial control and detection strategies ultimately selected for the initial TB CHIM. Safety is paramount; questions regarding the confidence in the level of safeguards built into the 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge strain, and the potential for reversion to a virulent state, will need to be addressed. The duration of survival of a CHIM 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> strain necessary to permit an adequate assessment of potential vaccine protection, and the level of sensitivity of detection that would need to be built into the system to permit these assessments remains unclear. Whether or not a vaccine effect can actually be detected via a CHIM strategy, and, if so, the types of TB vaccine for which this approach would be relevant, also remains unclear. Finally, the likelihood of regulatory acceptance of any 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> CHIM is not yet known.
