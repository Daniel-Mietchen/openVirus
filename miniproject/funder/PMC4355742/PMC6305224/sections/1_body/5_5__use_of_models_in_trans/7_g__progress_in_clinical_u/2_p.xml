<p>Developing a TB vaccine CHIM is challenging task given that virulent 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> cannot be used in the challenge model for obvious ethical reasons. Accordingly, a major question facing TB vaccine CHIM developers is whether 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> can be manipulated to be safe enough to administer to volunteers. An additional question is whether BCG could be used either as the challenge organism or at least as an agent that would permit further clinical development of the clinical challenge model.
