<p>Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) have proven useful in vaccine development efforts, including vaccines for malaria, influenza and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>. Development of a CHIM for TB vaccine development would represent a major step forward, given the uncertain predictive value of preclinical animal models, the lack of a validated immune correlate of protection and the value of detecting a signal of vaccine protection in the host species. A CHIM to support TB vaccine development could be used for vaccine selection as well as for immunobiology studies to inform basic knowledge gaps.
