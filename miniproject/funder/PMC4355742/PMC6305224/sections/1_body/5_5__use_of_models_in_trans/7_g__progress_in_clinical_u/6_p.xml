<p>Given these uncertainties, a different CHIM strategy, based on a human intradermal (ID) BCG challenge, is being developed in parallel to CHIMs based on intrapulmonary 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> administration. The rationale behind the ID BCG CHIM is based on the theory that an effective vaccine against BCG also should protect against 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>. BCG vaccination has been found to suppress growth of an ID BCG challenge in mice, cattle and NHPs

A similar study, in which MVA85A and BCG + MVA85A was assessed in addition to persons vaccinated with BCG alone, also revealed a statistically significant reduction of ID BCG as determined by culture and PCR of skin punch biopsies in persons receiving BCG or BCG + MVA85A as compared to placebo or MVA85A alone
