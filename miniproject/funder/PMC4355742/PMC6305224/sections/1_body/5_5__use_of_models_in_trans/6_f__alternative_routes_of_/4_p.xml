To directly assess the effect of various vaccine administration routes of a vaccine presenting a wide breadth of antigens, rhesus challenge experiments were conducted with BCG administered by ID, AE, IV and ID + AE, with a low-dose (15 CFU) challenge 6 months after immunization (BCG doses: ID – 5×10 
 <sup>5</sup>; AE – 5×10 
 <sup>7</sup>; IV – 5×10 
 <sup>7</sup>) (Robert Seder, personal communication). Initial immunogenicity results from BAL samples demonstrated that IV BCG resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of TB-specific CD4+ T-cells, and CD8+ T-cells compared to the other administration routes. Additionally, IV BCG strikingly altered the proportion of T-cells and macrophages in BAL samples. The extent to which IV BCG actually persists in the lung, and the degree of protection against 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> mediated by administration of BCG via the IV route, is being assessed.
