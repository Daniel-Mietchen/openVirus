<p>For TB, the route of vaccine administration also influences the sites of T-cell priming, and the location and strength of where tissue resident T-cells develop. ID or IM vaccination is the route by which BCG and all other TB vaccine candidates in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials are administered respectively. These routes primarily result in T-cell priming in local draining lymph nodes, a moderate circulating T memory (T 
 <sub>mem</sub>) response and a weak lung-resident effector (T 
 <sub>eff</sub>) memory response, not an optimal situation when a rapid, lung-based T-cell response is needed for protection. Vaccines administered via the AE route result in local T-cell priming in the lung with a weak peripheral response

 </sup>. Combining ID or IM administration with AE administration theoretically represents a strategy by which both lung T 
 <sub>eff</sub> memory cells, in combination with circulating T 
 <sub>mem</sub>, may be generated. With regard to AE delivery of vaccines, a series of NHP experiments with recombinant adenoviral-vectored TB vaccines encoding 2â€“4 antigens delivered via AE, generated robust T cell immunity in the lung, but did not result in greater protection against TB disease than with BCG given ID

 </sup>. These data suggest that there was either lack of antigenic breadth presented by the vectors, poor quality of the virally induced responses, or unfavorable innate imprinting by the viral vectors associated with increased risk of
