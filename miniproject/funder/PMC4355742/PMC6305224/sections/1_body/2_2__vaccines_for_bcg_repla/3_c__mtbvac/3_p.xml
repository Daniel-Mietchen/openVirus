 </sup>. MTBVAC currently is being further assessed for safety and immunogenicity in newborns in a phase 1b dose escalation study conducted in a TB-endemic region of South Africa, with a safety arm in adults (NCT02729571). Vaccination of newborns enrolled in this study was completed in September 2016, with one-year follow-up in September 2017. A phase 2a dose-defining safety and immunogenicity study of MTBVAC in 99 HIV-unexposed newborns in TB-endemic regions of sub-Saharan Africa is being planned (NCT03536117). This study is also intended to build capacity for future, later-stage evaluations of this vaccine.
