<p>MTBVAC is the only attenuated vaccine derived from 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> currently in clinical trials. To create this vaccine, two stable deletions were made in the genome of an 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> clinical isolate, selected so as to avoid laboratory subculture: deletions of the 
 <italic>phoP</italic> gene, needed to control the transcription of key 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> virulence genes permitting its survival in host cells; and 
 <italic>fadD</italic>26 gene, required for the synthesis of cell surface lipids that play a critical role in 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> pathogenicity

 </sup>. As MTBVAC is derived from a clinical 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> strain, and only carries two specific deletions in its genome, the vaccine candidate possesses 519 more epitopes (1603 epitopes) than currently used BCG (1084 epitopes) 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
 </sup>. Challenge experiments in mice demonstrated improved protection by MTBVAC as compared to BCG, with protection associated with a T-cell mediated response to two 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antigens, CFP10 and ESAT6, present in MTBVAC but absent in BCG
