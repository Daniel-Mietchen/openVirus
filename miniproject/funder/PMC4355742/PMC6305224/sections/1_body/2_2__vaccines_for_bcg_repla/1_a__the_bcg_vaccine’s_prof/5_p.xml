<p>Overall, the results of studies of BCG effectiveness, beyond prevention of miliary and meningeal TB in infants, has been marked by extraordinary variability and inconsistency, with rates of BCG-induced protection varying from 80% to totally non-protective at any age group. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain this variation and relative lack of effectiveness

 </sup>. These include differences in key antigens between 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> and BCG, including the absence in BCG of the important 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> RD1 and ESX genetic regions; differences in the potency of the various BCG strains in use globally; and interference from exposure to atypical environmental mycobacteria. Mycobacterial exposure, generally in countries closer to the equator, has the potential to confound assessing the efficacy of BCG or any new vaccine candidate in populations whose immune systems have been engaged by cross-reacting mycobacterial antigens. Another unknown about BCG is the extent to which the vaccine persists following infant vaccination.
