<p>The bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine represents the only successful vaccine as yet developed for TB. BCG is derived from 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, a bovine mycobacterium passaged 230 times in the Pasteur laboratory in Lyon by Drs. Calmette and Guérin between 1908 and its first human use in 1921. It has since become the most widely used vaccine in human history, with well over 3 billion doses administered; currently, more than 100 million children annually are administered BCG within hours or days of birth, representing 89% of the annual global birth cohort. BCG provides excellent protection in infants against disseminated miliary and meningeal TB, particularly serious forms of the disease with high mortality rate (RR 0.1; 95% CI 0.01 - 0.77)
