<p>While evidence of BCG-induced protection against miliary and meningeal TB in infants is widely accepted, the degree to which BCG prevents pulmonary TB in infants, children and adults remains controversial. In the past, some of the differing results has been attributed to the variety of BCG strains currently being used globally, yet in meta-analyses of clinical trials utilizing different BCG strains, no statistically significant difference in efficacy has been identified
