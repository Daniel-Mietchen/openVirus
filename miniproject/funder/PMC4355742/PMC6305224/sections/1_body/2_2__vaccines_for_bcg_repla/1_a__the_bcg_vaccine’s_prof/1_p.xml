<p>Optimally, certain information should be known when attempting to develop a vaccine, such as the immune mechanisms necessary and sufficient to protect against infection and/or disease, the antigens that stimulate a protective immunological response, the antigen delivery platforms best capable of evoking a protective response in a safe and acceptable manner, and confirmation of the protective mechanisms in human clinical efficacy studies. Currently, none of this information is available for TB vaccines. Accordingly, additional information must be sought and utilized to justify and guide the TB vaccine development effort.</p>
