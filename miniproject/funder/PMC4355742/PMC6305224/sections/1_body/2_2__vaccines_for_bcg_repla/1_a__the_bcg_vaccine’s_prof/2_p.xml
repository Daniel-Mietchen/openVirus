<p>There is some skepticism about whether an effective vaccine can be developed against TB. We know that about 90% of people infected do not develop disease and that individuals who are immunocompromised have 10-fold greater risk, establishing the importance of protective immune responses. One interesting piece of information comes from an observational clinical study published in the mid-1930s

 </sup>. In this study, nurses entering service in a TB hospital in Norway were assessed for their rate of TB based on their TST status prior to entering this service. This study revealed that nurses who were TST positive had a 96% reduced risk of developing clinical TB than did the nurses who were TST negative, with an annual TB rate of 4% to 5% observed in the TST-negative nurses, suggesting a meaningful degree of protection against TB disease stemming from latent TB infection (LTBI). A later analysis of 14 studies confirmed this result, with LTBI found to be 78% protective against TB disease, even though
