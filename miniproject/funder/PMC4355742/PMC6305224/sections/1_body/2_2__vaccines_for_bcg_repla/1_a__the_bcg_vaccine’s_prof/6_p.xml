<p>BCG administration has changed since its first delivery to an infant whose mother had active TB in 1921. Initially, BCG was administered orally, where most organisms were presumed to be killed by stomach acid. Calmette, however, observed bacillemia following oral administration, leading later to a switch of BCG administration to the intradermal (ID) route. Experiments with intravenous (IV) administration of BCG to rhesus macaques in the early 1970s demonstrated significantly greater protection against pulmonary and hematogenous TB following aerosol
