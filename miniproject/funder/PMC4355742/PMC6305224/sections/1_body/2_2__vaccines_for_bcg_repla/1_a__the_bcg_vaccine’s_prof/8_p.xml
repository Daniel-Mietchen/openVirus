<p>Improved understanding of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> and BCG pathophysiology has led to potential paths forward for improving BCG. As BCG is missing the RD1 and ESX genetic regions present in 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>, one possible future approach is to replace them in genetically modified BCG strains. Additionally, it is known that 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> is capable of escaping the macrophage endosome and thereby has its antigens processed in the cytosol, inducing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses, and that antimicrobial peptides derived from cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) are able to kill 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> within infected macrophages 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic> While BCG is incapable of escaping the endosomes or generating a significant CTL response, a BCG-derived TB vaccine, VPM1002, has been genetically manipulated to permit its escape from the endosome, resulting in cytosolic antigen processing
