<p>The current moment represents a critical juncture for TB vaccine development. In 2018â€“2020, clinical efficacy data are scheduled to be released from five phase 2b proof of concept studies: Vaccae, H4/BCG revaccination (data subsequently released and described above), M72/AS01 (data subsequently released and described below), Dar901 and VPM1002. Results from these trials will paint a clearer picture as to the potential of the global vaccine candidate pipeline, optimal paths for future TB vaccine design and development strategies, and the predictive ability of current animal models. Ideally, candidates that demonstrate efficacy will also enable discovery of candidate correlates of protection, with potential to substantially streamline further TB vaccine development.</p>
