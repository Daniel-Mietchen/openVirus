<p>Four potential indications have been identified as targets for TB vaccine development in adolescents and adults: 1) prevention of TB disease (PoD); 2) prevention of recurrent TB disease, which can be related to relapse or re-infection, in persons cured post-treatment for active disease (PoR); 3) prevention of established 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in persons uninfected with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> (PoI); and 4) as an immunotherapeutic adjunct to drug treatment to shorten curative regimens or increase the efficacy of treatment of drug-resistant strains. In infants, the major goals have been to develop a vaccine that is more efficacious and/or safer than BCG that could serve as a BCG replacement and to develop a booster to improve and extend the protection provided by BCG.
