<p>Despite these challenges, however, it is becoming clear that developing new TB vaccines is an achievable goal. The partially protective effect of BCG, capable of preventing up to 80% of cases of severe, disseminated TB in infants and young children, provides important supportive evidence of this point. Additional evidence comes from the 90% of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected persons who are capable of controlling their infection throughout their lives without developing disease; and the intriguing examples of individuals at high risk of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection who, when assessed for 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection by TST or IGRA, demonstrate transient positivity on repeated assessments before reverting to a consistently negative state, a situation with unclear clinical significance but which has been interpreted by some as evidence of early immunological containment of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and a reduced risk of TB disease

 <italic>Mtb</italic>, through household or occupational contact, for example, who never convert their TSTs or IGRAs, may represent another example of natural immunity to
