 </sup>. The major issue in developing a vaccine for a PoD indication, however, is the cost of conducting late-stage efficacy trials given the relatively large sample sizes and prolonged period of post-vaccination follow-up required to accrue adequate endpoints in the general, healthy population. In light of this, novel trial designs for phase 2 proof of concept studies have been developed to reduce the risk of failure in expensive late-stage trials. These novel designs have focused on assessing candidate TB vaccines for clinically meaningful biological effects in selected high-risk populations, to allow shorter, less expensive trials for assessment of efficacy.
