<p>Many challenges must be addressed to develop a successful TB vaccine. 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> represents a complex pathogen that has evolved with humanity for tens of thousands of years, allowing it to evolve in such a way as to survive the normal range of immune responses directed against it. The absence of a known correlate of immune protection against TB in humans has hampered vaccine discovery and development, as has the inability to assess the predictive nature of animal challenge models given the lack of vaccine efficacy data in humans to date. Late stage efficacy trials, particularly phase 3 trials for efficacy and safety, are long and expensive, as are subsequent phase 4 programs, together representing a potential disincentive for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to expend resources given the relatively high risk of failure and expectations of limited commercial returns. Moreover, the TB vaccine field remains severely underfunded, particularly given the potential impact of a vaccine in curbing the TB epidemic and the global societal cost of TB, estimated at $19.2 billion in 2017, including a $7.2 billion cost for treatment and control activities and $12 billion indirect costs to the economies
