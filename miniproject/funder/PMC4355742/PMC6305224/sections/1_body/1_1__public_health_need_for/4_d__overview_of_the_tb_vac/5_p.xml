<p>Assessing the ability of a candidate vaccine to prevent establishment of 
 <italic>de novo Mtb</italic> infection represents another strategy to demonstrate a clinically meaningful biological effect. If populations experiencing a high force of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection were recruited, such as adolescents in the Western Cape of South Africa, a PoI endpoint trial could potentially be less expensive to conduct than a PoR trial

 </sup>. Results from a PoI trial of the adjuvanted protein vaccine, H4:IC31 versus BCG revaccination, conducted in adolescents in the Western Cape were recently published (after the meeting reported here). This trial demonstrated that neither the H4:IC31 vaccine nor revaccination with the BCG vaccine prevented initial quantiferon (QFT) conversion (efficacy point estimates of 9.4%, P=0.63 for H4:IC31; 20.1%, P=0.29 for BCG). BCG revaccination, however, reduced the rate of sustained QFT conversion (efficacy 45.4%, P=0.03); efficacy of sustained QFT conversion for H4:IC31 was 30.5%, P=0.16)

 </sup>. The implications of these results for BCG revaccination strategies are currently being discussed. A recent review of available data on BCG revaccination before these data were released led WHO to conclude that the existing evidence, prior to the completion of the BCG revaccination PoI trial did not support BCG revaccination policy
