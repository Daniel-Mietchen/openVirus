<p>Currently, multiple vaccine candidates are being assessed in clinical trials. Vaccine strategies being assessed include live, attenuated mycobacteria (MTBVAC, VPM-1002); killed, whole cell mycobacteria (DAR-901, M. vaccae, MIP), mycobacterial extracts (RUTI); adjuvanted protein vaccines (M72/AS01E, H4:IC31 (discontinued), H56:IC31, ID93 + GLA-SE), and viral vectored vaccines (Ad5Ag85A, ChAdOx185A/MVA85A, TB/FLU-04L). Although the target populations in these trials include adolescents, adults and infants, it is generally recognized that vaccinating adolescents and adults represents the most efficient means of stopping the cycle of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> transmission and thereby offers the best opportunity to control the global spread of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>, even to infants and children
