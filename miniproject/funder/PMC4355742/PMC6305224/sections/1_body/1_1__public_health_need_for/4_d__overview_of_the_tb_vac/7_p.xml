<p>Both the PoI and PoR approaches pose a risk when used as experimental endpoints towards the development of a PoD vaccine, as it remains unknown whether these other endpoints actually predict efficacy for PoD in the general population. It is possible that preventing disease, preventing infection and preventing recurrence of disease in cured patients may require fundamentally different immunological responses, thereby leading to positive or negative results that would not be predictive of a positive PoD outcome.</p>
