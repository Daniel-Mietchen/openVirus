<p>A model of the health impact of the introduction in 2024 in low and middle income countries of a 60% efficacious vaccine with 10 years protection delivered to adolescents and adults, with coverage equal to school attendance for routine vaccination of 10 year olds and 72–76% for periodic mass campaigns, suggests that approximately 17 million TB cases could be averted between 2024 and 2050

 </sup>. If such vaccine were to be administered to infants, with approximately 90% coverage rate, 890,000 TB cases would be cumulatively averted by 2050. These benefits need to be weighed against the total systems cost of vaccine administration, including the purchase price and the cost of administration, transportation and storage, national program management and the facilities and equipment necessary to deliver and administer a vaccine. In the modelled scenarios above, the median cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in low or middle income settings ranged from cost saving to $720 per DALY averted in the adult/adolescent scenario, and $1,690–$18,110 per DALY averted in the infant scenario

 </sup>. Issues faced in the early stages of vaccine development, such as efficacy and duration of protection, and issues arising later, such as vaccine price, regimen of administration, thermostability and availability (overall supply) all contribute to the cost of vaccine administration and should be taken into consideration at the very earliest stages of the development of a vaccine.
