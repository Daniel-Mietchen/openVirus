<p>A key question that arises when attempting to assess the value of TB vaccines is how to measure “value”. Possible measures of value include the payer perspective – savings in direct healthcare costs resulting from the protective effect of vaccines; a human perspective – assessing reductions in death and disability; and a societal perspective – determining the overall benefits to society that result from vaccine-induced protection. Different stakeholders will have different views on which of these approaches best defines the value of vaccines. Perspectives of vaccine value also will differ based on whether the value proposition involves a regional, countrywide, or global assessment.</p>
