<p>Mathematical modeling exercises reinforce the intuitive conclusion that a vaccine with greater efficacy and a longer duration of effect will have greater benefit than those with lesser degrees of efficacy and durations. In addition, modeling has suggested that a PoD vaccine with protective efficacy as low as 20%, and duration as short as 5 years, administered to adolescents and adults, could have an important and cost-effective effect in controlling the spread of
