<p>A key objective of the WHO End TB Strategy is a 90% reduction in TB incidence, from the 2015 annual incidence of greater than 100 cases per 100,000 population to less than 10 cases per 100,000 persons by 2035

 </sup>. Currently, the annual decline in TB incidence is not nearly fast enough to meet the expressed goals

 </sup>. As evidenced by the successes of the social protections provided under the Marshall Plan in the aftermath of World War II, a 10% rate of decline could be considered feasible through optimization of currently available social and medical interventions, although this is a major proposition in and of itself which would require a heightened degree of global commitment to achieve. Without the development of new TB prevention modalities, however, this rate would be expected to flatten out to a 5% decline per year by 2025, again, not nearly sufficient to meet the End TB Strategy 2035 goals

 </sup>. Only the introduction of new tools, including better point-of-care diagnostics capable of quickly and reliably diagnosing TB, including cases of drug-resistant (DR) TB; better drugs for treating drug-sensitive and DR-TB over a shorter period of time than is currently required; and, most importantly, a new vaccine capable of preventing TB disease, introduced by 2025, would result in an acceleration to the 17% per year decline of TB incidence necessary to meet the 2035 goals
