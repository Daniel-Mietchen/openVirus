<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidance on priority targets and development pathways for vaccines against diseases of high public health interest. The involvement of the WHO in vaccine development is driven by assessments of medical need and technical feasibility, and an absence of market incentives and sufficient funding to adequately drive the development process. As tuberculosis (TB) kills more people globally than any other single infectious agent

 </sup>, developing a TB vaccine ranks among the highest global health priorities from a medical needs perspective. A number of factors support the technical feasibility of a TB vaccine, including the fact that an estimated 90% of persons infected with 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> ( 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>) do not progress to active disease 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 </sup>, evidence suggesting that past 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection provides some protection against new infections 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
 </sup>, and the existence of a century-old vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG), that provides partial protection in children which may, under some circumstances, extend for decades

 </sup>. The current imperative is to improve our understanding of the type of immunological responses needed to provide robust protection against 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection or TB disease, and to use this information to efficiently develop new, safe and effective TB vaccines.
