<p>ID93 is a fusion of four 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens with diverse roles that are recognized by T-cells isolated from 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed individuals and lack human sequence homology 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
 </sup>. The fused proteins in the ID93 vaccine include Rv1813, an antigen up-regulated under hypoxic conditions; Rv2608, the PPE protein, probably associated with the 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> outer-membrane; and Rv3619 along with Rv3620, both included among the EsX protein family of secreted virulence factors. GLA-SE is a synthetic TLR-4 agonist adjuvant, formulated in a squalene oil in a water nano-emulsion. GLA-SE has been demonstrated to be safe in humans, with thousands of doses delivered, induces a TH1-biasing immunological response, and production is readily scalable.
