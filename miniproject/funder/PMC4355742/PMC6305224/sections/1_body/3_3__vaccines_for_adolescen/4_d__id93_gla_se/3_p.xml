<p>Two phase 1, and one phase 2a clinical trial of ID93/GLA-SE in healthy adults in the United States and South Africa have been completed. These trials, assessing safety, immunogenicity and dosing approaches, have included persons not vaccinated with BCG, BCG vaccinated individuals, and persons who are IGRA-, IGRA+ and those with active TB disease. Results from these studies demonstrated the induction of a broad, polyfunctional T-cell response, an increase in multi-functional antibodies, and robust CD4+ T-cell responses in IGRA+ adults, suggesting that the vaccine boosts the immune response to natural infection

 </sup>. The phase 2a trial, in which vaccination occurred at the end of TB treatment, demonstrated encouraging CD4+ T-cell and antibody responses to vaccination (NCT02465216). These studies also demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for ID93/GLA-SE in more than 200 research participants. Several new Phase 2 studies of ID93 / GLA-SE are being prepared. A Phase 2a study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of ID93 / GLA-SE in preventing infection with TB among high-risk health care workers in Korea is being planned. Additionally, two Phase 2b clinical trials of ID93 / GLA-SE to evaluate the vaccine as an immunotherapeutic adjunct to multidrug therapy have received funding. In India, a collaboration with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences will administer the vaccine to patients undergoing multidrug therapy for both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. In South Africa, plans are being developed for an expansion of the Phase 2a prevention of recurrence study, with the intention to advance administration of the vaccine proximally towards the initiation of TB therapy, beginning at the completion of therapy and moving as early as two months after chemotherapy has started.
