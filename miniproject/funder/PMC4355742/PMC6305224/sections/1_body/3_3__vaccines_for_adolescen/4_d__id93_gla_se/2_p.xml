<p>ID93/GLA-SE is being developed for two indications: as an immunotherapeutic agent to improve the outcome of drug treatment for active TB, and as a prophylactic vaccine to prevent infection with TB. Proof of principle for the ability of ID93/GLA-SE to enhance TB treatment has been demonstrated in mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates, where immunotherapeutic vaccination with ID93/GLA-SE in combination with multidrug therapy was associated with a polyfunctional Th1 response, improved bacterial clearance and reduced pulmonary inflammation
