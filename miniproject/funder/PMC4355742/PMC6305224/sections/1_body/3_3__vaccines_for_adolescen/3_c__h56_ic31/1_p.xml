<p>The H56:IC31 vaccine is an adjuvanted fusion protein, consisting of three highly immunogenic 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens – Ag85B, ESAT-6 and Rv2660c – and adjuvanted with the Valneva IC31© adjuvant

 </sup>. ESAT-6 is a premiere virulence-associated antigen highly expressed throughout all stages of infection while Rv2660c is a stress-induced antigen, strongly associated with latent TB infection. The IC31 adjuvant consists of ODN1a, a TLR9 ligand, and a stabilizing molecule that helps establish depot formation. The central immunologic strategy of this vaccine is to generate long-lived, Th1-type T-cell immunity. The vaccine is being developed by the Statens Serum Institute (Denmark), with multiple partners including Valneva, GmBH (Austria), Aeras, the South African TB Vaccine Initiative (SATVI), The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) and the Research Council of Norway.
