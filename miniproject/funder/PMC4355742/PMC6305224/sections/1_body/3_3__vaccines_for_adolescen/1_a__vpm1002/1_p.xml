<p>In addition to its development as a vaccine to replace BCG in infants, VPM1002 also is being developed as a TB vaccine for adolescents and adults. A phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess VPM1002 vaccine efficacy in preventing recurrence of TB in adults recently treated and cured of active TB (PoR) is underway in India (NCT03152903). Sample size calculations for this study assume a 5% rate of TB recurrence in the placebo arm and a 50% reduction of TB recurrence among subjects in the VPM1002 arm during a 12-month follow-up period. Two thousand persons (1,000 in each arm) will be enrolled to achieve 80% power at a 5% significance level, with a 10% estimated drop-out rate. A phase 3 study to protect against TB disease among household contacts of persons with active TB also is being planned.</p>
