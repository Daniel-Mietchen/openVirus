<p>M72/AS01E, the GSK proprietary candidate vaccine, consists of a fusion protein expressing two immunogenic 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens: Mtb39A, a membrane-associated protein expressed early in the 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> life cycle, putatively identified as an immune evasion factor; and Mtb32A, a constitutively expressed secreted protein and a putative serine protease, combined with the adjuvant system AS01E containing monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS21 in a liposomal suspension, geared to promote a Th1 immune response

 </sup>. Key components of the target product profile (TPP) for M72/AS01E include preventing TB in adults and adolescents; an efficacy level of 70% or greater (no minimally acceptable level of efficacy has yet been set by the developers); a clinically acceptable safety profile, including safety for use in HIV-infected individuals; acceptability for co-administration with widely recommended adolescent vaccines when administered in a 2-dose regimen 1 to 6 months apart; and a duration of protection of 10 or more years. The possible need for boosters will be explored.
