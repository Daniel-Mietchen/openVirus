<p>The M72/AS01E candidate vaccine was first introduced into humans in 2004; clinical development has been conducted in collaboration with Aeras. M72/AS01E has been tested for safety and immunogenicity in 12 completed phase 1 and phase 2 studies. The vaccine has been tested in adults who were PPD negative, PPD positive

 </sup>. Overall, M72/AS01E was found to be safe and well tolerated in the recruited populations, with more reactogenicity noticed in subjects with active TB disease. The vaccine induced a high-magnitude, M72-specific CD4+ T-cell polyfunctional response (IFN-gamma, IL-2, TNF-alpha and CD40L) that persisted for more than 1 year.
