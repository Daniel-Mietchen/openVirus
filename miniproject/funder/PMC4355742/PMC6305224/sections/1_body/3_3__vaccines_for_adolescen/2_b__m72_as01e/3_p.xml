<p>A phase 2b proof of concept efficacy study in approximately 3,500 IGRA positive, HIV-negative adults in clinics in South Africa, Kenya and Zambia, in which enrollees were followed up for three years for the occurrence of TB disease, has been concluded (NCT01755598). Subsequent to the meeting reported here, results have been released

 </sup>. The study demonstrated 54% (90%CI 14%â€“75%) vaccine efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis, during a period of follow-up of approximately 2 years, the most promising results yet seen in clinical assessments of new TB vaccines. Increased reactogenicity (local reactions and flu-like symptoms) were more common in M72/AS01E vaccine recipients relative to placebo recipients, but no unexpected safety concerns were raised. Secondary analyses suggest vaccine efficacy does not appear to wane over the follow-up time, and may be a function of age, but secondary signals should be interpreted with caution, as they are based on small numbers. The study is ongoing, with final results expected to be released in 2019.
