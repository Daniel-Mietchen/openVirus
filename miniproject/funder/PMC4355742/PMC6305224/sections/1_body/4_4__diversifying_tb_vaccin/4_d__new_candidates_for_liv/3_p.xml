<p>The primary disadvantage to LAVs is a concern about their safety. The potential for reversion to wild-type virulence remains a possibility for organisms attenuated through the deletion of one or a few virulence genes. Additionally, LAVs that behave in an attenuated fashion in persons with normally functioning immune systems may prove dangerous and even deadly if administered to persons with compromised immune function.</p>
