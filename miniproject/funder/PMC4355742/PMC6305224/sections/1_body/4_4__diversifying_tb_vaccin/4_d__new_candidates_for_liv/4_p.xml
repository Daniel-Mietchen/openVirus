<p>Rational deletion of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> virulence genes represents an exciting approach to creating a new generation of TB vaccines. One attenuated 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> vaccine concept results from the deletion of MosR (Regulator of Mycobacterial Operons of Survival, Rv0348) that plays an important role in 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> survival during infection
