<p>Major advantages to using LAVs include their ease and low cost of production, their longer persistence and the ability to stimulate both adaptive and innate immune responses, thereby obviating the need for adjuvants with the establishment of a long-term, comprehensive immunity. This stands in contrast to inactivated whole cell vaccines that primarily induce neutralizing (humoral, antibody-based) immunity with minimal mucosal and innate immune stimulation and little generation of cell-mediated immunity (CMI); and recombinant vector vaccines that primarily generate CMI with minimal innate and mucosal immunity, and with little to no humoral immunity
