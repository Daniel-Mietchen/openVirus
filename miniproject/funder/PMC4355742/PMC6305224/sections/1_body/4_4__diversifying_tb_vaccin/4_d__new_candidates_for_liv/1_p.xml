<p>Live, attenuated vaccines (LAVs) are pathogens missing genes responsible for producing virulence factors or key metabolic enzymes, with the absence of these genes resulting either from rational design or randomly through passage. When creating LAVs as vaccine candidates, developers must maintain a balance between attenuation and virulence, as too much attenuation may impair the ability of the candidate to generate a sufficiently protective immune response, while insufficient attenuation would raise safety concerns.</p>
