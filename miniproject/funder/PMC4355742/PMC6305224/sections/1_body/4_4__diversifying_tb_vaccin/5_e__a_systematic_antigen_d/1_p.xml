<p>The current approach to TB vaccine development suffers from three shortcomings: 1) it has focused mostly on a narrow set of candidate TB antigens which may have suboptimal activity in protecting against TB; 2) it has focused on generating classical, CD4+ T(h1) cells, which may be essential but not sufficient to generate an optimally protective response; and 3) has not taken into account recently emerging evidence suggesting a role for traditionally “ignored” cells, such as B-cells, in generating immunological protection against TB. Accordingly, exploring the role of unconventional T-cells and T-cell responses, such as donor unrestricted T-cells (DURTS), mostly CD8+ T-cells restricted by CD1, MR1, HLA-E, TCR-gamma-delta; non-IFN-γ producing T-cells; and the role of non-T-cells will be critical to future TB vaccine development efforts
