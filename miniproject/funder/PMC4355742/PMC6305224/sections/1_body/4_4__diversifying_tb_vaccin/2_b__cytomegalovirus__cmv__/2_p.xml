<p>The strategic rationale for selecting a CMV vector for a TB vaccine resides in its unique ability to elicit and maintain robust, effector-differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in organs outside lymphoid structures, including the respiratory tract. Experiments with rhesus CMV (RhCMV) in rhesus macaques (RMs) demonstrate that RhCMV vectors expressing foreign antigens manifest the critical biological properties needed to generate effector-memory T-cells in a safe manner. These properties include the ability to super-infect rhesus already infected with CMV, and to persist indefinitely despite robust anti-CMV immunity in naturally CMV seropositive animals; the capacity to elicit and indefinitely maintain high frequency, “effector differentiated” T-cell (T effector and T tissue-resident effector) responses in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues and parenchymal organs; and the ability to maintain immunogenicity despite profound attenuation. In particular, genetically attenuated (ULb’ mutated) RhCMV vectors (68-1 RhCMV) demonstrate an unexpected and unusual capability to elicit CD8+ T-cell responses that entirely, and broadly, target novel epitopes restricted by MHC-E and MHC-II
