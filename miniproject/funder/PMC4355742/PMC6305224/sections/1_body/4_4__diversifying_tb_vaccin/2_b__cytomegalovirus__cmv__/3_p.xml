<p>The primary rationale for a CMV-vectored TB vaccine is to generate tissue effector T-cells capable of immediate interception of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages at sites of initial lung infection prior to the initiation of the substantial immune system modulation caused by 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> necessary to permit 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> survival and replication. Two RhCMV-TB vaccines have been created thus far, one expressing nine 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins across four different RhCMV vectors, the other expressing six 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins as a single polyprotein from one vector. Two RhCMV-TB efficacy pre-clinical assessments studies of these vectors, utilizing a low-dose (25 colony forming unit (CFU)) challenge of Erdman strain 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>, have been completed

 </sup>. In the first study, the extent of lung, non-lung and overall TB disease at one year following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge was significantly reduced in RhCMV-TB vaccinated NHPs as compared to unvaccinated and BCG vaccinated controls. BCG vaccination prior to RhCMV-TB vaccination appeared to reduce the efficacy of the experimental vaccine. In the second study, no TB disease was detected via lung CT scans in 13 of the 27 CMV-TB vaccinated animals, as compared to unvaccinated controls where all demonstrated TB involvement of lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes. While all unvaccinated RMs demonstrated both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB at necropsy, no gross or microscopic TB was found in the 13 RMs with CT scans that did not demonstrate TB disease. Moreover, 10 of these 13 were 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> culture negative. Taken together, these studies demonstrated unequivocal protection—defined as a finding of no granulomatous disease at necropsy (41%) and a significant reduction in TB disease (32%)—in 73% of vaccinated RMs. Comparisons between different CMV-TB constructs also determined that efficacy is not dependent on unconventional MHC-II and MHC-E restricted CD8+ T-cell responses.
