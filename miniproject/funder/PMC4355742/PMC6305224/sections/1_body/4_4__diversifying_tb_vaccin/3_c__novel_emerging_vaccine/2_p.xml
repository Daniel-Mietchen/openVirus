<p>No mRNA vaccine as yet has been developed for TB. mRNA technology, however, is a potentially attractive vaccine strategy against TB in light of the platformâ€™s ability to induce potent T- and B-cell responses, including polyfunctional T-cell responses that home to the lungs, the ability of these vaccines to co-express multiple antigens, and the potential to deliver these vaccines via ID, IM, subcutaneous (SC), intranasal (IN), aerosol (AE) and intravenous (IV) routes, based on the formulations. Limitations to their use for TB include the non-persistent nature of antigen expression and the limited number of antigens that can be included in each vaccine. Ultimately, the identification of a set of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens that offer the possibility of effective protection would be needed to stimulate greater interest in applying mRNA vaccine technology to TB prevention efforts.
