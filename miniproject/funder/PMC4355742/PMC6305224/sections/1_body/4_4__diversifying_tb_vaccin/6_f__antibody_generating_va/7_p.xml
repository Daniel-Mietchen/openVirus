<p>Four hypotheses have emerged to explain the possible role of antibodies in contributing to the control of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection and TB disease. The first hypothesis involves restricting the extent of initial 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in and around the alveolus by blocking 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> physically, by inducing complement-mediated 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> killing, and by stimulating enhanced phagocytic activity against 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>. The second proposed mechanism involves balancing inflammation resulting from 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, mainly by redirecting pathologic innate immune activity in a way that reduces corresponding immunopathology. The third proposed mechanism involves regulation of granulomas, including prevention of granuloma formation (in light of the emerging theory that granulomas are used by 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> to more efficiently spread infection via attraction of susceptible macrophages) and the clearance of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cells. Finally, antibodies may enhance dendritic cell and T-cell antigen presentation and regulation, through signals sent by specific Fc glycosylation patterns.
