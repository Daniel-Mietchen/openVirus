<p>Advances in systems serology assays now permit qualified and validated approaches to assessing antibody qualities and functions. Studies of TB patients utilizing systems serology have discovered that qualitatively different TB-specific antibodies are induced and distinct innate immune recruiting profiles are manifest in persons with LTBI as compared to those with active TB disease

 </sup>. Antibodies play a key role in creating these differences, as antibodies expressed in persons with latent infection help stimulate innate immune responses by attracting dendritic cells to macrophages infected with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>, resulting in dendritic cell-mediated activation of innate immune responses. In particular, antibodies expressed in LTBI prepare the immune system to kill 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cells, a signal sent via glycosylation patterns on the Fc domain of antibody molecules that were naturally modified during 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection to access different innate immune functions
