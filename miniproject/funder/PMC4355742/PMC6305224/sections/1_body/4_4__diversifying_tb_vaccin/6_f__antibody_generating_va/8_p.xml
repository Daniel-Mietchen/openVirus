<p>Studies of antibody responses in LTBI populations, individuals who appear to be resistant to 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection despite ongoing exposure, and persons participating in TB vaccine trials or in experimental medicine studies, utilizing more aggressive serological sampling techniques such as plasmapheresis, will be critical to advance the understanding of the potential roles played by antibodies in controlling TB. Using this information to design vaccine strategies that stimulate both humoral and CMI responses effective in controlling TB represents an important new strategy in TB vaccine development.
