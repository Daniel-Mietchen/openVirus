<p>Experiments in mouse models of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection demonstrate that depleting B-cells decreases mouse survival following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure, while B-cell depletion followed by B-cell restoration returns survival to the degree observed in control mice, suggesting an important role for B-cell responses in controlling TB

 </sup>. Moreover, histopathological studies in 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected humans and NHPs demonstrate aggregates of B-cells proximal to pulmonary granulomas, with B-cell laden tertiary germinal centers surrounding the granulomas

 </sup>. Antibody-deficient mice also demonstrate a greater degree of viable 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> in both lungs and spleen, and a marked decrease survival after infection with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>

 </sup>. Passive transfer experiments with the monoclonal antibodies anti-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and anti-HspX (directed against the 16 kD protein on 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> outer membranes expressed during times of mycobacterial stress, including within granulomas) resulted in improved survival (with anti-LAM antibodies)

 </sup> and decreased lung 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> CFUs (with HspX antibodies)

 </sup> in mice following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge. These experiments provide additional evidence that antibodies limit 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Improved mouse survival also was seen following administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against the mycobacterial heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), with no effect on diminishing lung 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> CFUs but with a marked decrease in spleen 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> CFUs, suggesting an effect on decreasing 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> dissemination

 </sup>. Additionally, the particular isotype of antibody makes a major difference in the ability to control 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>, with IgA monoclonal antibodies having a larger effect than IgG1 antibodies
