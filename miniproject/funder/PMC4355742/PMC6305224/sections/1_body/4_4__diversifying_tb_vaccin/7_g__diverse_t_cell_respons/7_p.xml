<p>A critical question regarding the potential for targeting DURTs through vaccination is whether DURTs have memory. If they do, and if durable expansion and preferential recall responses to these novel ligands can be elicited through vaccination, then DURTs could be harnessed directly as a potentially powerful vaccination strategy. If they are not capable of developing an anamnestic response but, instead, function more as adjuvants, then DURTs could be manipulated to help facilitate the acquisition of adaptive immune responses to

Ultimately, it will be necessary to develop fit-for-purpose animal models, identify the appropriate immunogens, develop techniques to formulate the ligands and create relevant animal challenge models to explore the potential of harnessing DURTs as a vaccination strategy against TB.
