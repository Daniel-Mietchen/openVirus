<p>An important characteristic of a vaccine-stimulated immune response to 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> is the ability of T-cells to recognize an 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected cell via receptors that are highly conserved in humans. Most vaccines currently being developed do this through “classical” HLA-I or HLA-II restricted antigen presentation. Donor unrestricted T-cells (DURTS) represent different types of T-cells that interact with human antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells or macrophages, through mechanisms other than classical HLA-I or HLA-II restricted antigen presentation. Examples of restriction molecule ligands associated with DURTS include: CD1a, b, c molecules, which present lipid and glycolipid moieties and bind CD1-restricted T-cells, including Type I and Type II natural killer T-cells (NKT cells); MR1, which presents riboflavin metabolites and interacts with mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAITS); and HLA-E, a highly conserved receptor that recognizes a diverse array of peptide ligands, binds to HLA-E-restricted T-cells and helps to mediate natural killer-cell killing

 </sup>. Although our understanding of DURTS ligands is still relatively superficial given that this is a young field of investigation, the potential applicability to TB vaccine development is great given that virtually all of the types of antigens presented by these ligands can be found in 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>.
