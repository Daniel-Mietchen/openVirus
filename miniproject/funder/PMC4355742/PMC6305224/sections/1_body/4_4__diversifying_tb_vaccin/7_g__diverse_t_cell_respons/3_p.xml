<p>MR1-restricted responses are highly conserved in mammals and do not diverge across mammal species. MR-1 interacts with MAITS as sensors of the metabolome via riboflavin metabolites, but also through other, as-yet-unidentified molecules

 </sup>. In studies of patients with TB, a dramatic enrichment of MAITS was found in samples obtained from bronchoscopies as compared to peripheral blood, with selective enrichment of certain T-cell receptors (TCRs) identified in the bronchoscopically-obtained samples, suggesting antigenic discrimination. This finding led to the discovery of a novel class of MR1 ligands called photolumazines. Experiments with synthetic photolumazines suggest that there is immunological memory underlying MR1-mediated antigenic recognition that could be harnessed in a TB vaccine
