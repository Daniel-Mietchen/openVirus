<p>HLA-E restriction encompasses presentation of both peptidic and non-peptidic antigens, and initially was identified as an inhibitor of recognition between NK cells and T-cells. Subsequently, however, HLA-E-restricted T-cell clones have been found to manifest antimicrobial properties, including the inhibition of intracellular

 </sup>. This inhibition appears to be mediated both by generating cytolytic properties in the T-cells, and by inducing a cytokine profile from these T-cells that resemble a Th2 phenotype. Additionally, gamma-delta cells, specifically γ9δ2 cells, have been found to be expanded following vaccination with BCG
