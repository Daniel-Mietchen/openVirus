<p>While these findings have relevance to decision-making around initiating preventive drug therapy before the development of clinical disease, they also provide the opportunity to stratify individuals in clinical trials of vaccines. Using these techniques to identify and selectively enroll LTBI individuals who are at risk of developing TB in an efficacy trial of a vaccine to prevent TB disease could considerably reduce the numbers of study participants required, shorten the clinical trial duration and greatly reduce cost by several orders of magnitude, assuming that these signatures could be utilized at reasonable cost and speed.</p>
