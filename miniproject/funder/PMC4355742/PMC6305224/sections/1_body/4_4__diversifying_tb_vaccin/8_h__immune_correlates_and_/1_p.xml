<p>Biomarkers that can reliably and accurately predict clinical outcomes of diseases are invaluable to vaccine development efforts. Biosignatures, custom-made combinations of biomarkers, offer the potential to enhance the predictive power of a single biomarker. Principally, biosignatures can be useful both in selecting promising vaccine candidates for more advanced development, while rejecting those with a reduced probability of ultimate success. They also can be used to more finely tailor the selection of individuals being enrolled into clinical trials, thereby reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of such trials. Thus far, studies exploring blood, urine or breath of persons with asymptomatic
