<p>Important future directions in biosignature research relevant to TB vaccine development will be to identify signatures of vaccine efficacy and signatures of vaccine safety. While studies of BCG responses can lay the groundwork for this

 </sup>. This further emphasizes the need to continue to conduct clinical efficacy trials of TB vaccines, and to invest in the collection of biological specimens from the participants. Only through efforts such as this will unexpected findings be identified that potentially could result in a major acceleration of novel TB vaccine development.
