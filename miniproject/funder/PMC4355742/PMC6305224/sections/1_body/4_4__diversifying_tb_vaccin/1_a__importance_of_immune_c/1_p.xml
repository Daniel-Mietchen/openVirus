<p>Most advanced vaccine candidates share one important commonality: they were selected for development on the basis of their ability to induce interferon-gamma producing T-cells obtained from vaccinated animals and individuals upon 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> mycobacterial antigen stimulation. Very little evidence, however, is available to confirm the full scope of the critical immune responses necessary to control TB disease and 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, including the potential roles of CD8+ T cell responses, tissue resident memory T-cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT)-cells in the lungs and B cell activation. Studying these and other diverse immune responses generated by current and future vaccines likely will be critical to advancing TB vaccine development in a more efficient and effective manner
