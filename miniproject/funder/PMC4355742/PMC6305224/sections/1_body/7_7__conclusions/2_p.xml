 </sup>. Importantly, the criteria appear to be flexible enough to keep open many directions in TB vaccine research and avoiding the trap of focusing on the wrong strategic priorities. While the WHO is presenting different PPCs for TB vaccines targeting infants and adolescents/adults, respectively, it will be important to model the effect of using adult and infant vaccines together to end the TB epidemic.
