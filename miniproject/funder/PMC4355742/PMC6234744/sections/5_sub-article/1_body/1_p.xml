   <p>Introduction: RV infections can also be mild and asymptomatic.</p>

   <p>A good reference to the naming of 160 genotypes for your readers, is 
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.picornaviridae.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.picornavirade.com</ext-link>

   <p>The authors make mention of RV studies in nations being rare and that this study’s area has a tropical climate. ollow-up on these and putting the study findings into context in the discussion would be helpful</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Could the authors add some information about why they excluded infants younger than days and people with ARI symptoms for longer than 30 days?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The authors note that their genotyping process is “as previously described”. But it is quite different including not being nested RT-PCR (which can enhance sensitivity). Could they provide more detail – perhaps consider adding their method in complete detail to 
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.protocols.io/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.protocols.io/</ext-link> and referencing to that in this paper.

   <p>Could the authors better justify their choice to use a 35 Ct threshold for PCR Also–please check that the reference used is correct.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Did the evidence 300nt was detrimental to calling genotypes? For example, they use truncated longer amplicons and the outcome by BLAST to determine a real difference?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The authors might consider the term “species ” to describe the “varying dominance” between HRV species discussed around Figure 2.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Could the authors add a comment about circulation of RVs throughout the year and the role this might play, if it occurs, in ‘’ of the same or different RV</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Could the add some referenced to pre-existing knowledge where discussion comments have about (a) of heterotypic immunity to RVs and (b) virus interactions?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>In their summary, the authors imply that the patterns in genotypes and species exchange detected in the nine health facilities are the same as those in the community. How sure can they be that there is not a mild and asymptomatic non-presenting infections?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Could the authors expand on their 22.2% VP4/VP2 sequencing failure in the context of the comment about changed methods above?</p>
