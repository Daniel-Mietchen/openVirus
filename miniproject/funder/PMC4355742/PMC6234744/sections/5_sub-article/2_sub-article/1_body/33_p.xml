<p>We have also added references (Mackay 2008; Brunstein et al. 2008) in the Discussion section (page 14), which comments on virus interactions. Mackay's review of human rhinoviruses (Mackay 2008) indicates that virus interactions could be the cause of seasonal variation in the prevalence of any virus, whereby the high prevalence of one respiratory virus moderates or prevents processes that allow one or more other viruses to establish themselves in the host at the same time. The review also suggests that HRV partnership with host immunity can be mutual, incidentally giving the host an advantage by protecting against more cytopathic viral pathogens in the respiratory system while the host provides a vessel for HRV replication and transmission.</p>
