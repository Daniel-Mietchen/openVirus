<p>We provided an explanation for the 7day exclusion in response to question 3 by the first reviewer. We felt that the inclusion of this age group would not significantly increase cases (of all respiratory viruses) and hence considered the collection of a deep NPS could not be justified. Viral ARI are self-limiting, often lasting between 7-14 days (Pappas et al. 2008) for immune-competent individuals. For persistent ARI (&gt;14 days), the individual could be having other underlying chronic infections e.g. TB or immune compromised due HIV-AIDS or malignancy (Chu et al. 2016)(Piralla et al. 2015).</p>
