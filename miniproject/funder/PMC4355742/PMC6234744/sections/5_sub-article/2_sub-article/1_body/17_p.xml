<p>Thank you for pointing this out as the method was not a nested RT-PCR. We apologize for this oversight. The RT-PCR method used to amplify the VP4/VP2 genomic region was a modification of a previous protocol (Wisdom et al. 2009). Forward primer OS (CCGGCCCCTGAATGYGGCTAA) and reverse primer IAS (TCWGGHARYTTCCAMCACCANCC) were used in a RT-PCR reaction using Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit. Thermocycling conditions were set as follows:Â  Reverse transcription of the RNA to cDNA at 50 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 30 minutes, in-activation of reverse transcriptase and activation of Taq polymerase at 95 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 15 minutes. This was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 1 minute, annealing at 60 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 1 minute and strand extension at 72 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 1 min and final incubation/extension at 72 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 10 minutes. We have added text in the Laboratory procedures section to this effect.
