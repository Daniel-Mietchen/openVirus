<p>The reviewer is right, we might have missed the mild and asymptomatic non-presenting infections since we only sampled from patients who presented to health centers with symptoms of ARI. However, we believe our surveillance is representative of circulation of all HRV infections because (a) we have a representative spatial distribution of health facilities and (b) our study of the household where we collected samples irrespective of symptoms showedÂ  similar type distributions for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (Kamau et al. 2018) .</p>
