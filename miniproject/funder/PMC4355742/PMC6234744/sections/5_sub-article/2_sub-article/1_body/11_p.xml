<p>HRV in sub Saharan Africa is not well described although some studies on molecular epidemiology of HRV species among the populations have revealed substantial diversity of HRV types in this region (Lâ€™Huillier et al. 2015)(Milanoi et al. 2016). The present study not only identifies the HRV types in circulation but describes their spatial-temporal patterns in the community. These data provide added perspectives on the spread patterns of HRV types in a community.</p>
