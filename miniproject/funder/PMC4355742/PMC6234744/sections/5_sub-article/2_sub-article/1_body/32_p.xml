<p>Heterotypic immunity against HRV infections is generally weak and short-term (lasting between 5 weeks and 16 weeks)(Fleet et al. 1965, 1968; Stott et al. 1969) compared to strong homotypic immunity (~1 year)(Barclay et al. 1989). Although heterotypic immunity can be established it is not significant to protect an individual from other multiple HRV types (Stott et al. 1969). The duration of homotypic immunity may be enhanced by reinfection with other types due to non-specific boosting of titers of types to which individuals were previously exposed(Fleet et al. 1965). Our own recent study of household HRV infection revealed rapid heterotypic reinfection in younger individuals (e.g. the median time to reinfection in 1-10 year olds was 1month), with a decreasing rate in older individuals (Kamau et al. 2018) who presumably had past experience of more types and hence reduced susceptibility.</p>
