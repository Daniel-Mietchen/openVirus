<p>Indeed, shorter sequences were detrimental to calling genotypes, we had to set 300nt of the VP4/VP2 region as the minimum nucleotide size to call HRV types because, with reduction of nucleotide size a typed sequence tends to shift to other branches of genotype/type or fails to cluster with a reference sequence thus falling as untypable.</p>
