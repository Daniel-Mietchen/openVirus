<p>We are not certain of the reasons for the 22.7% failure (240 samples) in sequencing. Viral load was slightly lower for failed samples: the mean Ct value for sequenced versus failed samples was 29.7 (standard deviation 3.1, 817 samples) and 30.7 (standard deviation 3.2, 240 samples) respectively. Furthermore, we had 154/240 samples failed at the PCR stage, which could have resulted from mismatches in the primer binding sites or assay sensitivity given that we were using a single step rather than nested PCR.</p>
