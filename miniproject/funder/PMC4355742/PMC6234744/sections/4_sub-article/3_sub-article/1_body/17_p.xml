<p>There is potential for over-estimation of rhinovirus prevalence for the reason stated.HRV and other enteroviruses are closely related at the genetic level. However, we sequenced in the VP2/VP4 region 78% of the rhinovirus positives (817/1057), identifying only 3 non-rhinovirus enteroviruses. This suggests that the over-estimation of prevalence is small.</p>
