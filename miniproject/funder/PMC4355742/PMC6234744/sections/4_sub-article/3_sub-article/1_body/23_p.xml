<p>We are not entirely sure what the reviewer is requesting. What we can say is that the study used a sensitive real-time PCR for the detection of HRV. Further that the assay targeted the 5’ UTR which is genetically similar for both rhinoviruses and other enteroviruses. As a result, non-rhinovirus enteroviruses were detected. However, these were uncommon. Using primers that anneal to only the highly conserved region on the 5 ‘UTR of all the HRV species can provide the most sensitive assay for the detection of HRV strains</p>
