<p>As expected, there was a decrease in the detection of HRV cases with an increase in the age of the patients. The majority of the HRV positive patients were children below the age of 5 years (63.95%) and a statistically significant decrease in HRV positives amongst older ages was observed. The consistent finding of high proportions of HRV infections in children below the age of 5 years reiterates the need to focus control strategies to this age group since they are the most vulnerable, and presumably make the greatest contribution to community transmission. The low rates of detection of HRV types in adults may reflect the gradual development of type-specific immunity due to increased exposure throughout life.</p>
