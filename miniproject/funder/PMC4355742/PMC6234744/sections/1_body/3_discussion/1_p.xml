<p>This study investigated the HRV infection, diversity and type distribution in individuals presenting with ARI symptoms for outpatient care at nine spatially structured health facilities in rural coastal Kenya over 12 months period. All three HRV species co-circulated, with HRV-A and HRV-C co-predominant. This observation agrees with a previous study conducted in rural coastal Kenya

 </sup>. Remarkably, a total of 87 HRV types were identified in circulation over the twelve months, representing 51.7% of all known HRV types. Occurrence of HRV throughout the year appears to be sustained by the existence of simultaneous and successive mini-epidemics each caused by a different HRV type introduced into the community independently. We assume each HRV type generates strong and lasting homotypic immunity, that leads to type-specific herd immunity and subsequent fadeout. This observation could be attributed to the natural ability of each type to independently cause an infection with limited cross-immunity with other types
