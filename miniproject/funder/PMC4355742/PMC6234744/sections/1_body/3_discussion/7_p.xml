<p>Although the study has strength in its structured design and its implementation, it faced a number of limitations. First, there was low patient recruitment in the initial study months (December 2015 and January 2016) due to clinic closure on public holidays or people migrating to other areas of the country during festive season. This may have contributed to the lower observed HRV prevalence compared to the other months of study. Second, we failed to sequence the VP4/VP2 coding region for 22.2% of HRV positives samples, possibly due to low virus titers in the nasopharyngeal samples inferred from high Ct values (Ct value&gt;33) in these samples. Third, since a maximum sample number per clinic was fixed, changes in prevalence of one virus, for example during a seasonal peak of coronavirus, would lead to fewer samples testing positive for other viruses. Hence there would be lack of independence of numbers of each virus type, or even between HRV types, over time, affecting temporal patterns of absolute numbers. However, the prevalence of each virus or virus type at any timepoint will reflect that circulating in the community.</p>
