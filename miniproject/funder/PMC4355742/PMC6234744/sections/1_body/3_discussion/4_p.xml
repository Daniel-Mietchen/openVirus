<p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed close genetic association between sequences from different health facilities, with high intra-type genetic identities between the sequences from different health facilities (87 -100%). In some cases, the identical HRV-types were circulating simultaneously in different geographical regions separated by a distance as far as 30 km apart. Supported by the low genetic variation in the VP4/VP2 coding sequences and the concurrent distribution between these identical HRV-types it is probable that there is a rapid spread of HRV-types within the KHDSS once introduced and or many introductions of the same type into different areas of the KHDSS.</p>
