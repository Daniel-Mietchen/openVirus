<p>We ascribed (above) the observation of multiple mini-epidemics in this community, each caused by a different HRV type, to the generation of homotypic herd immunity. If there was stronger heterotypic immunity, we would expect fewer HRV cases, and even periodic HRV fadeout. With strong homotypic and weak heterotypic immunity, we therefore expect newly introduced HRV types to spread unconstrained by pre-existing heterotypic immunity in the population. The differences in circulation periods observed among HRV-types could be as a result of stochastic differences in frequency of introduction and onward transmission of the HRV types, or variation in type-specific immunity. Similar observation has been reported in 
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> where simultaneous and successive epidemics caused by different HRV types contributed to HRV high incidence and enabled HRV to remain in the local population for extended periods. In some cases, type-specific epidemics were served with different variants of the same HRV type probably as a result of separate introductions into the community at different times over the year. Moreover, comparing the HRV incidence with other respiratory viruses, as shown in the preceding study 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 </sup>, HRV tend to peak in the second half of the year as other respiratory viruses report low incidence during this period. An explanation for this observation could be a case of virus interactions 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
 </sup> that whatever triggers (either environment or biological) high incidence in HRV in the 3 
 <sup>rd</sup> quarter of the year, causes low incidence in the other viruses. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether virus interaction affects incidence and transmission of individual viruses in the population.
