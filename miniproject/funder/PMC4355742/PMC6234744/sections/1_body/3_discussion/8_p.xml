<p>In summary, we observed co-circulation of the three HRV species in all nine health facilities scattered in the KHDSS area of coastal Kenya, and combined we documented the circulation of a majority of all known HRV types to date (87/165) within a single year period in this small geographical area. Some of the HRVâ€“types circulated in the KHDSS population close to all months of observation (10/12) suggesting marked local persistence of some types while others appeared and faded from circulation quite rapidly possibly due to low herd homologous immunity for the former and stronger herd homologous immunity in the latter. HRV transmission in the community is enhanced in people living close to one another and between areas linked by road network. Our study reports a substantial HRV burden among patients seeking outpatient care in this low-income setting of tropical Africa and a differential prevalence of the HRV species and types with significant differences in their local spatial-temporal distribution.</p>
