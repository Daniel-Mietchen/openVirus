  <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
 </sup>. Their genome occurs as a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 7.2 kb flanked by a 5’ untranslated region (UTR) and 3’ poly-A tail. There are three HRV species denoted as HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C within which over 168 genetically distinct types have been identified 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 </sup>. Identification of these types presently relies on molecular typing methods based on sequence analysis of VP1 or VP4/VP2 proteins encoding regions
