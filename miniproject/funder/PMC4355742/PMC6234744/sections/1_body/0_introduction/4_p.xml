<p>Hence it might be hypothesized that at the population level the virus types spread in a manner independent of each other. However, the statistical evidence to support this assertion has yet to be undertaken. This would require spatially structured study designs to capture temporal-spatial HRV transmission. Data of this sort could improve understanding on the nature of spread of these viruses at the population level in relation to homotypic and heterotypic immunity.</p>
