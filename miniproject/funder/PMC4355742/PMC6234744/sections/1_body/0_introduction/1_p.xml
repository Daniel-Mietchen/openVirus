<p>Human rhinovirus (HRV) is the predominant cause of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) referred to as the common cold

 </sup>. The virus has also been associated with lower respiratory tract illnesses, including exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

 </sup>. HRVs have also been identified in mild and asymptomatic cases

 </sup>. HRV is globally ubiquitous and infections usually occur all year-round, although peaking in the early autumn and late spring in many temperate or subtropical countries, and in the rainy season in tropical countries

  <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
 </sup>. Despite most HRV infections being mild, they pose a considerable social and economic burden due to time lost from work or school, medical attendance and reduced performance of regular duties
