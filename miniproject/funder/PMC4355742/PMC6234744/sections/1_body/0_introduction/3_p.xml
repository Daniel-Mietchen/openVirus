<p>Studies investigating the transmission of HRV show that multiple infections frequently occur in individuals over short periods of time of the order of a few weeks

 </sup>. In household studies, family members experience rapid rates of reinfection (for instance, up to 5 infections in adults or 12 infections in young children per year) where each infection tends to be caused by a different HRV-type and rarely with the same HRV-type

 </sup>. Moreover, studies have shown that individuals develop relatively long-lasting (~ 1 year) type-specific neutralizing antibodies (IgG and IgA) against a specific infecting HRV-type but susceptibility to other different HRV types remains and infection will occur as so long as there is an exposure
