<p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed 3 major clades representing the HRV-A, B and C species ( 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="SF1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Three samples were not assigned to any HRV type and these were identified as Enterovirus D68 (n=2) and Coxsackievirus B5 (n=1, see offshoot in 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="SF1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). A total of 87 different HRV types were identified: 39 within species HRV-A, 10 within HRV-B and 38 within HRV- C. Within HRV-A, A15 was the predominant type (n=62), followed by A58 (n=36) and A41 (n=20). Other HRV-A types occurred at lower frequencies, ranging from 1 to 19 cases (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1 panel B</xref>). Within HRV-C, C22 type was the predominant type (n=48), followed closely by C11 (n=45) and C38 (n=35). The other HRV-C types were detected as shown in
