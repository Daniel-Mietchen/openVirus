<p>In addition to clustering of individual type occurrence at the health facilities we also found evidence of greater similarity in HRV type distribution between the health facilities located near the road network in central Kilifi area (Chasimba, Jaribuni, Mavueni, Mtondia, Ngerenya, Sokoke) compared to the health facilities off the main road in the south of the KHDSS area (Junju, Pingilikani) and further north up the main highway (Matsangoni) ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). We measured the pairwise similarity of the type distribution at each health facility as the total absolute differences in their type occurrences shifted by the data median and rescaled by the median absolute distance from median (i.e. the rescaled Manhattan metric recommended for high dimensional data sets

 </sup>). We used the Orange implementation of MDS (see methods) to optimally represent the type distribution similarities on a plane along with a similarity network ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). The similarity network distinguishes between the type distributions of health facilities in the central part of Kilifi area on the road network, in particular the central similarity clique (Mtondia, Ngerenya, Sokoke), and the type distribution observed on the outskirts and harder to travel to parts of the Kilifi area. The MDS representation condenses and quantifies the information derived by direct visual comparison of the type distributions (
