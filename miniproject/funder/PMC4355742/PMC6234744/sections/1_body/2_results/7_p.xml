<p>Notably, the health facility of sample collection was not included amongst the predictor variables for our classification analysis of HRV positive samples. However, this does not exclude the possibility of correlations in the types collected between different regions. Most sequences typed as belonging to the same HRV type were from different regions (represented by different health facilities) of the KHDSS and some were detected in several months. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, closely related HRV-A15, C11, C22, C28 types were present in all 9 regions of KHDSS, and A66, B35, C14 and C44 types detected in 8 different regions. In other cases, identical HRV- types were shared in the different geographical regions ranging from 1 to 7 geographical regions. Nonetheless, the contingency table of type collected at each health facility ( 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="ST4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="SF2">Supplementary File 1</xref>) reveals highly significant evidence to reject independence of type occurrence at each health facility (G statistic = 849.7, dof = 704, P = 1.25Ã—10 
 <sup>-4</sup>) in favour of clustering of type occurrence by health facility.
