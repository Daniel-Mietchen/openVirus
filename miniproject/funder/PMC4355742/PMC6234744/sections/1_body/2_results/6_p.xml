<p>Regression analysis showed that the month of sample collection and age of participant were the most informative predictors for determining whether an individual tested positive for any HRV type. These predictors were identified whether undetermined samples were used in the regression analysis or not. Other factors considered were gender and health facility. First, five standard classification models (logistic regression, neural network using logistic activation functions and one hidden layer, k-nearest neighbor classification, tree and random forest regression) were compared using random partitions of the data into 2/3 training set, 1/3 testing set. Over 100-fold repetitions of training and testing each model, both logistic regression and the neural network classifiers had 77.2% classification accuracy (this increased to 81.0% and 80.9% respectively if undetermined samples were removed from the data set). Other classification models were less successful and because logistic regression is easier to interpret, and likelihood-based, we chose to continue our analysis using only logistic regression. Second, we removed uninformative predictor variables by comparing Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each additive combination of predictor variables and selecting the logistic regression model with lowest AIC. Whether undetermined samples were included in the regression analysis or not, in either case the lowest (i.e. best) AIC model included only month of sample collection and the age of the sample participant as predictors (

The most informative models implied that the odds ratio of the participants being detected HRV positive declined by 0.1â€“0.2% per month of life, and that collection in August to October increased the odds ratio of finding HRV positives (
