  <title>Type distribution similarity between health facilities in Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS).</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold>: Road map of KHDSS showing main highway (purple line), local roads (brown lines) and health facilities (red dots). 
   <bold>B</bold>: Multidimensional scaling of the type distribution at each health facility along with pairwise similarity matrix. 
   <bold>C</bold>: The type distribution at each health facility represented as a mosaic plot. The colors follow types in species human rhinovirus (HRV)-A (red, orange, yellow, green), HRV-B (light blue), and HRV-C (blue, dark blue, purple, red). Band widths are proportional to the number of each type sampled at the health facility.
