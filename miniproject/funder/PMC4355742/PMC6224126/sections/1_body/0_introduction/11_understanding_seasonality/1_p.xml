<p>Seasonality is an inherent feature of ecological systems, and seasonal incidence is a feature of both acute and chronic infectious diseases (Tables

 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). It is, therefore, important to conceptualize the epidemic calendar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007327.g001">Fig 1</xref>) from the lens of "everything is seasonal." The utility of this lens is that it forces us to carefully consider mechanisms behind disease seasonality, thus preventing what could, in some cases, be the misleading establishment of correlative relationships between seasonal phenomena and infectious disease incidence. Focused attention on building theory that will provide a deeper understanding of seasonal mechanisms and learning how to identify imprints of seasonal drivers in disease data could bring rapid advancement to the field of disease seasonality. In general, if "everything is seasonal," then everything will covary (usually with some phase shifts). Therefore, seasonal covariance alone is not useful for establishing seasonal drivers. Instead, long-term parallel data of potential seasonal drivers and disease incidence should be confronted with mechanistic transmission models. There is evidence to suggest that the information contained in interannual variation and anomalous years holds a key to establishing causal inference of seasonal forcing [
