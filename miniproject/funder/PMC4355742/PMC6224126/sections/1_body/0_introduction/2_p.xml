<p>Seasonal variation in infectious disease transmission plays an important role in determining when epidemics happen; however, it is not the sole determinant. For instance, some infectious diseases with known seasonal transmission, such as pertussis and measles, can display multi-annual outbreaks, meaning their epidemics occur in multi-year intervals, such as every two or four years, rather than annually. This is because the timing of these epidemics is determined by a combination of (i) seasonal transmission and (ii) different processes shaping the number of susceptible individuals in the population, a sufficient number of which is a prerequisite for an outbreak.</p>
