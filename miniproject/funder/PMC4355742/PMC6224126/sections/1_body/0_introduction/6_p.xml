<p>In the broadest sense, seasonal drivers can be separated into four categories: (1) environmental factors, (2) host behavior, (3) host phenology, and (4) exogenous biotic factors. These seasonal drivers may enter into disease transmission dynamics by way of hosts, reservoirs, and/or vectors. In surveying the literature to gauge the breadth of seasonal drivers acting upon human infectious disease systems (Tables 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>), specific seasonal drivers were found to include (a) vector seasonality, (b) seasonality in nonhuman animal host (i.e., livestock, other domestic animals, or wildlife), (c) seasonal climate (e.g., temperature, precipitation, etc.), (d) seasonal nonclimatic abiotic environment (e.g., water salinity), (e) seasonal co-infection, (f) seasonal exposure and/or behavior and/or contact rate, (g) seasonal biotic environment (e.g., algal density in waterbodies), and (h) seasonal flare-ups/symptoms and/or remission/latency.
