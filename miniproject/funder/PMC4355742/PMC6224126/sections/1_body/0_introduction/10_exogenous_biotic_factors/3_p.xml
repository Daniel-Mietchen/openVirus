<p>Outside of the host, community ecology becomes particularly relevant for disease transmission in multi-host systems, such as Lyme disease [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Community ecology is particularly important when there is heterogeneity in host and/or vector competence in a multi-species disease system. This is because the abundance of competent hosts and/or vectors can determine the transmissibility and maintenance of infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Each host and/or vector in a vector-borne or multi-host disease system has its own set of ecological interactions (e.g., competitive, commensal, parasitic, etc.) that can indirectly affect the disease of interest. The phenology of hosts, reservoirs, and vectors will give rise to seasonal changes in ecological community composition. Taken together, parasiteâ€“parasite interactions within hosts and ecological interactions outside hosts undoubtedly display seasonality, as do nearly all aspects of ecology, and this can influence the dynamics of diseases of public interest.
