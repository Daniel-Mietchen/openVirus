<p>During some co-infections, parasite–parasite interactions can occur directly or be mediated via the host immune system, when parasite species impact each other's population dynamics indirectly via their effect on the host immune system. Parasite–parasite interactions can result in parasite fitness being elevated (i.e., facilitation) or dampened (e.g., competition) [
