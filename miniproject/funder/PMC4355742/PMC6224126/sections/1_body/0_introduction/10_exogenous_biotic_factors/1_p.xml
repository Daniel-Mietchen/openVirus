<p>In addition to abiotic, behavioral, and phenological features of host–parasite systems, hosts and their parasites are embedded within ecological communities that have additional seasonal aspects. We can refer to biotic factors driven by ecological communities as exogenous biotic factors because they are exogenous to any given host–parasite dyad, host–vector–parasite triad, or multi-host system. Exogenous biotic factors include (1) interactions that take place within hosts—specifically parasite–parasite interactions—and (2) interactions within the ecological community of hosts, reservoirs, and vectors.</p>
