<p>In order to explore documented seasonal cycles in human infections, the websites of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control were searched to compile a list of 60+ communicable diseases of public health interest. Careful attention was paid to include neglected tropical diseases that may be underrepresented in disease notification systems. For each infection, online WHO disease information pages were used to determine whether the disease is acute or chronic. When the nature of the infection could not be established from the WHO disease information page, this information was gathered from online CDC disease factsheets. Google scholar was then used to systematically search for information regarding disease seasonality. For each of the diseases, a search was conducted using "[disease name] AND season." When needed, I also added "AND human" to the search term for zoonotic diseases. When searches needed to be more specific, a search for "[disease name] AND seasonality" was conducted. Most diseases had very few papers that specifically focused on seasonality (based on their titles and abstracts); the most relevant paper(s) presented in top search results were used in Tables 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The method employed here was meant to provide a broad overview of many infections as opposed to detailed information regarding any individual infection. A short description of the seasonality and hypothesized seasonal drivers were then summarized in Tables

 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>.
