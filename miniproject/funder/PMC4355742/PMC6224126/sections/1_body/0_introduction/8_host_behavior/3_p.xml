<p>For example, wildlife may be a useful study system for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Unlike humans, who might have moderate fluctuations in sexual contacts throughout the year [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], in some mammal species, there is a complete absence of sexual contact (and thus transmission) outside of the breeding season. I propose that isolation in time, such as this, is a much more extreme form of seasonal forcing than seen in human infectious disease systems. Isolation in time could also occur for parasites with other transmission modes, in addition to STIs. Although it is an unexplored area of research, the study of isolation in time may reveal pathogen metapopulation structure and parasite adaptations for surviving through transmission troughs. Discrete windows of transmission are likely to have evolutionary consequences for parasite life history. Cattadori and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] pointed out that, when transmission is restricted to a short seasonal window, natural selection will favor parasites with "long-lived infective stages." I further speculate that transmission isolated in time will have dynamical consequences that make these disease systems unique from those with more continuous transmission cycles.
