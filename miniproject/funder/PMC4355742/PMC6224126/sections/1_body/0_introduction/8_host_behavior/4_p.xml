<p>Sexual contact is not the only transmission-risk–elevating behavior that can display seasonality. Seasonal engagement in risk-taking behavior may occur in other disease contexts, including for infections transmitted during bouts of fighting. For example, the transmission of facial tumor disease among Tasmanian devils—which is caused by an infectious cancer—is facilitated by aggressive behavior. During a fight, the cancer cells from a facial tumor of an infected devil can be transferred into the wounds and mouth of a susceptible devil, resulting in infection. The Tasmanian devil contact network varies between the mating and nonmating seasons, and this could influence the transmission of this infectious cancer [

Although mating and aggression can elevate disease risk, it is important to acknowledge that some behaviors can also mitigate disease risk. In wildlife, disease mitigation behaviors include grooming to remove ectoparasites (as observed in birds and primates) and self-medication (as observed in primates, birds, and monarch butterflies) [
