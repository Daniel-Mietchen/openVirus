<p>Transmission seasonality is sometimes due to seasonal host behavior, specifically fluctuations in transmission-relevant host contact rates throughout the year. Seasonal host behavior not only includes seasonal behavior and/or exposure and/or contact rates in humans but also seasonality in nonhuman animal hosts (i.e., livestock, other domestic animals, or wildlife). The most well-known example of seasonal contact rates in humans is the aggregation of children in schools during school terms that results in elevated transmission of measles (e.g., [

For zoonotic diseases, however, it is contact with wildlife or livestock that can drive seasonal transmission, such as with anthrax, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, echinococcosis, and others (Tables
