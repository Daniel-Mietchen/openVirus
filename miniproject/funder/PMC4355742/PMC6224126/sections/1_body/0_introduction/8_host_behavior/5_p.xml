<p>As previously noted, mobility patterns are an aspect of host behavior that can also seasonally structure disease risk via the geographic localization of hosts. In humans, the most notable example is the movement of people in and out of cities. In Niger, for instance, the resulting changes in population density from migration is believed to be the primary driver of measles transmission seasonality [
