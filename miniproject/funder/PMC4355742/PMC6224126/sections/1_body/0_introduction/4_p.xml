<p>Here, I aim to motivate future studies of disease seasonality by drawing attention to the importance of seasonality in public health, medicine, and biology. I will explore documented seasonal cycles in human infections, including notifiable and neglected tropical diseases. I also aim to present a holistic view of hypothesized drivers of seasonality for each disease, with the caveat that, for the majority of infections, the current state of the science is insufficient to draw conclusions about seasonal timing, seasonal magnitude, and geographic variation in incidence. Although published data regarding disease seasonality are limited for individual diseases, collectively the body of work on disease seasonality is vast and reveals that infections—which may differ enormously in their pathology and/or ecology—coalesce via underlying seasonal drivers.</p>
