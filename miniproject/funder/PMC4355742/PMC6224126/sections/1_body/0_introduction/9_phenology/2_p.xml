<p>Each of the seven mechanisms of action could leave a unique imprint in long-term incidence data, as proposed in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. These mechanisms and their drivers, therefore, would have different consequences for disease dynamics. Using models, such as that schematized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007327.g001">Fig 1</xref>, statistical inference and simulation studies could be conducted to identify the dynamical effects of various seasonal mechanisms acting in isolation and/or in combination. Simulation studies could provide a foundation for determining the types of data required for distinguishing among seasonal mechanisms and/or drivers and how factors such as resonance can influence the ability to detect seasonal drivers. For example, Martinez-Bakker and colleagues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] used a simulation study to demonstrate the demographic and transmission regimes under which human birth seasonality is expected to have a meaningful impact on measles incidence in the face of strong seasonal forcing from transmission during school terms.
