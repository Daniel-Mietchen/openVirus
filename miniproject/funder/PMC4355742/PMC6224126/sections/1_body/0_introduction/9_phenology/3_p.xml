<p>This challenge of identifying seasonal drivers and their mechanisms of action becomes greater when considering chronic infections, vector-borne diseases, and parasites with complex life histories and phenology of their own. In reviewing seasonal drivers of human disease systems for Tables

 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>, human phenology seemed to be particularly relevant for diseases that have seasonal flare-ups/symptoms and/or remission/latency; this includes some chronic infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and yaws, along with Meningococcal disease, which is acute (Tables

Although the study of human phenology is a relatively new research area, phenology of vectors and nonhuman animals is well studied and could be the most common cause of vector seasonality and seasonality in nonhuman animal hosts, which impact diseases such as Zika (
