<p>Mechanistic transmission models have long been used to research the population biology and dynamics of mosquito‐borne pathogens. In this context, transmission potential can be defined through the basic reproduction number (R0)—the expected number of new cases generated by a single infection in a completely susceptible population—of which the classic mosquito‐borne example is the Ross‐Macdonald formulation applied to malaria (MacDonald, 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1957</xref>). Generally, the R0 of a mosquito‐borne pathogen involves a complex interplay between multiple host, viral and entomological factors. Since many of these are difficult to parameterize, simplifications are often implemented, and a multitude of R0‐based approaches of measuring the key components of transmission by mosquitoes exists in the literature (Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). One of the most widely used is the concept of vectorial capacity (VC), which stems from solely considering R0′s entomological factors (Brady et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). VC, also termed the daily reproduction number, is the expected number of infective mosquito bites that would result from all potentially biting mosquitoes of a single infectious host during 1 day. VC has contributed immensely to the theory of malaria elimination programmes (Brady et al.,

 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Furthermore, VC has recently been parameterized with the aforementioned mathematical climate–trait relationships from empirical studies, and has been successfully applied to derive new transmission potential measures for emerging mosquito‐borne viruses, such as DENV (Brady et al.,
