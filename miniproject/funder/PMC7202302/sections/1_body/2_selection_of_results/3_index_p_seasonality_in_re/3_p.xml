<p>For each year and city, the week with highest suitability is identified across all estimated index P solutions (
 <italic>simulations</italic>, of which the mean and 95% CI is in Figures 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e,f). As seen in Figures 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b, the two cities vary in their detected peak weeks. In Recife, suitability tends to peak between March and May (regional autumn), with the occasional occurrence of higher suitability in June (in particular in the years 2012 and 2013). In contrast, suitability peaks earlier in São Paulo, between late December and early February (regional summer).
