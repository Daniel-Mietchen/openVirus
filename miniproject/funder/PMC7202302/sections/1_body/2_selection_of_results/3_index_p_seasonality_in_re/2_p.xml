<p>We next present two visual outputs from MVSE, comparing some of the seasonal differences in the estimated index P between Recife and São Paulo (for a more complete set of possible outputs see S1_Text). Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the timing of highest index P and sensitivity of P to each of the climatic variables. For visual convenience, we restrict MVSE's output to the period of 4 years, between 2010 and 2013.
