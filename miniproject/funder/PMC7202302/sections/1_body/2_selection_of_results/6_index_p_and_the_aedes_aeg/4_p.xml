<p>At the country level, we estimated index P in time and space using the same approach as we used for Brazil (Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and South America (S2 Text). The spatial dimension (Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> a1) revealed a year‐round low index P in regions with high elevation, known to present the lowest DENV and CHIKV incidence in the country (Zambrano et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We found numerous similarities to previously published AaS maps of Honduras (Thézé et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). For instance, the index P presented widespread low suitability in January and high suitability in June, while northern and eastern regions had year‐round higher P compared to the rest of the country in the same months. We also found the geopixel representative of the location of San Pedro Sula to present an unusually high index P in January compared to nearby locations (seen in the inset square of Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> a1, with 
 <math id="nlm-math-43">
  <mrow>
   <mi>P</mi>
   <mo>≈</mo>
   <mn>1.15</mn>
  </mrow>
 </math> for the city, vs. 
 <math id="nlm-math-44">
  <mrow>
   <mi>P</mi>
   <mo>≈</mo>
   <mn>0.70</mn>
  </mrow>
 </math> elsewhere). Critically, this was also observed for the same geopixel when estimating AaS, which has helped Thézé and colleagues explain why the first ZIKV epidemic in Honduras peaked in January in San Pedro Sula, and in June in Tegucigalpa (Thézé et al., 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). To compare the index P directly to the monthly AaS estimation at the country level, we averaged the index P in space per month (e.g. for January, P was the mean of the values presented in the map of Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a1). The resulting Honduras index P was highly correlated with the AaS estimated in a similar manner (Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> a2).
