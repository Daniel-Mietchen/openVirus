<p>Overall, both at the country and city levels, the two suitability measures were highly correlated, and performed similarly in regards to the temporal patterns of three vector‐borne viruses. Given that the index P ignores precipitation, vegetation levels, urbanization levels and mosquito geo‐occurrence, it performed remarkably well. Furthermore, the index P can be estimated at a higher temporal resolution, allowing it to be analysed at the original weekly scale of the incidence time series (presented in Figure S8 in S1 Text with a Pearson's correlation of 0.9).</p>
