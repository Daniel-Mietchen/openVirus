<p>Notifications were originally per month, for every year over the period 2007–2012 (see 
 <xref rid="mee313205-sec-0019" ref-type="sec">Data accessibility3</xref> for details). We estimated index P per day in the period 2007–2012, and then calculated mean P for each of the 12 months across those years. We also calculated the mean of dengue notified cases for each of the 12 months across those years. By averaging across 5 years, we aimed at quantifying suitability into what can be termed a 
 <italic>typical year</italic> that is the expected average monthly suitability of each city in any year.
