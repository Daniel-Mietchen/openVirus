 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we characterized the index P for the cities of Recife and São Paulo. We use climate data from 2007 to 2012 for these and 13 other cities in Brazil, and present the correlation between the estimated suitability and notified dengue cases. Access to adequate climatic data restricted the number of cities we could explore, but with this small set of cities we aimed at presenting examples along the coastal line of Brazil, which present interesting geographical and temporal variation in suitability (shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
