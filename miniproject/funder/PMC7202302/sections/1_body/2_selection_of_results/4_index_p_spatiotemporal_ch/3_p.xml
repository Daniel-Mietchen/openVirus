<p>The estimated mean suitability presents high variation across Brazil (Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> a). As expected, the southern regions present the lowest transmission potential (colder colours, 
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.6), while the highest potential is estimated in the centre and along the northern coast (warmer colours, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 1.0). The elevated regions of the country, running in parallel to the eastern coast, present a pattern of intermediate suitability (
