<p>In the previous figures, we demonstrated how the index P can be used to compare transmission potential and timing between two Brazilian cities. In this section, we demonstrate the usefulness of index P to characterize the transmission potential across vast geographical ranges, using Brazil as a case study. We use the WorldClim V2 dataset, which holds mean world‐wide climatic data per month, during 1970–2000 (see 
 <xref rid="mee313205-sec-0019" ref-type="sec">Data accessibility3</xref> for details). Our analysis is performed over a regular grid of Brazil, in which each pixel represents an area of 
 <math id="nlm-math-35">
  <mrow>
   <mo>≈</mo>
   <mn>340</mn>
   <msup>
    <mrow>
     <mtext>km</mtext>
    </mrow>
    <mn>2</mn>
   </msup>
  </mrow>
 </math>. For each pixel, we use 12 time points (months) of humidity and temperature to run MVSE and estimate the dynamics of index P over 1 year. Although computationally intensive, due to the size of the grid, this exercise only employs functions available in MVSE. For further details on the data, and outputs of a similar exercise over the entire South American continent, see S2 Text. Figure
