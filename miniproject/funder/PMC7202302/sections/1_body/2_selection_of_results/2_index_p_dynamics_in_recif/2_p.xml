<p>We first present a comparison of the estimated index P per day in two major urban centres—Recife and São Paulo (Brazil)—for the time period between 2005 and 2016. Recife is located in the state of Pernambuco in the north‐east of Brazil with a tropical savanna climate, while São Paulo is located in the south with a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification (Peel, Finlayson, &amp; McMahon, 
 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). The two cities are known to have contrasting epidemic and endemic histories for mosquito‐borne viruses. For instance, Recife has experienced a large ZIKV epidemic and is known to be endemic to DENV and CHIKV (de Araújo et al.,

 <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In contrast, São Paulo is yet to experience a sustained ZIKV epidemic, DENV incidence is known to be low for the national average (Teixeira, Siqueira, Ferreira, Bricks, &amp; Joint,
