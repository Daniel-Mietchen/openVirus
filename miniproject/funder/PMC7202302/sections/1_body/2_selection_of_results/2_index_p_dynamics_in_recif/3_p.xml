<p>The input (climate time series, user‐defined priors) and index P output for the two cities is summarized in Figure 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (for a more complete set of possible outputs see S1 Text). Here, for simplicity, and for a lack of evidence of significant differences between the two cities, we assume all informed priors to be the same (Figures 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b,d). As expected, differences can be seen in the local climatic trends, with São Paulo showing, for instance, lower temperatures compared to Recife (Figures 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,c). Figures 
 <xref rid="mee313205-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e,f show the estimated index P for the two cities, which present significantly different dynamics. For instance, the mean index P in Recife is estimated to be 1.5‐fold higher than in São Paulo (1.26 vs. 0.84). Seasonality is also different, with Recife showing less pronounced oscillations and with mean P generally maintained above 1 (i.e. one female mosquito per human would necessarily be enough for transmission, equation 1). In contrast, São Paulo shows pronounced oscillations, with P presenting substantial troughs.
