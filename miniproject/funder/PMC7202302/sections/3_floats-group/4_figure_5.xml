The inset square presents a close‐up of the region of San Pedro Sula, in which the centre geopixel is the city exhibiting high index P values relative to its surroundings. (a2) Typical year index P (red) and 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> suitability score (AaS, blue) per month at the country level with Pearson's correlation of 0.89. Index P at each month is the mean across all geopixels (e.g. maps in (a1)). AaS is the score of Figure

   <xref rid="mee313205-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). (b) Typical year index P (red) AaS (blue) per month at the city level with Pearson's correlation of 0.865. Index P at each month is the mean of P at each month between 2005 and 2013 when using temperature and humidity per day from a local weather station (shown in Figure S8 in S1 Text). AaS is the score of Figure

   <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">DENV</styled-content>) incidence per month (green, for 2015). (c3) Same P and AaS as in (b), and chikungunya virus (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">CHIKV</styled-content>) incidence per month (magenta, for 2015). (c1–c3) Pearson's correlation for each pair of suitability measure vs incidence is presented within each subplot. In the legend of Pearson's correlation, M refers to AaS. (b‐c3)All variables are normalized to 0–1 by their maximum value for visualization purposes. Incidence variables are log10 before being normalized
