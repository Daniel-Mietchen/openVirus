Each pixel is coloured according to that month, with the colour scale represented in a circle. (c) Same as (a), but presenting the mean for selected months. In all maps, priors were assumed to be the same per pixel, as used for Recife and São Paulo. See Supplementary Information S2 Text for prior distributions. These solutions are made available as Supplementary Files
