 <p>A chikungunya epidemic recently occurred in Mandera, Northern Kenya, with over 1,700 cases reported. The disease epidemics are linked to the urban vector, 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. This mosquito species is rapidly expanding its range and it is currently abundant in and around the major urban cities of Kenya. In this study, we demonstrated the ability of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> from three distinct cities of Kenya to transmit chikungunya virus (CHIKV) under laboratory conditions. Our findings showed that populations of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> from Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nairobi were competent vectors for CHIKV. Overall, about 60% of the 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> that ingested â‰¥10
  <sup>6.9</sup> plaque-forming units of virus/ml became infected and about 10% of the virus-exposed mosquitoes transmitted virus to a capillary tube. Vector competence remains a prerequisite in disease risk assessment, while surveillance and control of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> should remain the main focus in many disease control programs and should be performed routinely.
