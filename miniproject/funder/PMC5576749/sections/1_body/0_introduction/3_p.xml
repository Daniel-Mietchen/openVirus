<p>Chikungunya has been reported in Mombasa city but so far has not been documented in Kisumu and Nairobi, although the presence and abundance of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> can differ greatly for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005860.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we hypothesized that the differences in the histories of chikungunya outbreaks in various areas in Kenya might be explained by the relative vector competence of these populations. Therefore, we tested populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> collected in Kilifi on the Coastal region near Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kisumu for their relative ability to transmit CHIKV.
