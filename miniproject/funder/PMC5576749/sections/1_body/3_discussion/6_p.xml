<p>In conclusion, although all three populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were competent laboratory vectors for CHIKV, the Mombasa population appeared to be slightly more competent than the population from Kisumu and Nairobi. Findings from this study clearly demonstrated the importance of viremia levels in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> susceptibility to CHIKV. Vector competence is an important prerequisite in evaluating risk of emergence of CHIKV in addition to vector densities and host preference evaluation. Surveillance and control of the domestic vector, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, should remain the main focus in many disease control programs and should be performed routinely where the risk is found to be high.
