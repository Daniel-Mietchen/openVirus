<p>All populations of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> tested were able to transmit CHIKV under laboratory conditions, indicating that mosquitoes in each of these areas were competent vectors of CHIKV. Although infection rates were higher among mosquitoes from Mombasa as compared to Kisumu and Nairobi, these differences were not statistically significant, suggesting a higher CHIKV susceptibility for the

 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Mombasa was not the primary reason for the increased risk of CHIKV transmission in this area. For all three 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations, about 70% of mosquitoes that became infected with CHIKV developed a disseminated infection. Thus, a midgut infection barrier may be an important factor affecting vector competence, particularly at lower viremias, as was suggested in another study on the dengue virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005860.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, only 18 (21%) of 84 mosquitoes with a disseminated infection transmitted CHIKV to a capillary tube indicating a significant salivary gland barrier, although a mosquito may secrete less virus into a capillary tube than it would when feeding on an animal [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005860.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Transmission rates are therefore often lower when they are determined by collection of saliva as compared to allowing the mosquito to feed on a susceptible animal [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005860.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, failure to detect CHIKV in the saliva collected in a capillary tube does not mean that the mosquito would not have transmitted the virus by bite if it fed on a susceptible human, and our transmission rates should be considered as minimum transmission rates.
