<p>Populations of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Mombasa, Nairobi, and Kisumu were all competent vectors of CHIKV. The recent outbreaks of chikungunya in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005860.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], clearly demonstrate the potential for CHIKV to spread to new geographical areas and cause massive epidemics. The most likely way that CHIKV may be introduced into new areas is by a person infected in an area where CHIKV is currently being transmitted traveling to an area where susceptible people and competent vectors exist. In addition, it is possible for an infected mosquito to be transported from an area of active transmission to an area with susceptible people and vectors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005860.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The risk of importation of CHIKV into new areas is high because chikungunya epidemics often result in high attack rates, high viremia levels among infected individuals, as well as the widely distributed 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005860.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Due to the movement of humans to cities, these areas may be associated with higher risk of vector-borne pathogens, such as CHIKV. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> remains the only known urban vector for CHIKV transmission in Kenya. The CHIKV titers used in this study to expose mosquitoes are similar to published viremia levels associated with human infections (often &gt;10
