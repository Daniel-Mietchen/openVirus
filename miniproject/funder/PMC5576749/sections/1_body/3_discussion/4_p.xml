<p>Although we observed a significant difference (P = 0.0012) in the body titers of mosquitoes that did, or did not, disseminate CHIKV, we did not observe any difference in leg titers for mosquitoes with a disseminated infection that did, or did not, transmit virus (P = 1.0). This suggests that the salivary gland barrier which determines the ability of the virus to penetrate into the salivary glands and be secreted into the saliva is independent of the body titer in a mosquito with a disseminated infection [
