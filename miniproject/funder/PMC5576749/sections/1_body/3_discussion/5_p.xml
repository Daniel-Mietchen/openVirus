<p>Although, transmission rates trended higher among the Mombasa populations, the differences were not statistically significant compared to the populations in Kisumu and Nairobi, or more importantly, biologically meaningful. The higher transmission rates observed in the mosquitoes from Mombasa are, however, consistent with the higher chikungunya epidemics in this part of the country. The lower temperatures in Nairobi (average monthly temperatures 22–28°C) as compared to those in Mombasa (average monthly temperatures 27°C—31°C) may be a major contributing factor to the absence of chikungunya in the Nairobi area, as earlier studies demonstrated that temperature plays a significant role in the susceptibility of

Increased feeding on humans would have a much larger effect on CHIKV transmission than a moderate difference in vector competence, and may partly explain why CHIKV remains essentially absent in Kisumu, despite its relatively high temperatures.
