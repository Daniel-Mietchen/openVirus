<p>The legs and wings of each mosquito were removed and the body placed on a sticky tape. The mosquito’s proboscis was inserted into a capillary tube containing 15–20 μl of homogenization media, and left to salivate for 30 minutes. The saliva containing media was eluted to 200 μl of homogenization media and the samples stored at -80°C until assayed for virus by cell culture. The body and legs were placed separately in microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of homogenization media and stored at -80°C until assayed for virus by plaque assay.</p>
