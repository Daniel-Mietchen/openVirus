 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was collected from selected sites in the three major cities in Kenya. Mosquitoes were collected as eggs using oviposition cups (black cups lined with oviposition papers and half filled with water) and as larvae from water holding containers in and around houses, between March and April 2016 (

 <italic>aegypti</italic>, and a portion of them were blood fed on laboratory mice (Kenya Medical Research Institute, Animal House) to provide eggs. These were hatched, reared at 28Â°C and provided fish food (Tetramin) as larval food to produce F

 <sub>2</sub> mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes were provided 8% glucose as a carbohydrate source, which was replaced with water 24 hours prior to virus exposure. We used F
 <sub>0-2</sub> mosquitoes in this study.
