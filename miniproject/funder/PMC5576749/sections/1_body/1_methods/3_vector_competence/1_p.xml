<p>When the laboratory-reared, F
 <sub>1</sub> or F
 <sub>2</sub> mosquitoes from Mombasa, Kisumu, or Nairobi were 4–5 days old (or the F
 <sub>0</sub> mosquitoes from Mombasa and Nairobi were 3–12 days old), they were exposed to blood meals containing four different titers. A Hemotek membrane feeding system (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, the United Kingdom), maintained at 37°C, was covered with mouse skin (Kenya Medical Research Institute, Animal House) and used for artificial blood feeding. All feeding was performed in a BSL-2 insectary at ICIPE.
