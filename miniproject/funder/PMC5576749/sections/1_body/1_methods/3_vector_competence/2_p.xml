<p>In the first experiment, 100 μl of freshly harvested virus was added to 9.9 ml of cell culture media to produce a 1:100 stock virus. 3 ml of this stock was added to 7 ml of defibrinated sheep blood. We added 2 ml of the CHIKV-blood suspension to each well of a Hemotek feeder and

 <italic>aegypti</italic> from the three locations were allowed to feed for about 1 hour. Immediately after making the blood virus suspension, 100 μl of the suspension were added to 900 μL of homogenization media (MEM, supplemented with 15% FBS) to make a 1:10 suspension of the time-0 blood. At the end of the 1-hour feeding period, 100 μl of the virus blood meal were removed from one of the Hemotek feeders and added to 900 μl of homogenization media to determine an end of feeding concentration.
