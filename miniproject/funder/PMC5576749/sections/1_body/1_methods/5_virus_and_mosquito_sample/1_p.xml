<p>Quantification of CHIKV-blood meal, and mosquito body and leg samples was performed by plaque assay. Mosquito bodies were homogenized using a Minibeadbeater (BioSpec Products Inc, Bartlesville, OK 74005 USA) with the aid of a copper bead (BB-caliber airgun shot) and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5417R) for 10 mins at 4°C. Serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and inoculated in 12-well plates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers. Each well was inoculated with 100 μl of virus/blood or body dilutions, incubated for 1 hour to allow for adsorption, with frequent agitation/rocking. The infected cells were then maintained using 2.5% methylcellulose mixed with 2X MEM and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. On the fourth day, the plates were fixed for 1 hour with 10% formalin, and then stained for 1 hour with 0.5% crystal violet solution. Plaques were counted on a light box. Only the legs of the positive mosquito bodies were homogenized and tested in the same way, to determine the dissemination rate.
