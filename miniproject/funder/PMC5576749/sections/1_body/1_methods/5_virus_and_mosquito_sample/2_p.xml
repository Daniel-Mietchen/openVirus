<p>To test for virus transmission, 80 μl of the saliva sample was inoculated into a well of a 24-well plate containing confluent Vero cell monolayers. Plates were incubated for 1 hour to allow for adsorption, with frequent agitation/rocking. The infected cells were maintained using maintenance media (1 ml per well) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Plates were observed for 7 days and the supernatant of wells showing CPE were harvested and virus quantified by plaque assay.
