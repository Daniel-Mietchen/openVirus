<p>The Lamu001 strain of an East/Central/South Africa lineage of CHIKV, isolated during the 2004–2005 outbreak on Lamu Island, was used for all the infection assays performed in this study. The virus was amplified in T-25 cell culture flasks (Corning Incorporated, USA) containing confluent monolayers of Vero cells (ATTC CCL-81), grown in cell culture media consisting of Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with Earle's salts and reduced NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich), 2% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2% antibiotic/antimycotic solution with 10,000 units penicillin, 10 mg streptomycin and 25μg amphotericin B per ml (Sigma-Aldrich,). The inoculated cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, to allow for virus adsorption. Maintenance medium (MEM supplemented with 2% FBS) was then added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator and observed for cytopathic effects (CPE). After 24 hours, 80% CPE was observed and a portion of the CHIKV-media suspension cell suspension was harvested, added to defibrinated sheep blood (Central Veterinary Laboratories Kabete, Kenya) and used without freezing to produce an infectious blood meal used to expose mosquitoes to CHIKV.
