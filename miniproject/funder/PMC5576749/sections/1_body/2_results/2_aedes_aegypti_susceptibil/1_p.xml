<p>In all three populations, viral dissemination was observed as early as 5–7 days of extrinsic incubation, when mosquitoes were exposed to titers of ≥10
 <sup>5.9</sup> PFU/ml. Although dissemination rates appeared to increase with increasing exposure doses, virtually all of this increase could be accounted for by an increase in infection rates. Also, the observed dissemination rates at 10
 <sup>6.9–7.5</sup> were highest in the population of mosquitoes from Mombasa but the difference was however not significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 3.66, DF = 2, P = 0.16). Regardless of mosquito origin, infectious dose, or period of extrinsic incubation, about 71% of the infected mosquitoes had developed a disseminated infection (
