<p>The titers in the infectious blood meals ranged from 105.6–10

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005860.t002">Table 2</xref>), the overall infection rates for all three geographic populations increased with an increase in the exposure dose, with very low infection rates in all three populations when ≤10
