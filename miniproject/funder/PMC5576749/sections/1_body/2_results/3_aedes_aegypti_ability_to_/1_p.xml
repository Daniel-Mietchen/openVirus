<p>Similar to viral dissemination, viral transmission was only detected in mosquitoes that ingested ≥10
 <sup>5.9</sup> PFU/ml (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005860.t004">Table 4</xref>). Although transmission rates appeared to increase with increasing exposure doses, virtually all of this increase was accounted for by an increase in dissemination rates. The transmission rates ranged from 0–2% at a viremia level of 10
 <sup>5.9</sup>, 3–15% at a viremia level of 10
 <sup>6.9</sup>, and 13–19% at a viremia level of 10
 <sup>7.5</sup>. Regardless of mosquito origin, infectious dose, or periods of extrinsic incubation, about 21% of the mosquitoes with a disseminated infection were able to transmit infectious virus to the capillary tube (
