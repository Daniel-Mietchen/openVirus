<p>Based on the titers detected for each population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, we observed that mosquitoes that were susceptible to infection and failed to disseminate the virus had titers at least a log lower than mosquitoes which were susceptible and had disseminated the virus (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005860.t005">Table 5</xref>). This difference was significant (t = 8.10, DF = 4, P = 0.0012). In general, viral dissemination only occurred when body titers were â‰¥10
 <sup>4</sup> in all populations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005860.t005">Table 5</xref>). However, for mosquitoes with a disseminated infection, no significant difference in leg titers was observed for those that did, or did not, transmit virus by bite (t = 0, DF = 4, P = 1.0).
