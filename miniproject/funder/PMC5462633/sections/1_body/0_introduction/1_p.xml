<p>Morbilliviruses belong to the family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> and include a number of highly pathogenic viruses, such as measles virus, rinderpest virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), and 
 <italic>peste-des-petits</italic>-ruminants virus, which cause devastating diseases in humans and animals. In the last decades, morbilliviruses emerged also as causative agents of several mass-mortalities in marine mammals

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The causative agent, CDV, is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Similar to other paramyxoviruses the virus contains six structural proteins, termed nucleocapsid (N), phospho (P), large (L), matrix (M), hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) protein, and two accessory non-structural proteins (C and V) that were found as extratranscriptional units within the P gene 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Generally, CDV exhibits lympho-, neuro- and epitheliotropism resulting in systemic infection of almost all organ systems including respiratory, digestive, urinary, lymphatic, endocrine, cutaneous, skeletal and central nervous system (CNS)

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The disease course and pathogenesis in canine distemper resemble those of human measles virus infection including, fever, rash, respiratory signs, lymphopenia, and profound immunosuppression with generalized depletion of lymphoid organs during the acute disease phase 
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, CDV infection shows a high incidence of neurological complications
