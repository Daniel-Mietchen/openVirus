<p>Unlike the related measles virus which is maintained by single host species, CDV represents a rather promiscuous agent causing distemper-like pathology in a variety of different carnivorous and also non-carnivorous species

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Clinical findings and pathology resemble largely the disease in dogs. However, morbidity and mortality may vary greatly among animal species. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses of CDV have revealed that mutations affecting the binding site of the H protein for virus entry receptors (
