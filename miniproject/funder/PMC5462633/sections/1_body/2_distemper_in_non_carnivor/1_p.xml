<p>The remarkable ability of CDV to cross species barriers is exemplified by its infection of non-carnivore species such as peccaries and non-human primates. In 1989, a CDV epizootic with fatal encephalitis was observed in collared peccaries (javelina;

Thus, increased fatality rate during the outbreak was probably supported by high population densities and crowding around remaining water sources
