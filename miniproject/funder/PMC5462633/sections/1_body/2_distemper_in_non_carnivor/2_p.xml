<p>In 1989, first cases of natural CDV infections in Japanese macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>) with two fatalities were reported 
 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">[121]</xref>. In 2006, large CDV outbreaks occurred among rhesus monkeys (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) in a breeding farm in Guangxi province (China) with death rates up to 30% (about 4000 fatalities). Animals displayed measles-like signs, such as respiratory distress, anorexia, fever, rash and conjunctivitis. Although the exact source of infection could not be determined, virus transmission by contact between farm monkeys with local wild monkeys or a spillover from a stray dog carrying CDV that became adapted to the new host was discussed

 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>). Post mortem examination revealed interstitial pneumonia, generalized lymphoid depletion and demyelination in the brain. Sequence analyses of the viral genome revealed that Chinese and Japanese isolates are closely related within the Asia-1 clade, suggesting continuous chains of CDV infection in monkeys
