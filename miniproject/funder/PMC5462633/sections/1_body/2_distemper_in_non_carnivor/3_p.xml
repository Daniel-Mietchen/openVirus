<p>Expansion of host species to include primates has raised concerns about a potential risk of CDV infection in humans. It has been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> that the monkey-adapted strain (CYN07-dV) has an intrinsic ability to use human nectin-4 for virus entry and easily become adapted to use the human CD150 following minimal amino acid changes of the viral H protein
