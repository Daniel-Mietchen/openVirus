<p>Spillover of CDV resulting from interactions between domestic or feral dogs and various wild species has led to mass mortalities in several wildlife species, but also spillback events from wildlife reservoir hosts to domesticated animals occur 
 <xref rid="bb0745" ref-type="bibr">[149]</xref>. Epidemiology of distemper in wildlife animals depends upon several factors, such as virulence of virus strain, population density, and herd immunity

 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Also genetic diversity of CDV strains represents a possible cause for unpredictable disease emergence in domestic and wildlife populations

 <xref rid="bb0750" ref-type="bibr">[150]</xref>. Thus, in contrast to host-specific pathogens, such as measles virus and rinderpest virus, the broad and expanding host range of CDV considerably hampers disease eradication even by widespread mass vaccination
