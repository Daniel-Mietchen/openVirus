<p>Domestic ferrets (
 <italic>Mustela putorius furo</italic>) are highly susceptible to CDV infection with a mortality rate of up to 100% in non-vaccinated populations. As a consequence of systemic infections, ferrets develop high fever together with respiratory and intestinal signs

Polioencephalitis leading to behavioral changes, lethargy and seizures is a common cause of death or reasons for euthanasia. But CNS manifestation varies among CDV isolates and is preferentially caused by strains known to be neurovirulent in dogs (e.g. Snyder Hill and Cornell A75-17)
