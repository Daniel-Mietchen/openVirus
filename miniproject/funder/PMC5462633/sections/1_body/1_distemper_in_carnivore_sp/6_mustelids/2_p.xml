<p>First reports of CDV infection in farmed minks (
 <italic>Neovison vison</italic>) have been described in 1930 
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Similar to ferrets, young minks usually die suddenly, while adult mink have an increased resistance and exhibit protracted disease courses with neurological signs 
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>. Recently, phylogenetic analyses showed that wildlife species in Denmark, such as foxes, potentially contribute to the transmission of CDV to farmed mink and that the virus is able to be maintained in the wild animal reservoir between outbreaks. Isolates from the Danish outbreak in 2012 clustered in the European CDV lineage and were closely related to viruses circulating in wildlife populations from Germany and Hungary 
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. Interestingly, identification of CDV in fleas collected from a mink carcass has led to speculations about vector-mediated transmission of viruses between mink and other species
