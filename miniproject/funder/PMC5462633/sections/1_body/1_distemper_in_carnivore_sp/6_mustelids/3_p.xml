<p>Systemic, often lethal disease has been observed in black-footed ferrets (
 <italic>Mustela nigripes</italic>) following CDV infection representing a serious threat for wildlife and captive populations 
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Noteworthy, severe pruritus can be commonly observed as an initial clinical sign in affected animals, followed by hyperkeratosis and progressive loss of body condition. The high susceptibility of black-footed ferrets is demonstrated also by their fatal response to modified-live CDV vaccines demonstrated to be safe in domestic ferrets and Siberian polecats 
 <xref rid="bb0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. Mortalities following CDV infection have been described also in colonies and wildlife populations of other mustelids, including martens (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), polecats, badgers, ferret-badger, otters, and weasels, leading to the assumption that all members of the family are susceptible

 <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. At post mortem examination interstitial pneumonia, enteritis, encephalitis (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and lymphoid depletion (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) with intralesional virus antigen can be found. Common lethal complications in mustelids are secondary parasitic or bacterial diseases (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) as a consequence of virus-induced immunosuppression 
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Mustelids are regarded as a CDV reservoir and potential source of transmission to other species, including domestic dogs. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a co-circulation of several contemporary CDV genotypes in carnivores of central Europe with the occurrence of a distinct CDV lineage in ferrets, polecats and martens, suggestive of mustelid-adapted strains 
 <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. As in other carnivores distemper represents an important differential diagnosis for other CNS infections and has to be discriminated especially from rabies 
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. Distemper has been described also in striped skunks (
 <italic>Mephitis mephitis</italic>) belonging to the mustelid related 
 <italic>Mephitidae</italic> family
