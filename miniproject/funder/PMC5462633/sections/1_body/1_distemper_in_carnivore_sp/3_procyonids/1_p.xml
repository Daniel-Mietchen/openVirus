 <italic>Procyonidae</italic> including predominantly raccoons (
 <italic>Procyon lotor</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, but also pygmy racoons (
 <italic>Procyon pygmaeus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Spontaneous clinical distemper has been reported in sylvatic and urban populations of raccoons 
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, while vaccination-induced distemper is reported in kinkajous (
 <italic>Potos flavus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Clinical signs in raccoons resemble those in dogs and must be differentiated from rabies in cases with neurologic signs 
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Pathology is characterized by blepharoconjunctivitis, rhinitis, occasional pigmentation of the muzzle and footpads with hyperkeratosis, interstitial pneumonia with syncytia and viral inclusion bodies, and demyelinating cerebellar white matter disease

 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. Lednicky et al. (2004) identified two different American CDV lineages causing raccoon distemper outbreaks in the same area suggesting multiple reintroductions of the virus 
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Phylogenetic analyses of CDV isolates from an outbreak in free-ranging raccoons in Germany from 2012 to 2013 revealed close relations with European CDV lineages especially from foxes and domestic dogs suggestive of interspecies transmission 
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In addition, raccoons might have intensified transmission of Asia-1 lineage CDV during an epidemic in wildlife mammals in Japan (2007â€“2008)
