<p>Endangered African wild dogs (
 <italic>Lycaon pictus</italic>) have been reported to be exposed to CDV and are highly susceptible to develop distemper 
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Molecular analyses of isolates from African wild dogs suggest that CDV is endemic in wildlife carnivore populations in Tanzania (Serengeti ecosystem)
