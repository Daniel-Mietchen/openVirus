<p>Besides domesticated dogs natural and/or vaccine-induced CDV-associated disease has been reported in almost all genera of the tribus true canids. Affected members of the genus Canis include Australian dingos (
 <italic>Canis dingo</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, coyotes (
 <italic>Canis latrans</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, black-backed jackals (
 <italic>Canis mesomelas</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, golden jackals (
 <italic>Canis aureus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, Canadian wolves (
 <italic>Canis lupus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, American gray wolves (
 <italic>Canis lupus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, Mexican wolves (
 <italic>Canis lupus baileyi</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, Iberian wolves (
 <italic>Canis lupus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and Apennine wolves (
 <italic>Canis lupus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Phylogenetic analyses suggest a CDV spillover from domestic dogs to free-ranging jackals and wolves 
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Referring to this, sequencing of CDV from Apennine wolves in Italy identified a strain belonging to the Arctic lineage, known to circulate in European dog populations 
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The Ethiopian wolf (
 <italic>Canis simensis</italic>) is recognized as the rarest canid species in the world and the most threatened carnivore in Africa. This species is almost extinct due to combined effects of rabies and CDV infections 
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Wolf-derived CDV from the Ethiopian outbreak show sequence homologies to isolates from domestic dogs in the USA, Germany and Japan, suggestive of global virus spread 
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. There is serological evidence of CDV exposition to maned wolves (
 <italic>Chrysocyon brachyurus</italic>) in Brazil. Natural clinical distemper has not been reported in this species 
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, but vaccination-induced distemper may occur 
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Similarly, there are no reports about cases of naturally occurring distemper in bush dogs (
 <italic>Speothos yenaticus</italic>), however, a possible vaccine-induced case has been described 
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.
