<p>Free-ranging Serengeti hyenas (
 <italic>Crocuta crocuta</italic>) and captive hyenas may succumb following CDV infection (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 6</xref>). Sequence data revealed closest homology to CDV strains causing high mortality in sympatric lions 
 <xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">[117]</xref>. Seropositivity of living animals indicates that Serengeti hyenas may also become subclinically infected without overt disease or can recover from disease, respectively
