<p>There is marked serological evidence that various species of bears have been exposed to CDV including American black bears (
 <italic>Ursus americanus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, Asian black bears (
 <italic>Ursus tibethanus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, polar bears (
 <italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, grizzly bears (
 <italic>Ursus arctos horribilis</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and Marsican brown bears (
 <italic>Ursus arctos marsicanus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. However, clinicopathological manifestation of distemper in ursids is rare. An American black bear yearling showed loss of fear for humans, periods of somnolence, sporadic tremors and seizures caused by nonsuppurative polioencephalitis with eosinophilic intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons. Additionally, hyperkeratotic thickened footpads were recorded. Sequence homologies with a CDV vaccine strain (Rockborn strain) indicate the potential virus exchange between vaccinated domestic animals and wildlife 
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Furthermore, neonatal death of polar bears (
 <italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>) and a spectacled bear (
 <italic>Tremarctos ornatus</italic>) has been attributed to CDV infection 
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. The virus can be transmitted to bears by dogs, mustelids, coyotes, and other carnivores that might be sympatric with bears. Besides serological evidence of CDV infection in captive Giant pandas (
 <italic>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>, also fatal CDV infection was noted recently among these endangered species in a wildlife rescue and breeding center in China
