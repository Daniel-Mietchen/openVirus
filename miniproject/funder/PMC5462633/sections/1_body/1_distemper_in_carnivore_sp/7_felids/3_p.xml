<p>Similar to infections in wildlife populations, large felids including tigers (

 <italic>Panthera pardus</italic>), and jaguars (
 <italic>Panthera onca</italic>) in zoological collections may become infected with CDV. Animals often develop fatal disease with respiratory and gastrointestinal signs followed by neurological manifestation
