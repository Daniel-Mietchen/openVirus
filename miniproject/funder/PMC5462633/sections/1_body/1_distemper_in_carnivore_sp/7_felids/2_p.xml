<p>CDV-neutralizing antibodies have been found in various species of wild felids throughout their natural habitats worldwide, e.g. in Amur tiger (
 <italic>Panthera tigris altaica</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>, leopard (
 <italic>Panthera pardus</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref> or South American jaguars (
 <italic>Panthera onca</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. The first devastating epidemic in large wild felids occurred in 1994 within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of East Africa. Approximately one-third of the Serengeti lion population (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>) died or disappeared. Analyses indicated that the Serengeti lion CDV was closely related to the Onderstepoort strain isolated from a domestic dog in South Africa. Clinically, grand mal seizures and myoclonia were observed. Death was caused by nonsuppurative encephalitis and pneumonia 
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. A similar epidemic occurred in 2001 in the Ngorongoro Crater lion population 
 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. In east Africa, CDV-infected domestic dogs are regarded as the main source for infection in lions. However, since widespread dog vaccination reduces outbreak sizes but does not prevent CDV transmission to Serengeti lion populations, the virus is supposed to be maintained also in wildlife hosts, e.g. in hyenas and jackals 
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. CDV infection in lions is not necessarily fatal, because retrospective serological investigations revealed that at least five “silent” CDV epidemics swept through the same two lion populations between 1976 and 2006 without clinical disease or increased mortality 
 <xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. Severe hemoparasitism with tick-born 
 <italic>Babesia</italic> sp. triggered by extreme drought is regarded as a major contributing factor to fatal outcome of the epidemics in 1994 and 2001 
 <xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. CDV represents also a threat for the wild Amur tiger (
 <italic>Panthera tigris altaica</italic>), one of the most endangered cat populations. CDV-infected animals show clear nasal and ocular discharge, stupor and anorexia. Neurological signs include non-responsiveness to stimuli, blindness, absent fear for humans, head pressing, ataxia, and intermittent petit and grand mal seizures. Lymphopenia indicates immunosuppression in affected tigers. Contrary to histologic lesions in domestic dogs, diffuse alveolar type II cell hyperplasia with cytoplasmic and intranuclear viral inclusion bodies is found in the lungs of large felids 
 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. Additionally, in the brain typical white matter lesions seen in canids are lacking, but instead lymphocytic meningoencephalitis with extensive malacia in brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus are observed. Viral inclusion bodies and antigen are detectable in glial cells and occasional neurons in malacic areas 
 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. Sequence analyses showed homologies between tiger CDV and Arctic-like strains of CDV isolated in Baikal seals in Russia and domestic dogs 
 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis and molecular characterization of CDV strains from a variety of geographic lineages and with a variety of amino acid residues in the H gene binding site indicate that some strains are regularly capable to infect felids and cause diseases. Therefore, CDV infections of felids may not just be incidental events or spillover diseases but a part of the regular host spectrum of this infectious disease
