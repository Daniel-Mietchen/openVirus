<p>In felids, CDV can cause clinically silent infections or fatal disease. Although CDV antibodies have been detected in domestic cats (

 <xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>, there are no reports of naturally occurring systemic CDV infections, despite frequent contact with dogs. Experimental infection of domestic cats with a highly virulent CDV strain resulted in asymptomatic infection without virus shedding
