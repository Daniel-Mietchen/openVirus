<p>The pathogenesis of CDV infection in domestic dogs has been extensively reviewed previously 
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In brief, disease duration and severity in domestic dogs depends mainly on the animal's age and immune status and strain virulence. The primary mode of infection is via inhalation 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Initially, CDV replicates in lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. Here, monocytes and macrophages are the first target cells which propagate the virus 
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Following a variable incubation period (one to four weeks), animals develop a characteristic biphasic fever 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. During the first viremic phase, generalized infection of lymphoid tissues with lymphoid depletion, lymphopenia and transient fever is observed. Profound immunosuppression is a consequence of leukocyte necrosis, apoptosis and dysfunction 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Second viremia is associated with high fever and infection of parenchymal tissues such as the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, and CNS 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. During this disease stage, various clinical manifestations may be present such as conjunctivitis, nasal discharge, anorexia, respiratory signs, gastrointestinal signs, and neurological deficiencies 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Respiratory signs are a sequel of virus-induced rhinitis and interstitial pneumonia, while vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration are caused by gastrointestinal tract infection 
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Often enteric and respiratory signs are worsened by secondary bacterial infections. Characteristic dermal manifestations include pustular dermatitis (distemper exanthema) and hyperkeratosis of foodpads and nasal planum (hard pad disease). In young animals also enamel hypoplasia and metaphyseal osteosclerosis have been described following CDV infection 
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Neurologic signs depend on viral distribution in the CNS and include hyperesthesia, cervical rigidity, seizures, cerebellar and vestibular signs, as well as paraparesis or tetraparesis with sensory ataxia 
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Histological manifestations include polioencephalitis and demyelinating leukoencephalomyelitis 
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Recovery depends on the host immune response. Particularly, a strong and effective cellular immune response can eliminate the virus prior to infection of parenchymal tissues, while weak and delayed cellular and humoral immune responses lead to virus spread and persistence, respectively
