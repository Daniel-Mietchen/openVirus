<p>Surprisingly, PDV has been isolated only during the epidemics in northwestern European waters in 1988 and 2002

 <xref rid="bb0685" ref-type="bibr">[137]</xref>. In some CDV outbreaks including the mass mortalities among Baikal and Caspian seals, terrestrial carnivores including dogs and wolves have been suspected as vectors for the infectious agent 
 <xref rid="bb0700" ref-type="bibr">[140]</xref>. Different hypotheses concerning the origin of PDV and its geographical and chronological dissemination pattern have been presented. These include virus spread from less susceptible marine mammals including Canadian harp seals (

 <italic>Halichoerus grypus</italic>), as well as infection from diseased terrestrial animals including minks, wolves and polar bears. Debated predisposing factors for disease outbreaks include malnutrition and immunosuppressive xenobiotics

 <xref rid="bb0710" ref-type="bibr">[142]</xref>. It still remains a possibility that PDV strains, with reduced virulence for terrestrial mammals, are circulating in these species and cause mass die-offs in pinnipeds after crossing the species barrier
