<p>Several morbillivirus epidemics have been observed in different marine mammal species. Distemper in seals can be caused by CDV and the closely related but genetically different phocine distemper virus (PDV) 
 <xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">[129]</xref>. The devastating PDV epidemic among harbor seals (
 <italic>Phoca vitulina</italic>) and gray seals (
 <italic>Halichoerus grypus</italic>) in northwestern European waters in 1988 represents the first documented disease manifestation of a morbillivirus infection in marine mammals 
 <xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">[130]</xref>. At the same time, epidemics with CDV strains of the Arctic group were observed among Baikal seals (
 <italic>Phoca sibirica</italic>) in Siberia 
 <xref rid="bb0655" ref-type="bibr">[131]</xref>. CDV was isolated also from Caspian seals during disease outbreaks with high mortality rates in 1997, 2000 and 2001
