<p>Experimental infection revealed duration of phocine distemper ranging from two to three weeks with a mortality rate of 60% to 80% 
 <xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">[135]</xref>. Similar to CDV, PDV infection of seals leads to interstitial pneumonia and catarrhal enteritis, causing fever, diarrhea, coughing, and dyspnea 
 <xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">[135]</xref>. Other signs include nasal discharge, ocular discharge, anorexia, weight loss and abortion 
 <xref rid="bb0680" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref>. Common neurological manifestations represent tremor, behavioral changes and lethargy 
 <xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">[129]</xref>. Brain lesions in PDV-infected seals are similar to CDV-induced acute polioencephalitis in dogs and measles virus inclusion body polioencephalitis in human beings, respectively. With disease progression also demyelination in the CNS can be observed

 <xref rid="bb0680" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref> and thymic atrophy, which renders the animals susceptible to develop opportunistic infections. Interestingly, few harbor seals develop also epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis as a consequence of dermal infection
