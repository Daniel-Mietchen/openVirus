<p>Distemper-like diseases in dolphins and harbor porpoises are caused by the dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and porpoise morbillivirus (PMV), respectively 
 <xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">[145]</xref>. Together with the pilot whale morbillivirus, isolated from a stranded long-finned pilot whale (
 <italic>Globicephalus melas</italic>), DMV and PMV are members of the cetacean morbillivirus group 
 <xref rid="bb0725" ref-type="bibr">[145]</xref>. Analysis revealed that these cetacean viruses are more closely related to rinderpest virus and 
 <italic>peste-des-petits</italic>-ruminants virus than to CDV 
 <xref rid="bb0730" ref-type="bibr">[146]</xref>. Viruses isolated from Mediterranean monk seals (
 <italic>Monachus monachus</italic>) during mass die-offs closely resemble cetacean morbilliviruses, indicative of interspecies transmission from cetaceans to pinnipeds
