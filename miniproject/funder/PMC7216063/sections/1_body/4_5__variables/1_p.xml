The dataset also includes the following covariates: age, number of children, education, lost to follow-up from HIV ARV care/treatment during pregnancy, Cluster of Differentiation antigen 4 (CD4) count, travel time to clinic, and clinic site (urban or rural). This high dimensional vector of covariates allows for appropriate regression modeling in using the observed characteristics of HIV positive pregnant women to analyze the determinants of enrollment in NHIF.</p>
