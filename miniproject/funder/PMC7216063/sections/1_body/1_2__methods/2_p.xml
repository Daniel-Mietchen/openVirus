<p>Specifically, we focus on ‘adverse selection’ given that it can suffer from the ‘dual problem’ of de-pooling health insurance pools through the same actions taken to address adverse selection [

Given the ‘dual problem’ of ‘adverse selection’, an analysis of the determinants and predictors of health insurance enrollment among high risk groups, such as HIV positive pregnant women, in limited resource settings is timely and nascent. Such an analysis would help to establish the potential for the existence of ‘adverse selection’ and a probable mechanism to address the same.
