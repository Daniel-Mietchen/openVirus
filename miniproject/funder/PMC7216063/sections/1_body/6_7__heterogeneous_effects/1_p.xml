<p>Further, the drivers of health insurance enrollment may be heterogeneous for HIV positive pregnant women given their health status i.e., those who are in a worse off health state are more likely to enroll in health insurance, given their demonstrated need for access to healthcare [

Such differential enrollment in health insurance may be indicative of adverse selection, a crucial consideration for health insurance design and management. Previous studies that have looked at adverse selection across different insurance markets including automobile, annuities, life insurance, reverse mortgages, long-term care, crop insurance, and health insurance show that adverse selection does exist for some markets but not for others, and for some pools within similar markets and not others [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. As such, there are conceptual reasons to expect adverse selection to vary across insurance markets and their corresponding segments [

For health insurance, HIV status and disease severity are likely drivers of health insurance enrollment i.e. adverse selection, and health insurers are likely to take into account HIV status and severity in adjusting for risk in their pools, as they stand to lose money [

Previous studies on the effect of test and treat have been inconsistent, showing that increasing viral suppression is achievable, but getting universal coverage is very difficult, and gaps exist between HIV acquisition and testing, and challenges exist in linking those that test positive for HIV with treatment [

Additionally, in previous work in the same setting, we have shown that HIV disease severity does influence NHIF utilization patterns [
