<p>As global healthcare systems work towards improved HIV outcomes and sustainable financing for HIV care, it is going to be imperative to continue to explore the intersection of health insurance and access to HIV treatment and care. This analysis has shown that health insurance enrollment among HIV positive pregnant women in this setting is relatively low. However, these HIV positive pregnant women have positive odds of health insurance enrollment if they deliver at an institution, were lost to follow-up to HIV ART care during pregnancy, and were getting care at an urban clinic. On the other hand, being on HIV treatment is negatively associated with health insurance enrollment. Therefore, considerations of health insurance vis-a-vis HIV care and financing will need to take into account these factors, as they would influence the potential success of health insurance for HIV financing in limited resource settings, including the design of health insurance programs and the sub-sequent enrollment in these programs. As such, there is need for additional research to understand the nature and structure of adverse selection and information asymmetries in low/limited resource settings, combined with the use of innovation and novel data sources to address the challenges identified. Moreover, policy initiatives for increasing health insurance enrollment that align with UHC are going to be critical for sustained and enhanced HIV care and prevention moving forward toward future elimination.</p>
