<p>The descriptive analysis shows that insurance enrollment among HIV positive pregnant women is low. The low insurance enrollment is consistent with national level estimates that show similarly low enrollments rates (11%) among pregnant women in the general Kenyan population [

Being Lost to-follow-up to HIV care during pregnancy and receiving care at an urban clinic are positive predictors of insurance enrollment. Additionally, the univariate and multivariate regression analysis both indicate that, for HIV positive pregnant women, delivering at healthcare facility, being lost to-follow-up to HIV care during pregnancy, receiving care at an urban clinic conditional on other socio-demographic factors are positive predictors on enrollment in health insurance. This may be indicative of the potential for adverse selection and the existence of information asymmetries [

Low insurance enrollment among HIV positive pregnant women could be driven by insurance institutions, such as the NHIF trying to enroll lower risk patients in their insurance pool to keep the premiums, administrative, and claims costs down [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This attempt to have low risk pools is likely compounded by information asymmetriesâ€”one party having more information on health insurance than the other does [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This analysis also shows that HIV positive pregnant women getting their care in urban clinics and delivering at healthcare facilities are more likely to have NHIF. This may be the case, as these patients are likely to be privy to information that would enable them enroll in the NHIF compared to mothers delivering at home or getting their care in rural health facilities, who may have limited information [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Further, limited availability of accredited facilities in rural areas is due to the historical practice of the NHIF targeting facilities with in-patient capabilities, and the hierarchical structure of the system favoring higher-level urban facilities [
