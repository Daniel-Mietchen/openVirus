HIV positive pregnant women who deliver at a health facility had twice the odds of enrolling in insurance, were 10 times more likely to have insurance if they were lost to follow-up to HIV care during pregnancy, and three times more likely to enroll if they sought care at an urban clinic. On the other hand, being on HIV treatment was negatively associated with health insurance enrollment.
