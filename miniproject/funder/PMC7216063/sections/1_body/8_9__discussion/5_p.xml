<p>While this analysis does show that adverse selection and information asymmetries are likely influencing health insurance enrollment among HIV positive pregnant women in Kenya, the results may be limited. First, NHIF enrollment in Kenya is largely voluntary, and may favor those in the formal sector more than those in the informal sector, as such these results may not reflect what is happening at the national level vis-a-vis health insurance and HIV. Second, the data used in the analysis is a cross-sectional sample from retrospective electronic clinical records that may not capture the full spectrum of predictors and nuances of insurance enrolment in these kinds of settings. Additionally, there may be the potential for recall bias on the capturing of health insurance status, but this would be offset by the frequency of multiple clinical encounters for each patient. Nonetheless, given the existence of limited analysis of predictors of health insurance for HIV positive populations in low and middle income countries (LMIC), the results presented here are informative for HIV healthcare systems that are similar to AMPATH in Kenya. The results can thus be used as a basis for further exploration of the relationship between HIV and health insurance [

The additional exploration can take advantage of novel longitudinal data sources that are becoming much more prevalent in the age of big data. Maximizing the full potential of these kinds of data will no doubt require resources, innovation, and the right policy frameworks and dispensation [
