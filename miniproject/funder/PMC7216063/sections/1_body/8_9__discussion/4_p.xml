<p>If we take into consideration the severity of HIV, as determined by CD4 cell count, health insurance enrollment for mothers with lower CD4 is consistent with the overall results from the non-stratified sample. This may signal that, for HIV positive mothers with lower CD4 (CD4 &lt;350), health insurance enrollment is influenced by adverse selection and information asymmetries. This should be of concern to policy makers, as this group of HIV positive mothers need better access to care, and insurance companies could ration this care in the event that they risk adjust their insurance pools [

Moreover, those HIV positive pregnant women with CD4 &gt;350 are 17 times more likely to sign up for health insurance if lost to follow-up to HIV care during pregnancy. This may be because they are compensating for their sporadic encounters and may be more risky. Given the new ART treatment guidelines, this may play-out differently and, as indicated above, there is a need to undertake further analysis of adverse selection, as it manifests differently in various health insurance markets, and specific to HIV, we have a limited understanding of enrollment dynamics in developing countries [
