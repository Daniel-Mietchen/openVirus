<p>The data used in the study is stored in the AMPATH Medical Records System (AMRS)—an electronic database of clinical encounters spanning more than 500 healthcare facilities in Western Kenya, with extensive socio-demographic, economic, clinical and biological variables [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The information in the AMRS is collected using encounter forms designed in a consultative process with physicians, clinical officers, and nurses in different healthcare specialties [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. AMRS developers then program the AMRS input screens to capture the data during clinical encounters, and retrieve the information for research based on inclusion/exclusion criterion provided in study protocols [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The quality of the data captured is ensured using a concept dictionary that is centrally maintained and updated [

As such, for this analysis, the study population includes HIV positive pregnant women (ages 15–49 years), who get their HIV care at AMPATH clinics and have had a delivery (full term, preterm, miscarriage) with their NHIF enrollment status available in the dataset. Those enrolled in the NHIF are the cases and those not enrolled are the controls. From the AMRS, data programmers in the biostatistics program at AMPATH extracted information on institutional delivery and health insurance enrollment from 2008–2013. We used this de-identified EMR dataset to create a retrospective case-control cross-sectional study sample, based on the last clinical encounter (over the 5-year period) of HIV positive pregnant women with complete information on their insurance and institutional delivery status.
