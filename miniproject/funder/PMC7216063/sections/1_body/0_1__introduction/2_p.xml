<p>In the HIV/AIDS space, tremendous gains have been recorded, with the number of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths markedly decreasing since peaking in 1997 and 2005, respectively [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These gains are partly the result of focusing on the HIV cascade [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and mobilizing more than US $500 billion in global resources [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, this progress seems to be slowing down. Reductions in new HIV infections in the past decade have slowed down, raising concerns of a resurgence, which is compounded by increasing incidences in some 50 countries [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], especially among youths and adolescents [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Global funding for HIV is also beginning to decline steadily [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. According to the Kaiser Family foundation, donor spending on HIV declined by 13% from US $8.62 billion in 2014 to US $7.53 billion in 2015 [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that US $26.2 billion will be required for a global HIV response in 2020 alone, if the efforts to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 are to stay on course [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Kenya, a country with one of the largest HIV epidemics in the world in terms of the number of people living with HIV [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], data from 2018 shows that the overall adult HIV prevalence (~5%) and incidence (36,000 new infections annually) continues to decline, but HIV related deaths continue to plateau [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, without treatment and adherence, the risk of mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV among HIV positive pregnant women increases [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with coverage at 74%, down from 86% [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While virtual elimination of MTCT is possible [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], this scenario presents the need to not only focus on access to ART and outcomes along the HIV cascade, but also to begin to institute a health systems approach focusing on financing, human resources, service delivery, and information and appropriate technology for comprehensive HIV treatment and prevention [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This would be in line with the Institute of Medicine (IOM), whose view on the future of HIV in Africa [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] is that health insurance does offer some promise in helping fill these health systems gaps in low and middle-income countries [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
