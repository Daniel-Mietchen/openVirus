<p>In Kenya, like most countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), HIV programs are largely dependent on external donor funding. In 2015 for example, Kenya spent US $1.9 billion on HIV/AIDS [

Given that 82% of HIV funding has come from donor assistance and OOP payments, there is an urgent and existential need to explore locally sustainable modes of HIV financing, including health insurance such as the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) [
