<p>Established by an Act of Parliament in 1966, the NHIF is the oldest Social Health Insurance (SHI) in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and the largest health insurer in Kenya, with private health insurance covering about 2% of the population [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Over the next 30 years, NHIF has instituted reforms to expand coverage. This expansion includes: the management of inpatient and outpatient schemes for government employees; the introduction of a quality improvement system; the launch of health subsidies for the poor; the revision of monthly premiums and increase in provider reimbursement rates through capitation; and the accreditation of public and private hospitals to expand the provider network [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Under NHIF legislation, enrollment is based on which segment of the economy one is employed in. All formal sector employees and civil servants (government employees, including military personnel) are mandatory members, and their employers are obligated to deduct their monthly premiums from a portion of their gross salary [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While there are no co-payments or co-insurance, those not enrolled in NHIF depend on OOP payments or tax subsidized care in government facilities, where quality is questionable [
