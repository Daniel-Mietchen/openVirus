<p>In higher income countries, health insurance has been used across the HIV treatment and prevention spectrum. In the US for example, public health insurance has facilitated access to health services beyond ART and ensured access to quality healthcare with disease progression [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Private health insurance plans are also required to provide appropriate care to those enrolled in their plans and in most cases are more effective than public insurance [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], how to expand private health insurance coverage for HIV and AIDS [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and considerations in the integration of the global HIV/AIDS response into UHC [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-17-02892" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, none of these studies has looked at the predictors of health insurance enrollment among people living with HIV (PLWH).
