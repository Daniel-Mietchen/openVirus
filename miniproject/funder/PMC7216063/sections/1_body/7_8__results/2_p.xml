<p>Results of the bivariate and multivariate analysis of the predictors of health insurance enrollment among HIV positive pregnant women using the confirmatory approach are presented in

 <xref rid="ijerph-17-02892-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. From the bivariate analysis, HIV positive pregnant women who delivered at a health institution have three times the odds (OR 2.91; CI 1.56–5.41), of enrolling in health insurance. Those lost to follow-up to HIV care during pregnancy are four times (OR 3.77; CI 1.37–10.41) more likely to enroll in health insurance, while those enrolled in care in urban clinics are three times (OR 3.16; CI 1.98–5.05) more likely to have health insurance. The fact that currently being on ARV treatment negatively (OR 0.21; CI 0.10–0.43) predicts enrolling in the NHIF is notable, while CD4 at enrollment, and the number of days pre and post ARV initiation, does not have an effect on enrollment. The results from the multivariate analysis are similar to the univariate analysis, with being on ARV treatment still negatively associated with NHIF enrollment. Also, in the multivariate analysis, age at enrollment doubles the odds of enrolling in the NHIF (AOR 2.24; CI 1.30–3.86), and the odds of enrollment in insurance due to loss to follow-up to HIV care during pregnancy (AOR 9.90; CI 3.42–28.67), conditional on other observable characteristics almost triples in comparison to the same odds in the univariate analysis.
