<p>To account for the potential of differential enrollment in health insurance given health status i.e., adverse selection, we stratify the analysis by HIV disease severity i.e., CD4 &lt;350 as “Severe HIV disease,” and CD4 &gt;350 otherwise. As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-02892-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, HIV positive pregnant women with CD4 &lt;350 are more likely to enroll in health insurance if they delivered at a health institution (AOR 3.69; CI 1.15–11.82) and if they are enrolled for their care in an urban clinic (AOR 5.71; CI 2.40–13.6). Additionally, for the mothers with CD4 &lt;350, currently being on ARV treatment is negatively predictive of their enrollment in health insurance (AOR 0.03; CI 0.00–0.32), conditional on their demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics. Their age at enrollment at AMPATH is also predictive of enrollment in the NHIF (AOR 2.16; CI 0.94–4.94), but this result is marginally significant. For those HIV positive pregnant women who have CD4 &gt;350, age at enrollment (AOR 2.92; CI 1.20–7.08) is predictive of insurance enrollment. They are also 17 times (AOR 17.42; CI 3.52–86.29) more likely to enroll in insurance if they were lost to follow-up to HIV care during pregnancy, conditional on their age, education, number of pregnancies, loss to follow-up during pregnancy HIV treatment status, and distance to and location of their HIV clinic. Being currently on ARV treatment is not a significant predictor of whether or not those with CD4 &gt;350 enroll in health insurance.
