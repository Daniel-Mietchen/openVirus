<p>This manuscript analyzes a model of virus evolution in a host population in response to accumulating immune memory in previously infected individuals. The main result is a phase diagram that delineates qualitatively different modes of evolution (rapid extinction, strain proliferation, and metastable traveling fitness wave dynamics) as a function of evolutionary and epidemiological parameters.</p>
