<p>I still think it would be relevant to quantify the behaviour of the number of competing strains in the phase diagram (Figure 3B, C) in some fashion (see previous comment 3). The authors map the line q=1. Their reply otherwise refers to Figure 5, but it is not clear to me to which numbers q this refers to in Figure 3 (e.g., where is the locus q=10). Figure 3B, C shows two quantities as formulas in white font which I am not sure to which lines they refer to; please clarify and give units and numbers for these quantities.</p>
