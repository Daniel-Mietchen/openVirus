<p>3) The mathematical conditions for the mapping onto fitness waves should be made more precise. This mapping is used throughout to describe the endemic regime. However, the traveling fitness wave formalism is derived under more specific assumptions, namely, the coexistence of many small-effect mutations (which corresponds to large values of q). Some parts of the phase diagram clearly fall outside this regime. While it may still be permissible to extend the asymptotic formulae, this should be discussed. We suggest to mark the boundary of the many-mutations regime, say, given by the condition U_b \gtrsim s, as a dotted line in the phase diagram.</p>
