<p>The primary concern stems from details that are now provided in the revised manuscript that you submitted. Given these new details, reviewer #2 is particularly concerned that the epidemiological model does not incorporate infection histories appropriately, such that the results of this analysis do not advance the literature. The reviewer's request is that you re-do the entire analysis, using an epidemiological model structure that is appropriate. We would like to give you an opportunity to respond to this request, given the set of highly divergent approaches for modeling multi-strain dynamics.</p>
