<p>a) According to my understanding, a typical infection is a stochastic event. An individual exposed to virus is either infected, at the systemic level, or not. If the individual is infected, the virus reaches high loads, causes a strong immune response, leaves high numbers of memory cells, and can be transmitted with appreciable probability to another individual. If the exposed individual is not infected at the systemic level, none of these events takes place. The probability of each of the two outcomes, given the exposure dose, depends on the presence of memory cells left from the previous infections, and their genetic distance from the infecting strain. Is this the scenario that the authors had in mind?</p>
