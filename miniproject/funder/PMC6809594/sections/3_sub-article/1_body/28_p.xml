<p>The manuscript analyzes a model of the virus evolution in a host population due to accumulating immune memory in previously infected individuals. The authors use the SIR model by Gog et al., 2002, to map it to results of the traveling wave theory of evolution. If the cross-immunity between the virus and the memory is long-range, the authors demonstrate that the virus persists indefinitely. The state is a Red Queen process, a never-ending chase between virus and immune system in the antigenic space. If the cross-immunity is short-range, they find out that persistent infection is either unstable or splits into new states. An effective selection coefficient which makes the mapping to traveling wave possible is calculated.</p>
