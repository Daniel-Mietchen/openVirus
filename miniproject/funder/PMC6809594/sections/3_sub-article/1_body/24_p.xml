<p>Unfortunately, not tracking the history of individual patients, i.e., not classifying patients according to previous infecting strains, is not a biologically correct approach, even though it has been done by two groups. This is not how the immune system works. One must track the memory cells from, at least, last infection. Virus infecting an individual reacts to memory in that individual, and not in other individuals. The oversimplification changes the results substantially and cannot be relied upon. For example, the turnover rate of population should not be an important parameter of the model. The dependence of the speed on parameters changes as well. We cannot be sure about the rest.</p>
