<p>To avoid huge phase space, the simplest meaningful approximation is to track the last infection of an individual, i.e., to introduce the recovered uninfected individuals density and classify then according to memory cells left from their last infecting strain. One can show that older infection are a small correction. Then, consider multiple dimensions (analytically or numerically does not matter) and demonstrate that one-dimensional path arises automatically. After 1D path is assured, solve the 1D model analytically. Rouzine and Rozhnova did exactly that, in the case of the long-range immunity. Their multi-dimensional simulation is located in the end of Results and Supplementary Information. I also recommend to consult the previous numeric work of Bedford.</p>
