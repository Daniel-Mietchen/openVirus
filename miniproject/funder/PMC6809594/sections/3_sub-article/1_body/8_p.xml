<p>2) Text should be added to refer to several previous analyses that focus on very similar questions. Of particular importance is incorporating (to a much greater extent, both in the Introduction and starting around Equation 6) text that relates to the results presented recently in Rouzine and Rozhnova, 2018, ensuring that the overlap and the differences between these two analyses is accurately described. Koelle et al., 2011,) and Andreasen and Sasaki, 2006, also address similar questions about how certain epidemiological factors (population size, breadth of cross-immunity, etc.) affect whether and how quickly antigenic diversification will occur. The results presented here should be compared to those found earlier, even if these former approaches do not consider explicitly a traveling wave model. Finally, the way in which the epidemiological dynamics are mapped to fitness and how cross-immunity is quantified is identical to the approach outlined in Luksza et al., 2014, and this paper therefore needs to be cited, most notably in the context of Equations 1-3 and 4.</p>
