<p>Persistence and transition to an endemic state is only possible if the pathogen can evade the rapid build-up of immunity via a small number of large effect antigenic mutations. This process is indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> by horizontal arrows leading to antigenically evolved strains of higher susceptibility and bears similarity to the concept of ‘evolutionary rescue’ in population genetics (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gomulkiewicz, 1995</xref>). The parameter range of the idealized SIR model that avoid extinction after a pandemic resulting in persistent endemic disease is relatively small. Yet, various factors like geographic structure, heterogeneity of host adaptation and population turn-over slow down the pandemic and extinction, thereby increasing the chances of sufficient antigenic evolution to enter the endemic, RQS-type, regime. The 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 has undergone such a transition from a pandemic to a seasonal/endemic state. We shall not investigate the transition process in detail here, but will assume that endemic regime has been reached.
