 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rouzine and Rozhnova (2018)</xref> have recently formulated a similar model of antigenic evolution of rapidly adapting pathogens. Analogously to our model, Rouzine and Rozhnova couple strain dynamics to antigenic adaptation through mutations, albeit assuming a one-dimensional antigenic space. In agreement with Rouzine and Rozhnova, we find that selection coefficients of novel mutations are inversely proportional to the cross-immunity rate
