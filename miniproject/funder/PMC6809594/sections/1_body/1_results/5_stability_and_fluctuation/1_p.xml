<p>In contrast to most population genetic models of rapid adaptation, our epidemiological model does not control the total population size directly. Instead, the pathogen population size (or prevalence) depends on the host susceptibility, which in itself is determined by recent antigenic evolution of the pathogen. The coupling of these two different effects results in a rich and complicated dynamics (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for an example trajectory): The first effect is ecological: a bloom of the pathogen depletes susceptible hosts leading to a crash in pathogen population and a tendency of the population size to oscillate
