<p>The correspondence of the multi-strain SIR and the TW models discussed above assumes that cross-immunity decays slowly compared to the coalescent time of the population, that is

  </math>
 </inline-formula>, these sub-population would no-longer compete for the hosts, becoming effectively distinct viral ‘species’ that propagate (or fail) independently of each other. Such a split has for example occurred among influenza B viruses, see
