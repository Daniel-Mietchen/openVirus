 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Van Valen, 1973</xref> In large populations the RQS exhibits oscillations in prevalence. As we will discuss further below, the RQS state is transient and either goes extinct after some time or splits into multiple antigenically diverging lineages that propagate independently. To quantitatively understand the dependence on parameters, we will further simplify the model and establish a connection to models of rapid adaptation in population genetics.

A long-lived but transient RQS regime is flanked be the regime of deterministic extinction (red) and the regime of continuous branching and diversification – the ‘speciation’ regime (blue). The RQS regime itself undergoes a transition from a steady traveling wave (yellow) to a limit cycle oscillation (green) with increasing population size. The location of the boundaries depend on the time scale of observation as the cumulative probability of extinction and speciation increases with time.
