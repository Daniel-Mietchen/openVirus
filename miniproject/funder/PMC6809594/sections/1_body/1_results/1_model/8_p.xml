 </inline-formula> hosts. This stochasticity is particularly important for novel mutant strains that are rare. Most rare strains are quickly lost by chance even if they have a growth advantage due to antigenic novelty. To account for stochasticity in a computationally efficient way, we employ a clone-based hybrid scheme where mutation and the dynamics of rare mutants are modeled stochastically, while common strains follow deterministic dynamics, see Materials and methods (Clone-based simulations).
