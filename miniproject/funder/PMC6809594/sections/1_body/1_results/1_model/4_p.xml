<p>This corresponds to the ‘order one independence closure’ by 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kryazhimskiy et al. (2007)</xref> and is known as Mean-Field approximation in physics (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 1907</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Landau and Lifshitz, 2013</xref>). The Mean-Field approximation here corresponds to ignoring correlations between subsequent infection in the individual histories. Approximating the product by the exponential is justified because the total fraction of the host population infected by any single strain in the endemic regime is typically small (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). A detailed derivation of 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref> and more detailed discussion of approximations is given in Appendix 1. While the original formulation of immunity in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> is based on the infection history of individuals (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andreasen et al., 1997</xref>), the population average over the factorized distribution of histories relates the model to status based formulations (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gog and Grenfell, 2002</xref>). While some differences between status and history-based models have been reported (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ballesteros et al., 2009</xref>), others have shown that different model types have similar properties (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson and Andreasen, 2002</xref>). The differences between these models and approximations are small compared to the crudeness with which these simple mathematical models capture the complex immunity profile of the human population. A model similar to ours has been successfully applied to influenza virus evolution (
