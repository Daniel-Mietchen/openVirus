<p>Cross-immunity and the mutation/diversification process are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. An infection with a particular strain (center of the graph) generates a cross-immunity footprint (shaded circles). Mutation away from the focal strain reduces the effect of existing immunity in the host population, but complete escape requires many mutations. Hence closely related viruses compete against each other for susceptible individuals.
