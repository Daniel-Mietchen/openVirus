<p>In a host population that develops long-lasting immunity, a pathogen can persist by infecting immunological naive individuals such as children, or through rapid antigenic evolution that enables the pathogen to evade immunity and re-infect individuals. Childhood diseases like measles or chicken pox fall into the former category, while influenza virus adapts rapidly and re-infects most humans multiple times during their lifespan. The continuous adaptation of influenza is facilitated by high mutation rates resulting in diverse populations of co-circulating viral strains. Nevertheless, almost always a single variant eventually outcompetes the others such that diversity within one subtype or lineage remains limited (
