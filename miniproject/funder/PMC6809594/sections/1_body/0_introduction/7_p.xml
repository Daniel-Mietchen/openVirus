<p>Our work aims to examine the conditions under which the evolving pathogen can maintain a spindly phylogeny with an approximately constant level of diversity – sufficient to avoid extinction, yet constrained from further branching by cross-inhibition between not too distant strains. We show that long range cross immunity in generic stochastic models of antigenic evolution generates such phylogenies. However, in the long term the viral population either ‘speciates’ into weakly interacting diverging lineages or goes extinct with rates that are controlled by three dimensionless combinations of model parameters. While the relation of these parameters to the known characteristics of influenza epidemiology and evolution is not direct, the general ‘phase diagram’ captured by the parameters of the simple model illustrates the key competing factors governing expected long-term dynamics.</p>
