<p>Traveling wave (TW) models in a one-dimensional antigenic space naturally result in spindly phylogenies: There is only one possible direction for immune escape and the fastest growing most antigenically advanced strain grows drives 
 <italic>all</italic> other strains extinct. Influenza viruses, however, can escape immunity by mutations at a large number of positions (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Wilson and Cox, 1990</xref>), suggesting antigenic space is high dimensional (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Perelson and Oster, 1979</xref>). In many dimensions, different viral strains can escape immunity via different paths and diverge sufficiently from each other until they no longer compete for hosts and thereafter propagate independently evolve. A satisfactory explanation of spindly phylogenies therefore has to describe how evolution in a high dimensional space reduces to an effectively one-dimensional path without persistent branching or rapid extinction. Several computational studies have addressed this question and identified cross-immunity (
