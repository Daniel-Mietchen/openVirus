<p>Epidemiological dynamics of influenza is often modeled using generalizations of the classic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to multiple antigenically distinct viral strains (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gog and Grenfell, 2002</xref>). Such models need to capture (i) how the infection with one strain affects susceptibility to other strains and (ii) how novel strains are generated from existing strains by mutations. A common approach has been to impose a discrete one-dimensional strain space in which new strains are generated by mutation of adjacent strains. Infection results in a reduction of susceptibility in a manner that depends on the distance in this one-dimensional strain space (
