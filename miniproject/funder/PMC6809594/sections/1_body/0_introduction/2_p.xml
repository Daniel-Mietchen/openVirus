<p>The contrast of rapid evolution while maintaining limited genetic diversity is most pronounced for the influenza virus subtype A/H3N2. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows a phylogenetic tree of HA sequences of type A/H3N2 with the characteristic ‘spindly’ shape. The most recent common ancestor of the population is rarely more than 3–5 years in the past (
