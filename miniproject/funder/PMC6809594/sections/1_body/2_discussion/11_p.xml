<p>The influenza B lineages tend to be more genetically diverse than the influenza A lineages with a typical time to the most recent common ancestor of around 6 compared to 3 years, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Influenza A/H3N2 tends to have the lowest diversity and most rapid population turnover. This difference in diversity is consistent with influenza B lineages being more prone to speciation.
