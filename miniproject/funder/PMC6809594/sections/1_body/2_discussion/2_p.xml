<p>Here, we have integrated classical multi-strain SIR models with stochastic models of adaptation to understand the interplay between the epidemiological dynamics and the accumulation of antigenic novelty. The former is dominated by the most prevalent strains, while the latter depends critically on rare pioneer strains that become dominant at later times. Our model differs from that of 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rouzine and Rozhnova (2018)</xref> in two aspects that are crucial to questions addressed here: To meaningfully study speciation and diversification, the model needs to allow for an high dimensional antigenic space. Similarly, fluctuations in pathogen population size determine the dynamics of extinction and this aspect can not be studied in models with constant population size. Including these aspects of the epi-evolutionary dynamics allowed to define a ‘phase’ diagram that summarizes qualitatively different behavior as a function of the relevant parameter combinations, see
