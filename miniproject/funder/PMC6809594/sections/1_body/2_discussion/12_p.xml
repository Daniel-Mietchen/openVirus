<p>The typical diversity of these viruses needs to be compared to their rate of antigenic evolution. Hemagglutination inhibition titers drop by about 0.7–1 log2 per year in A/H3N2 compared to 0.1–0.4 log2 per year for influenza B lineages (

 </inline-formula> is similar for the different lineages, suggesting that the distinct rates of genetic and antigenic evolution can not be used as a straight forward rationalization of the speciation event of Influenza B and the lack of speciation of influenza A lineages. Nor should such an explanation be expected as there is only a single observation of speciation. We note that currently circulating A/H3N2 viruses are exceptionally diverse with a common ancestor that existed about 8 years in the past. Furthermore, the cocirculating 3c.3a and 3c.2a are antigenically distinct and it is conceivable that further antigenic evolution will result in speciation of A/H3N2 viruses.
