<p>In practice, the range of cross-immunity required to prevent speciation might be smaller than the idealized model. Our model assumes that the pathogen population can escape immunity via many equivalent mutational path. But in reality, the number of path to escape will be limited and some path more accessible than others, which will reduce the tendency to speciate and the necessity for large
