<p>Previous studies have shown that the rate of branching in the speciation regime increases with population size and mutation rate consistent with the phase diagram (

The latter increases the typical antigenic effect of successful mutations, which decreases the radius of cross-immunity when measured in units of mutations making the population more prone to speciate.
