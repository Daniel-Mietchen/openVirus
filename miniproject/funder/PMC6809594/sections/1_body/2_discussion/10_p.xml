<p>Different influenza virus lineages, in contrast, persist in the human population, suggesting that they correspond to parameters that fall into the RQS region of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the different subtypes display quantitatively different circulation and diversity patterns that allow for a direct, albeit limited, comparison to theoretical models: subtype A/H1N1 circulated with interruption from 1918 to 2009, A(H2N2) circulated for about 10 years until 1968, A/H3N2 emerged in 1968 and is still circulating today, and the triple reassortant 2009 H1N1 lineage, called A(H1N1pdm), settled into a seasonal pattern following the pandemic in 2009. Influenza B viruses have split into two separate lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata) in the 1970s (
