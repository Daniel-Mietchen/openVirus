<p>While we have shown that the natural tendency of SIR models to oscillate couples to the instability of the nose of the pathogen fitness distribution, making a quantitative link to the observed epidemiological dynamics of the flu is difficult on account of seasonal oscillation in transmissivity. The latter confounding factor is widely believed to be the cause behind observed seasonality of the flu. Including explicit temporal variation (in

   <mi>Î²</mi>

 </inline-formula>) in our model would lock the frequency of the prevalence oscillation to the seasonal cycle, possibly resulting in subharmonic modulation, yet distinguishing such a modulation on top of an already stochastic process is hard. Much remains to be done: finite birth rates, distinct age distributions (as for example is the case for the two influenza B lineages), realistic distribution of antigenic effect sizes, or very long range T-cell-mediated immunity would all be interesting avenues for future work.
