<p>We aligned HA sequences using mafft (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>) and reconstructed phylogenies with IQ-Tree (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Phylogenies were further processed and time-scaled with the augur (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hadfield et al., 2018</xref>) and TreeTime (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sagulenko et al., 2018</xref>). The analysis pipeline and scripts are available on github in repository 2019_Yan_flu_analysis of the neherlab organization.
