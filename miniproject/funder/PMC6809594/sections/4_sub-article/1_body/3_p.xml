<p>We now discuss the work by Rouzine and Rozhnova (R&amp;R) at greater length. R&amp;R map a multi-strain model in a one-dimensional antigenic landscape to a TW models of population genetics and the formulation of the model as well as the mapping to TW models is analogous to our approach. In contrast to R&amp;R, our point of departure is a model in a high dimensional antigenic space and we use this model to show how the effectively one-dimensional TW emerges rather than introducing this as model assumption. R&amp;R use their model to infer parameters through explicit comparison to influenza diversity data, which we don’t attempt. Instead, we use this model to explore the processes of extinction and speciation which can’t be studied in one-antigenic dimension with constant population size examined in R&amp;R.</p>
