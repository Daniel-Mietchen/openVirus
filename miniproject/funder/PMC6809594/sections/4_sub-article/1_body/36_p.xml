<p>- We show how qualitative features of epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of rapidly adapting pathogens depend on parameters in a generic model of evolution in a high dimensional antigenic and genetic space. We delineate parameter regimes corresponding to speciation/diversification, single strain persistence, and extinction after a pandemic in a unified frame work. All previous analysis of this problem were either restricted to low dimensional spaces, a few strains, or purely numerical in nature.</p>
