<p>Having provided the reasons why we think weak-inhibition approximation is appropriate, we note that the utility of (3) as a model of susceptibility does not end there! To wit, this approximation correctly captures the cross-inhibiting contribution of distant strains (on account of 
 <italic>K
  <sub>ab</sub>
 </italic>for those strains being much less than 1, so that quadratic terms in 
 <italic>K</italic> can be neglected compared to linear ones). Hence, even in the case of strong immunity 
 <italic>α</italic> ≈ 1, only correlation terms involving close strains could contribute. In the traveling wave description of continuous adaptation, most relevant effects involve the spreading of the newly emerging antigenic variants in the “nose” of the fitness distribution. While these strains are antigenically close they occur at low frequencies, so that 
 <italic>R
  <sub>a</sub>
 </italic> ≪ 1 and the correlations can again be neglected, the population-wide susceptibility to these strains is dominated by the effect of more distant strains (from further in the past).
