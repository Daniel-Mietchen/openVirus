<p>In contrast, the proposal by reviewer #2 to simplify the problem by only tracking the last infection (that is dropping all terms in 
 <sup>Π</sup>
 <italic>
  <sub>b</sub>
 </italic>(1 − 
 <italic>K
  <sub>ab</sub>σ

 </italic>) but the most recent one) is completely arbitrary and counterfactual. Fonville et al., 2014, have shown that immunity is maintained over decades and new infection results in a back-boost rather than a reset of the immunity landscape. It is also problematic as it would artificially facilitate speciation: It would increase susceptibility to viruses from sister clades since infection with one virus “wipes out” immune memory induced by a common ancestor.
