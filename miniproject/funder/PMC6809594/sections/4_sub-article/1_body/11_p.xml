<p>In a strict sense, the endemic regime is always metastable as explicitly shown in Figure 5 which shows that RQS always goes away eventually either through extinction or through speciation. We have added text to further explain the meaning of Figure 5 to the reader. However the dependence of the extinction rate on model parameters might change through the addition of different model components. Instead of the logarithmic dependence of extinction rate on population size, this dependence might become polynomial or exponential in models that dampen population size fluctuations more strongly. We have added a short paragraph emphasizing that long range immunity and other features that dampen oscillations (population turn over, geographic structure, etc.) will tend to stabilize the RQS state.</p>
