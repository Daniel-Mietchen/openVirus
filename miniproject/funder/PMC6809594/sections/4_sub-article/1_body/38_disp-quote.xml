 <p>The editor and reviewers have again carefully studied the previously revised manuscript and the authors' response to previous criticism. We appreciate the value of simplified models; however, our previous comments we designed primarily towards making the simplifying assumptions explicit and to embed the epidemiological model better into the context of previous work on the subject, which we also discussed in the review consultation. Both issues are not yet adequately addressed in the current revision, and we regard the following points as essential for publication of this manuscript:</p>
 <p>1) The assumptions underlying the epidemiological model, in particular with respect to the applicability to influenza, should be made explicit. It is not clear to us whether the model used here is indeed a generalization of previous models, as claimed.</p>
 <p>Specific points:</p>
 <p>a) Some justification should be given for the steps leading from a general multi-strain immunity model to their Equations 1 â€“ 3, e.g. along the lines of Rozhnova and Rouzine. For example, the authors could try to estimate, by the order of magnitude, the error of this approximation, at least, in a simple population configuration.</p>
