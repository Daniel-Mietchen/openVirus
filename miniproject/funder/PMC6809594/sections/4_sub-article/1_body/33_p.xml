<p>- one- vs multidimensional trajectories:The reviewer suggests to “consider a multi-dimensional model […] and assure that a one dimensional path arises automatically. […] solve the 1D model analytically”. However, we show that a 1D path does not arise automatically and delineate conditions in which it does. Within these parameter ranges, we then investigate the model analytically as suggested by the reviewer. We are well aware of the work by Bedford et al., 2012, and Rouzine and Rozhnova, 2018. In Rouzine and Rozhnova, 2018, the 1D traveling wave is inherent in the model by either allowing for only one antigenic direction or imposing a preferred direction of antigenic escape (section 2.1 of the appendix of Rouzine and Rozhnova, 2018, – there seems to be inconsistent notation and a confusion of recovered and susceptible classes in the appendix).</p>
