 <p>Essential revisions:</p>
 <p>The reviewers all agreed that the presented analyses were thorough and that the results were interesting. However, they also felt that several essential revisions were required:</p>
 <p>1) The manuscript makes use of an existing status-based SIR model when mapping epidemiological dynamics on to the traveling wave evolutionary model. This model, first, should be explained in greater detail and with more clarity in the manuscript text. Further, this multi-strain model is one of two general types of multi-strain models (the other being a history-based model formulation). Are the phase diagram results robust to other SIR model formulations, including history-based formulations and the model formulation by Lin et al., 2003? Previous relevant work (Ballesteros et al. PLOS One) indicates that this might not be the case.</p>
