<p>While infection history of an individual is important for predicting her/his susceptibility to infection by a given strain, the effective rate of spreading of that strain depends on the average susceptibility of individuals. This averaging makes our “mean field”-type approximation for population-wide susceptibility a natural first step. Let us restate here that there is a direct relation between the form of susceptibility that we use in the our work and the infection history description. It is easy to see that our expression for 
 <italic>S</italic> given in Equation 3 is essentially exact in the limit of weak inhibition. The probability 
 <italic>p
  <sub>a,i</sub>

 <italic>a</italic> can be expressed as
