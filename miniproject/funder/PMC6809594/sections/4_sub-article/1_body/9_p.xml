<p>We have added a paragraph (bottom of column 1 on p 6) discussing typical values of 
 <italic>q</italic> in influenza populations and making explicit comment that flu evolution is not likely to be in the asymptotic regime of large 
 <italic>q</italic>. Nevertheless, we and others before us (references in the text), find that qualitative features of the TW models extend to modest values of 
 <italic>q</italic> (as seen through comparison with direct simulation). Instead of adding a dotted line to indicate crossover in the phase diagrams of Figure 3B, C we added a note in the caption explaining that boundary of the”extinction” regime corresponds to 
 <italic>q</italic> ∼
 <italic>o</italic>(1). More detailed view of the range of 
 <italic>q</italic> corresponding to the RQS state is provided by Figure 5. We have added a remark about the range of 
 <italic>q</italic> to the discussion of Figure 5 in the text, noting that (asymptotic) region of large 
 <italic>q</italic> can only be reached in the limit of long-range cross-inhibition.
