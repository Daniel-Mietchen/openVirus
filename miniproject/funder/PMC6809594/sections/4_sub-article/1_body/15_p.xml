<p>However, in response to our revised manuscript reviewer #2 now requests that we redo the analysis using a model that explicitly keeps track of the infection histories of all individuals. Based on previous work by several authors and our current understanding of influenza epidemiology and immunology, we have argued in the manuscript that this level of detail is not necessary and that the essential aspects of the dynamics are captured by simpler models that instead of individual infection histories keep track of susceptibilities to different strains in the population. We stand by this argument.</p>
