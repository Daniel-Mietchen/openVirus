<p>Last but not least, expression (3) is an example of a “Mean Field Theory” type of approximations that replace the average of an exponential by an exponential of the average, neglecting correlation effects. This type of an approximation has an illustrious record of providing valuable insight into complex phenomena and are universally accepted in Physics: they are well recognized as the starting point for mathematical modeling.</p>
