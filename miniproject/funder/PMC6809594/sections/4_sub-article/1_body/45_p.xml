<p>We have added a discussion of the infected fraction predicted by our model. The values predicted by our model are compatible with observation and up to logarithmic factors agree with predictions by Rouzine and Rozhnova. Similar results hold for the average selection coefficient 
 <italic>s</italic> (called 
 <italic>σ</italic> in R&amp;R), where we predict the same qualitative dependence on parameters. The main difference (we predict a weaker dependence on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) can be traced to the “most-recent” approximation to the immunity history made by R&amp;R. We show (see above) that our approximation is more accurate. We also discuss the results of Bedford et al., 2012m who studied dependence of genetic diversity and the tendency to speciate in large scale agent based simulations. Their observations are consistent with our analytic results.
