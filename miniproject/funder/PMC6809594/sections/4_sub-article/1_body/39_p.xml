<p>We have added an Appendix 1 that explains in detail how a model based on individual infection histories reduces approximately to our “mean-field-theory” (MFT) type model of cross-immunity. We discuss the underlying assumptions in the light of known influenza immunology. Diversity of immune responses, non-perfect immune protection, and long-lasting immunity with known back-boost effects all suggest that the entire infection history is important at the level of individuals, but that population level dynamics is well described by a factorized distribution of histories. Following the suggestion of the decision letter, we evaluate the accuracy of our approximation (in Figure 8) for a specific “simple population configuration”, adopting for this purpose the scenario of periodic reinfection of individuals specifically considered by Rozhnova and Rouzine (R&amp;R), which allows us to explicitly compare with the approximation used in their paper. In this R&amp;R scenario, infection histories of individuals contain strong temporal correlations so that it may be expected to be a tough case for the MFT approximation (which neglects correlations in evaluating population averages). Nevertheless, we show (in Figure 8) that our approximation to the population averaged susceptibility is quite accurate in the relevant parameter regime. In particular, it is more accurate than the “most recent” approximation advocated for by one of the reviewers and used by Rouzine and Rozhnova.</p>
