<p>We agree that our previous presentation on how 
 <italic>q</italic> is related to the phase diagram was not optimal. We have now expanded our explanation of the regime boundaries in the phase diagram of Figure 3 specifically discussion the nature of the “critical” values of 
 <italic>q</italic> (associated with these boundaries) and stressing how the transitions to extinction and speciation regimes depend on the time scale of observation. To this effect, we have added a subsection “Red Queen State is transient” (just before the Discussion section) and another figure (Figure 7) that explicitly shows the regimes of extinction and speciation in the plane of 
 <italic>q</italic> and the observation time scale. We have also edited Figure 3B, C to clarify the labelling of the regime boundaries.
