<p>We note that given this form of susceptibility and the homogeneity property of Equations 2-3 in the manuscript, parameter 
 <italic>Î±</italic> can be eliminated by rescaling of 
 <italic>R</italic> and 
 <italic>I</italic> fractions, i.e. can be absorbed into effective host population size and does not explicitly appear in model analysis and simulation.
