<p>- We connect the population genetics of rapid adaptation and with multistrain models of pathogens in a population that builds up immunity and show how epidemiological oscillation couple to the evolutionary dynamics of the pathogens. Rouzine and Rozhnova, 2018, don’t account for this crucial interaction – they consider a time invariant traveling wave solution of constant size.</p>
