<p>We have provided more details in the derivation of susceptibility model (Equation 3) adding a discussion which connects it to “status” and “history” based models. Our approximation is based on a factorization of the probability of different immune histories of individual hosts, which directly relates to the approach of Kryazhimskiy et al., 2007, in enabling a drastic reduction of the state space relative to the original “status” and “history” models. This approximation retains the dependence of the susceptibility of the host population to the prior history of infections, without tracking infection histories of individuals. Our resulting model of susceptibility is analogous to that derived in Kryazhimskiy et al., 2007, and the one used, prior to that, by Gog and Grenfell, 2002. These connections are fully acknowledged in references. We have also added references to and comments on Lin et al. and Ballesteros et al. Ballesteros et al. present four different two strain models (history vs status, reduced infectivity vs reduced susceptibility) and compare simulation results for these models. Only one (the status based reduced infectivity model) shows recurrent waves of infection by the mutant strain at high levels of cross-immunity. However, the parameters for cross-immunity of these models cannot be compared quantitatively. The differences between the simulations are thus due to choices of values of parameters that are phenomenological in nature and don’t have a one-to-one correspondence to reality. In the multi-strain case, we expect all models to exhibit qualitatively similar dynamics with appropriately chosen parameters – especially after reducing the high-dimensional history of status space to a linear number of variables, see Kryazhimsky et al.</p>
