 <p>Koelle et al., 2011, and Andreasen and Sasaki, 2006, also address similar questions about how certain epidemiological factors (population size, breadth of cross-immunity, etc.) affect whether and how quickly antigenic diversification will occur. The results presented here should be compared to those found earlier, even if these former approaches do not consider explicitly a traveling wave model.</p>
