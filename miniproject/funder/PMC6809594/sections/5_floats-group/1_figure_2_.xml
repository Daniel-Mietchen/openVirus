  <title>Viral populations escape adaptive immunity by accumulating antigenic mutations.</title>
  <p>Via cross-reactivity, the immunity foot-print of ancestral variants (center of the graph) mediates competition between related emerging viral strains and can drive all but one of the competing lineages extinct. At high mutation rates and relatively short range of antigenic cross-reactivity, different viral lineages can escape inhibition and continue to evolve independently.</p>
