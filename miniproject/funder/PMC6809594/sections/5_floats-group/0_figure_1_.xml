  <title>Spindly phylogenies and speciation in different human seasonal influenza virus lineages.</title>
  <p>The top left panel shows a phylogeny of the HA segment of influenza A virus of subtype H3N2 from its emergence in 1968 to 2018. The virus population never accumulates much diversity but is rapidly evolving. The lower left panel shows a phylogeny of the HA segment of influenza B viruses from 1940 to 2018. In the 70s, the population split into two lineages known as Victoria (B/Vic) and Yamagata (B/Yam) in the 1970s. The graphs on the right quantify diversity via the time to the most recent common ancestor
