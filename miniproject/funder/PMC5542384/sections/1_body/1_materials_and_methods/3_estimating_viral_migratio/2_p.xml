<p>To provide a minimal set of location state changes that provide an adequate description of viral spread, we used Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. BSSVS uses Bayes factors (BF) and binary indicator variables (I) to identify statistically supported viral lineage movement routes. Values of BF &gt; 6 and I &gt; 0.5 were considered as denoting a significant migration pathway, where BF &gt; 1,000 indicates decisive statistical support, 100 ≤ BF &lt; 1,000 indicates very strong support, 30 ≤ BF &lt; 100 indicates strong support, 10 ≤ BF &lt; 30 indicates substantial support and 6 ≤ BF &lt; 10 indicates support [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which provided a quantitative measure of successful viral introductions among countries [
