<p>To reconstruct the spatial dynamics of DENV-1–3, we used a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) phylogeographic discrete approach [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] that estimates the ancestral locations along each branch of a viral phylogeny, as implemented in BEAST v1.8.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A GTR+ I+Γ nucleotide substitution model was used in this analysis. Three independent MCMC chains were run for 150 million states, sampling every 15,000 states after the removal of 10% burn-in. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarized using TreeAnnotator and visualized using SPREAD [
