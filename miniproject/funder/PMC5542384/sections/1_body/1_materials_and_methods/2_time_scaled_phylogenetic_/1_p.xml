<p>For each serotype subsampled data set, we first estimated the correlation between root-to-tip genetic divergence and sequence sampling dates, using TempEst [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005694.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To reconstruct past population dynamics, we used a coalescent-based Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) method with the time-aware smoothing parameter [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], as implemented in BEAST v1.8.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A GTR+I+Γ nucleotide substitution model and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model were used, with a prior distribution for the evolutionary rate parameter set to a Γ distribution with shape = 0.001 and scale = 1000. The BEAGLE library was used to accelerate computation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005694.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For each serotype, three independent analyses of 150 million generations were performed, sampling parameters and trees every 15,000 generations. Analyses were combined after the removal of a burn-in of 10–20% of the samples and were checked visually in Tracer v.1.5.
