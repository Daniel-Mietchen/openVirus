<p>To understand the spatial circulation of DENV in Asia, we reconstructed the past spatial transmission patterns of serotypes DENV-1â€“3 over the study period, for each country from which sequences were sampled (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005694.g004">Fig 4</xref>). A Bayesian stochastic search variable selection procedure was employed to infer a minimum set of location exchange events, while a Markov jump (MJ) analysis was used to quantity viral lineage movement among pairs of locations (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005694.g005">Fig 5</xref> indicates several significant migration links (with BF support &gt; 1000). For DENV-1 these are between Cambodia and Vietnam, Thailand and Laos, and Singapore and China. For DENV-2, the well supported links are between Thailand and Cambodia, China and Indonesia, and Indonesia and Singapore. Finally, for DENV-3 the strongly supported links are between India and Sri Lanka (BF &gt; 800). We also inferred a number of other well supported movements among countries; a full list is provided in
