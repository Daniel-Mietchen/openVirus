<p>Evolutionary analysis of 327 DENV-1 E gene sequences showed that Asian sequences fell into five distinct lineages, genotypes I—V. The 357 DENV-2 E gene sequences were classified into five genotypes: Asia I, Asia II, America/Asia, Cosmopolitan, and the America genotype. Further, the 202 DENV-3 E gene sequences comprised four genotypes, genotypes I and III—V. The estimated evolutionary rates of the E gene of each serotype, under the selected evolutionary model, were 7.50×10
 <sup>−4</sup> (95% highest posterior density, HPD: 6.73×10−4–8.28×10
 <sup>−4</sup>) substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) for DENV-1, 8.14×10
 <sup>−4</sup> (95% HPD: 7.38×10−4–8.94×10
 <sup>−4</sup>) s/s/y for DENV-2, and 7.96×10
 <sup>−4</sup> (95% HPD: 7.01×10−4–8.89×10
 <sup>−4</sup>) s/s/y for DENV-3. The corresponding estimates of the time of the most recent common ancestors (TMRCAs) of DENV-1–3 in Asia were 1911 (95% HPD: 1891–1928), 1901 (95%HPD 1868–1931, after removal of sylvatic lineages) and 1929 (95% HPD: 1916–1941) respectively.
