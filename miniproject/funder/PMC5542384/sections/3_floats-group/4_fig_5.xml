  <title>Strongly supported pathways of lineage movement and histograms of the total number of location state transitions of DENV-1–3 in Asia for 1956 to 2015.</title>
  <p>(A) Strongly supported state transitions, indicating migration of DENV-1–3 lineages among discrete locations. The size of points corresponds to the number of geographic connections. The colored lines represent statistical support for a given viral movement pathway. Only those viral lineage movements supported with a BF &gt; 6 are shown. (B) Number of expected transitions into and out of each country per serotype. Error bars represent 95% BCIs.</p>
