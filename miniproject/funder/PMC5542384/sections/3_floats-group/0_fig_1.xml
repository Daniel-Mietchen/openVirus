  <title>Co-circulation of dengue virus serotypes in Asia.</title>
  <p>(A). Locations of available viral sequences (within regions defined by sampling effort) and airports. Circle areas are proportional to the number of genetic sequences from a particular geographic location and for a given serotype (dark grey: DENV-1, orange: DENV-2, green: DENV-3, and yellow: DENV-4). Grey dots represent the airports for which passenger flux data was used in the analysis. Sequences obtained from patients in Japan, 2014 are indicated by asterisk. (B) The upper panel shows the proportion of sequences from each serotype per year, while the lower panel shows the number of serotypes isolated per year in Asia. Co-occurrence of multiple serotypes in a single year has become increasingly frequent.</p>
