  <title>Centrality measures of the air passenger network and number of state transitions.</title>
  <p>(A) Scatterplot of centrality measures for the air travel network based on degree and betweenness. The “degree” centrality of a given country (node) refers to the number of airlines linking it in the airline network, and the “betweenness” centrality of a given country measures the extent to which a country lies on routes between other countries in airline network (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). The size of each point corresponds to the number of expected Markov jump transitions (including both importations and exportations). (B) Net Markov jump counts, summed across all 3 DENV serotypes. For each country, we summarize the average net Markov jumps (jumps to—jumps from) and their 95% credible intervals. The estimates are ordered from the lowest to highest number of net jumps.
