An EV71 epidemic swept Taiwan in 1998, which caused 405 severe cases and 78 deaths [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After the epidemic, multiple and real-time national enterovirus surveillance systems were established by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, including viral lab network; outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room visits for hand-foot-and-mouth-disease (HFMD) and/or herpangina (HA); and mandatory notification of enterovirus severe cases [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. After the first EV71 epidemic in 1998, EV71 cases occurred again in 2000&#x02013;2001, 2005, 2008, and 2012 based on the surveillance data [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. There seems to be a nationwide EV71 epidemic every 3 to 5 years.

No EV71 vaccine is licensed in Taiwan up to now. Contact with HFMD and/or HA cases was defined as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, sharing food, or playing with children who had HFMD and/or HA. All interviewers were trained, and contact history information was collected from several family members to minimize recall bias. The questionnaires for preschool children, students and adults are listed in the supplementary files (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0224110.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0224110.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0224110.s003">S3</xref> Files).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Laboratory methods for the EV71 neutralizing antibody</title><p>The serum neutralizing antibody response is the major indicator of EV71 protective immunity.

Thereafter, rhabdomyosarcoma cells were added into each reaction well and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Each plate included a cell control, serum control, and virus back-titration. The cytopathic effect was monitored from 5 to 6 days after incubation, and the serotiter was determined when the cytopathic effect was observed in one TCID50 of the virus back-titration.

The EV71 seropositive rates in 2017 were very low, at 4% to 10%, in the very-high-risk group (&#x0003c;6-year-old preschool children) and not high, at 31%, in primary school students. The risk factors associated with seropositivity in preschool children included female gender, having siblings, more siblings, and contact with HFMD and/or HA whereas the only risk factor associated with seropositivity in adults was having children in the family in addition to older age.</p><p>The lower seropositive rates in young children observed in 2007 and 2017 correlate well with the fact that there were no major EV71 outbreaks during the last 10 years. Factors underlying the decreasing seropositivity may include lower birth rates and strict implementation of preventive measures during this time period [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The low birth rate and having only one child in most families in Taiwan make children get EV71 infection at an older age in comparison with the previous periods of the late 1990s or early 2000s. In our previous study conducted in 2001&#x02013;2002, we found a very high EV71 household transmission rate of 84% among siblings if there were any siblings infected with EV71 in the household [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Taiwan has the sixth-lowest birth rate in the world, according to the most recent data released by the Central Intelligence Agent World Factbook [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the fertility rate in Taiwan was only 1.13 children per woman in 2017 and 1.218 children per woman in 2018, which was the third lowest in the world [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because of having only one child in most families in recent years, there is no elder sibling(s) to spread viruses, including EV71, into the other family members; thus, most children acquire viral infection when they go to school or kindergarten. Therefore, the age of getting EV71 becomes older than in previous periods. In addition, EV71 infection at different ages has different symptomatic ratios and severity [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The symptomatic ratios are much lower [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the severity is milder when children get an EV71 infection at older ages [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>After the nationwide EV71 epidemic that occurred in Taiwan in 1998, multiple and real-time national enterovirus surveillance systems have been established by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control since 2000 and include viral lab network; outpatient, inpatient, and emergency room visits for HFMD and/or HA from National Health Insurance claim data; and mandatory notification of enterovirus severe cases [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The real-time EV surveillance makes early detection of EV71 possible, and strict implementation of preventive measures during EV71 circulation periods are applied, so these preventative measures may limit the spread of EV71 [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, to reduce the risk of enterovirus clustering, class suspension has been executed for the pre-school education and care institutions. Strengthened implementation of infection control measures is applied in hospitals and postpartum nursing care centers to reduce the risk of enterovirus clusters. For medical care of severe enterovirus cases, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control have constructed a medical service network for recent 2 decades and workshops are held on the clinical treatment of critical enterovirus complications to enhance doctors&#x02019; skills every year. There has been a marked decrease in severe and fatal EV71 cases after 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the results of this seroepidemiology study also endorse the impact of a well-established real-time enterovirus surveillance system and all the preventive measures to limit the spread of EV71 in Taiwan. Other speculations may include viral evolution, as evidenced by EV71-like gene elements appearing in other cocirculating EV-A viruses by intensive recombination [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The virulence of EV71 could thus be modified. Overall, the viral (recombination and mutation), host (low birth rate) and environmental (increased surveillance) factors might change transmission dynamics of EV71. However, with the accumulation of a susceptible high-risk group during the past 20 years, new epidemics could occur in the years to come. Careful monitoring and preventive measures are still necessary.</p><p>Risk factors associated with EV71 seropositivity were female gender, having siblings, more siblings, classmates with HFMD and/or HA and contact with HFMD and/or HA in high-risk groups. The seropositive rate in females is significantly greater than in males. However, the male-to-female ratio of symptomatic and/or severe enterovirus infections shifted toward males and was approximately 1.5 [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The role of gender on the susceptibility to EV71 and the severity of EV71 infections remains unclear and needs further investigation.</p><p>Among different regions in Taiwan, 3- to 5-year-old children and primary school students in rural areas had greater seropositive rates. In our previous seroepidemiology conducted in 1999, living in rural areas was also a significant risk factor for EV71 infection [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The possible reasons may be poorer hygiene behaviors and larger family size, resulting in more possible contacts and transmissions of EV71 in rural areas. The socioeconomic and educational gaps between urban and rural areas might affect the parents&#x02019; and/or caregivers&#x02019; hygiene behavior, which would in turn have some impact on the infection incidence and/or severity. For example, caregivers in the critical group (encephalitis with or without cardiopulmonary failure) of EV71 infection had a significantly lower rate in terms of cleaning the faucet after washing their hands, as our previous study reported [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Young children in Taiwan have very low EV71 seropositive rates now and therefore harbor a high risk of developing an EV71 infection. Our earlier studies also showed that young children are at especially high risk of developing severe disease after EV71 infections [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Future EV71 vaccine policy should be targeted to young children, who will be the first priority to receive the EV71 vaccine in Taiwan.</p><p>For 16-50-year-old people, the significant risk factor associated with EV71 seropositivity was having children in addition to older age. Bidirectional transmission of EV71 between children and parents or other household adults does occur, parents or other household adults might transmit EV71 to their children and vice versa. For example, a Japanese mother developed encephalitis caused by intrafamilial transmission of EV71 from her 1-year-old son and it also elucidated the risk for EV71 encephalitis even in adults [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, parents and other household adults have to be cautious and take preventive measures once their children have such infection.</p><p>We further compared EV71 serostatus among different countries in <xref rid="pone.0224110.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Among different countries, the EV71 seropositive rates varied greatly. The seropositive rates of children in China, Thailand and Cambodia were very high, ranging from 35 to 98% [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The rates (15 to 37%) of children in Singapore in 2008&#x02013;2010 were comparable to those in Taiwan in 2007 and 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The rates in Russia varied in different regions: the rates were lower (5 to 19%) in urban areas, such as Moscow and Rostov, than those (20 to 83%) in rural areas, such as Tyva [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Severe EV71 cases occurred more frequently in countries, such as China and Cambodia which had greater seropositive rates [<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0224110.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and it indicates greater disease burden in these countries.

Young children will be the group with the greatest priority to receive the EV71 vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0224110.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Questionnaire for preschool children with Chinese-English parallel texts.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0224110.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0224110.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Questionnaire for students with Chinese-English parallel texts.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0224110.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0224110.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Questionnaire for adults with Chinese-English parallel texts.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0224110.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0224110.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>NJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lennette</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name>. <article-title>An apparently new enterovirus isolated from patients with disease of the central nervous system</article-title>. <source>J Infect Dis</source>. <year>1974</year>;<volume>129</volume>:<fpage>304</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>309</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/infdis/129.3.304</pub-id>

</p><p>Reviewers' comments:</p><p>Comments to the Author</p><p>Reviewer #1: The manuscript &#x0201c;Enterovirus 71 Seroepidemiology in Taiwan in 2017 and comparison of those rates in 1997, 1999 and 2007&#x0201d; provided an updated serostatus of EV71 in different region of Taiwan. This is a timely study as the threat of enterovirus infection continuously posing significant concern worldwide.</p><p>Response: thank you very much for your comment and appreciation.</p><p>Below are my comments for improvement.</p><p>1) Is there any patient data co-relating with the seropositive specimen? For example, successful rate of detecting viral RNAs/antigens in specimens of seropositive patients; the history of seropositive patients with enterovirus-related syndromes.</p><p>Response: we did not have any data of detecting viral RNAs/antigens in specimens of seropositive patients, but we did have data on enterovirus-related ( HFMD or herpangina) history of seropositive children in Table 2. For example, 34% of seropositive preschool children had history of HFMD and 24% had history of herpangina (Table 2).</p><p>2) The authors suggested that female gender could be a risk factor of EV71 seropositivity. The comparison appears to be based on the absolute number of seropositivity in between male and female. The comparison may be subjected to the biases due to disproportion of male:female ratio within the community. The authors may need to consider this point and perform normalization accordingly.</p><p>Response: we agree with this comment, so normalization was done for Figure 1 accordingly to minimize any disproportion of male:female ratio within the community. </p><p>3) The number of tested specimen (n) needs to be indicated in table 3.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion and we added the numbers of seropositive and tested specimen in Table 3. However, only those numbers are not available in Cambodia and we can not add them.</p><p>4) The authors suggested the lower EV71 seropositivity detected in specimen of 2007 and 2017 could be due to the absence of disease outbreak. Does the high seropositivity detected in other countries, for example, Cambodia (Table 3), correlate to an EV71 outbreak?</p><p>Response: We agree with your comment that the high seropositivity detected in other countries correlate to an EV71 outbreak. We mentioned it in the Discussion: Severe EV71 cases occurred more frequently in countries, such as China and Cambodia which had greater seropositive rates [7, 23, 31-33] and it indicates greater disease burden in these countries. EV71 outbreak occurred in Cambodia in 2012, it characterized by severe encephalitis with cardiovascular collapse and pulmonary edema seized international headlines and resulted in the death of at least 54 children [31], and more than 2 thousands of laboratory-confirmed EV71 cases died in China from 2008 to 2015 [7].</p><p>5) Figure 2 showed similar but delayed trend of EV71 seropositivity between specimens obtained from 1997 and 1999 to 2007 and 2017. For example, an age 1 EV71 seropositive specimen detected in 1999 will become an age 8 EV71 seropositive specimen detected in 2007. In other words, the delay could be an indication of effective infectious disease control. The authors should discuss what infectious disease control policy may have been implemented during this period of time. When comparing with data from other countries, which ways do Taiwan do better or worse?</p><p>Response: Thank you very much for your detailed review and suggestion. We described more infectious disease control policy in the Discussion to share our experience, which may be helpful to other countries.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Comments to the Author</p><p>The manuscript aims to explore the EV71 serostatus in Taiwan. The authors made efforts to test the EV71 neutralizing antibody with serum samples and compared EV71 serostatus among 1997, 1999, 2007 and 2017. They illustrated that the EV71 seropositive rates in children were significantly lower in 2017, compared with the rates in 1997, 1999 and 2008. These results prompt the necessity of continuous surveillance for the prevention and control of the disease infected with EV71. The main limitations of the manuscript are listed below.</p><p>1. Did the questionnaire include the subjects' vaccination history?</p><p>Response: The questionnaire include the subjects' vaccination history. We deposited the questionnaires as supplementary files with Chinese-English parallel texts. We did not show it in the original manuscript since EV71 vaccine is not commercially available now in Taiwan and the current vaccination did not affect EV71 serostatus. We added it in the revised manuscript since you and the readers may be curious about it.</p><p>2. As the authors indicated that the male-to-female ratio of symptomatic and/or severe enterovirus infections shifted toward males in the discussion section. While the female gender was the risk factors associated with EV71 seropositivity in this study, and this conclusion was based the analysis of in preschool children in 2017. The risk factors could be analyzed including other ages.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. We analyzed the risk factors in the other age groups, which are shown in the text: For the 6 to 15 year-old children, no significant risk factors were found except older age. For 16-50-year-old people, the significant risk factor associated with EV71 seropositivity was having children in addition to older age: 61% of seropositive 16-50-year-old people had children in their families but only 27% of seronegative 16-50-year-old people had children in their families (p&#x0003c;0.001). Therefore, we did not find gender difference in the other age groups.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0224110.s004"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers comment.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0224110.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0224110.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0224110.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Dong-Yan</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2019 Dong-Yan Jin</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2019</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Dong-Yan Jin</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0224110" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
