<p>The manuscript aims to explore the EV71 serostatus in Taiwan. The authors made efforts to test the EV71 neutralizing antibody with serum samples and compared EV71 serostatus among 1997, 1999, 2007 and 2017. They illustrated that the EV71 seropositive rates in children were significantly lower in 2017, compared with the rates in 1997, 1999 and 2008. These results prompt the necessity of continuous surveillance for the prevention and control of the disease infected with EV71. The main limitations of the manuscript are listed below.</p>
