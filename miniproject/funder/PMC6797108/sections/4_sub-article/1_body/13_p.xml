<p>Response: We agree with your comment that the high seropositivity detected in other countries correlate to an EV71 outbreak. We mentioned it in the Discussion: Severe EV71 cases occurred more frequently in countries, such as China and Cambodia which had greater seropositive rates [7, 23, 31-33] and it indicates greater disease burden in these countries. EV71 outbreak occurred in Cambodia in 2012, it characterized by severe encephalitis with cardiovascular collapse and pulmonary edema seized international headlines and resulted in the death of at least 54 children [31], and more than 2 thousands of laboratory-confirmed EV71 cases died in China from 2008 to 2015 [7].</p>
