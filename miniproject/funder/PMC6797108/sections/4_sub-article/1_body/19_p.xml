<p>Response: The questionnaire include the subjects' vaccination history. We deposited the questionnaires as supplementary files with Chinese-English parallel texts. We did not show it in the original manuscript since EV71 vaccine is not commercially available now in Taiwan and the current vaccination did not affect EV71 serostatus. We added it in the revised manuscript since you and the readers may be curious about it.</p>
