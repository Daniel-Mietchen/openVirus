<p>The serum neutralizing antibody response is the major indicator of EV71 protective immunity. The neutralizing antibody test of EV71 followed the standard protocol of a neutralization test. Serum samples were heat-treated for 30 minutes at 56°C, serially diluted and mixed with 100 50% tissue culture-infective doses (TCID50) of the EV71 TW/2272/98 strain (GenBank accession number AF119795), and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Thereafter, rhabdomyosarcoma cells were added into each reaction well and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Each plate included a cell control, serum control, and virus back-titration. The cytopathic effect was monitored from 5 to 6 days after incubation, and the serotiter was determined when the cytopathic effect was observed in one TCID50 of the virus back-titration. Seropositivity was defined as a serotiter ≥8. For details, please see
