<p>The Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital approved this study. After written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of children, we enrolled preschool children, 6–11-year-old primary school students and 12–15-year-old high school students in the northern (Taipei City), eastern (Hualien County), western (Yunlin County) and southern (Kaohsiung City) regions of Taiwan between May and November 2017. Community-dwelling 16-50-year-old healthy people were also enrolled in the four different regions of Taiwan after their own written informed consent was obtained. Participants received a questionnaire, and a blood sample was collected and submitted for measuring the EV71 neutralization antibody.</p>
