<p>The EV71 seropositive rates were very low, at 4% to 10%, in the high-risk group (&lt;6-year-old preschool children) and not high, at 31%, in primary school students. Female gender, having siblings, more siblings and contact with HA or HFMD were factors associated with EV71 seropositivity in children younger than 6 years of age while having children in the family and older age were factors associated with EV71 seropositivity in 16-50-year-old people. Young children will be the group with the greatest priority to receive the EV71 vaccine.</p>
