<p>The lower seropositive rates in young children observed in 2007 and 2017 correlate well with the fact that there were no major EV71 outbreaks during the last 10 years. Factors underlying the decreasing seropositivity may include lower birth rates and strict implementation of preventive measures during this time period [
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The low birth rate and having only one child in most families in Taiwan make children get EV71 infection at an older age in comparison with the previous periods of the late 1990s or early 2000s. In our previous study conducted in 2001â€“2002, we found a very high EV71 household transmission rate of 84% among siblings if there were any siblings infected with EV71 in the household [

 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and the fertility rate in Taiwan was only 1.13 children per woman in 2017 and 1.218 children per woman in 2018, which was the third lowest in the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because of having only one child in most families in recent years, there is no elder sibling(s) to spread viruses, including EV71, into the other family members; thus, most children acquire viral infection when they go to school or kindergarten. Therefore, the age of getting EV71 becomes older than in previous periods. In addition, EV71 infection at different ages has different symptomatic ratios and severity [
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The symptomatic ratios are much lower [
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the severity is milder when children get an EV71 infection at older ages [
