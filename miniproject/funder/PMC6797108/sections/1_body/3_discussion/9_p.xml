<p>There are some limitations in this study. First, the test population (sampling methods, geographical and demographical characteristics) were not the same with those previous studies of 1997, 1999 and 2007 in Taiwan although the laboratory method was the same. Second, the sample size of young children was small and the power may be limited, so larger sample size and multiple test correction may be needed in the future to verify our findings. Third, the EV71 viral strains used for neutralizing antibody, cut-off criteriae for seropositivity and the age groups are different among different countries. Although the seroprevalence rates were not so comparable, we tried our best to clarify the difference and did some important comparisons.</p>
