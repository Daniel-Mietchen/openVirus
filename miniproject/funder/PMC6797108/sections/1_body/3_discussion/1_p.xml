 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], one year after the first epidemic occurred in Taiwan in 1998. The EV71 seropositive rates in 2017 were very low, at 4% to 10%, in the very-high-risk group (&lt;6-year-old preschool children) and not high, at 31%, in primary school students. The risk factors associated with seropositivity in preschool children included female gender, having siblings, more siblings, and contact with HFMD and/or HA whereas the only risk factor associated with seropositivity in adults was having children in the family in addition to older age.
