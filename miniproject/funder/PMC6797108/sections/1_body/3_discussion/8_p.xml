<p>We further compared EV71 serostatus among different countries in 
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Among different countries, the EV71 seropositive rates varied greatly. The seropositive rates of children in China, Thailand and Cambodia were very high, ranging from 35 to 98% [

 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The rates (15 to 37%) of children in Singapore in 2008–2010 were comparable to those in Taiwan in 2007 and 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The rates in Russia varied in different regions: the rates were lower (5 to 19%) in urban areas, such as Moscow and Rostov, than those (20 to 83%) in rural areas, such as Tyva [
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Severe EV71 cases occurred more frequently in countries, such as China and Cambodia which had greater seropositive rates [

 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and it indicates greater disease burden in these countries. EV71 outbreak occurred in Cambodia in 2012, it characterized by severe encephalitis with cardiovascular collapse and pulmonary edema seized international headlines and resulted in the death of at least 54 children [
 <xref rid="pone.0224110.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and more than 2 thousands of laboratory-confirmed EV71 cases died in China from 2008 to 2015 [
