 <xref rid="pone.0224110.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows. The seropositive rates of 3–5-year-old kindergarteners and 6–11-year-old primary school children were significantly greater in rural areas (Hualien County and Yunlin County) than in metropolitan areas (Taipei City and Kaohsiung City). Among the four regions, there were no significant differences in the age and gender of the enrolled people, but the family size was larger (4.4±1.8 vs. 3.9±1.7, p&lt;0.001) and the rate of drinking spring or well water was significantly greater (18% vs. 9%, p&lt;0.05) in rural areas than in metropolitan areas.
