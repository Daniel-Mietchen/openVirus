 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224110.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows age-specific seropositive rates among 1997, 1999, 2007 and 2017. Infants might have maternal antibodies, so they did not have significantly different seropositive rates among different years (p = 0.62). Compared with EV71 seropositive rates in 1997 and 1999, the rates in 2â€“11-year-old children were significantly lower in 2007 and 2017 as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224110.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows (p&lt;0.001). The seropositive rates of the 6- to 19-year-olds in 2017 were significantly lower than those rates in 1997, 1999 and 2007 (p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in 20- to 29-year-old adults among the four different periods (p = 0.36). Overall, the seropositive rates in 2017 were the lowest among the four periods.
