In 2015, a WHO-led assessment of shortcomings in the initial response to the unfolding epidemic noted that &#x0201c;better information was needed to understand best practices in clinical management&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;innovations in data collection should be introduced, including mHealth communications&#x0201d;. Despite the availability of numerous clinical guidelines, their digital accessibility is poorly adapted to field conditions and difficult to navigate or read on mobile phones. Further, information is distributed across various guidelines, quickly outdated, and undirected reading is often overly detailed or too generic for the patient at hand. On the Google Play store, the search term &#x0201c;Ebola&#x0201d; returned just three EVD-specific applications directed at clinicians, only one of which assimilated guidelines from 2014 within their current structure. Machine learning prognostic models could improve understanding and personalized use of evidence-based guidelines by helping to prioritize recommended interventions according to the prognostic importance of each clinical feature present in the individual patient. We searched PubMed without date limits for various permutations of terms representing &#x0201c;prognostic&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;machine learning&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mHealth&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;guidelines&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Ebola&#x0201d;. Less than ten EVD symptomatic prognostic models were found, with most constructed on single-site cohorts without external validation. While one provided a paper scorecard, none were integrated in an mHealth tool or made use of machine learning.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0015">This study is based on the largest and most diverse clinical EVD dataset available to date, comprising 470 confirmed EVD cases from five different locations in Sierra Leone and Liberia, and a further 264 cases from two independent datasets for external validation. It demonstrates how interoperability between diverse datasets can be achieved through data harmonization approaches and constructs a family of flexible externally validated prognostic models that are able to approximate observational wellness assessments made by experienced clinicians. We further integrate these models in the first field-deployable mobile app for EVD prognostication, which enables informed access to recommended guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="p0020">The <italic>Ebola Care Guidelines</italic> app benchmarks an approach to generating evidence-based mobile clinical management tools to improve training and informed adherence to protocol, where a personalized predictive support system organizes clinical procedures more effectively around patient data.</p></sec></sec><notes notes-type="alt-text" specific-use="for-accessibility" id="al0050"><p>Alt-text: Unlabelled Box</p></notes></boxed-text></p><sec id="s0025"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">The 2014&#x02013;2016 outbreak of EVD caused a worldwide health crisis with more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths, the vast majority of which occurred in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The recent ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> is evidence of the threat posed by EVD, even with the availability of experimental vaccines. Of particular concern, is the presence of outbreaks in regions with limited medical coverage such as the active conflict zone affected by the current outbreak <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Despite its notoriety as a deadly disease, the pathology of EVD includes a range of outcomes, spanning from asymptomatic infection to complex organ failure. On the few cases treated in high-income countries, case fatality ratios (CFRs) of under 20% were achievable, revealing the importance of resources in determining prognosis <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Prioritizing time and material resources for high-risk patients in remote and low-resource settings is one approach to decrease overall mortality when subject to such constraints <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A complementary approach is to use tools providing clinical instructions for management, training, and improved protocol adherence <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0030">We previously introduced the use of prognostic models that can be deployed as mobile apps for the purpose of risk stratification in EVD <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our original models were developed on the single publicly available dataset at that time by Schieffelin et al. <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which includes 106 Ebola-positive patients admitted at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). These models outperformed simpler risk scores and allowed users to choose from various sets of predictors depending on the available clinical data. While this study showed the potential for such an approach, the models were limited by the narrow geographical and temporal scope of the relatively small and incomplete dataset. Further, the prototype app in which the models were packaged displayed only the severity score of the patient without further guidance. We thus sought to create models with greatly expanded geographic relevance packaged in a new app that could provide risk-based guidance to health workers particularly in limited-resource settings. The models are derived from the largest and most diverse EVD dataset published to date, comprised of 470 confirmed cases from five treatment centers spread across Sierra Leone and Liberia at various timepoints during the 2014&#x02013;16 epidemic (provided by International Medical Corps, IMC) and further externally validated on two datasets of 264 cases (comprising the 106 KGH dataset and an additional 158 provided by GOAL Global).</p><p id="p0035">Despite the availability of numerous clinical guidelines for EVD, their digital accessibility is poorly adapted to field conditions where their book-like formatting makes for awkward navigation and reading on mobile devices. Further, the static nature of these documents makes them quickly outdated, especially in the rapidly evolving context of an epidemic where new recommendations are often fragmented across research papers and field reports that are challenging and sometimes impossible for health workers to access. Our goal is not only to provide an updatable platform on which care guidelines could be centralized, but also to personalize the prioritization of recommendations based on the severity score of the individual patient, as predicted by validated prognostic models. Such tailored guidance can be achieved by objectively highlighting the symptom-based interventions that are most relevant given all the available information about the patient during triage.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0035"><label>2.1</label><title>IMC Patient Cohort and Data Collection</title><p id="p0040">Prognostic models were based on data collected from 470 patients at five ETUs operated by IMC in Liberia (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;178, 38%) and Sierra Leone (n&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;292, 62%) between September 15, 2014 and September 15, 2015. The ETUs were located at Lunsar (Port Loko District), Kambia (Kambia District), and Makeni (Bombali District) in Sierra Leone, and at Suakoko (Bong County) and Kakata (Margibi County) in Liberia. The majority of the patients presented directly to these centers without secondary referrals from holding units.

The clinical and lab protocols were mostly consistent across the five ETUs, making it possible to aggregate individuals into a single cohort. Notable exceptions were wellness scale (WS) and body temperature, both of which were only recorded in Sierra Leonean ETUs.

RT-PCR results and detailed sign and symptom data were available for all 158 patients. Missingness across the dataset was 1%.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.3</label><title>Acquisition, Transformation and Normalization of Cycle Threshold Values</title><p id="p0060">Further details on the assays and processing methodologies are provided in the supplementary materials (PCR Lab Notes section). RT-PCR data were obtained from four laboratories. Liberian ETUs were served by the United States Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) Mobile Laboratory in Bong County. In Sierra Leone, the Lunsar, Makeni and GOAL ETU's were served by Public Health England (PHE), while a Nigerian Lab handled samples from the Kambia ETU. KGH had on-site laboratory support. Inconsistent with other sites, the KGH PCR data was reported as viral load (VL, in copies/ml) only. To harmonize measures, VL was transformed to CT according to the standard qPCR curve log(VL)&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;m&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;CT&#x0202f;+&#x0202f;c0, such that the minimum VL in the KGH dataset corresponded to the maximum CT in the aggregated IMC dataset, and vice versa. The accuracy of the transformation was supported by the observations that its limit of detection aligned to the IMC dataset, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and also that the curve corresponded to its expected form, where a&#x0202f;&#x02248;&#x0202f;10-fold increase in Ebola VL corresponded to a 3-point decrease in CT <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Based on this relationship, &#x02212;&#x000a0;3/m in our formula should be close to 1, which is indeed the case (&#x02212;&#x000a0;3/m&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.976 using the m and c0 constants derived from the KGH and IMC data). Transformation results were not dependent on the geographical origin of the IMC data.</p><p id="p0065">Geographical origin did, however, have a significant (P&#x0202f;&#x0003c;&#x0202f;0.0001) impact on CT distribution across sites (Suppl. Fig. S1), where IMC ETU's had a mean of 21.82&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;5.16 in Sierra Leone and 27.67&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;5.45 in Liberia. In the KGH and GOAL external validation cohorts, these values were 26.05&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;6.00 and 22.20&#x0202f;&#x000b1;&#x0202f;4.31, respectively. A possible reason for this discrepancy is the differing methods of RT-PCR in each site (TaqMan in the Liberian ETUs, commercial Altona and in-house &#x0201c;Trombley&#x0201d; in the Sierra Leonean ETUs). To correct for such analytical bias, and ensure the results were internally consistent at each site and thus comparable between sites, we normalized the CT values from each site/group of sites by feature-scaling (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). As the differences in CT could also arise from differences in care-seeking behaviors, the normalization of CT values within sites would also work towards reducing the effect of this potential confounder.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.4</label><title>Ethical Approval</title><p id="p0070">The Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee, the University of Liberia &#x02013; Pacific Institute for Research &#x00026; Evaluation Institutional Review Board, the Lifespan (Rhode Island Hospital) Institutional Review Board, and the Harvard Committee on the Use of Human Subjects provided ethical approval for this study and exemption from informed consent.

The predictors for the models were selected in a machine learning variable-selection process, where an initial set of candidate factors associated with death in EVD were submitted to penalized logistic regression using the R package Glmnet <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> with Elastic Net regularization. To define a non-redundant, parsimonious subset of predictors, variables with a coefficient &#x0003e;&#x000a0;0 in at least half of the penalized models were retained. As marginal associations can become less significant when accounting for confounding dependencies in such multivariate models, the process tended to include variables with weak correlations to the outcome in bivariate analysis, such as bleeding and dyspnea, and elimination of variables that had a low P-value, like conjunctivitis. Using these variables, we constructed a family of non-penalized logistic regression models using the lrm function from the R package rms <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This included a parsimonious model (using all the variables obtained from the selection process), and several fallback models that can be applied on smaller subsets of demographic information, clinical features and laboratory results, for use when more limited data is available at triage. This approach has been shown to outperform predictive value imputation, which consists of having only one full model and imputing missing values at prediction time using the data distribution from the training set <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Each final model in the family was obtained by fitting N copies of the model on each imputed dataset, and then averaging those copies into a single model using the fit.mult.impute function in Hmisc. Internal validation was performed using bootstrap resampling and model performance is presented by the area under the curve (AUC), McFadden's pseudo-R<sup>2</sup>, Brier score, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

The actual values of age and temperature were the input of the spline fitting procedure, as implemented in the Hmisc package. The lack of a saddle in the CFR vs CT plot (Suppl. Fig. S3) suggested that cubic splines were not required to model CT. Following Hartley's <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> observation that viral load can act as a confounding factor for outcome and TTP (where patterns in early viral load directs care-seeking behavior as well as determines outcome), we added a CT&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;TTP interaction. While non-random patterns of missing values were found when considering all data, Little's MCAR test was satisfied at P&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.05 when considering the Sierra Leonean and Liberian records separately, thus identifying geographical location as the main source of non-randomness. The remaining weak non-random patterns for missing fields in the TTP variable in Sierra Leonean records (P&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;0.03) could be explained by low CT values.

It then offers a visualization of the score and the magnitude of patient-specific contributions for each feature included in their score, where the score value is shown at the top in a color-graded scale and patient-specific feature contributions to that score are depicted in a bar chart summary page (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E). Each clinical feature is linked to one or more of the care guidelines according to their appearance in the guideline, so that when that feature is present in the data, the corresponding guidelines are highlighted (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F). The total severity score can also be linked to specific guidelines when it is over a threshold defined in the app's settings. Those guidelines will also be highlighted when the score is higher than a user-defined threshold. This feature is designed to bring the user's attention to the resource-consuming recommendations that could be most relevant given the clinical manifestation of the patient (e.g. intensive monitoring). It is important to note that the app does not make any choices for the user nor does it deviate or omit information from the guidelines, it simply directs the user to the section in the guidelines that advises them in that decision.

The discriminative capacity of the models is robust across the training set and two independent validation sets, with AUCs ranging from 0.75 up to 0.80. Furthermore, these models recapitulate several findings reported earlier in the literature and also reveal further associations between mortality and clinical signs/symptoms. The most informative predictors of EVD outcome are patient age and viral load, and models incorporating just these two variables exhibit good performance. Occurrence of jaundice or bleeding at initial presentation are important predictors of death, but both have low incidence at triage among the patients in the IMC cohort of only 5%. In contrast, more widespread EVD manifestations such as dyspnea, dysphagia, and asthenia at triage have a much weaker correlation with mortality. Even though fever is a non-specific symptom with no predictive power, body temperature at triage is informative by increasing specificity in the predictions. The performance of models incorporating the clinical wellness score is at least comparable or superior to the more detailed models including individual clinical features deemed as the most predictive in our variable selection process. This is a particularly interesting result in our study, since it suggests that machine learning approaches, when properly designed and implemented, and applied on rich-enough data, could approximate the clinical intuition that physicians acquire through their experience in the field. Conversely, this also provides evidence that good bedside intuition can very effectively integrate the individual indicators of the patient's clinical status into an overall health assessment of great predictive power. These models may be useful in emergency situations when the appropriate experience is unavailable or under-developed.</p></sec><sec id="s0130"><label>4.2</label><title>Updating the Models and App</title><p id="p0165">Our prognostic models and guidelines app can be easily updated with new data. With increasing knowledge on the management of Ebola, we expect the mortality rate to decrease over time or to be more reliably estimated by earlier symptoms. New information from the ongoing outbreak in DRC or future epidemics would enable us to train and update the models to more appropriate calculations that are adapted to improving standards of care, and geographically divergent variables. For example: health-care seeking behavior in the conflict-afflicted DRC would be undoubtedly more limited than that in West Africa in 2014&#x02013;16, and perhaps other factors will be more predictive of death. Therefore, not only are the models adapted to the newly available information but the new models would also automatically link up to the easily-updatable guidelines as they become available.</p></sec><sec id="s0135"><label>4.3</label><title>Data-harmonization Challenges</title><p id="p0170">When aggregating data from several sources, care must be taken to search and correct for systematic differences between datasets and best ensure interoperability. For example, in order to aggregate CT values and control for analytical bias generated by the different PCR labs, we applied an intra-site normalization to ensure that values were comparable across sites. We had to discard several potentially informative clinical variables such as confusion and coma since they were not available in all the IMC ETUs. Other features could be imputed, such as body temperature by using fever as a proxy variable.</p></sec><sec id="s0140"><label>4.4</label><title>Validation Strategies</title><p id="p0175">Our prognostic models, particularly those incorporating the parsimonious sets of predictors, perform well on two independent datasets used for external validation. These datasets have a wide temporal, geographic and clinical scope. A major difference between these datasets was the time during which they were collected, with the KGH data representing an earlier time point, with less refined treatment protocols, increased patient volume and admission intensity with a larger number of patients delayed during transfers from holding centers. On the other hand, the GOAL dataset includes patients from the final months of the epidemic with a 13% lower CFR. Thus, as may be expected, the models underestimated the observed risk for patients of the KGH cohort, while observed risk was slightly overestimated in the GOAL cohort. The IMC training dataset covers a much broader temporal window of the epidemic as well as a wider catchment area, spanning several districts across two countries, which may explain its consistent performance in these disparate populations. We also investigated the temporal flexibility of the models by testing them on CT values obtained two days after triage and comparing model performance on patients with short or long times to presentation at the ETU. The results show that the parsimonious models could maintain their performance parameters when deployed in contexts with systematically different referral times or laboratory turnaround times, and further justifies the use of time-to-presentation within the model to control for time-dependent effects.</p></sec><sec id="s0145"><label>4.5</label><title>mHealth Applications</title><p id="p0180">Finally, with the <italic>Ebola Care Guidelines</italic> app we benchmark a robust and flexible mHealth platform for clinicians that could be extended to other diseases affecting rural and low-resource areas. By linking evidence-based prognostication with trusted clinical care information, we propose the app both as a reference tool to improve training and adherence to protocol, as well as a support system that better tailors the prioritization of clinical interventions to the patient's data. The integration of mHealth platforms with rapid point of care diagnostic kits <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> has the potential to realize the concept of a &#x0201c;pocket lab&#x0201d; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which could be used outside laboratory settings and during health emergencies. The ultimate goal of these platforms is to aid clinical management decisions by personalizing the understanding of individual prognostic predictions and better organizing access to the trusted, updateable medical knowledge. This platform also allows updating of the prognostic models, where new weightings may be trained on more geographically or temporally relevant data as it becomes available. The current update process simply involves bundling the specifications of the new models (predictor variables and coefficients), rebuilding the app, and releasing it through Android's app store. Future versions of the app may not even require to be updated, as they could retrieve new models directly from a central server. We believe that if clinical staff can obtain actionable information from the data they collect, they may be incentivized to generate more and higher-quality data: creating a positive feedback loop which drives precision. Further, the visualization of the clinical basis of prediction models (such as the charts provided in our app) provides a learning platform that builds informed clinical experience rather than simply replacing it.</p></sec><sec id="s0150"><label>4.6</label><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0185">Despite being the largest EVD prognosis modeling study to date, the amount and quality of available clinical data is still limited. We accounted for these limitations by harmonizing the data from different ETUs and applying various statistical techniques recommended for prognosis modeling (multiple imputation, bootstrap sampling, external validation). Even with the help of these approaches, data might be affected by variations in clinical assessments from clinicians with varying levels of experience, errors in data collection (including patient symptom recall or history taking skills), and differences in lab protocols. Ultimately, future predictive models will require larger and better datasets, and consensus mechanisms to ensure that data is consistent across sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0155"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0190">It is possible to generate generalizable machine learning prognostic models if data from representative cohorts can be harmonized and externally validated.
