  <p>Ebola Care Guidelines app. The home screen presents the list of recommendations (A), which can be selected to access specific interventions associated with each recommendation (B). Selecting a specific intervention or guideline redirects the user to the corresponding section in the WHO's manuals for care and management of hemorrhagic fever patients (C). The app allows the users to enter basic demographic information (age, weight), vitals, signs &amp; symptoms at presentation, lab data (CT value from first RT-PCR and malaria test result), and wellness scale (D). Based on the available data, the app calculates the severity score of the patient using the suitable prognostic model and presents a customized risk visualization (E). The recommendations that are associated with the presentation signs and symptoms are highlighted in the home screen (E).</p>
