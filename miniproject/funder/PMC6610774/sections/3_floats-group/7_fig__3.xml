 <caption>
  <p>Bootstrap overfitting-corrected calibration curves for the wellness models. Estimated for the four prognostic models using the wellness scale as predictor: wellness parsimonious (A), wellness parsimonious without body temperature (B), wellness clinical-only (C), and wellness minimal (D). Each plot contains the rug chart at the top showing the distribution of predicted risks. The dotted line represents the apparent calibration curve and the solid line shows the optimism-corrected calibration. A perfectly-calibrated model will fall along the diagonal. Generated with the calibrate function in the rms package.</p>
