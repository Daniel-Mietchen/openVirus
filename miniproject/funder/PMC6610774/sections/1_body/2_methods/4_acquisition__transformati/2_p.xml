<p id="p0060">Further details on the assays and processing methodologies are provided in the supplementary materials (PCR Lab Notes section). RT-PCR data were obtained from four laboratories. Liberian ETUs were served by the United States Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) Mobile Laboratory in Bong County. In Sierra Leone, the Lunsar, Makeni and GOAL ETU's were served by Public Health England (PHE), while a Nigerian Lab handled samples from the Kambia ETU. KGH had on-site laboratory support. Inconsistent with other sites, the KGH PCR data was reported as viral load (VL, in copies/ml) only. To harmonize measures, VL was transformed to CT according to the standard qPCR curve log(VL) = m × CT + c0, such that the minimum VL in the KGH dataset corresponded to the maximum CT in the aggregated IMC dataset, and vice versa. The accuracy of the transformation was supported by the observations that its limit of detection aligned to the IMC dataset,

 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and also that the curve corresponded to its expected form, where a ≈ 10-fold increase in Ebola VL corresponded to a 3-point decrease in CT 
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Based on this relationship, − 3/m in our formula should be close to 1, which is indeed the case (− 3/m = 0.976 using the m and c0 constants derived from the KGH and IMC data). Transformation results were not dependent on the geographical origin of the IMC data.
