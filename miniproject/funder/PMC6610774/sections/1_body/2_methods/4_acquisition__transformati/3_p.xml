<p id="p0065">Geographical origin did, however, have a significant (P &lt; 0.0001) impact on CT distribution across sites (Suppl. Fig. S1), where IMC ETU's had a mean of 21.82 ± 5.16 in Sierra Leone and 27.67 ± 5.45 in Liberia. In the KGH and GOAL external validation cohorts, these values were 26.05 ± 6.00 and 22.20 ± 4.31, respectively. A possible reason for this discrepancy is the differing methods of RT-PCR in each site (TaqMan in the Liberian ETUs, commercial Altona and in-house “Trombley” in the Sierra Leonean ETUs). To correct for such analytical bias, and ensure the results were internally consistent at each site and thus comparable between sites, we normalized the CT values from each site/group of sites by feature-scaling (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). As the differences in CT could also arise from differences in care-seeking behaviors, the normalization of CT values within sites would also work towards reducing the effect of this potential confounder.</p>
