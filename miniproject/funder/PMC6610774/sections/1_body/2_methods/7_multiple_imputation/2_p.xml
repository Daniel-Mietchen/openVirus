<p id="p0080">Across all the potential predictors in the dataset, 22% of fields had missing values. Predictor exclusion was limited to those having more than 50% missingness so as to minimize bias in the regression coefficients 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The remaining missing values were assessed for their suitability for imputation, using Little's MCAR test (R package BaylorEdPsych), which tests for bias in the missing values or whether they are “missing completely at random” (MCAR) 
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Multiple imputation was undertaken with the aregImpute function from the R package Hmisc 
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, which generates a Bayesian predictive distribution from the known data, and outputs a number N of imputed datasets. Each missing value in the i
 <sup>th</sup> imputation is predicted from an additive model fitted on a bootstrap sample with replacement from the original data. We set N = 100, well above standard imputation guidelines
