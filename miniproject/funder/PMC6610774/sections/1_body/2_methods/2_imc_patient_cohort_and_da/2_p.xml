<p id="p0040">Prognostic models were based on data collected from 470 patients at five ETUs operated by IMC in Liberia (n = 178, 38%) and Sierra Leone (n = 292, 62%) between September 15, 2014 and September 15, 2015. The ETUs were located at Lunsar (Port Loko District), Kambia (Kambia District), and Makeni (Bombali District) in Sierra Leone, and at Suakoko (Bong County) and Kakata (Margibi County) in Liberia. The majority of the patients presented directly to these centers without secondary referrals from holding units. The overall Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) across the 5 ETUs was 58%.</p>
