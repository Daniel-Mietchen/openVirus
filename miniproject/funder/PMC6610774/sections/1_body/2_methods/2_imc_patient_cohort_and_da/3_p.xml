<p id="p0045">Trained health workers recorded patient demographic, clinical, and support data at least daily from admission to discharge on standardized paper forms. Collection and archival protocols are detailed in Roshania et al. 
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The clinical and lab protocols were mostly consistent across the five ETUs, making it possible to aggregate individuals into a single cohort. Notable exceptions were wellness scale (WS) and body temperature, both of which were only recorded in Sierra Leonean ETUs. WS is an observational assessment assigned by experienced clinicians on a scale ranging from 0 (cured) to 5 (very sick) as seen in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. WS was recorded for 223 of the 292 patients treated at the three ETUs in Sierra Leone and was imputed for the 89 Sierra Leonean patients without it. The categorical variable fever, available for all ETUs, was used to guide imputation of body temperatures.
