<p id="p0050">The cycle threshold (CT) value is an inversely proportional proxy of viral load, with a cut-off of 40â€¯cycles considered as negative. These values were calculated from PCRs performed on admission or from the second PCR when the first was missing, performed no later than two days after admission and affecting a total of 28 patients. The mean CT value of these patients 
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> was not significantly different from the rest of the cohort 
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> in crude analyses or when stratified by outcome. PCR data was normalized across sites to adjust for analytical bias between laboratories (described below).
