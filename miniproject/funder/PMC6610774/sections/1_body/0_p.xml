    <p id="p0010">The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks have highlighted the need for field-deployable patient management tools adaptable to its heterogeneous spectrum of pathology across widely varying environments and resources. In 2015, a WHO-led assessment of shortcomings in the initial response to the unfolding epidemic noted that “better information was needed to understand best practices in clinical management” and “innovations in data collection should be introduced, including mHealth communications”. Despite the availability of numerous clinical guidelines, their digital accessibility is poorly adapted to field conditions and difficult to navigate or read on mobile phones. Further, information is distributed across various guidelines, quickly outdated, and undirected reading is often overly detailed or too generic for the patient at hand. On the Google Play store, the search term “Ebola” returned just three EVD-specific applications directed at clinicians, only one of which assimilated guidelines from 2014 within their current structure. Machine learning prognostic models could improve understanding and personalized use of evidence-based guidelines by helping to prioritize recommended interventions according to the prognostic importance of each clinical feature present in the individual patient. We searched PubMed without date limits for various permutations of terms representing “prognostic”, “machine learning”, “mHealth”, “guidelines” and “Ebola”. Less than ten EVD symptomatic prognostic models were found, with most constructed on single-site cohorts without external validation. While one provided a paper scorecard, none were integrated in an mHealth tool or made use of machine learning.</p>

    <title>Added value of this study</title>
    <p id="p0015">This study is based on the largest and most diverse clinical EVD dataset available to date, comprising 470 confirmed EVD cases from five different locations in Sierra Leone and Liberia, and a further 264 cases from two independent datasets for external validation. It demonstrates how interoperability between diverse datasets can be achieved through data harmonization approaches and constructs a family of flexible externally validated prognostic models that are able to approximate observational wellness assessments made by experienced clinicians. We further integrate these models in the first field-deployable mobile app for EVD prognostication, which enables informed access to recommended guidelines.</p>
