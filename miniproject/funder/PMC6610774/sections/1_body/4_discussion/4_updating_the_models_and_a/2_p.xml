<p id="p0165">Our prognostic models and guidelines app can be easily updated with new data. With increasing knowledge on the management of Ebola, we expect the mortality rate to decrease over time or to be more reliably estimated by earlier symptoms. New information from the ongoing outbreak in DRC or future epidemics would enable us to train and update the models to more appropriate calculations that are adapted to improving standards of care, and geographically divergent variables. For example: health-care seeking behavior in the conflict-afflicted DRC would be undoubtedly more limited than that in West Africa in 2014â€“16, and perhaps other factors will be more predictive of death. Therefore, not only are the models adapted to the newly available information but the new models would also automatically link up to the easily-updatable guidelines as they become available.</p>
