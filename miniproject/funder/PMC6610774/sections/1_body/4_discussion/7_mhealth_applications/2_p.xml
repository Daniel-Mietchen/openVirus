<p id="p0180">Finally, with the 
 <italic>Ebola Care Guidelines</italic> app we benchmark a robust and flexible mHealth platform for clinicians that could be extended to other diseases affecting rural and low-resource areas. By linking evidence-based prognostication with trusted clinical care information, we propose the app both as a reference tool to improve training and adherence to protocol, as well as a support system that better tailors the prioritization of clinical interventions to the patient's data. The integration of mHealth platforms with rapid point of care diagnostic kits

 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> has the potential to realize the concept of a “pocket lab” 
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which could be used outside laboratory settings and during health emergencies. The ultimate goal of these platforms is to aid clinical management decisions by personalizing the understanding of individual prognostic predictions and better organizing access to the trusted, updateable medical knowledge. This platform also allows updating of the prognostic models, where new weightings may be trained on more geographically or temporally relevant data as it becomes available. The current update process simply involves bundling the specifications of the new models (predictor variables and coefficients), rebuilding the app, and releasing it through Android's app store. Future versions of the app may not even require to be updated, as they could retrieve new models directly from a central server. We believe that if clinical staff can obtain actionable information from the data they collect, they may be incentivized to generate more and higher-quality data: creating a positive feedback loop which drives precision. Further, the visualization of the clinical basis of prediction models (such as the charts provided in our app) provides a learning platform that builds informed clinical experience rather than simply replacing it.
