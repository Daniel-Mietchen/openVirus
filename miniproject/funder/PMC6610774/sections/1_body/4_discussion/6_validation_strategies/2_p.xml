<p id="p0175">Our prognostic models, particularly those incorporating the parsimonious sets of predictors, perform well on two independent datasets used for external validation. These datasets have a wide temporal, geographic and clinical scope. A major difference between these datasets was the time during which they were collected, with the KGH data representing an earlier time point, with less refined treatment protocols, increased patient volume and admission intensity with a larger number of patients delayed during transfers from holding centers. On the other hand, the GOAL dataset includes patients from the final months of the epidemic with a 13% lower CFR. Thus, as may be expected, the models underestimated the observed risk for patients of the KGH cohort, while observed risk was slightly overestimated in the GOAL cohort. The IMC training dataset covers a much broader temporal window of the epidemic as well as a wider catchment area, spanning several districts across two countries, which may explain its consistent performance in these disparate populations. We also investigated the temporal flexibility of the models by testing them on CT values obtained two days after triage and comparing model performance on patients with short or long times to presentation at the ETU. The results show that the parsimonious models could maintain their performance parameters when deployed in contexts with systematically different referral times or laboratory turnaround times, and further justifies the use of time-to-presentation within the model to control for time-dependent effects.</p>
