<p id="p0185">Despite being the largest EVD prognosis modeling study to date, the amount and quality of available clinical data is still limited. We accounted for these limitations by harmonizing the data from different ETUs and applying various statistical techniques recommended for prognosis modeling (multiple imputation, bootstrap sampling, external validation). Even with the help of these approaches, data might be affected by variations in clinical assessments from clinicians with varying levels of experience, errors in data collection (including patient symptom recall or history taking skills), and differences in lab protocols. Ultimately, future predictive models will require larger and better datasets, and consensus mechanisms to ensure that data is consistent across sites.</p>
