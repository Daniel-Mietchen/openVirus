<p id="p0170">When aggregating data from several sources, care must be taken to search and correct for systematic differences between datasets and best ensure interoperability. For example, in order to aggregate CT values and control for analytical bias generated by the different PCR labs, we applied an intra-site normalization to ensure that values were comparable across sites. We had to discard several potentially informative clinical variables such as confusion and coma since they were not available in all the IMC ETUs. Other features could be imputed, such as body temperature by using fever as a proxy variable.</p>
