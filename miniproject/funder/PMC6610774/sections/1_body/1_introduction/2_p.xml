<p id="p0025">The 2014â€“2016 outbreak of EVD caused a worldwide health crisis with more than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths, the vast majority of which occurred in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The recent ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> is evidence of the threat posed by EVD, even with the availability of experimental vaccines. Of particular concern, is the presence of outbreaks in regions with limited medical coverage such as the active conflict zone affected by the current outbreak 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Despite its notoriety as a deadly disease, the pathology of EVD includes a range of outcomes, spanning from asymptomatic infection to complex organ failure. On the few cases treated in high-income countries, case fatality ratios (CFRs) of under 20% were achievable, revealing the importance of resources in determining prognosis 
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Prioritizing time and material resources for high-risk patients in remote and low-resource settings is one approach to decrease overall mortality when subject to such constraints 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A complementary approach is to use tools providing clinical instructions for management, training, and improved protocol adherence
