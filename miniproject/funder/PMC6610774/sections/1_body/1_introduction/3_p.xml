<p id="p0030">We previously introduced the use of prognostic models that can be deployed as mobile apps for the purpose of risk stratification in EVD 
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Our original models were developed on the single publicly available dataset at that time by Schieffelin et al. 
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which includes 106 Ebola-positive patients admitted at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). These models outperformed simpler risk scores and allowed users to choose from various sets of predictors depending on the available clinical data. While this study showed the potential for such an approach, the models were limited by the narrow geographical and temporal scope of the relatively small and incomplete dataset. Further, the prototype app in which the models were packaged displayed only the severity score of the patient without further guidance. We thus sought to create models with greatly expanded geographic relevance packaged in a new app that could provide risk-based guidance to health workers particularly in limited-resource settings. The models are derived from the largest and most diverse EVD dataset published to date, comprised of 470 confirmed cases from five treatment centers spread across Sierra Leone and Liberia at various timepoints during the 2014â€“16 epidemic (provided by International Medical Corps, IMC) and further externally validated on two datasets of 264 cases (comprising the 106 KGH dataset and an additional 158 provided by GOAL Global).
