<p id="p0035">Despite the availability of numerous clinical guidelines for EVD, their digital accessibility is poorly adapted to field conditions where their book-like formatting makes for awkward navigation and reading on mobile devices. Further, the static nature of these documents makes them quickly outdated, especially in the rapidly evolving context of an epidemic where new recommendations are often fragmented across research papers and field reports that are challenging and sometimes impossible for health workers to access. Our goal is not only to provide an updatable platform on which care guidelines could be centralized, but also to personalize the prioritization of recommendations based on the severity score of the individual patient, as predicted by validated prognostic models. Such tailored guidance can be achieved by objectively highlighting the symptom-based interventions that are most relevant given all the available information about the patient during triage.</p>
