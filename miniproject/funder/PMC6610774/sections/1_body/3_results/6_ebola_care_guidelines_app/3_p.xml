<p id="p0150">Users can also input patient information (age, sex, pregnancy status, weight, height), clinical signs and symptoms recorded at triage, laboratory results, and the wellness scale (WS) from the first clinical rounds after admission (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D), through a built-in form, or via a separate CommCare (

It then offers a visualization of the score and the magnitude of patient-specific contributions for each feature included in their score, where the score value is shown at the top in a color-graded scale and patient-specific feature contributions to that score are depicted in a bar chart summary page (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E). Each clinical feature is linked to one or more of the care guidelines according to their appearance in the guideline, so that when that feature is present in the data, the corresponding guidelines are highlighted (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F). The total severity score can also be linked to specific guidelines when it is over a threshold defined in the app's settings. Those guidelines will also be highlighted when the score is higher than a user-defined threshold. This feature is designed to bring the user's attention to the resource-consuming recommendations that could be most relevant given the clinical manifestation of the patient (e.g. intensive monitoring). It is important to note that the app does not make any choices for the user nor does it deviate or omit information from the guidelines, it simply directs the user to the section in the guidelines that advises them in that decision. The trigger signs/symptoms linking to the guidelines are straightforward, since are precisely those listed in the guidelines themselves (e.g. vomiting and diarrhea for the ORS/IV fluids). The app's source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license. An online wiki provides detailed instructions on how to update the models and the guidelines included in the app (
