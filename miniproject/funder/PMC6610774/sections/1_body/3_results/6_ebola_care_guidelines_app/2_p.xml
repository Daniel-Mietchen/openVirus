<p id="p0145">We created a multilingual (English and French) Android app for health workers, named 
 <italic>Ebola Care Guidelines</italic>, that integrates available patient care and management guidelines for EVD patients with the prognostic models described earlier. To adapt to the needs of rural or remote locations with limited internet access, the app only requires internet connectivity to be installed the first time, and all subsequent use can be performed offline. The home screen shows a list of supportive care recommendations for Ebola patients, compiled from Lamontagne et al. 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and care and management guidelines for hemorrhagic fevers from WHO 
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and MSF 
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). The list is categorized by intervention type and selecting a guideline from this list provides a summary description and specific interventions related to that guideline (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). When users select a specific intervention, the app redirects to the corresponding page in the reference document (
