<p id="p0140">All the performance indices of these new models are higher than the corresponding original models. In fact, the performance of the worst performing model in this set, the wellness clinical-only, is comparable to that of the parsimonious model including the detailed signs and symptoms. The calibration curves for the parsimonious models with and without wellness scale are almost indistinguishable, but it is possible to note an improvement for the clinical-only and minimal models with the addition of the wellness scale (
