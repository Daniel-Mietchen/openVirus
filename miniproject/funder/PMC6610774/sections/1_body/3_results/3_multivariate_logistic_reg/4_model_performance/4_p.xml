<p id="p0115">The ranking of all of the variables by their importance in the parsimonious model, as measured by the Wald Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> statistic, reveals that the most important variables are CT and patient age, with jaundice and bleeding coming in at a distant third and fourth place respectively, followed by body temperature and the CT-TTP interaction (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). The odds ratios (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) indicate that presentation of either jaundice or bleeding are associated with more than a doubling of the odds of death, although their prevalence is low at 5% (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Transformation of the odds risks into risk ratios (Suppl. Table S1) yields a more reasonable estimate of 4% increase in risk associated with the occurrence of those symptoms at presentation.
