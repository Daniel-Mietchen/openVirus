<p id="p0105">In addition to the parsimonious model (using all features described above), we constructed three fallback models for use when certain features were unavailable. The first “parsimonious without temperature” model was identical to the parsimonious but with backwards elimination of body temperature. A second “clinical-only” model selected only clinical features after omitting CT from the initial list of variables before the machine learning selection step. This model included jaundice, bleeding, dyspnea, dysphagia, asthenia/weakness, and diarrhea. A final “minimal” model only incorporated CT and age, which were the strongest individual predictors of outcome, as observed in our data and reported by other researchers

 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> contains the validation indices and their 95% CIs. Most indices are very similar between the parsimonious and minimal models, with largely overlapping CIs. The specificity and R
 <sup>2</sup> are higher in the parsimonious models, while the sensitivity is slightly higher in the minimal model. The addition of temperature consistently increases performance across all indices, but only by a minor amount. The clinical-only model shows consistently lower performance. Detailed description of all the models is provided in Suppl. Table S1.
