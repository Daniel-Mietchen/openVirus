<p id="p0110">The calibration curves comparing the predicted and actual probabilities of death (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) suggest that the two parsimonious models represent the actual probabilities well, with some underestimation for low risk patients. The minimal and clinical-only models are less calibrated, with the former underestimating the actual probabilities at both the low- and high-risk ends, and the later overestimating the actual probabilities for a wide range of risks above 60%.
