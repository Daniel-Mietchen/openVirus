<p id="p0120">To test the temporal flexibility of models we compared the predictions from the parsimonious model when using the CT value from day 0 versus day 2, for those patients for whom these CT values where available. There were 84 patients in the d0 subcohort (CFR: 63%) and 14 patients in the d2 subcohort (CFR: 64%). The model performed similarly on these cohorts (Suppl. Table S2A) with 15 misclassifications using d0 CT reads subcohort, and 3 using d2 CT reads. Further, comparing patients with slow (&gt; 3 d) or rapid (≤ 3 d) times to presentation, we see little difference (Suppl. Table S2B) in performance parameters for the parsimonious model.</p>
