<p id="p0100">Before procedure, selected variables were assessed for bias. We applied restricted cubic splines to model the non-linear relationships between CFR and age (Suppl. Fig. S2A) and CFR and body temperature (Suppl. Fig. S2B). The actual values of age and temperature were the input of the spline fitting procedure, as implemented in the Hmisc package. The lack of a saddle in the CFR vs CT plot (Suppl. Fig. S3) suggested that cubic splines were not required to model CT. Following Hartley's 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> observation that viral load can act as a confounding factor for outcome and TTP (where patterns in early viral load directs care-seeking behavior as well as determines outcome), we added a CT × TTP interaction. While non-random patterns of missing values were found when considering all data, Little's MCAR test was satisfied at P = 0.05 when considering the Sierra Leonean and Liberian records separately, thus identifying geographical location as the main source of non-randomness. The remaining weak non-random patterns for missing fields in the TTP variable in Sierra Leonean records (P = 0.03) could be explained by low CT values. Inclusion of CT in the model controlled for this effect and ensured randomness within each subset of CT (high versus low).
