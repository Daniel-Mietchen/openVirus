<p id="p0125">External validation on the 158 EVD-positive patients in the GOAL dataset shows that the four models described earlier improve their performance with respect to the internal validation. CT was missing in 37 patients, and both CT and TTP were missing in 53, so the parsimonious models were validated on 105 patients and the minimal model on 121. The clinical-only model was validated on all the 158 patients. We obtained AUCs of 0.82, 0.84, 0.73, and 0.82 for the parsimonious, parsimonious without temperature, clinical-only, and minimal (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>A). In terms of the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, all the models, with the exception of the clinical-only, performed similarly well with accuracies around 74%. Excluding again the clinical-only model, sensitivity ranged between 78% and 82%, while specificity was lowest for the minimal model at 61% and highest for the parsimonious model at 68%. Therefore, it is not possible to pick an overall best model between the three including CT but depending on what is the priority in the predictive task, higher sensitivity or specificity, one could favor either the parsimonious or the minimal.
