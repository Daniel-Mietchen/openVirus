<p id="p0130">For the KGH dataset (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>B), only 11 patients had enough complete records to validate the parsimonious models, but after multiple imputation, all the 106 KGH cases could be used. As it was observed in the first validation, all models with the exception of the clinical-only, exhibited consistent performance in terms of AUC and overall accuracy, with analogous differences in terms of specificity and sensitivity. The parsimonious models have higher specificity, while the minimal is more sensitive. The impact of imputation was inconsequential.
