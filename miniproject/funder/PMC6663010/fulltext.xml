This study aims to understand the diversity, epidemiology and dynamics of DENV 4-I. We collected 404 full length DENV4-1 envelope (E) gene sequences from 14 countries using two sources: Yunnan Province in China (15 strains during 2013&#x02013;2016) and GenBank (489 strains up to 2018-01-11). Conducting phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses, we estimated the virus spread, population dynamics, and selection pressures using different statistical analysis methods (substitution saturation, likelihood mapping, Bayesian coalescent inference, and maximum likelihood estimation). Our results show that during the last 60 years (1956&#x02013;2016), DENV 4-I was present in mainland and maritime Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the southern provinces of China, parts of Brazil and Australia. The recent spread of DENV 4-I likely originated in the Philippines and later spread to Thailand. From Thailand, it spread to adjacent countries and eventually the Indian subcontinent. Apparently diverging around years 1957, 1963, 1976 and 1990, the different Clades (Clade I-V) were defined. The mean overall evolution rate of DENV 4-I was 9.74 (95% HPD: 8.68&#x02013;10.82) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year. The most recent common ancestor for DENV 4-I traces back to 1956. While the demographic history of DENV 4-I fluctuated, peaks appeared around 1982 and 2006. While purifying selection dominated the majority of E-gene evolution of DENV 4-I, positive selection characterized Clade III (Vietnam). DENV 4-I evolved in situ in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Thailand and Indian acted as the main and secondary virus distribution hubs globally and regionally. Our phylogenetic analysis highlights the need for strengthened regional cooperation on surveillance and sharing of sample sequences to improve global dengue control and cross-border transmission prevention efforts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Dengue virus (DENV) can be classified into four serotypes, DENV 1, 2, 3 and 4. Although DENV 4 is the first dengue serotype to diverge in phylogenetic analyses of the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, this serotype occurs at a low prevalence worldwide and spreads the least rapidly. Similar to other serotypes, DENV 4 can also cause severe dengue (SD) disease manifestations, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). To date, no study has investigated the epidemiology and dynamics of DENV 4 genotype I comprehensively. In this study, we seek to address this gap. Our study shows that the distribution of DENV 4-I is mainly restricted to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The most recent spread of DENV 4-I likely originated from Southeast Asia&#x02013;initially circulating in the Philippines, then Thailand and later on the Indian subcontinent. Viruses evolved in situ in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, respectively. Although DENV 4-I occasionally spread elsewhere, this genotype did not become widely established. The overall evolution rate of DENV 4-I was comparable with that of DENV 2&#x02013;4. The nucleotide sequences indicates that the demographic history of DENV 4-I fluctuated with peaks apparent during parts of the 1980s and 2000s. Although a weak positive selection existed in Clade III -predominately in Vietnam, purifying selection dominated the E-gene evolution of DENV 4-I.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81602898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6298-4621</contrib-id><name><surname>Sang</surname><given-names>Shaowei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>2018M630790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6298-4621</contrib-id><name><surname>Sang</surname><given-names>Shaowei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>SS was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No.81602898) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M630790).

Although the geographical origin of dengue is still under some debate, the recent global expansion has been attributed to environmental changes, unprecedented population growth, uncontrolled urbanization, spread of the mosquito vectors, and host population movements [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries in much of the globe&#x02019;s tropical and subtropical areas, being reported predominantly in Southeast Asia, the Americas, and the Western Pacific, and less frequently in Africa and Eastern Mediterranean WHO regions [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence of dengue has increased 74.7% between 2006 and 2016 [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While dengue infections are most often asymptomatic, a recent study has estimated a global total of 58.4 (95% CI: 24&#x02013;122) million symptomatic dengue cases occur annually costing some US$8.9 (95% CI: 3.7&#x02013;19.7) billion [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The four antigenically distant serotypes comprising dengue virus are categorized as DENV 1, -2, -3, and -4. Each serotype is classified into different genotypes based on complete E gene sequences [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The four serotypes were first identified at different times and locations, and diffused globally at different rates. Although clearly circulating before isolation techniques enabled the viruses&#x02019; discovery and characterization, DENV 1 was first reported in 1943 in French Polynesia and Japan, DENV 2 in 1944 in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, DENV 3 and DENV 4 both in 1953 in the Philippines and Thailand [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A study mapping the global spread of DENV 1&#x02013;4 over the 70-year history (1943&#x02013;2013), indicated DENV 1 was reported most often, followed by DENV 2, DENV 3, and DENV 4 [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although, DENV 4 was the first dengue serotype to diverge in phylogenetic analyses of the genus <italic>Flav</italic>ivirus [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it spread the slowest geographically [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar to other serotypes, DENV 4 can also cause severe dengue including dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). An epidemiological study in Thailand from 1973 to 1999 revealed that despite the proportionately lower prevalence of DENV 4, it was responsible for 10% of all DHF cases in Children [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Among DENV 4, there are four genotypes (I, II, III and Sylvatic). The dengue cases from DENV 4 genotype I (DENV 4-I) have increased in recent years. In 2013, a large DENV outbreak occurred in central Vietnam with a total of 204,661 clinical cases reported, of which 48.9% were DENV 4-I cases [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The same year, DENV 1-I, DENV 2-I and DENV 4-I caused a large outbreak with 20,255 cases including 84 deaths in Myanmar [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Sri Lanka, the dominant virus in the 2012 epidemic was DENV 1, but DENV 4-I infections were also commonly observed [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While all four serotypes have been detected, a 2015 study showed that dengue in China remains primarily an imported disease with DENV 1 most frequently found in samples [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, since 2013 several strains of DENV 4-I have been detected in Yunnan Province, China. Among the recorded DENV 4-I strains, both imported and autochthonous cases were found.</p><p>The dengue viruses DENV 1&#x02013;4 are typically prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions globally. However, the spatial distribution of different genotypes is not uniform, e.g., some genotypes exist only in specific parts of Asia and others are more cosmopolitan. While the distinct distribution patterns of different genotypes remain enigmatic, mapping of the genotypes&#x02019; distribution can generate hypotheses on their spatial pattern and support policies on dengue prevention and control effort. In the past, efforts have been made to infer the dispersal of DENV 1&#x02013;4 and to elucidate the evolution of their diffusion patterns [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, so far no studies investigated globally the spatial distribution of the single genotype, DENV 4-I, its diversity, and its temporal evolution. This may be due to the limited number of recorded cases and the distribution of DENV 4-I worldwide.</p><p>In this study, we used available GenBank data in addition to Chinese data sources to make the first attempt to more comprehensively understand the spatial and evolutionary patterns of DENV 4-I. Leveraging full envelope gene sequences in our analysis, we sought to investigate the origin and spreading routes of this less-studied, rare but deadly virus, in order to contribute important information for future dengue prevention and control efforts around the globe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Ethical Committee (No. 201214).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Data collection</title><p>Dengue viruses detected in Yunnan Province were recovered from serum samples of suspected dengue patients visiting hospital from 2013 to 2016.

These have been assigned GenBank accession numbers (HM893690-HM893699, MG601754, KJ470764, KJ470765, KX262920, KX262923). The sequences of Yunnan were compared with published sequences by using the nucleotide blast program in the NCBI. All the sequences of human DENV 4-I with full length E-gene (1,485 nucleotides) were downloaded with the accession number, collection date and country/region (as of January 11<sup>th</sup>, 2018). All the sequences were aligned using MAFFT [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Recombinants detected based on the analyses of RDP3 program [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were also excluded. Ultimately, 404 sequences of DENV 4-I obtained from 14 countries were included for analyses in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007592.s003">S1 Table</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Substitution saturation analysis and likelihood mapping analysis</title><p>The phylogenetic signal of the aligned DENV 4-I was evaluated by plotting the observed number of transitions and transversions against genetic distance for the n (n-1)/2 pairwise comparisons in an alignment of n taxa using DAMBE [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is expected that transitions and transversions increase linearly with the genetic distance, with transitions being more frequent than transversions. In the Supplementary Materials, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007592.s001">S1 Fig</xref> shows that no substitution saturation was detected, indicating phylogeny reconstruction was appropriate. In likelihood mapping analysis, groups of four sequences (quartets) were evaluated using the maximum likelihood approach. For each quartet, the three possible unrooted tree topologies were weighted. The likelihood weights were then plotted into a triangular surface. The fully resolved tree topologies were plotted in the three corners, which indicated the presence of a tree-like phylogenetic signal, and the unresolved quartets, indicating a star-like signal were shown in the central region of the triangle [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

We further separated this large dataset into different Clades and analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of Clades separately. Our study shows that the spatial distribution of DENV 4-I is mainly restricted to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The recent spread of DENV 4-I likely originated from Southeast Asia&#x02013;namely the Philippines, from where it then spread all the way to the Indian subcontinent, Australia and Latin America. DENV 4-I evolved in situ in Southeast Asia and on the Indian subcontinent. Although DENV 4-I cases occasionally were found elsewhere, this genotype didn&#x02019;t undergo in situ evolution and largely failed to establish. We found that mainland Southeast Asia, specifically Thailand, was at the center of the global spread of the viruses, which in time contributed to the observed diversity.</p><p>Although Thailand&#x02019;s strains dominated the records, the Philippines&#x02019; strains were at the basal location of the phylogeny. The analyzed diverge time (95% HPD: 1955&#x02013;1956) is consistent with the timing of DENV 4-I virus being first detected in the Philippines. Therefore, we propose that global spread of DENV 4-I originated very likely from the Philippines. From the Philippines, DENV 4-I spread to Thailand and then on to nearby countries including Sri Lanka. On this point our findings clash with one previous study&#x02019;s results indicating that DENV 4-I originated from Thailand, from where it spread to the neighboring countries of the Philippines and Sri Lanka [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>We found that the strains of DENV 4-I&#x02014;monophyletic Clade IV, detected in the Indian subcontinent including Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan, probably originated in Thailand, then evolved in situ, but as of 2016, had not yet spread outside of the Indian subcontinent. Dengue is endemic in the Indian subcontinent and four serotypes have been co-circulating, with DENV 2 and DENV 3 dominating [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, the distribution and dissemination patterns of the different genotypes are not uniform. A study showed that the DENV 3 genotype III (DENV 3-III) was spread from the Indian subcontinent to East Africa first and then from there to Latin America [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Another study on DENV 2 showed that the cosmopolitan genotype was spread from the Indian subcontinent directly to Latin America [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition to the Indian subcontinent, dengue is also endemic in Brazil. Even in two separate regions of the world where dengue is endemic, the specific evolutionary drivers of a given serotype and genotype may differ.</p><p>DENV4-I was introduced to Brazil in 2011. Our study indicated that the strain was probably imported from mainland Southeast Asia, which was consistent with the analysis conducted in a previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Curiously, DENV 4-I apparently disappeared quickly from Brazil after the introduction. This is different from the expansion/establishment patterns of DENV 4-II, which has become established in the Caribbean since early 1980s after being introduced from Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Human movement is known to play a significant role in contributing to the virus distribution at large spatial scales (e.g., national, international) [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], because of the limited range of mosquitos&#x02019; flying distance. However, human movement alone cannot explain the different expansion pathways and establishment of new genotypes, for example, in the DENV 4-I dynamics on the Indian subcontinent and Brazil even after controlling for the climate suitability and mosquito abundance. These studies show that the spread of dengue virus is not merely shaped by human movement. Human movement is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Different pathways of genotypes spread may be associated with the strain virulence, human population immunity, previous exposure to other dengue viruses, in addition to the volume and timing of human population movements, the local environment, and numerous other factors.</p><p>Our study on evolution rate showed that the substitution rate of DENV 4-I is 9.74 (95% HPD: 8.68&#x02013;10.82) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year.

The range of mean evolution rate from DENV 2&#x02013;4 is found to be (8.3&#x02013;10.7) &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which included Asian I and Asian-American genotype of DENV 2, genotype I-III of DENV 3, DENV 4-II. Although DENV 4-I was shown to evolve with a relatively large substitution rate comparing to some other genotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], there is no significant rate differences among the different dengue serotypes. Among the five Clades of DENV 4-I, we found that the highest evolution rate was among Clade II strains (<xref rid="pntd.0007592.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The MCC tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g003">Fig 3</xref>) indicates that the strains of Clade II spread rapidly in mainland Southeast Asia. The rapid spread and the subsequent replication in a large susceptible population of hosts could account for the higher rate of evolution, when compared to the other Clades in DENV 4-I having relatively smaller pools of susceptible hosts. We found no evidence of positive selection in most of the Clades of DENV 4-I, although there was evidence for weak positive selection in Clade III. Some studies have suggested purifying selection [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], where majority of amino acid changes within infected hosts, are deleterious in the long run and are eventually removed from the population [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This purifying selection induces the distinct ladder-like phylogeny. Our study confirms this purifying selection process as the predominant evolutionary force acting on DENV 4-I.</p><p>Our study also showed that DENV 4-I experienced a fluctuating demographic pattern although occurring in a low prevalence compared to other serotypes. The fluctuation of effective infected population size might be shaped by human population immunity/susceptibility. DENV 4-I was first detected in the Philippines and spread to Thailand and Sri Lanka before 1980, where humans were lacking previous exposure and thus immunity. The effective infected population size decreased once immunity was built up as result of previous exposure. DENV 4-I viruses spread onto Vietnam around 1992 (95% HPD: 1986&#x02013;1996) and evolved in situ, which might have induced the secondary increase. This observation agrees with the study by Villabona-Arenas <italic>et al</italic>. using the dataset from 1956 to 2008. They indicated that the effective population size was estimated to be the largest at two time periods around 1982 and 2005 [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which is similar to our result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g005">Fig 5A</xref> using a larger dataset covering a longer period.</p><p>Dengue is endemic in Vietnam. Most of the DENV 4-I strains detected in Vietnam shaped the Clade III, as the in situ evolution occurred since DENV 4-I started circulating in Vietnam in 1998. It did not dominate during dengue epidemics until 2013 when a large outbreak was occurred having 204,661 clinical cases with nearly 50% of them having DENV 4-I in central Vietnam [<xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This occurrence coincided with the demographic history of Clade III. Lacking immunity to DENV 4-I among the Vietnamese human population could be a reason to cause second infection and therefore severe dengue which resulted in being more likely reported. Amino acid 95 under positive selection could also account for this large outbreak. The E protein ectodomain can be divided into three structural domains designated domain I-III. Domain II contains the fusion loop (residue 98&#x02013;111), which interacts with the host endosomal membrane, leading to virus-mediated membrane fusion and allowing the newly infecting virus to initiate the cellular replication cycle. As residue 95 is located three residues downstream of the fusion loop, it is likely to indirectly affect the process of membrane fusion. The Vietnam strains experiencing positive selection pressure did not spread outside of Vietnam based on the available data and our findings. Enhanced surveillance to these strains could be very helpful to aid in understanding and controlling this potentially devastating virus strain.</p><p>Although our study represents the most comprehensive study on the evolutionary dynamics of DENV 4-I using the largest dataset available to date, the results should be interpreted cautiously given various limitations. For example, itself, reporting of DENV, especially in the genetic record, is a source of many types of potential bias, of particular concern in locations with limited resources for virologic diagnostic and reporting capacity. While our dataset represents an opportunistic, but highly useful sample of occurrence, it should be noted that we worked with a limited subset of data, rather than a complete record of global DENV 4-I transmission dynamics. To account for sampling bias, in this study we constructed and analyzed a down-sampled dataset for sensitive analysis, finding an equivalent result to that which was obtained with the full dataset. Nevertheless, the quality of this type of study will be increased greatly with an enhanced global dengue surveillance, greater access to next generation diagnostic and sequencing tools, and improved data sharing systems. Our current study can be described as exploratory research, as this is the first time that the geographic spread and evolutionary dynamics of the DENV 4-I was mapped out and analyzed based on a large dataset. Given that other dengue research in this area is sparse and rarely conducts genotype-specific analysis, our targeted focus on just one genotype of DENV 4 makes comparison difficult. We hope that our study can stimulate further research studies in this area so that in the future researchers can compare different genotypes and understand better the similarities and differences among them. Our mapping of the genotypes&#x02019; distribution pattern may help to generate hypotheses on the specific mechanisms mediating the spread of DENV 4-I. This understanding is potentially of great utility in the generation of health policies and practices on dengue prevention and control.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we have investigated the global patterns of DENV 4-I dissemination&#x02014;its spatial and temporal distribution. This is the most extensive molecular epidemiological study of DENV 4 genotype I to date to our knowledge. Our results indicate that recent spread of DENV 4-I originated in maritime Southeast Asia, probably from the Philippines, from where it spread to mainland Southeast Asia, and then on to the Indian subcontinent. Thailand acted as a distribution hub for spreading the virus regionally and globally. Within the India subcontinent, India was the distribution center for spreading the virus. We found that there is no uniform spreading pattern among genotypes. In addition, purifying selection was still the dominant acting force on E gene to shape the evolution, but weak positive selection existed in dengue viruses detected in Vietnam.</p><p>This work is a first step towards increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the spread of DENV 4-I virus. Our study suggests that surveillance could be enhanced to better leverage next generation sequencing for informing dengue control practices. Regional cooperation should be strengthened to determine and communicate information on the genotype-specific spreading pathways, to explore the related underlying mechanisms, and ultimately to better coordinate dengue control efforts globally.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007592.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>Results of substitution saturation analysis (A) and likelihood mapping analysis (B).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007592.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007592.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree summarized for down-sampled dataset of DENV 4-I.</title><p>The colors of the branches corresponded to their probable geographic location (see the legend).
