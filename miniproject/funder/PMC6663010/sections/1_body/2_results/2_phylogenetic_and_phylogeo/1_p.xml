 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree. It indicates that the recent spread of DENV 4-I most likely originated from the Philippines with 0.98 posterior location probability. Viruses evolved in the Philippines and then spread across the sea to Thailand, Cambodia, Australia and China at different times. Thailand played the dominate role in spreading the viruses, gradually spreading virus to the Indian subcontinent, Myanmar, Cambodia, Singapore, Indonesia and China. These viruses diverged around 1957, 1963, 1976 and 1990, and shaped different Clades (Clade I to V). Since the introduction from Thailand, DENV 4-I has evolved in the Indian subcontinent (Clade IV), Myanmar (Clade II) and Cambodia (Clade I and III), respectively. Strains obtained in Vietnam correspond to Clade III, which evolved notably in situ for three decades after introduction from Cambodia. In the Indian subcontinent (Clade IV), dengue virus first apparently arrived in Sri Lanka in the 1960s from Thailand and then spread onto India in the early 1970s. India then became an epicenter for transmission and spread virus to Pakistan and back to Sri Lanka in the 2000s.
