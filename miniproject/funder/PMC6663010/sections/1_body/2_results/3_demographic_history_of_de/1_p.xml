 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g005">Fig 5A</xref> illustrates the demographic history of DENV 4-I. A fluctuation was observed over the 60 years with an approximately “M” shape. The two highest plateaus were around 1982 and 2006 with a width about 6-years, while the lowest point was around 1996. Analysis of the Clade I dataset revealed, as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g005">Fig 5B</xref> exhibits, that the effective population size increased approximately linearly from 1992 to 2004, and then decreased slowly from 2004 to 2013. The effective population size of Clade II, as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g005">Fig 5C</xref> conveys, increased slowly for the first two decades and then much more sharply (2007–2013), before a rapid recent decrease (2013–2016). Data from the Clade III in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g005">Fig 5D</xref> shows that there were two peaks (~2000 and ~2011) over nearly four decades of demographic analysis. The effective population size of Clade IV over the same period decreased slowly and then stayed constant with the inflexion lying around 1990, as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g005">Fig 5E</xref> depicts. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, one can see the long demographic history pattern of Clade V (1956–2013) is mirrored by Clade IV, but with the inflexion point much earlier (~1965).
