Specifically, the recorded samples revealed that DEVN 4-I was mainly observed in Mainland Southeast Asia, especially Thailand and Vietnam. Collection of DENV 4-I covered a period of 60 years. The first strain of DENV 4-I was detected in 1956 in the Philippines, where it transmitted exclusively for some 20 years, according to known reporting and sequencing records. Over the two decades following 1976, most detected strains of DENV 4-I were found to be circulating in Thailand, while a few strains were discovered in other four countries. Detected in a total of 14 countries, DENV 4-I continued to diffuse to more areas around the globe between 1996 and 2016.
