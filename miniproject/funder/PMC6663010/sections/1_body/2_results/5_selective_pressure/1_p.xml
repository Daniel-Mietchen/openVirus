 <italic>vs</italic> M2a test and M7 
 <italic>vs</italic> M8 test indicated consistently that there was no positive selection across overall DENV 4-I, Clade I, II, IV and V datasets. In Clade III dataset, no positive selection was indicated by M1a 
 <italic>vs</italic> M2a test, however, M7 
 <italic>vs</italic> M8 test inferred a weak positive selection (5.6% of codons with 
 <italic>Ï‰</italic> = 1.193) with amino acid site 95
