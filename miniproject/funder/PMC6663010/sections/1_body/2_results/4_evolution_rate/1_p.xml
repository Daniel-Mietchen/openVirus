 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the evolution rate and the divergence time of the different Clades’ datasets. The overall evolution rate was 9.74 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> (95% HPD: 8.68 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>–10.82 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) nucleotide substitutions/site/year and TMRCA of DENV 4-I was 1956 (95% HPD: 1955–1956) (year). The mean evolution rate of different Clades was comparable, with the smallest being 8.66 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year in Clade V and the largest being 11.3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year in Clade II. TMRCA of Clade I to V was 1991, 1990, 1977, 1971 and 1962, respectively.
