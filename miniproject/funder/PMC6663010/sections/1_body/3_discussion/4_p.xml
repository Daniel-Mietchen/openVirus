<p>DENV4-I was introduced to Brazil in 2011. Our study indicated that the strain was probably imported from mainland Southeast Asia, which was consistent with the analysis conducted in a previous study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Curiously, DENV 4-I apparently disappeared quickly from Brazil after the introduction. This is different from the expansion/establishment patterns of DENV 4-II, which has become established in the Caribbean since early 1980s after being introduced from Southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], because of the limited range of mosquitosâ€™ flying distance. However, human movement alone cannot explain the different expansion pathways and establishment of new genotypes, for example, in the DENV 4-I dynamics on the Indian subcontinent and Brazil even after controlling for the climate suitability and mosquito abundance. These studies show that the spread of dengue virus is not merely shaped by human movement. Human movement is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Different pathways of genotypes spread may be associated with the strain virulence, human population immunity, previous exposure to other dengue viruses, in addition to the volume and timing of human population movements, the local environment, and numerous other factors.
