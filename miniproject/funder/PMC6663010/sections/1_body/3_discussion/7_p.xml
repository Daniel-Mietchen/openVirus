<p>Dengue is endemic in Vietnam. Most of the DENV 4-I strains detected in Vietnam shaped the Clade III, as the in situ evolution occurred since DENV 4-I started circulating in Vietnam in 1998. It did not dominate during dengue epidemics until 2013 when a large outbreak was occurred having 204,661 clinical cases with nearly 50% of them having DENV 4-I in central Vietnam [

Lacking immunity to DENV 4-I among the Vietnamese human population could be a reason to cause second infection and therefore severe dengue which resulted in being more likely reported. Amino acid 95 under positive selection could also account for this large outbreak. The E protein ectodomain can be divided into three structural domains designated domain I-III. Domain II contains the fusion loop (residue 98â€“111), which interacts with the host endosomal membrane, leading to virus-mediated membrane fusion and allowing the newly infecting virus to initiate the cellular replication cycle. As residue 95 is located three residues downstream of the fusion loop, it is likely to indirectly affect the process of membrane fusion. The Vietnam strains experiencing positive selection pressure did not spread outside of Vietnam based on the available data and our findings. Enhanced surveillance to these strains could be very helpful to aid in understanding and controlling this potentially devastating virus strain.
