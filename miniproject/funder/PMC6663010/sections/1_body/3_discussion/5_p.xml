<p>Our study on evolution rate showed that the substitution rate of DENV 4-I is 9.74 (95% HPD: 8.68–10.82) × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year. This is comparable with the value found by Klungthong 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (10.72 (95% HPD: 8.41–13.11) × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year), but is approximately twice that of the one estimated by Twiddy 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (5.42 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year) using an admittedly much smaller dataset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The range of mean evolution rate from DENV 2–4 is found to be (8.3–10.7) × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> nucleotide substitutions/site/year [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which included Asian I and Asian-American genotype of DENV 2, genotype I-III of DENV 3, DENV 4-II. Although DENV 4-I was shown to evolve with a relatively large substitution rate comparing to some other genotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], there is no significant rate differences among the different dengue serotypes. Among the five Clades of DENV 4-I, we found that the highest evolution rate was among Clade II strains (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The MCC tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007592.g003">Fig 3</xref>) indicates that the strains of Clade II spread rapidly in mainland Southeast Asia. The rapid spread and the subsequent replication in a large susceptible population of hosts could account for the higher rate of evolution, when compared to the other Clades in DENV 4-I having relatively smaller pools of susceptible hosts. We found no evidence of positive selection in most of the Clades of DENV 4-I, although there was evidence for weak positive selection in Clade III. Some studies have suggested purifying selection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], where majority of amino acid changes within infected hosts, are deleterious in the long run and are eventually removed from the population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This purifying selection induces the distinct ladder-like phylogeny. Our study confirms this purifying selection process as the predominant evolutionary force acting on DENV 4-I.
