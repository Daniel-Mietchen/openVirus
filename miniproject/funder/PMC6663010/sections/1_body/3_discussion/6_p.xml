<p>Our study also showed that DENV 4-I experienced a fluctuating demographic pattern although occurring in a low prevalence compared to other serotypes. The fluctuation of effective infected population size might be shaped by human population immunity/susceptibility. DENV 4-I was first detected in the Philippines and spread to Thailand and Sri Lanka before 1980, where humans were lacking previous exposure and thus immunity. The effective infected population size decreased once immunity was built up as result of previous exposure. DENV 4-I viruses spread onto Vietnam around 1992 (95% HPD: 1986â€“1996) and evolved in situ, which might have induced the secondary increase. This observation agrees with the study by Villabona-Arenas 
 <italic>et al</italic>. using the dataset from 1956 to 2008. They indicated that the effective population size was estimated to be the largest at two time periods around 1982 and 2005 [
