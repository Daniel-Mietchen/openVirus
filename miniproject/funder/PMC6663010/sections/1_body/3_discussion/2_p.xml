<p>Although Thailand’s strains dominated the records, the Philippines’ strains were at the basal location of the phylogeny. The analyzed diverge time (95% HPD: 1955–1956) is consistent with the timing of DENV 4-I virus being first detected in the Philippines. Therefore, we propose that global spread of DENV 4-I originated very likely from the Philippines. From the Philippines, DENV 4-I spread to Thailand and then on to nearby countries including Sri Lanka. On this point our findings clash with one previous study’s results indicating that DENV 4-I originated from Thailand, from where it spread to the neighboring countries of the Philippines and Sri Lanka [
