<p>Although our study represents the most comprehensive study on the evolutionary dynamics of DENV 4-I using the largest dataset available to date, the results should be interpreted cautiously given various limitations. For example, itself, reporting of DENV, especially in the genetic record, is a source of many types of potential bias, of particular concern in locations with limited resources for virologic diagnostic and reporting capacity. While our dataset represents an opportunistic, but highly useful sample of occurrence, it should be noted that we worked with a limited subset of data, rather than a complete record of global DENV 4-I transmission dynamics. To account for sampling bias, in this study we constructed and analyzed a down-sampled dataset for sensitive analysis, finding an equivalent result to that which was obtained with the full dataset. Nevertheless, the quality of this type of study will be increased greatly with an enhanced global dengue surveillance, greater access to next generation diagnostic and sequencing tools, and improved data sharing systems. Our current study can be described as exploratory research, as this is the first time that the geographic spread and evolutionary dynamics of the DENV 4-I was mapped out and analyzed based on a large dataset. Given that other dengue research in this area is sparse and rarely conducts genotype-specific analysis, our targeted focus on just one genotype of DENV 4 makes comparison difficult. We hope that our study can stimulate further research studies in this area so that in the future researchers can compare different genotypes and understand better the similarities and differences among them. Our mapping of the genotypesâ€™ distribution pattern may help to generate hypotheses on the specific mechanisms mediating the spread of DENV 4-I. This understanding is potentially of great utility in the generation of health policies and practices on dengue prevention and control.</p>
