<p>In this study, we have investigated the global patterns of DENV 4-I disseminationâ€”its spatial and temporal distribution. This is the most extensive molecular epidemiological study of DENV 4 genotype I to date to our knowledge. Our results indicate that recent spread of DENV 4-I originated in maritime Southeast Asia, probably from the Philippines, from where it spread to mainland Southeast Asia, and then on to the Indian subcontinent. Thailand acted as a distribution hub for spreading the virus regionally and globally. Within the India subcontinent, India was the distribution center for spreading the virus. We found that there is no uniform spreading pattern among genotypes. In addition, purifying selection was still the dominant acting force on E gene to shape the evolution, but weak positive selection existed in dengue viruses detected in Vietnam.</p>
