<p>This work is a first step towards increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing the spread of DENV 4-I virus. Our study suggests that surveillance could be enhanced to better leverage next generation sequencing for informing dengue control practices. Regional cooperation should be strengthened to determine and communicate information on the genotype-specific spreading pathways, to explore the related underlying mechanisms, and ultimately to better coordinate dengue control efforts globally.</p>
