<p>In this study, using the most comprehensive and largest dataset(s) available we mapped the spatial distribution and 60-years evolution of one genotype from one of the four serotypes of dengue virus, DENV 4-I. We further separated this large dataset into different Clades and analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of Clades separately. Our study shows that the spatial distribution of DENV 4-I is mainly restricted to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The recent spread of DENV 4-I likely originated from Southeast Asia–namely the Philippines, from where it then spread all the way to the Indian subcontinent, Australia and Latin America. DENV 4-I evolved in situ in Southeast Asia and on the Indian subcontinent. Although DENV 4-I cases occasionally were found elsewhere, this genotype didn’t undergo in situ evolution and largely failed to establish. We found that mainland Southeast Asia, specifically Thailand, was at the center of the global spread of the viruses, which in time contributed to the observed diversity.</p>
