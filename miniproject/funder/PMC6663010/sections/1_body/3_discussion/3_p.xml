<p>We found that the strains of DENV 4-Iâ€”monophyletic Clade IV, detected in the Indian subcontinent including Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan, probably originated in Thailand, then evolved in situ, but as of 2016, had not yet spread outside of the Indian subcontinent. Dengue is endemic in the Indian subcontinent and four serotypes have been co-circulating, with DENV 2 and DENV 3 dominating [

A study showed that the DENV 3 genotype III (DENV 3-III) was spread from the Indian subcontinent to East Africa first and then from there to Latin America [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition to the Indian subcontinent, dengue is also endemic in Brazil. Even in two separate regions of the world where dengue is endemic, the specific evolutionary drivers of a given serotype and genotype may differ.
