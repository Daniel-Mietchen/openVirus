<p>The phylogenetic signal of the aligned DENV 4-I was evaluated by plotting the observed number of transitions and transversions against genetic distance for the n (n-1)/2 pairwise comparisons in an alignment of n taxa using DAMBE [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is expected that transitions and transversions increase linearly with the genetic distance, with transitions being more frequent than transversions. In the Supplementary Materials, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007592.s001">S1 Fig</xref> shows that no substitution saturation was detected, indicating phylogeny reconstruction was appropriate. In likelihood mapping analysis, groups of four sequences (quartets) were evaluated using the maximum likelihood approach. For each quartet, the three possible unrooted tree topologies were weighted. The likelihood weights were then plotted into a triangular surface. The fully resolved tree topologies were plotted in the three corners, which indicated the presence of a tree-like phylogenetic signal, and the unresolved quartets, indicating a star-like signal were shown in the central region of the triangle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Likelihood mapping was performed using the TREE-PUZZLE program [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], by analyzing 10,000 random quartets. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007592.s001">S1 Fig</xref> showed tree-like area accounted for 96.4%, which further suggested that the data were reliable for phylogenetic inference.
