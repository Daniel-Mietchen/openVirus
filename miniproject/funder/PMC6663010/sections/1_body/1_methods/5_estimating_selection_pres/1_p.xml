<p>We used a variety of computational methods to explore the selection pressures. A Maximum Likelihood (ML) method was used to examine selection pressures [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the analysis, the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio (
 <italic>ω = d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>N</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>/d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>S</italic>
 </sub>) was determined codon-by-codon using various models of codon substitution. These models differ in how 
 <italic>ω</italic> ratios are allowed to vary along the sequence. Four models of codon substitution were conducted in the study: M1a (
 <italic>ω</italic> &lt; = 1; nearly neutral), M2a (
 <italic>ω</italic> &lt; = 1 and 
 <italic>ω</italic> &gt; 1; positive selection), M7 (beta; a discrete distribution with 10 site classes to model values of 
 <italic>ω</italic> between 0 and 1) and M8 (beta and 
 <italic>ω</italic> &gt; 1). M1a is nested with M2a, and M7 is nested with M8. Models that are nested are compared statistically using a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). Positive selection can be inferred when a group of codons with a 
 <italic>ω</italic> ratio &gt; 1 is identified and the likelihood of the codon substitution model in question is significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that of a nested model that does not take positive selection into account. Lastly, using Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) methods, posterior probabilities were calculated to identify sites under positive selection (posterior Bayesian probability (
 <italic>P</italic>p) &gt; 95%). All the analyses were performed by using CODEML from the PAML v4.9 package [
