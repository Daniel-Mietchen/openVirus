<p>Evolution rate, effective population size dynamics, divergence time and selection pressure were estimated based on two different types of datasets: (i) all sequences of DENV 4-I and (ii) those from different Clades. The spatial diffusion was estimated based on all sequences of DENV 4-I. In order to minimize oversampling of Thailand and Vietnam during the spatial diffusion analysis, we down-sampled dataset for sensitive analysis. The down-sampled dataset included 50 sequences at random, from each Thailand and Vietnam and all the available sequenced strains from other countries/regions, therefore making the sample size 207 sequences.</p>
