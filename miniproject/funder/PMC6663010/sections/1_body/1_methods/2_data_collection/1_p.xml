<p>Dengue viruses detected in Yunnan Province were recovered from serum samples of suspected dengue patients visiting hospital from 2013 to 2016. The envelope (E) genes of isolates were sequenced as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These have been assigned GenBank accession numbers (HM893690-HM893699, MG601754, KJ470764, KJ470765, KX262920, KX262923). The sequences of Yunnan were compared with published sequences by using the nucleotide blast program in the NCBI. All the sequences of human DENV 4-I with full length E-gene (1,485 nucleotides) were downloaded with the accession number, collection date and country/region (as of January 11
 <sup>th</sup>, 2018). All the sequences were aligned using MAFFT [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We chose only one sequence to represent sequences with 100% matching identity by location and time. Recombinants detected based on the analyses of RDP3 program [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were also excluded. Ultimately, 404 sequences of DENV 4-I obtained from 14 countries were included for analyses in this study (
