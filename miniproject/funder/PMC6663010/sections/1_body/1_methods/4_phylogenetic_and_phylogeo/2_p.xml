<p>The spatial diffusion of DENV 4-I was estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) statistical framework implemented in the BEAST v1.8.2 package. The phylogeographical diffusion process was identified using the Bayesian Stochastic Variable Search Selection (BSVSS). Effective population size dynamics were estimated using the Bayesian Skyride Coalescent statistical approach.</p>
