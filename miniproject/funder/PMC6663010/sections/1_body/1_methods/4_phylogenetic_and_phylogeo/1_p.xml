<p>Rates of nucleotide substitution per site per year and time to The Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) were estimated using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and implemented using the BEAST v1.8.2 software package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The best-fit model of nucleotide substitutions was determined using Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) as implemented in jModelTest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The calibration point was the “year” that each strain was isolated. Statistical simulations were performed under strict or relaxed (uncorrelated exponential and lognormal) clock model, with the Bayesian Skyride Coalescent Tree Prior [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To determine the best-fit combination, we have applied Posterior-simulation Akaike Information Criterion through MCMC (AICM) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Bayes Factor (BF) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Harmonic Mean (HM) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Path Sampling (PS) and Stepping-stone Sampling (SS) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] model selection methods. The results showed that the best fitting model was the combination of uncorrelated relaxed exponential clock model and the Bayesian Skyride Coalescent model (

All chains were run sufficiently long to achieve convergence (the effective sample size of continuous parameters greater than 200) after burn-in, as checked using TRACER v1.5 (

Based on the MCC tree, we identified five Clades using visual judgement and comparison among all the countries/regions that reported DENV 4-I. Using the definition of a minimum of three sequences of monophyletic origin, DENV 4-I were labelled with Clade I to V (the largest five) where every Clade included as many strains as possible.
