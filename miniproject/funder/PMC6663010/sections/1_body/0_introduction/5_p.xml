<p>In this study, we used available GenBank data in addition to Chinese data sources to make the first attempt to more comprehensively understand the spatial and evolutionary patterns of DENV 4-I. Leveraging full envelope gene sequences in our analysis, we sought to investigate the origin and spreading routes of this less-studied, rare but deadly virus, in order to contribute important information for future dengue prevention and control efforts around the globe.</p>
