<p>The four antigenically distant serotypes comprising dengue virus are categorized as DENV 1, -2, -3, and -4. Each serotype is classified into different genotypes based on complete E gene sequences [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The four serotypes were first identified at different times and locations, and diffused globally at different rates. Although clearly circulating before isolation techniques enabled the viruses’ discovery and characterization, DENV 1 was first reported in 1943 in French Polynesia and Japan, DENV 2 in 1944 in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, DENV 3 and DENV 4 both in 1953 in the Philippines and Thailand [

 <italic>Flav</italic>ivirus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it spread the slowest geographically [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar to other serotypes, DENV 4 can also cause severe dengue including dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). An epidemiological study in Thailand from 1973 to 1999 revealed that despite the proportionately lower prevalence of DENV 4, it was responsible for 10% of all DHF cases in Children [
