<p>The dengue viruses DENV 1–4 are typically prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions globally. However, the spatial distribution of different genotypes is not uniform, e.g., some genotypes exist only in specific parts of Asia and others are more cosmopolitan. While the distinct distribution patterns of different genotypes remain enigmatic, mapping of the genotypes’ distribution can generate hypotheses on their spatial pattern and support policies on dengue prevention and control effort. In the past, efforts have been made to infer the dispersal of DENV 1–4 and to elucidate the evolution of their diffusion patterns [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007592.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, so far no studies investigated globally the spatial distribution of the single genotype, DENV 4-I, its diversity, and its temporal evolution. This may be due to the limited number of recorded cases and the distribution of DENV 4-I worldwide.
