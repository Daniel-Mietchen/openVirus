  <title>The temporal distribution of DENV 4-I by location.</title>
  <p>The red color dots represents the strains detected in mainland Southeast Asia and its adjacent provinces of China; similarly, blue depicts those found in maritime Southeast Asia; green those from the Indian subcontinent; and purple those few strains found in circulation elsewhere (Brazil and Australia). The diameter size of the circles corresponds to the number unique strains of DENV 4-I in a given year in a given location.</p>
