<p>Detection of arbovirus in immature stages or mosquitoes has been well described. In our study of 615 specimens distributed in 18 pools, we found 3 positive for ZIKV, with a MIR for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> of 11.6 (2/173) and for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> of 2.3 (1/442) suggesting that arboviruses have been transmitted by the transovarial route. Two other studies also obtained similar data, with immature phases developed until the adult forms, where DENV-4 was detected in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and MIR was 10.5 (8/758) (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and another in Fortaleza for DENV-3, which despite the high incidence rate of DENV, the MIR for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was 0.5 (1/2005) and for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, 9.4 (2/212) (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In a study carried out in Colombia, using an immunofluorescent assay with a flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibody on adult 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females, the MIR was 11.6 (24/2065) for DENV but no vertical transmission of DENV could be detected in 1552 male 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> collected (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
