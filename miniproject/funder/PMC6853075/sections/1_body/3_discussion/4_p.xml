<p>Transovarial transmission of arbovirus allows persistence of the viruses in nature and is relevant to the epidemiological role in outbreaks of vector-borne diseases (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Our data suggested that the transovarial transmission capacity of both 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, may be related to the persistent survival of ZIKV during interepidemic periods, which has already been demonstrated by Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Interestingly, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may play an important role in the maintenance of ZIKV throughout the year, as it was found persistently in foci in the studied area; it is a species more adapted to temperate climatic conditions and less urbanized areas (
