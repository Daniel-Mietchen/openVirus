<p>In Brazil, arbovirus monitoring using RT-PCR in larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. is performed sporadically by some surveys (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and is not used as a routine tool in arbovirus control programs. The RT-PCR has several advantages, such as rapid detection, sensitivity, and specificity, and can be applied in the surveillance of arboviruses (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), especially when negative results are obtained by other tests, such as viral isolation in cell cultures (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Our results confirmed the high level of sensitivity by RT-PCR in pools containing a smaller amount of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, as obtained in other studies (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).
