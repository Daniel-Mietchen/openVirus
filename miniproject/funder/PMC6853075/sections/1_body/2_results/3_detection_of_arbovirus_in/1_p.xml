<p>A total of 615 immature stages (larvae and pupae) were collected every two months from June 2015 to April 2016, 442 (72%) of which were identified as 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 173 (28%) as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. The RT-qPCR for DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV was performed in all pools and, of the 18 pools analyzed, 3 (which only had larvae) were positive for ZIKV, suggesting the occurrence of transovarian transmission of ZIKV of 11.6% (2/173) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 2.3% (1/442) for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. The positive pools were from October 2015, containing 38 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and December 2015, containing 33 larvae of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 3 larvae of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). According to these results, the cycle thresholds of positive pools, when screened by RT-qPCR, were: in October/2015: 37.34 (larvae 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>) and December/2015: 36.00 (larvae 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>); 37.84 (larvae 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>). CHIKV and DENV were not identified in any of the pools evaluated.
