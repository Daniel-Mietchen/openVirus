<p>Influenza A viruses express two accessory proteins, NS1 and PA-X, to induce general host shutoff, which work through different mechanisms [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Interaction of NS1 with CPSF30 prevents processing of pre-mRNA in the cell nucleus, while PA-X directly degrades RNA Pol II transcripts in both nucleus and cytoplasm of an infected cell [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Both NS1 and PA-X contribute to antagonizing host antiviral and immune responses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, their shutoff activities vary between virus isolates. Most seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses express shutoff-active NS1, but their PA-X shutoff activities are relatively low compared to avian-origin viruses due to various mutations in the N-terminal domain of PA gene [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The 2009 pH1N1 strains express shutoff-inactive NS1 due to amino acid substitution in CPSF30 binding residues, while their PA-X shutoff activities are highly active due to their avian-origin PA gene [

Influenza viruses rely on cellular machinery for genome replication and viral protein synthesis; therefore, the viruses likely need to adjust their shutoff activities to create an optimum cellular environment for efficient viral growth. In this study, we investigated the functional interplay between influenza PA-X and NS1 proteins on viral and host gene expression in infected human and avian cells and identified preferential cellular mRNA targets and the biological pathways associated with PA-X and NS1 shutoff activities. We found that i) PA-X strongly inhibits host protein synthesis in human and avian cultured cells, while the effect of active NS1 on general host protein synthesis was predominantly observed in avian cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g002">Fig 2</xref>); ii) PA-X preferentially targets cellular mRNAs involved in protein modification, metabolism and repair processes, while shutoff-active NS1 specifically targets genes involved in antiviral responses and strongly suppresses induction of IFN, interleukin, chemokine and class I MHC genes (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007465.s006">S2</xref> Tables); iii) shutoff-active NS1 together with PA-X predominantly repressed viral NS1 and NEP mRNA expression (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g008">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g009">9</xref> and S3); and iv) the virus expressing shutoff-active NS1 with a limited amount of PA-X (Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low]) whose shutoff activity mimics that of seasonal human viruses, is the most potent in antagonizing antiviral and innate immune responses in human cells (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007465.g005">5</xref> and
