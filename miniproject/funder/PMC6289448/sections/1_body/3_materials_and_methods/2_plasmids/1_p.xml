<p>pPolI-CalNS3m was created by subcloning HindIII/pPuMI fragment of pCAGGS-CalNS3m [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to pPolI-CalNS1m (R108K), which was generated by site-direct mutagenesis. pPolI-CalPA-XFS was previously constructed by site-directed mutagenesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other pPolI and pCAGGS vectors for virus rescue were described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
