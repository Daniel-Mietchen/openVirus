<p>Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] viruses were rescued by a 12-plasmid rescue system [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007465.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Rescued viruses were plaque purified in MDCK cells, and stock virus was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Mutations in PA and NS sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis. The viruses were titrated in MDCK cells, A549, Calu-3 and DF-1 cells by immunofluorescence analysis of the NP [
