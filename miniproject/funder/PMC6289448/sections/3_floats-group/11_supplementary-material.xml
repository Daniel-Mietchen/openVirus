  <title>Differential expression of genes of individual virus-infected conditions with mock.</title>
  <p>(A) Volcano plots of differential gene expression between individual virus-infected conditions versus mock demonstrate the significance (-log
   <sub>10</sub> P-value) on the y-axis and the magnitude of difference (log
   <sub>2</sub> fold-change) on the x-axis. Genes with multiple test corrected P-value &lt; 0.05 were colored according to the direction of the fold-change (green: down-regulation or red: up-regulation). A line was drawn at the unadjusted P-value of 0.05 for reference. (B) A table demonstrates the number of DEGs (adjusted P value &lt; 0.05) and the number of at least two-fold up- or down-regulated DEGs of A549 cells infected with indicated viruses compared to mock. (C) Venn diagrams demonstrate genes that were at least two-fold up-regulated (left) or down-regulated (right) upon infection with Cal [NS1_low-PAX_high], Cal [NS1_low-PAX_low], Cal [NS1_high-PAX_high], and Cal [NS1_high-PAX_low] viruses compared to mock.
