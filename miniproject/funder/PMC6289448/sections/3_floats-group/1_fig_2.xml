  <title>Shutoff activity on host protein synthesis of human and avian cultured cells by mutant viruses.</title>
  <p>(A) A549 or DF-1 cells were left uninfected or infected with the viruses at MOI of 2. At 16 h pi, cells were labeled with 
   <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys for 30 min and the radiolabeled lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. As loading controls, cellular actin was detected by Western blot analysis (lower panel). (B) Densitometric traces of labeled proteins shown in (A). (C) Quantities of cellular Î²-actin mRNAs in infected A549 or DF-1 cells at 12 h pi as determined by qRT-PCR. The data represent averages with standard deviations (n = 3). *, P&lt; 0.05, **, P&lt;0.01, ***, P&lt;0.001, NS, not significant. (D) Shutoff activity of the viruses in A549 cells at an early and late time points. Cells were labeled with 
   <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys at 6 or 24 h pi and total lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as (A).
