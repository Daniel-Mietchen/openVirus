  <title>Inhibitory activity of NS1 on innate signaling.</title>
  <p>(A) Interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Infected cell lysates were reacted with anti-NS1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated materials were analyzed for the presence of TRIM25 and NS1. Left figure is a representative of four independent experiments and bar graph on right shows relative ratio of co-immunoprecipitated proteins (n = 4). (B) Activation of IRF3 in infected cells. (Left) A549 cells infected with the viruses were determined for IRF phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. (Right) Translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus in infected cells was determined by immunofluorescence assay using anti-IRF3 antibody (red) counterstained with DAPI (blue).</p>
