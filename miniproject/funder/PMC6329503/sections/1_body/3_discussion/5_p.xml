<p>The association of the 65–74 and ≥75 years age groups with death was closer for type B and subtype A(H3N2), in agreement with the results of other studies that found high excess mortality in patients aged &gt;70 years in years with a high rate of A(H3N2) circulation and which recommended paying more attention to this subtype in the elderly [

 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Studies focused only on A(H1N1)pdm09 in Spain and in a cohort study including several countries also found a high risk of death in elderly patients [

 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. An increased risk of death in older age groups has been also reported in a study that did not differentiate by type/subtypes [
