<p>In our study, 161 patients requiring ICU care had COPD, but this was statistically significant only for type B. We have not found specific type/subtype analyses in other studies. Without distinguishing by type/subtype, Taylor et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found that COPD was more frequent in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (42.7% vs 30.3%) and Garg et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found an association between COPD and ICU admission or death. In a study of severe outcomes in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and influenza between 2000 and 2012, COPD was associated with an increased risk of ICU admission or death in the univariate but not in the multivariate analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other studies found no association with death [
