<p>In this series of hospitalized cases of severe influenza recorded from 2010 to 2016 in Catalonia, subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most frequent (40.3%) followed (22.5%) by influenza A(H3N2), while influenza type B was less frequent (14.1%). This distribution is similar to that reported in an Italian study from 2010–11 to 2014–15 (79.1%, 9.8% and 6.6%, respectively) and an international cohort from 2009 to 2015 (45.9%, 38.1% and 16.1%, respectively) [
