<p>The limitations include, firstly, the voluntary participation of hospitals, which could lead to selection bias. However, because the hospitals participating in the surveillance system cover more than 60% of the Catalan population and a mixed-effect logistic regression model with hospitals as a random intercept was used, we believe our results might be extensible to severe hospitalized patients in Catalonia. Secondly, not all influenza A case virus were subtyped. However, because the number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) cases was high, conclusions about the differences in risk factors related to these two subtypes seem robust. Thirdly, we were not able to investigate differences between the Victoria and Yamagata lineages because this information was not available. Fourthly, all comparisons were between severe hospitalized cases, and the results cannot be extrapolated to non-severe influenza cases.</p>
