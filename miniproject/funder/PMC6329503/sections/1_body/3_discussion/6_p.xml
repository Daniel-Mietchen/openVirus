<p>Men were more frequently admitted to the ICU than women (37.8% vs. 30.0%) but this association was only significant for type A, with the other types/subtypes having insufficient statistical power. These results are in agreement with those of the crude analysis in a 2010â€“2012 Canadian study with 62.7% of influenza A cases although the association was lost in the adjusted analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our study, as in others [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], sex was not associated with death for any influenza type or subtype. In contrast, in a study carried out in Taiwan over three seasons, male sex was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with A(H1N1) but not in those with A(H3N2) or B virus infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As Klein et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported, male-female differences in studies of influenza may be confounded by age and health seeking. We can reasonably rule out confounding by age because we introduced this variable in the adjusted analysis, but unfortunately we have no information about the health-seeking behaviours of patients included.
