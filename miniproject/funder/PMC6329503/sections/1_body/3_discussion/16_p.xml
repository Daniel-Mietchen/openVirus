<p>This study, like all observational studies, has strengths and limitations. First, comparative studies between factors associated with severe outcomes according to influenza type and subtype are scarce and, therefore, our results may help identify them. Secondly, unlike studies based on nonspecific outcomes [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], all cases included were laboratory-confirmed and, therefore, the distribution of independent variables corresponds to real severe influenza cases. Thirdly, the sample size permitted a multivariable analysis, therefore reducing the possibility of confounding factors invalidating the results.
