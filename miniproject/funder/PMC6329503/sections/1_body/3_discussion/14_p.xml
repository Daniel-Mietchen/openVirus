<p>Seasonal influenza vaccination was associated with a reduced risk of ICU admission in influenza A patients considered globally, but the statistical power was low to detect any association in type B or in A subtypes. In the Canadian study by Taylor et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we found differences in the vaccination coverage according to type/subtypes: the highest coverage (37.5%) was in A(H3N2) patients, followed by influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 patients (31.0% and 18.3%), suggesting lower effectiveness against subtype A(H3N2), which may be explained by more frequent mutations in this subtype and difficulties in obtaining the corresponding strain for the vaccine [
