<p>Patients aged ≥75 years were less frequently admitted to the ICU than those aged 18–64 years in all influenza types/subtypes and the 65–74 years age group was also associated with a lower frequency of ICU admission for all type A patients but the statistical power was low for influenza A subtypes and influenza type B. These results contrast with those related to death, which was higher in patients aged 65–74 and ≥75 years for all influenza types and subtypes. These differences suggest that age is probably taken into account when deciding whether a severe case should be admitted to the ICU. Possible explanations are that the elderly may be admitted to hospital more frequently with clinically less-severe influenza or, due to personal choice might be less frequently transferred to the ICU [
