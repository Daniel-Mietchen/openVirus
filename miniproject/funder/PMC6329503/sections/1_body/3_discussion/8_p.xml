<p>Obesity was associated with ICU admission in influenza A patients. Other studies in the post-pandemic period found not association between obesity and ICU admission [

A possible explanation is that, as in the case of age, obesity is taken into account when deciding whether a severe case should be admitted to the ICU. No association was found with death for any type or subtype, in agreement with the results of studies of influenza B and influenza A [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Specific studies of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H3N2) also found no association [

 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A meta-analysis suggested that data on obesity and the risk of death should be interpreted with caution, because early antiviral treatment might be a key confounding factor [
