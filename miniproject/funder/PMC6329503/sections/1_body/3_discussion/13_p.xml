<p>Antiviral treatment administered â‰¤48 hours after symptom onset prevented death in all influenza A patients considered jointly and also in A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) patients considered separately. In influenza B patients, the statistical power was insufficient to detect associations. However, as in studies in Italy and France, fewer influenza B patients received early antiviral treatment than those with influenza A subtypes, supporting the idea that treatment should be reinforced for type B patients [
