<p>In conclusion, although possible explanations are not always available, our results suggest that predictors of poor outcomes of influenza may vary by type/subtypes. Older age was a differential factor in patients hospitalized due to severe influenza with respect to ICU admission and death. While age â‰¥65 years was a risk factor for death in all influenza types and subtypes, and especially for type B, age &gt;75 years was associated with lower ICU admission for all influenza types and subtypes. The comorbidity with the closest association with death was immune deficiency, mainly in type B patients. Further studies on the virology of hospitalized influenza patients are required.</p>
