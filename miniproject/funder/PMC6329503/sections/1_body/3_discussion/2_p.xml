<p>Patient with A(H1N1)pdm09 required ICU admission more frequently (39.6%), followed by influenza B patients (30.9%) and A(H3N2) patients (26%). The same order of frequency was registered in the international study carried out during six influenza seasons by Dwyer et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (5.9%, 5.4% and 3.6%), but in studies carried out in England during five seasons [

 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] influenza B required a slightly higher frequency of ICU admission than subtype A(H3N2) (10.7% vs 10.5% and 14% vs 11%, respectively). The higher proportions of ICU admissions in our study may be due to the fact that only severe hospitalized cases were included rather than all the hospitalized cases included in the above mentioned studies.
