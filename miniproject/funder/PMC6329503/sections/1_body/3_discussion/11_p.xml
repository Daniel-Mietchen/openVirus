<p>Chronic cardiovascular diseases were a protective factor against ICU admission in influenza B patients and were a risk factor for death in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 patients. The surprising finding of the protective role of cardiovascular disease against ICU admission is similar to that found by Taylor et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in the pandemic period but not in the post-pandemic period. The evident benefits of statins in cardiovascular disease might also extend to patients with influenza [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Statins are widely recommended in patients with high levels of LDL-cholesterol, diabetes mellitus and a risk of cardiovascular morbidity [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Because these diseases are highly prevalent and the use of statins alone or in combination with other drugs is frequent in Spain [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], a possible explanation for this association might be that, in influenza B patients, a history of treatment with statins was more frequent than in influenza A patients. However, we have no information about previous statins uses and are thus unable to explain these results.
