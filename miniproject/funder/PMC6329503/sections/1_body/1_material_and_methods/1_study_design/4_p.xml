<p>Respiratory tract samples were processed at each hospital laboratory within 24 hours of receipt. A 300 μL aliquot was taken for total nucleic acid extraction and eluted in 25 μL of RNase-free elution buffer using the automatic QIAsymphony system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, two specific one-step multiplex real-time PCR techniques using Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR Systems (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were carried out to type A/B influenza viruses (sensitivity was 10 and 103 copies/μL, respectively) and influenza A virus subtypes (sensitivity was 102, 103 and 10 copies/μL for H1, H3 and H5 RNA, respectively) [
