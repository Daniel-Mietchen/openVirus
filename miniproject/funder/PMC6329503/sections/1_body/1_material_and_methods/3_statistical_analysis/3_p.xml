<p>Because the participating hospitals may not have been homogeneous and there were differences in the number of ICU admissions and deaths between hospitals, a mixed-effects logistic regression model with the variable 
 <italic>hospital</italic> as a random intercept was constructed to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted OR (aOR) were calculated using the mixed-effects logistic regression model with backward selection of variables, with a cut-off point of p&lt;0.2, and the variable 
 <italic>season</italic>, known to be a potential confounder was also included in the multivariable analysis.
