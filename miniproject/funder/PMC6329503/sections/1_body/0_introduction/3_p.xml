<p>Annual excess mortality appears to have increased over recent decades, perhaps because the number of elderly and immunocompromised individuals has also increased [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and is typically higher in A(H3N2) infections than in A(H1N1)pdm09 infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Infection due to influenza B viruses is often perceived to be milder than influenza A virus infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0210353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, similar clinical features between outpatients infected with seasonal influenza A or B viruses and no clinical differences between influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) in the post-pandemic period have been reported [
