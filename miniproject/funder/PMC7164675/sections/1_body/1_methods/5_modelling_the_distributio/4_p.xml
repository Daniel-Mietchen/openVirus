<p>Due to the disparity between local land use maps and global forest loss data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>), at each resolution, a set of 100 BRT sub-models was fitted to all environmental predictors and another set fitted to all predictors except area of forest loss. Models were fitted using the gbm.step function of the dismo package in R [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Model settings were as follows: learning rate = 0.001; tree.complexity = 4; bag rate = 0.6; to allow two way interactions between environmental predictors and to ensure that optimum number of trees always exceeded 1000. The gbm.step function automatically identifies the optimum number of trees for a BRT model using ten-fold cross-validation, selecting the number of trees that minimises hold-out deviance (cross-validation deviance) across folds. In addition to the cross-validation deviance, gbm.step reports several metrics of model performance in cross-validation across folds including; (i) the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve Statistic (AUC) on hold-out dataset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], or cross-validation AUC, where an AUC value of 0.5 indicates no discriminative ability between presence and absence, and a value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination; (ii) cross-validation coefficient, which is the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between the predicted probability of presence and the true presence/background for the hold-out dataset. We report the mean, median and standard deviation of these metrics across the 100 BRT sub-models in each model set. This provides a full picture of the average performance and consistency across each model set. The true prevalence of the disease across the study region is unknown, and the models are parameterised with ad hoc presence data combined with selected pseudo-absences rather than true absences. Therefore, the models predict the relative rather than absolute probability of presence between cells. This model fitting process was repeated at each resolution for the two sets of environmental predictors as above, giving rise to four different model runs- 1 km with forest loss, 1 km without forest loss, 2 km with forest loss, and 2 km without forest loss.
