<p>Due to the high degree of spatial clustering in the case presence data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g002">Fig 2</xref>), it was clear that this presence data should be thinned prior to analysis to avoid inflation of model accuracy and pseudo-replication of particular environmental conditions in the model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Presence data can be thinned in geographical or environmental space [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The lack of quantitative information on the environmental drivers of KFD makes it difficult to select key environmental axes by which to thin the data. Thus thinning in geographical space was conducted. A rule of thumb is to take the peak distance between pairs of presence records (this is 10 km for KFD in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and thin the points so that they are no closer than half this distance (~ 5 km for KFD), ensuring that there is only 1 presence in each 5 km grid cell. Thus, at each resolution (1 km grid cell and 2 km grid cell), we randomly selected one of the presence records per 5 km grid cell, for each of the 30 x 5 km grid cells in which presence records were found. The whole process was repeated 100 times to generate 100 presence datasets at each resolution.
