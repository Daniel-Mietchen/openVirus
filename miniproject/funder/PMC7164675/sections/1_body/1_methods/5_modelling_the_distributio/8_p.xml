<p>To predict the distribution of KFD across Shivamogga in unsampled areas, each BRT sub-model was applied to the prediction layers for a given resolution and environmental set using the predict.gbm function of the gbm package in R [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The predicted relative probability of presence was averaged across sub-models to produce an ensemble mean Â± standard deviation of the relative probability of presence per grid cell. For each BRT model, the threshold relative probability of presence that maximises discrimination between presence/background for the hold-out dataset was calculated by gbm.step and averaged across folds (cross-validation threshold). Occurrence patterns were summarised across sub-models by converting the predicted distributions to binary presence-absence maps per sub-model using the mean cross-validation threshold relative probability of presence for each sub-model, and counting the number of times a cell was predicted to be present across the 100 sub-models. The predicted extent of occurrence in terms of number of study grid squares or pixels was calculated for each predictor resolution and environmental set. The geographical extent of predictions was limited to the region for which the environmental predictors were available and, out of necessity, omitted very large water-bodies and areas classified as towns or cities in the census.
