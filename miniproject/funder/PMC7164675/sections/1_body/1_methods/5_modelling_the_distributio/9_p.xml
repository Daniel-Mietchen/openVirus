<p>Independent validation of models was achieved using the presence points from the 2018/2019 outbreak, by calculating the predicted-to-expected (P/E) ratio for all model sets using the ecospat.boyce function of the ecospat package in R. Here a graph of predicted versus expected for a good model should show a monotonically increasing curve [
