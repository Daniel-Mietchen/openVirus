<p>Stakeholders also ranked human use of forests and living in/around forests as key risk factors. They identified policies (or poor policy implementation) linked to grazing and encroachment in and around forest areas as increasing the risk of KFD. This is consistent with case-control studies that have linked grazing cattle inside forests, handling cattle and gathering of dry leaves for animal bedding to higher exposure to KFD [

Available spatial proxies for extent of forest use for grazing were the densities of indigenous cattle (since smallholders in Shivamogga keep indigenous breeds) and buffalos per grid cell.
