This identified key actors from different sectors and working at different scales, likely to play major roles in the understanding and management of KFD. The two aims of the workshop were to (i) identify the key risk factors for KFD as prioritized by stakeholders and (ii) identify key policies that affect KFD transmission and management using participatory approaches, as outlined in
