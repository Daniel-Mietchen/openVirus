<p>During the 2018/2019 transmission season in Shivamogga District, households with cases throughout Shivamogga District were geo-located as a passive independent validation dataset. Between 21 November 2018 and 16 June 2019, 344 human cases of KFD were reported across 104 villages, causing 20 deaths. The majority of these cases (212 cases or 61%) and 17 deaths were concentrated in a new geographical focus in Sagara taluka in northern Shivamogga (

This area had reported no human cases and only one or two human or tick positives in the 2014/2015 and 2017/2018 season during the prior decade. Geo-location of affected households was achieved directly in the field using the Smartphone Android App “AndLocation” or by health workers who shared their live location on WhatsApp with project staff for transfer to Google Earth and retrieval of coordinates. These 2018/2019 season cases spanned 84 of the 1 km grid cells and 68 of the 2 km grid cells. They provided an ideal test of whether the risk maps developed before the transmission season (using human cases data from the prior five transmission seasons) are capable of predicting new outbreaks, including new geographical foci like the one in Sagara taluka.
