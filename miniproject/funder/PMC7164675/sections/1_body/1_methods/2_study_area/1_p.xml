 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The district is diverse in topography and vegetation, comprising Western Ghats mountains that are subject to high annual rainfall (900 to 8000 mm per annum) and drier inland plateau areas (range in elevation across Shivamogga is -70 m to 2674 m a.s.l., mean ± s.d. = 460 m ± 379 m a.s.l.), and a corresponding transition from evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, to moist deciduous forest and scrub. The forests of the Western Ghats have been degraded and fragmented throughout the 19
 <sup>th</sup> and 20
 <sup>th</sup> centuries, due to timber extraction, industrial development (roads, railways, dams and mines) and increases in agriculture and plantations [
