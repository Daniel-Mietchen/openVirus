<p>The emergence of KFD in humans has been widely linked to human modification of the forest ecosystem through deforestation [

The initial epidemics in Karnataka in the 1950s and those in the 1980s were preceded by population increases and extensive deforestation, to make way for plantations (such as Areca and cashew), paddy cultivation, housing and roads. This created mosaic tropical evergreen and deciduous forest, interspersed with cultivation (e.g. paddy), and interface scrub habitat between villages and forests that was conducive to both tick populations and cattle grazing [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These conditions are hypothesised to have facilitated the emergence of KFDV into humans from a cryptic sylvatic enzootic cycle involving small mammals and monkeys [
