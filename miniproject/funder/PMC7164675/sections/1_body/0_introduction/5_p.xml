<p>As well as affecting diverse human communities, the transmission cycle of KFDV is complex. KFDV cycles between different life stages of tick species from several genera (principally 
 <italic>Haemaphysalis</italic> but also some 
 <italic>Ixodes</italic> species) and amplifying vertebrate hosts including wild rodents and shrews, monkeys and some birds [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Humans contract KFDV when bitten by an infected tick, but are incidental hosts for the disease. Monkeys, principally the black-footed grey langur (
 <italic>Semnopithecus hypoleucos</italic>) and the bonnet macaque (
 <italic>Macaca radiata</italic>), are thought to act as amplifying hosts, by infecting large numbers of larval ticks with the virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Cattle do not amplify KFD since they do not develop viraemia of long duration [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but may amplify tick populations through their importance as a blood meal host.
