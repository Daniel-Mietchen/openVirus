<p>The co-production process involved framing potential key risk factors for KFD with cross-sectoral managers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Spatial proxies of these risk factors were integrated into the model framework. The spatial grain of the model and its output was tailored to the scale at which people use forests (from household surveys) and the scale at which public health managers collect and report outbreak data. The models were then validated during the 2019 outbreak season with health managers, in terms of their predictive accuracy and utility for management.
