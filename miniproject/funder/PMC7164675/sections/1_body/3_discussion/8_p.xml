<p>The socio-ecological mechanisms linking human cases of KFD and landscape factors can be understood only through joint study across fragmented forest landscapes of the intersecting (1) human activities and priorities of forest users that underpin exposure and (2) vector and host population dynamics and infection rates that underpin hazard. Such empirical, inter-disciplinary, landscape scale studies for KFD are currently underway within the MonkeyFeverRisk project.</p>
