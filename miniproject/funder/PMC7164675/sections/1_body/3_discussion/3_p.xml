<p>The models predicted human case locations with high accuracy in the sub-district from which the input data from the prior four years had been drawn. They also predicted large clusters of human cases in the newly affected sub-district over 30 km away. Their failure to predict some isolated case locations in the newly affected area, suggests that the models, parameterised with four years data from an epidemic in one sub-district, may be under-estimating the “environmental niche” of human spill-over of KFD cases to some degree. Ideally, such correlative, pattern-matching models should be updated annually, preferably prior to the transmission season, as cases arise in new areas.</p>
