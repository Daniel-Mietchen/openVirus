<p>Our models indicated that focal patterns in human KFD cases can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy from combined metrics of area and diversity of different forest types, plantation and cattle, as well as elevation. Overall, landscapes that were at high risk of occurrence of human KFD cases were characterised by diverse forest-plantation mosaics, containing large amounts of moist evergreen forest and plantation and low amounts of dry deciduous forests, with high indigenous cattle densities, occurring at elevations over 650 m a.s.l. These findings are consistent with prior suggestions that KFD is an "ecotonal" disease[
