<p>Prior studies have already highlighted several advantages of combining participatory methods and traditional models for understanding and predicting zoonotic diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These include an improved understanding of contextual risk factors (including social, cultural, political and economic dimensions), both by corroborating a priori knowledge and highlighting hitherto unknown factors, and allowing models to be parameterised with realistic data at field level rather than with aggregated data (that is more often available from Public and Animal Health Systems). Here we highlight the (additional) benefits from linking participatory methods and models within a co-production process. Firstly, throughout the framing and knowledge integration stages, cross-sectoral stakeholders contribute valuable hypotheses about key risk factors and the policy landscape for zoonotic diseases that may have been over-looked in the scientific literature and can be tested within models (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, a key next step is to integrate remote sensing of seasonal dynamics of rice paddies into the MonkeyFeverRisk predictive model framework and field surveys since local disease managers highlighted these landscape features (and harvest time) as key potential nodes of interaction between people, wildlife hosts and tick vectors for KFD. Several risk factors highlighted by stakeholders, including poor data management, low vaccine uptake and under-reporting of monkey deaths, could not be integrated into models, either because they are not measured or because they are poorly linked to available geographical proxies. Awareness of these risk factors still informs treatment of input data, interpretation of model outputs and priorities and partnerships for future collection of both health and environmental data. For example, spatial information on vaccine coverage is now being collected by Primary Health Centres and shared with District Health Officials whilst the Indian Government National Biodiversity Mission aims to address some gaps in data on alternative hosts and vectors for priority zoonotic diseases.
