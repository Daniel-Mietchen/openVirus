<p>Since model accuracy did not increase substantially when the area of forest loss was added to the models, this may indicate that the composition of forest and plantation types in the diverse mosaic around a settlement is of greater importance in determining KFD risk than a particular level of deforestation per se. This concurs with our a priori expectations that human contact rates across landscapes of different composition will depend on how human activities and the dynamics and infection rates of key vectors, wildlife and domestic reservoirs are linked to different types of forest and cultivation. However, accurate quantification of the level of forest loss that can lead to emergence of KFD in humans was hampered by the poor correspondence between global spatial data on forest loss and gain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and the local patterns in forest types shown on the Land Use Land Cover map. The strong correlation between areas of forest gain and areas of forest loss in the global dataset for our study area suggests that the forest loss metric is more of an indicator of ‘intensification’, where forest is converted into plantation, rather than permanently lost (to make way for crops or built up areas). Local-scale understanding of these loss and intensification processes can be improved through time series analysis of Landsat Imagery (currently underway in the MonkeyFeverRisk project).
