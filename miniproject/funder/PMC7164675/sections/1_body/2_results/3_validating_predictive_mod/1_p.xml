<p>The Boyce Index values i.e. the correlation between the predicted to expected ratio and the predicted probability of presence were uniformly high (r &gt; 0.8) when all case locations in Shivamogga district or only those in the long-affected Tirthahalli taluka were considered in validation. For these areas, the Boyce Index was slightly higher for 1 km models than 2 km models and when area of forest loss was excluded from models (Tables S8A &amp; S8B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s009">S8 File</xref>) suggesting that the predictions from these models are most consistent with the distributions of the presences in the independent validation datasets. This result was mirrored in the graphs of predicted versus expected ratios (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s009">S8 File</xref>) which were closest to a monotonic increase for the 1 km models without forest loss. When the model predictions for Tirthahalli are overlaid with the locations of cases from the 2018â€“2019 season (red circles,
