<p>Forest loss locations from the global dataset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] did not correspond well with Landsat-derived estimates of current land use for Shivamogga (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s004">S3 File</xref>). Models including the area of forest loss per grid cell as a predictor had equivalent performance to models excluding area of forest loss in cross-validation, and generally performed worse in validation with the independent outbreak data (
