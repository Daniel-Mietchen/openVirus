<p>The results at a 2 km resolution were similar in that the area of moist evergreen forest again far outranked the other predictors with a relative importance of around 20% and modal ranked importance of 1 (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The area of dry deciduous forest and area of plantation were next in importance followed by forest diversity and elevation. Once area of forest loss was added to models at a 2 km resolution, it again ranked second in importance to the area of moist evergreen forest but the subsequent order of importance of the other landscape predictors listed above remained the same as for models without forest loss (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, right hand columns). Again, the addition of forest loss to the models at 2 km did not increase the accuracy in cross-validation over models without forest loss.
