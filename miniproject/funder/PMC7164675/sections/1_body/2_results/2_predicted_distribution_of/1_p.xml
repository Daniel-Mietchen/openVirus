<p>Geographical patterns in areas predicted to have a high probability of KFD presence are similar between 1 km and 2 km grid cell resolutions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s008">S7 File</xref>). There was also a high degree of correlation between mean predicted probability of presence layers between models with and without forest loss (Pearsonâ€™s r = 0.974, p &lt; 0.005 at 1 km).
