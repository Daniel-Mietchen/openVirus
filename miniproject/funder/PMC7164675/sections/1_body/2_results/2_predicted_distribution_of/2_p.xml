<p>Since the area predicted to be suitable for KFD varies between model runs, it is useful to look at the orange and red cells in the bottom panel of the prediction figure, which are cells in which KFD is predicted to be present in more than half of model runs. Suitable habitat for KFD is predicted to occur across a wide area in the south and south east of the district, extending between 5 km and 10 km around current presence locations (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008179.g005">Fig 5</xref> for models at 1 km without forest loss, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008179.s008">S7 File</xref> for all other model sets). Pockets of suitable habitat for KFD are predicted to occur also to the south and north of the large water-bodies (white cells) in the east of the district and in sporadic isolated locations in the north. The absence of KFD in agricultural areas along the northeastern band of Shivamogga (blue areas in all panels) and the southwestern coast is widely predicted across the models.
