<p>In another vein, the authors donâ€™t address their inability to develop quantifiable indices for some of the variables identified as important by their stakeholders, e.g. Table 1, nor the fairly coarse fit between their spatial proxies for some of the variables and the identified risk factors. This is a major issue, and should be addressed in the Methods and in the Discussion, particularly in light of their discussion of the advantages of co-production. One of the challenges is that (appropriate) data might not be available. What issues does this raise? What kinds of partnerships could arise from such a discussion, i.e. to collect or gather some of the missing data? Would it be better to wait to run the models until those data can be obtained so that they more accurately reflect actual risk? </p>
