<p>Overall, I think that the manuscript is of publishable quality and suitable for PLoS NTDs. In particular, the combined use of: i) information from key stakeholders to guide modelling and; ii) case data from a new area to validate models is novel with respect to zoonotic diseases relevant to developing countries. I do not have any major concerns with respect to the scientific approach and conclusions made but highlight that my skills and experience are not sufficient to comment in detail on the modelling techniques used.</p>
