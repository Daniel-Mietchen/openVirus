<p>My major concern with this study is that the authors do not take a critical enough look at their own data, at least based on the general presentation in the manuscript. For example, in several places, they note that the 2018/19 outbreak locations were entirely in zones of high risk, as predicted by their model. This is clearly not the case. Though some of the case locations are within high risk zones, others are in lower risk zones. Further, they indicate, e.g. in the abstract, that they correctly identified a hotspot of an outbreak before it occurred. However, in the region of Sagara taluk depicted in Figure 6, roughly 1/3 of the entire area is identified by the model as high risk, and the outbreak occurred in just one of the many locations they predicted as hotspots. It’s great news that there weren’t more outbreaks, but the authors do need to wrestle with the fact that their risk maps indicated a lot of hotspots, and approximately one of the many regions they identified actually had an outbreak. How should a resource-poor region deal with predictions like these? Would delivering vaccinations over such a large area strain resources? Might it be possible to refine their models with more/better data so that they could provide more accurate outbreak locations? Is this good enough to be useful? Is it good enough to avoid being counter-productive, e.g. by diffusing a public health response that could have been more focused with better data? Again, the larger concern here is that the authors risk coming across as advocating a particular approach rather than objectively evaluating its strengths and weaknesses. This is particularly problematic because their approach is not an unequivocal success. </p>
