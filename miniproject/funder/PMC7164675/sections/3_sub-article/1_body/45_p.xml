<p>I appreciate the clear explanation of both the need for and the response to spatial clustering of the case presence data, and the supplementary file that provides some additional information. Their conclusion is that there is still mild spatial autocorrelation, based on Moranâ€™s I, but they conclude that it is not important despite its presence in fairly large percentages of their model runs. By what objective grounds do they determine that spatial autocorrelation is not a problem for their analysis? Also, it would be helpful for them to include the sample sizes of case sites after thinning.</p>
