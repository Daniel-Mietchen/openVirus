<p>Line 275 – “Forest diversity” is not the ideal descriptor for the variable used here. Based on the description, they seem to have used “Diversity of forest types”, while “forest diversity” sounds like they quantified the species diversity within forests, which they didn’t. I would suggest changing this throughout. </p>
