<p>Reviewer #3: This manuscript describes the results of a study of risk factors for Kyasanur Forest Disease in the western Ghats of India. The authors identified potential risk factors to assess in models by involving stakeholders, who also participated in identifying the relevant scales for spatial analyses. The analyses identify several risk factors that are correlated with earlier outbreaks. The authors then identify future outbreak areas and compare these to an outbreak in 2018/19, concluding that the model accurately predicted the location of this outbreak.</p>
