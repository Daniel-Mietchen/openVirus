<p>Reviewer #1: This study aimed to develop spatially-explicit predictive models of Kyansur Forest disease (KFD) occurrence for an endemic region of India. The choice of risk factors for inclusion in models was based on information gained from a workshop with key stakeholders. Machine learning algorithms were used to fit models to human case data. Resulting models were then tested for the ability to identify areas where a new outbreak had occurred, not used for initial model fitting. The modelling identified diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high proportion of moist evergreen forest, high cattle density and elevation above 650m as important risk factors for KFD.</p>
