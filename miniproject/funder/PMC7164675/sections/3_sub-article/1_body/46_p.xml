<p>The authors analyze their data with and without the incorporation of the variable for forest loss. They do not investigate the model with and without any other variables, nor do they rigorously evaluate the potential intercorrelation of their variables. These are important considerations and need to be addressed in the manuscript. In partcular, discussion topics like those on lines 621 and on, in which they interpret what they see as a lack of importance of forest loss as a predictor, are problematic. </p>
