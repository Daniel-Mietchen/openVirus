  <title>Predicted probability of presence of KFD from Boosted Regression Tree models for the 2019 outbreak region in Sagara taluk.</title>
  <p>Models are at a 1 km (left hand panel) and 2 km resolution (right hand panel), with area of forest loss included in the predictors (bottom panel) and without (top panel). The outbreak locations from the 2018 to 2019 season (open red circles), occur in areas of medium to high probability of presence (yellow to red) in all models. White areas have missing environmental data because they contain water-bodies or are outside of Shivamogga district. These raster maps are not under copyright since they are a product of this study.
