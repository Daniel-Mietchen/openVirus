  <title>Predicted probability of presence of KFD from Boosted Regression Tree models for the 2019 outbreak region in Tirthahalli taluk.</title>
  <p>Models are at a 1 km (left hand panel) and 2 km resolution (right hand panel), with area of forest loss included in the predictors (bottom panel) and without (top panel). The outbreak locations from the 2018 to 2019 season (open red circles) occur mostly in areas of medium to high probability of presence (yellow to red) in all models, apart from two outbreak locations in the west. The black circles indicate outbreak locations from the 2014 to 2018 seasons, used to parameterise the models. White areas have missing environmental data because they contain water-bodies or are outside Shivamogga district (black outline). These raster maps are not under copyright since they are a product of this study. The administrative boundary dataset is from HindudstanTimesLabs (
