  <title>Predicted probability of presence of KFD from Boosted Regression Tree models containing landscape predictors (without forest loss) at a 1 km resolution.</title>
  <p>Top panels give mean and standard deviation of the relative predicted probability of presence of KFD in each grid cell across model runs. Top left panel—areas in orange and red have a higher predicted probability of presence of KFD, whilst areas in blue have a lower predicted probability of presence of KFD. Top right panel–areas in yellow and red have more variable predictions of probability of presence of KFD than blue areas. Bottom left panel indicates the number of times KFD is predicted to be present in each cell across the 20 model runs, with orange and red indicating that KFD is often predicted to be present. Bottom right panel again depicts the mean predicted probability of presence but the locations of affected households are super-imposed, for the 2014 to 2018 seasons as open black circles and for the 2018 to 2019 season as open red circles.
