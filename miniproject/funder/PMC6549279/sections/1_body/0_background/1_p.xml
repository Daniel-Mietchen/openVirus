<p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infectious disease, which is transmitted from one person to another through the bite of the infected female 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In recent decades, dengue incidence has grown dramatically around the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], leading to half the worldâ€™s population being at risk of infection and 390 million people being infected each year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is now regarded as a big international public health concern. In China, dengue epidemics also exhibited clear upward trend both in extent and severity since its reemergence in 1978 in Guangdong (GD) Province, which has always been the hardest-hit Chinese province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Particularly in 2014, an explosive outbreak of dengue unexpectedly attacked GD, in which the reported cases were more than 3 times of the total number in previous 20 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During this outbreak, it was observed that dengue is heterogeneously distributed in time and space, and the incidence varied greatly among districts and counties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Characterizing the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of this dengue outbreak is very important, which allows to recognize the dengue cluster and the risky area, and further to improve dengue control and prevention strategies.
