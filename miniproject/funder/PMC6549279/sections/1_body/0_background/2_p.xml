<p>Many previous studies were conducted to discover and predict the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue by using mapping techniques [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], dynamical models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or statistical methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The recent dengue outbreak in China also drew similar analysis, such as inferring the spatiotemporal patterns of dengue transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and identifying the determinants of spatial variations in the dengue epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, existing studies usually focused on one or several cities, and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the transmission patterns remains little understood at a finer scale of Guangdong.
