<p>This study addressed this issue by examining the spatiotemporal process at district/county level that contributed to the 2014 dengue outbreak in GD Province. We first used global Moran’ I to investigate the spatial autocorrelation of dengue incidence around the 128 districts and counties, and then employed Anselin Local Moran’s I (local indicators of spatial association [LISA]) and Kulldorff’s spatial scan statistics to detect the dengue clusters and identify the disease dynamics dispersion in these regions. Finally, we decomposed dengue cases into endemic, autoregressive and spatiotemporal components by a multivariate time-series model. The autoregressive and spatiotemporal components described an autoregression on past counts in the same and in other districts, respectively, which can capture occasional outbreaks and dependencies across regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The endemic component captures the background risk of new events by external factors (independent of the history of the epidemic) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results can help to clarify the spatiotemporal patterns of dengue transmission at 128 districts/counties of GD, which might assist in the development of dengue control and prevention strategies in this province.
