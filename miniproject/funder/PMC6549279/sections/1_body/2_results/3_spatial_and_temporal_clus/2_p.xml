<p>Based on the retrospective scan analysis by SaTScan, many clusters with statistically significant high incidence in different periods were detected. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, during June and August, three significant clusters were detected, which covered 7 districts (Liwan, Yuexiu, Haizhu, Baiyun, Nansha, Panyu and Tianhe). In September, another new cluster was observed in Foshan (Nanhai, Sanshui and Sihui). In October, the clusters cover more districts in Foshan and Guangzhou (Huangpu, Chancheng, Nanhai, Qingcheng and Huadu), as well as Qingcheng District in Qingyuan. After that, the clusters scattered around cities of Guangzhou, Foshan, Qingyuan and Jiangmen, will relatively low relative risk and small log likelihood ratio. The first likely cluster existed in October, as a circle center in Baiyun district and a radius of 16.03 km to include Yuexiu and Tianhe districts, with 10,648 observed cases (1090.96 expected). The second likely cluster existed in September, as a circle center in Liwan district and a radius of 17.41 km to include Yuexiu, Haizhu and Tianhe districts, with 7,943 observed cases (832.89 expected). It was observed that the most likely clusters through the four periods were always concentrated in the city of Guangzhou, but as the infection propagated, the cluster center vary from Liwan, Baiyun, to Luogang, with different radius and relative risk.
