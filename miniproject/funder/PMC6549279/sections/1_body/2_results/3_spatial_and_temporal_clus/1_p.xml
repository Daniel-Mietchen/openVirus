 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the SaTScan-generated cluster circles and local Moran’s I clusters overlain on the map of dengue incidence in GD Province in the four periods. Based on the LISA statistics, it is observed that the high-high clusters only exhibited in the districts/counties of Guangzhou and Foshan, suggesting that high incidence rates potentially occurred these regions with interactive transmission. During June and August, the high-high clusters first emerged in the 8 districts of Guangzhou (Yuexiu, Liwan, Haizhu, Baiyun, Tianhe, Huangpu, Panyu, and Nansha). As time went by, the clusters geographically expanded to the west and the north. The cluster covered another two districts (Luogang and Nanhai) in September, as well as Huadu and Chancheng in October. During November and December, in addition to adding a new district (Pengjiang), the clusters restricted in Guangzhou (except Zengcheng and Conghua).
