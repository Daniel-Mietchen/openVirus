 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows the time series of fitted components for the 25 districts/counties with most dengue cases. Some special features are observed: (1) Dengue cases in Yuexiu, Baiyun, Huadu and Nanhai have vast autoregressive components, indicating that these districts were predominantly affected by the previous infection in their own regions; (2) Baoan, Chaoyang and Jiangcheng have extremely big endemic distributions and thus admitted high risk of local transmission; (3) Dengue cases in most districts have spatiotemporal components of dengue cases, especially in Huangpu, Luogang, Zengcheng, Dongguan and Zhongshan, indicating that these districts easily suffered dengue infection from the adjacent districts; (4) Liwan, Haizhu, Tianhe, Panyu, Nansha, Zengcheng, Conghua, Xiangzhou, Chancheng, Shunde, Pangjiang, Jianghai and Qingcheng have similarly big components of autoregressive and spatiotemporal incidence, which means that the risk of dengue infection in these districts mainly come from local and neighboring regions.
