<p>The variances of the random effect for the three parts were estimated to be 0.485, 1.731 and 2.635, respectively. It means that there was little variation in the autoregressive component, but vast variation in the endemic and spatiotemporal components. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, it is found a homogeneously low random effect of the autoregression in most of the districts, but a little high value in Guagnzhou and Foshan, as well as Leizhou district, indicating that these regions were affected by large local outbreaks. Further, it is observed that the random intercepts of the endemic and spatiotemporal components exhibited significant heterogeneity across districts, in which southern and central GD admitted a relatively high endemic incidence with a few cases from other districts.
