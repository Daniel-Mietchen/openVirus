<p>Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of dengue incidence for the four periods, where the values of global Moran’s I ranged from 0.164 to 4.999. It means that the districts/counties close together tend to have similar baseline of incidence rates, and clustered patterns existed during this outbreak. Such phenomenon was more evident in the highly epidemic period, i.e., September and October.
