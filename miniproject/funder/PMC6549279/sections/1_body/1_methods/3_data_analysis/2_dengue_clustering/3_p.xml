<p>Next, Kulldorffâ€™s spatial scan statistics were used to identify the specific clusters of varying sizes within the study area, which was implemented by SaTScan v9.4.4 (

The statistic software can generate circles consisting of regions whose incidence rates are significantly higher than the regions outside the circles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This was achieved by gradually scanning a window across space, and the window with the maximum likelihood was the most likely cluster. A Poisson-based model was used for this study. This method has previously been validated for plotting and understanding local spatiotemporal clusters of many epidemics, such as dengue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Here the maximum cluster size was set to 5% of the total population at risk.
