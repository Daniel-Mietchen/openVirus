<p>The presence of dengue clustering was identified by two cluster detection programs: Anselin’s Local Moran I (LISA) test statistics and Kulldorff’s spatial scan method. Using the input area data (case, population and geographic information), they can output the location, approximate size and significance level of identified clusters. Based on the spatial time series of reported cases, the evolution is divided into in four periods (from June to August, September, October, and from November to December).</p>
