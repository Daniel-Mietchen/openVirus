<p>Dengue is a legally notifiable communicable disease in China since 1989. Dengue cases were diagnosed according to the unified diagnosis criteria issued by the Chinese Ministry of Health, including clinically diagnosed and laboratory confirmed cases. Dengue cases data reported between 2014 and 2018 was used in this study. The data was obtained from Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GDCDC), with regard to the number of reported apparent and confirmed dengue cases per county/district. The MOI data is retrieved from GDCDC. In GD, mosquito ovitraps are placed widely to monitor mosquito density. MOI is computed as the proportions of positive mosquito ovitraps. Population data for each county/district in GD in 2014 were retrieved from the Guangdong Statistical Yearbook.</p>
