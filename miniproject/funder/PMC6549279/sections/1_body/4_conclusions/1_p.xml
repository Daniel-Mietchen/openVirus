<p>This paper analyzed the spatiotemporal diffusion patterns contributed to the large dengue outbreak in GD in 2014. The results showed that dengue distribution was strongly correlated in space, and was highly clustered around Guangzhou and Foshan, with a slight movement of clustering over time. Further analysis revealed that autoregressive, endemic and spatiotemporal transmission in each district and county had different contributions to human infection, and most of districts/counties (especially the urban area) had cases that were infected in adjacent regions. This study can help to clarify the heterogeneity and the associations of dengue transmission in time and space, and thus provide insightful information for public health authorities to plan dengue control strategies.</p>
