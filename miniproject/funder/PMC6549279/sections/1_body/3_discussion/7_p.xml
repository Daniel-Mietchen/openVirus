<p>Several limitations existed in our study worth noting. (1) The incidence data are based on passive surveillance system. We were unable to calculate the unreported and asymptomatic cases. (2) The cases were recorded in the residence of the patients, which could lead to inconformity with the real location where they were infected. (3) The statistic model employed here could not explicitly incorporate climatic and socio-ecological factors, such as climate and human migration. More efforts are needed to assess the effects of these factors on the spatiotemporal evolutions of dengue.</p>
