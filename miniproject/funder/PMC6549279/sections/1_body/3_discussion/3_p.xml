<p>To locate the hotspots for future surveillance strategy, we identified the prominent spatial clustering covering specific districts. In 2014, though dengue infection rapidly spread over most of districts in GD, it was highly localized in particular locations and times. We identified 12 significant clusters during the four periods, which included about 22 districts lied in the cities of Guangzhou, Foshan, Qingyuan and Jiangmen. The most likely cluster with the largest relative risk occurred in central Guangzhou in October. Both cluster detection methods identified similar significant clustering, suggesting that the result is robust. It is found that the cluster center, the radius, and the relative risk varied across different districts as the infection propagated, but the 5 districts, i.e., Liwan, Yuexiu, Haizhu, Tianhe and Baiyun, always recorded in clustering, indicating their important role in dengue transmission. Compared to other regions, eastern Foshan, southwestern and central Guangzhou are more vulnerable to dengue, which appeared as a dengue hotspot in mapping and cluster assessment. The outbreak information in one district of the hotspots can serve as an early warning device for a possible outbreak in neighboring districts. Our findings are consistent with previous analysis, where they found similar dengue clusters at rough scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. To further verify the location of dengue clusters, we performed similar analysis on the incidence data in 2016 and 2017. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, beside a new cluster observed in east GD (Chaoan and Xiangqiao), the districts in Guangzhou (except Nansha, Panyu and Conghua) and in Foshan (except Gaoming) are also marked as the hot regions. The almost overlapped clusters in recent years indicated that the marked hotspots are not made by chance. Possible reasons that contribute to such clustering patterns could be: (1) Southwestern and central Guangzhou is the downtown, with particular features: dense population density [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], higher temperature (due to the urban heat island effect) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], in the process of urbanization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and a transportation hub [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; (2) Eastern Foshan is near Guangzhou, which share large human mobility between these two regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
