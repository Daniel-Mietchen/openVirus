<p>We found a significant positive spatial autocorrelation on the dengue incidence in the four time periods. Further analysis on the spatial autocorrelation of the yearly incidence between 2015 and 2018, yields the global Moranâ€™s I as 0.147, 0.041, 0.139 and 0.315, respectively. These positive values highlight that the districts and counties at geographical proximity shared a similar level of vulnerability to dengue, and such feature was more evident as the disease developed. In other words, dengue infections do not spread uniformly or randomly but occurred in cluster, and thus suggest possible measures of early detection for disease surveillance. Our results are consistent with previous findings that dengue is inclined to spatially correlate with clusters [
