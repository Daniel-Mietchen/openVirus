<p>By fitting a multivariate time series model to dengue cases, we further clarified the spatiotemporal pattern of dengue transmission. First, we found significant spatial variation in the endemic and spatiotemporal component across the districts, while the autoregressive component was more spatially homogenous, similarly to the patterns in city level [

It is important to note that nearly all districts have cases that were infected in adjacent regions. Such feature is more evident in and around urban area, possibly because frequent human mobility resulted in many interconnected infections between these places. The result reminds us that joint control efforts in surrounded regions could be necessary for dengue intervention. As a matter of fact, simultaneous intervention in multi-area since October 2014 had significant effect to control the dengue outbreak in Guangzhou [

For those districts with more autoregressive components (Yuexiu, Baiyun, Huadu and Nanhai), rigorous intervention strategies should be implemented in case of sudden local infection. For those districts with more endemic component, active surveillance should be adopted since they are more susceptible to dengue infection.
