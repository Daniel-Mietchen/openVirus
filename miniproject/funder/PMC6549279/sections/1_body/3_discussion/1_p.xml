<p>This study explored the spatiotemporal variation and association of the dengue transmission in GD Province in 2014. By using Moranâ€™s I statistics and Spatial scan method, as well as a multivariate time series model, we were able to clarify the spatiotemporal distribution patterns, detect the dengue clusters, and evaluate the spatiotemporal components of dengue infections. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to infer the dengue transmission patterns in GD Province at district/county level. Several notable findings could provide meaningful clues for public health authorities to implement effective interventions on dengue infection.</p>
