<p>Using the recorded MOI data, we found three significant high-MOI areas located in Shaoguan, Qingyuan, Shanwei and Guangzhou. The proportions of positive mosquito ovitraps in Shaoguan and Qingyuan are almost ninety percent, which signifies high mosquito density there. However in reality, these regions admitted low dengue incidence. That is probably due to the sparsity of human population and human movement, yielding seldom circulation of dengue viruses. But in Guagnzhou, relative high MOI combined with the above-mentioned features easily triggers dengue occurrence.</p>
