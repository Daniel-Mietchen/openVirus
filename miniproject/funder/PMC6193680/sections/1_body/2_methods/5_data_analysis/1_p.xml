<p>Two social scientists (DN and WL) listened to recordings from the FGD separately and developed a coding framework. The recordings were audio coded and emerging codes were grouped into analytical themes. A framework matrix was developed based on these themes and populated with relevant notes and discussions about each logo. The initial themes and matrix were later reviewed by other researchers (MK and KG). Findings were analyzed by comparing responses across different groups and in relation to sex and location. Scores from the matrix ranking exercises were also used to support discussions on main themes of attractiveness, comprehension and acceptability. Verbatim quotes have been used to illustrate key themes.</p>
