<p>A topic guide was used to facilitate the focus group discussions, and a participatory ranking exercise was incorporated for participants to assess the logos. The topic guides included questions on whether participants liked the logos, the perceived meaning of the logos, whether they would be understood and accepted in communities, and suggestions for a Chichewa name for the logos. An opportunity was also given to the participants to discuss their general views in order to allow them to cite inductive ideas. The ranking exercise was designed to provide quantitative information on acceptability and a clearer indication of variation in preferences across different groups of potential research participants in order to inform decisions. During the focus group discussions, posters of the two logos were placed in the front of the room and participants were led through a discussion about their perception of the logos. Attributes discussed by participants were listed on a flip chart, and used as criteria for assessing the logos during the ranking exercise. These were later grouped into three categories of attractiveness, comprehension and acceptability. The latter was tested by asking participants if they would wear a t-shirt with the logo. Each participant was then asked to put a colored sticker on the attributes that they mostly identified with about each logo. This was followed by another discussion on the rationale behind their ranking. Each focus group was facilitated by experienced social scientists (DN, WL, MK), and these three social scientists also took turns to take notes during the discussions. The FGD lasted one hour and were recorded using a digital recorder. FGD participants were given a refreshment and they were also compensated for their time.</p>
