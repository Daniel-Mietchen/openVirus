<p>The staff in charge of each of the three health centres were contacted to discuss the consultation exercise, in order to arrange access to participants. On the day of the focus groups, healthcare workers at the centres used convenience sampling to select participants attending the health centres that day. Criteria for selection for the first three groups were that participants should be members of the target group (people attending ART clinics, pregnant women or mothers of under-five children), and willing and available to participate in the focus groups. We also asked a staff member to help recruit participants for the fourth focus group, which included men, women, boys and girls from the village surrounding Mfera Health Centre.</p>
