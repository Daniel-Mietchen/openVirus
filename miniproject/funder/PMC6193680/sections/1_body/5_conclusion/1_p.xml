<p>Our experience with the focus groups underlines the value of involving potential research participants in the design of study logos and other research materials, to ensure that these materials are culturally and contextually appropriate. The consultation highlighted important risks of the logos, and allowed the researchers to make a decision based on the ethical principle of minimizing harm to potential participants. Our experience also points to challenges of consultation, in particular the complexities of seeking feedback from multiple groups of potential study participants and negotiating these differing views to reach consensus. As we found, consultations can provide ambiguous or contradictory answers. As such, ethical guidelines on community engagement need to provide further guidance on how to negotiate contradictory views of community partners, in order to make final decisions.</p>
