<p>Malawi is a land locked country located in Southern Africa with a population of 17,215,000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0205737.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The majority of the population (84%) reside in rural areas, and 72% of the population live below the poverty line on less than US$1.25 a day [
 <xref rid="pone.0205737.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The country has a heavy disease burden due to both infectious and non-communicable diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea and TB [

 <xref rid="pone.0205737.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Alternatively, concerns about drawing blood, fear of strangers and perceived lack of benefit from the study can reduce participation [
