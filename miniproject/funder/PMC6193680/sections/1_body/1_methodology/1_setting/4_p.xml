<p>This small consultation exercise was part of the community engagement activities to ensure that the study logo was culturally and socially appropriate, and hence we did not seek ethics approval. Ethical guidelines on community engagement state that 
 <italic>‘examples of community engagement processes that may require ethics review include systematic data collection that can be generalized and disseminated in forums outside of the community in which they were implemented</italic>, 
 <italic>as well as any data generation that could create social risks for participants’</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0205737.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This consultation exercise was undertaken to seek feedback on the logo rather than generalizable data, and we anticipated minimal social risks among FGD participants. Study information was discussed with FGD participants and verbal consent was sought prior to FGDs. Focus group participants were also told during the consenting process that the group discussions were going to be shared with other researchers or published. In addition, we presented this paper to MLW Community Advisory Group (CAG) members to seek their views on whether it was acceptable to publish this work. The CAG members who provide feedback to represent community views on MLW research gave consent to publish the work since this was part of the formative work and not a research with human subjects.
