<p>MLW undertakes community engagement activities in all these areas, including use of radio programmes, media engagement, science cafes, community film shows, a science exhibition and representation from community advisory groups. The consultation about the logo is part of a wider programme of ongoing public and community engagement around the influenza programme and MLWâ€™s research more generally. For the influenza programme, engagement includes collaboration with community advisory groups for feedback on study procedures. In addition, meetings are held throughout the research process with community leaders, district health staff and community members. This is done to explain the research, address community concerns and share preliminary findings.</p>
