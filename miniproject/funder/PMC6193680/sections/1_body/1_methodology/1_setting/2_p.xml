<p>The Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with participants from both urban and rural settings in Blantyre and Chikhwawa districts. Bangwe and Ndirande are high-density urban areas in Blantyre. Both areas have high levels of in and out migration, and they are low-income with a variety of formal and informal income earning strategies. Mfera is a rural village in Chikhwawa with high levels of poverty. Both Blantyre and Chikhwawa are long-term research sites for MLW, and each district hosts a range of trials, observational and qualitative studies.</p>
