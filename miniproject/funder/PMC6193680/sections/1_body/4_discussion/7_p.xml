<p>In addition to the varied and changing views, the findings also raised a question for researchers about the weight to place on participants’ comments. Some suggestions for improvement from participants were based on their assumptions about what would be understood or accepted by other community members. For example, one participant suggested that showing the bug going into the body would clearly indicate that the research is about flu. This assumption and perception may not be a reflection of reality because people do not see a virus going into the body as specifically about flu. In addition, FGD participants also suggested Chichewa names that we thought could be potentially confusing to people such as 
 <italic>“chilombo”</italic> (which could either mean bug or animal), 
 <italic>“akita”</italic> (actor), 
 <italic>“tseka mphuno”</italic> (close your nose), and 
 <italic>“chenjerani”</italic> (beware). Decisions about which comments to dismiss and which to take more seriously rested partly on researcher judgment based on the frequency with which issues were raised as well as ethical principle to minimize risks to potential participants. In light of these dilemmas around which comments to accept as important or dismiss; we suggest that the ultimate decision by researchers should be based on ethical principles such as to minimize harm to potential participants.
