<p>The changing views during discussions and unanimous voting in some FGDs both raise the issue of social influences within focus groups. FGDs were ideal because they tend to indicate social norms and perceptions based on social interaction [

 <xref rid="pone.0205737.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; there was value in examining decision-making within this social context. However, the group approach may also have had the disadvantage of obscuring individual views and responses to the logos. Although the matrix ranking exercise was designed to indicate individual views, the tendency for groups to vote the same way suggests the individual votes were influenced by group discussions. This could have reflected the presence of dominant personalities within the groups. Some groups included participants with different levels of social status and influence (for example, men, women and youths), and this may have encouraged a tendency to follow the views of socially respected participants. This could have been partially avoided through a more homogeneous selection of focus group participants.
