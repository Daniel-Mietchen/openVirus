<p>The use of a consultation to assess community preferences may have been particularly difficult because of the nature of the questions being asked. In our experience of similar consultation exercises in other studies, eliciting and acting on community feedback has appeared more straightforward. Pictorial diaries have been used in two recent studies, and in both cases community feedback was sought on draft versions of the diaries to see whether the pictures were clear. We can suggest some possible reasons why previous consultation exercises were more effective than the one reported in this manuscript. The flu logo study asked participants to choose between two logos, and with this kind of binary choice, different views among participants are likely. Although varied opinions among participants may exist in a group discussion, varied opinions do not prevent an answer being found. If most participants do understand a picture but a small number do not, investigators should consider making changes so that the picture is clear to everyone.</p>
