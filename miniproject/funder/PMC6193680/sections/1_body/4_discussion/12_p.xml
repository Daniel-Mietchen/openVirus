<p>Our timescales and resources limited the consultation process to four FGDs. We were also unable to feedback the findings to FGD participants due to logistical challenges of getting participants who were mostly clinic attendees in one place. We however presented our report to MLW CAG members to get their feedback and consent to publish this paper. A more extensive consultation process may be more effective to generate a consensus between participants and researchers, with more two-way interaction between researchers and participants and more participant input to logo design. For example, communities could be asked to suggest initial ideas for the logo or to comment on revised versions, and different stakeholder groups could be brought together to discuss the initial focus group findings and seek a consensus. This more extensive process could help move community engagement from consultation towards collaboration [
