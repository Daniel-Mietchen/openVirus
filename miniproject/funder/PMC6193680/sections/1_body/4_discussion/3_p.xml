<p>Diverse and potentially opposing views among communities are noted within the community engagement literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0205737.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These contrasting views among potential participants raise the dilemma of whose views should be incorporated in research decisions. Assessing group preferences was complicated by differences between the voting and opinions suggested in the discussion. In some cases, the scores suggested a unanimous group preference for one logo, but the discussion did not indicate any strong group preference about each logo. For example, participants in FGD 1 (pregnant women) all voted for Logo B as more attractive, but they also expressed negative comments in the discussion about its attractiveness. This may be because while one logo was preferred, there were still reservations about its attractiveness, such that the need to choose means the matrix scores gave an incomplete understanding of group preferences. In addition, the unanimous scores on all criteria for FGD 1 and 2 may have reflected peer influence and a decision to vote in the same way as other group members, an inherent feature of FGD that we return to below.
