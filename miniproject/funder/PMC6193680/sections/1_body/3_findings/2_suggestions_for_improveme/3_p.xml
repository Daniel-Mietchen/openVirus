<p>We also asked participants to provide us with Chichewa names for each logo. The majority of suggestions for Logo A were names suggesting something that causes disease, such as 
 <italic>“chilombo” (bug)</italic>, or 
 <italic>“akita” (actor)</italic>, which meant the 
 <italic>culprit</italic>, because the virus is the culprit for influenza infection. Others however suggested that the word 
 <italic>Chimfine (flu</italic>) should be added to the logo in order for people to understand it. Participants also suggested names that represent risk, such as 
 <italic>“tseka mphuno” (close your nose)</italic>, or 
 <italic>“chenjerani”</italic>, which means 
 <italic>beware</italic>. In contrast, names suggested for Logo B were not related to the influenza virus or to research. For example, 
 <italic>“yanjanani”</italic> (get together) and 
 <italic>“chikondi”</italic> (love), because Logo B has a picture of two people who seemed to represent a couple. This raises again the issue of comprehension of the logos: by the end of the FGDs, the link to influenza research may have been clearer with Logo A. Interpretations of Logo B as a couple may also have contributed to its association with HIV and consequent concerns about stigma.
