<p>We defined attractiveness as whether people liked the logo. We asked participants what they liked and did not like about each logo, and which logo they would prefer to see. The matrix scores indicated mixed views between and within the groups: people with HIV voted for Logo A as more attractive, a view shared by the majority of mothers. The group of pregnant women, however, voted for Logo B as more attractive, and votes of the community members were split between Logos A and B. Variations in voting and preferences did not appear to be related to characteristics of the FGD participants such as age, gender, education level or location. For instance, a majority of participants in two FGDs were women below the age of 30 (FGD 1 with pregnant women and FGD 3 with mothers) while the other two FGDs with people living with HIV (FGD 2) and community members (FGD 4) were conducted with a mix of both men and women.</p>
