<p>Comprehension was defined as the ability of participants to understand the message portrayed by the logos, as defined by the flu study team. We sought to understand how participants interpreted the logos, and whether the logos portrayed sufficient information about the research. At the start of the group discussions, before researchers explained what the logos were supposed to represent, we asked participants what they saw in the logos, what they thought the logos meant and what message the logo was trying to communicate.</p>
