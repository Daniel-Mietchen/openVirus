<p>In terms of the matrix scores, all participants in FGD 2 (people living with HIV) and five of the eight participants in FGD 3 (mothers) voted for Logo A as more easily understood, whereas all participants in FGDs 1 (pregnant women) and 4 (community members) voted for Logo B as more comprehensible. As indicated under attractiveness, most participants could not understand Logo A at first sight. This was indicated in varied ideas about what Logo A represented, including a 
 <italic>head with legs</italic>, 
 <italic>big eyes and horns; sunshine; a crab with eyes and legs; a frog; a tortoise; a cartoon;</italic> and 
 <italic>a doll;</italic> as well as comments that “
 <italic>we do not know what it is”</italic>. These misunderstandings also came from some participants in the groups that voted for Logo A as easier to comprehend, some of whom initially thought Logo A was a '
 <italic>balloon'</italic> or a '
 <italic>toy'</italic>. However, some participants did relate the cartoon more closely to health, describing the logo as 
 <italic>'a germ that causes malaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Ebola and other diseases'</italic>. These comments came from a small number of participants in the group that voted for Logo A as comprehensible (FGD 2, people living with HIV), as well as participants from FGD 4 (community members), none of whom voted for Logo A as more comprehensible.
