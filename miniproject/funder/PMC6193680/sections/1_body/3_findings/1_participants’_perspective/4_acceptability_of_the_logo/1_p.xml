<p>We defined acceptability as whether the logos’ appearance and message satisfied community standards, norms and values and whether the logo could be incorporated into communities’ daily lives. To assess acceptability, we asked participants whether they would wear t-shirts with the logos, whether there was anything about the logos that communities would find offensive or inappropriate, which logo people would find culturally acceptable, and how people would react if they found the logos at the clinic.</p>
