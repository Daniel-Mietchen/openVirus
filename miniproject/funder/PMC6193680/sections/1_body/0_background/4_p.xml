<p>The influenza research team felt that a logo would improve public recognition of the influenza studies and support community participation. The logo had several rationales: it was designed to make the research visible, to encourage people to ask about the studies, and to prompt conversations about influenza. The logo was to be used on badges worn by study researchers and fieldworkers, and on participant information sheets and other project documents. Given the need to ensure the logo was socially and culturally appropriate, we engaged potential study participants in the logo development.</p>
