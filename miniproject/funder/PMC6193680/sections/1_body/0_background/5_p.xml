<p>This paper contributes to a growing body of literature that examines community engagement in practice by documenting our experience of the consultation exercise. The consultation highlighted benefits of public consultation but also complexities, including the difficulty of identifying clear answers through discussions with diverse stakeholders. While consultation was designed to support community input and ensure the logo was socially and culturally acceptable, the exercise also raised questions about the feasibility, effectiveness and legitimacy of the consultation approach. We reflect on the benefits and challenges to identify lessons for other research projects.</p>
