<p>Global temperatures have increased by an average of 0.85 °C (0.65–1.06) from 1880–2012 [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The International Panel on Climate Change predicts a further acceleration of global temperature rise, with an additional 1.4–3.1 °C (RCP 6.0) or 2.6–4.8 °C (RCP 8.5) by the end of the century if there is no change to greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Temperature has been shown to have a significant influence on the transmission of many infectious agents, including arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This results from a range of effects of temperature on biological processes influencing host, vector and virus. The complexity of enzootic transmission cycles makes understanding the role of temperature a challenge. Here, we review the role of temperature in major zoonotic arboviruses (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01013-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Viruses were limited to those that (1) are associated with human disease, (2) have a primarily non-human amplifying host, (3) are primarily vectored by mosquitoes, and (4) have at least one study examining temperature effects. We summarize studies examining temperature effects on Vector Competence, Life History Traits, Blood-feeding Behavior, Vector and Host Distribution, and Viral Distribution; and subsequently address gaps in the field that should be the focus of future studies. Since the epidemiology and ecology of each virus has been adequately reviewed elsewhere (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01013-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) we focus exclusively on the influence of temperature on transmission dynamics.
