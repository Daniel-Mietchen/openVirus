<p>The relationship between temperature and viral transmission may be complex due to the variety of influences on different aspects of the ecology and biology of vectors, hosts, and viruses [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The fact that temperatures effects can vary at multiple time scales (i.e., within days and across seasons) can further complicate these relationships. Diurnal variations due to non-linear temperature relationships are important [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], have been observed for WNV [
 <xref rid="B183-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>], and can be accounted for in analyses of arboviruses [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Spatial variation in temperature is also important, and is not well represented on fine scales (i.e., microclimatic variation) by gridded temperature products [

 <xref rid="B275-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>]. This can lead to underestimation of vector-borne disease risk in some habitats and locations [
