<p>Where arboviruses are emerging, more refined spatial and temporal data could improve early warning forecasting systems. High-quality, publicly available temperature data sets exist, but vector species abundances and locations and virus infection rates need to be more publicly available in accessible Geographic Information System (GIS) formats. Improved knowledge of vector and host distribution would also be instrumental in improved forecasts of expected changes under climate change. Host-vector interactions are additionally important, and the degree to which host choice depends on temperature is also worthy of study. Host choice in 
 <italic>Cs. melanura</italic>, for example, has also been found to be temperature dependent [
 <xref rid="B277-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>], however temperature co-varied with season, which needs to be controlled for in future studies. Temperature effects can vary by vector species and even within populations of a single species. Vector and host populations can evolve and adapt, and temperature will likely have significant effects on both the rate and trajectory of viral evolution. For this reason, models need to be informed by experimental studies that consider not just how changing temperatures interact with current biological systems, but also future biological systems. Further, the degree to which temperature relationships interact with other environmental variables (e.g., precipitation, insecticide resistance, vaccine development) should be considered. Defining these complex and nuanced relationships over appropriate temporal and geographic scales, while daunting, is critical if we are to accurately define how climate change will alter the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne viruses.
