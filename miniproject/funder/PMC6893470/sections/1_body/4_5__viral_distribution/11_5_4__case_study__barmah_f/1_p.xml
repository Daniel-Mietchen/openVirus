<p>Temperature relationships for BFV are scale-dependent, but generally risk of BFV increases with increasing temperatures. BFV was found to increase with increased minimum temperature based on 0-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-month lags in Queensland, Australia (using seasonal differencing to control for seasonal effects) [

 <xref rid="B248-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>] (note exact attribution is difficult as minimum and maximum temperature are strongly correlated in the region, Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.93). BFV risk increased with increasing minimum temperatures in coastal regions [

 <xref rid="B170-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>], but this effect could be due to a contrast between interior and coastal areas rather than an inconsistent temperature effect (i.e., Simpsonâ€™s paradox [
