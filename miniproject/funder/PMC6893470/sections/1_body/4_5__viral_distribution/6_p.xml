<p>Within the normal range of some viruses, environmental temperatures were not found to be the main limiting factor. For example, rainfall and tides are the main environmental predictors for RRV [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and similarly RVFV is strongly tied to rainfall [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B222-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>,
 <xref rid="B223-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. Rainfall was more strongly associated with EEEV than temperature in Rhode Island, USA [
 <xref rid="B171-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Rice fields, swine production, and percent of humans and swine vaccinated were more important for JEV in some regions [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the island of Mayotte, where temperatures were suitable for RVFV, the import of an animal infected with RVFV was the most important risk factor [
 <xref rid="B224-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. No direct temperature relationships were detected for SINV in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B173-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. A study of seasonal and meteorological models aggregated by state in Australia found relatively small improvements of adding weather variables for RRV and BFV, with the largest improvements due to lagged variables [
 <xref rid="B157-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Similarly, in Queensland, weather variables were not found to predict RRV [
 <xref rid="B225-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>].
