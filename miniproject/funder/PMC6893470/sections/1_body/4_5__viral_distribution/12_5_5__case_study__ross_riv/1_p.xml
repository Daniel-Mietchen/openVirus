<p>RRV is an excellent example of a virus demonstrating a temperature optimum [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], although a number of studies from different geographic regions have not reported an effect of temperature on RRV after controlling for other variables [
 <xref rid="B251-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>,
 <xref rid="B252-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>,
 <xref rid="B253-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>,
 <xref rid="B254-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>]. A study summarizing 100 years of epidemics found that relationships with temperatures varied by region, with an increase in minimum temperatures being associated with RRV in Southern Australia, an increase in RRV associated with a decrease in maximum temperatures in arid parts of Australia, and no strong relationship in tropical northern Australia, where temperatures are routinely suitable for this virus [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At a regional scale (defined by cluster analysis), the RRV risk decreased with increasing spring minimum temperatures in the northernmost region (closest to equator), while in the southernmost (poleward) region, RRV risk increased with increasing spring minimum and maximum temperatures, with two other regions showing no effect of temperature [
 <xref rid="B225-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. Similarly, in Southern Australia, RRV infections increased with either increasing monthly mean minimum or maximum temperatures [
 <xref rid="B255-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>] and temperature increased RRV risk in Tasmania [
 <xref rid="B256-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>]. Temperature was included in a model used to forecast RRV risk 1â€“5 weeks in advance in Western Australia [
 <xref rid="B257-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. Risk of RRV increased with increasing minimum temperature, except in one area (Capel, in SW Australia) [
 <xref rid="B257-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. Risk also generally increased with increasing maximum temperature, but decreased in Capel [
 <xref rid="B257-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>], and showed no effect in two other locations.
