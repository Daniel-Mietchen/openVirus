<p>Low temperatures have been found to be limiting the distribution of many arboviruses. Low temperatures are generally thought to be limiting WNV expansion northward [

 <xref rid="B211-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Further, high temperatures have been observed to aid in the establishment of arboviruses. For example, WNV often invaded new locations following heatwaves [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but once established no longer required such high temperatures to persist [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B212-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. Indeed, simulations found that temperature was more important in WNV establishment than mosquito population composition (i.e., biotype ratio of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic>), fraction of hosts that are birds, and the mosquito-to-host ratio [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. At low temperatures (18 °C), mosquito-to-host ratio has a greater influence on WNV establishment [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, amplification of SLEV was estimated to stop at 17 °C [

 <xref rid="B202-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>] although the virus has still been detected in female mosquitoes during winter and spring when temperatures were between 11–15 °C. SLEV has also been predicted to expand further northward due to increased temperature suitability [
 <xref rid="B213-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>] as SLEV outbreaks have generally occurred at or below the 21 °C isotherm [
