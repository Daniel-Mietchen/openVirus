<p>Temperature has also played a strong role in risk modeling for new locations. Temperatures associated with mosquito development were used in modeling suitable locations in North Africa [

 <xref rid="B272-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>] for RVFV. Specifically, a minimum of 14 °C and a maximum of 40 °C were used, with an optimum of 28–32 °C for enzootic suitability, and a linearly increasing risk for epizootic transmission. Extrinsic incubation period and gonotropic period both decreased with increasing temperature (increasing viral risk) in a model of locations suitable for RVFV in California, USA [
 <xref rid="B166-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. The model found that a RVFV outbreak was possible in all months except December and January. A temperature-based model for the continental USA found that the number of risk days ranged from 0 in the far north to 325 in Florida [
