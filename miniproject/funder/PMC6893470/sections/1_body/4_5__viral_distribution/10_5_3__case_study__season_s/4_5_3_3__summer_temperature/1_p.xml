<p>Above average summer temperatures likely contributed to WNV epidemics in 2002â€“2004 [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and hot dry summers were also identified as associated with WNV foci in Connecticut, while warm wet summers were associated with more distributed cases of WNV [
 <xref rid="B242-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. Minimum summer temperature was found to predict human and mosquito cases in New York and Connecticut [
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Increased temperatures at a two-week lag interval were associated with WNV in Suffolk County, NY [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] and Nassau County, NY [
 <xref rid="B153-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. August and September temperatures were associated with increased WNV incidence in Russia [
 <xref rid="B186-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Increased summer temperatures were associated with West Nile fever in Europe [
 <xref rid="B184-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>,
 <xref rid="B189-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. In Romania, temperatures twenty days earlier were found to increase WNV infection rates [
 <xref rid="B227-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. High temperature anomalies in July were linked to WNV outbreaks in Europe [
 <xref rid="B184-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>,
 <xref rid="B243-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. In contrast, in West Texas, a dry and cool summer following a wet spring was associated with increased WNV cases [
 <xref rid="B244-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. In locations with high summer temperatures (i.e., deserts), habitat suitability for WNV may be low during the summer [
 <xref rid="B245-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. In South Africa, an increase in minimum summer temperature decreased WNV infection rates [
 <xref rid="B173-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Similarly, summer temperatures have also been linked to JEV in Japan [
