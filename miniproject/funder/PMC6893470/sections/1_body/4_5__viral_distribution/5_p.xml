<p>However, increased temperatures may cause decreases in arbovirus activity in hotter portions of their range. For instance, high temperatures have been predicted to limit WNV in subtropical regions [

 <xref rid="B213-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>] and observed [

 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> is able to clear WEEV infections at 32 째C compared to 18 and 25 째C [

 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> is increased for SLEV at 18 째C relative to 27 째C [
 <xref rid="B219-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. Data on 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> suggests that WNV will decline in some portions of its Southern range with increasing temperatures [

 <xref rid="B146-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Maximum temperature was negatively associated with seroprevalence of RVFV, although there was a strong trend towards an increase in seroprevalence with increasing night-time (minimum) temperature [
 <xref rid="B220-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. A large MVEV outbreak occurred during 2010/2011 due to low temperatures and high rainfall [
