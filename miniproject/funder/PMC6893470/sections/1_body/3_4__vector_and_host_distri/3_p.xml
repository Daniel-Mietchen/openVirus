<p>Consequently, in epizootic areas and endemic areas on the low side of the temperature range for arboviruses, an increase in temperature has often been associated with an increase in major vector populations. For example, increased temperatures have been associated with increased abundance of 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> [

 <xref rid="B118-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>,
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>,

 <xref rid="B121-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], a major vector for WNV. Increased temperatures have also been associated with an extended 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> season [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. The northern limit of EEEV is likely temperature limited due to lack of availability of suitable overwintering sites. 
 <italic>Cs. melanura</italic>, the main vector for EEEV, is active at low temperatures (1–5 °C) [
 <xref rid="B122-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], but requires liquid water in order to overwinter as larvae (typically in aquatic habitat underneath trees) [
 <xref rid="B123-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. In Botswana, seasonal temperature was important for 
 <italic>Cx. pipens</italic> dynamics [
