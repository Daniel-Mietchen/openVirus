<p>In regions with higher average temperatures, no effect of temperature variation may be detected, or effects may be mixed. For example, in Senegal, three major RVFV vector species increased in abundance with increasing temperature [

 <italic>Cx. poicilipes</italic> in this region was also found to increase with increased minimum temperature but decreased with increased maximum temperature [

 <italic>Cx pipiens</italic> distribution in the Middle East and North Africa was primarily driven by human population density and land cover, but not by temperature or rainfall [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], although a local study in Saudi Arabia found temperature was an important predictor for RVFV vector
