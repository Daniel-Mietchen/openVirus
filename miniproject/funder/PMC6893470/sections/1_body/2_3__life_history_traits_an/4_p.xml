<p>Blood feeding frequency, on a population level, should increase with development time and temperature, yet this may not always be the case if mating and/or host seeking success is negatively influenced by rising temperatures. Studies with 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> found an increased likelihood of blood feeding with increased temperatures from 10 °C to 28 °C [

 <xref rid="B89-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], yet feeding rates could decrease at higher temperatures [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Differences at lower temperatures are additionally influenced by photoperiod, demonstrating that multiple environmental cues influence diapause in some mosquitoes that overwinter as adults [

 <italic>Ae. triseriatus</italic> from 25.2 °C to 32.2 °C was found [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], yet extreme temperatures (&lt;20.0 °C and &gt;35.0 °C) have been also been shown to decrease mating [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-11-01013" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], and could therefore negatively impact feeding frequencies.
