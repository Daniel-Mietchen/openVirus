<p>We implemented two sequential population‐representative surveys in 2014 and 2016 in two municipalities in North West Province (NW). The surveys were conducted in conjunction with an HIV prevention programme, providing an opportunity to both evaluate the impact of an HIV prevention programme focusing on increasing HIV testing uptake through community‐based testing campaigns and home‐based testing services, and to assess trends in the HIV care continuum in an understudied but high prevalence area. While we had hypothesized that HIV testing and care engagement would increase in the municipality receiving the combination prevention programme compared to the municipality not receiving these services, we found that changes in the 90‐90‐90 indicators between the two communities were equivalent. However, changes over time in the 90‐90‐90 indicators in both communities reflect trends with important implications in evaluating the impact of national policies because the surveys were implemented at different stages of national ART access expansion. As a result, we describe changes in the 90‐90‐90 targets through comparison of population‐based data from the two municipalities before (early 2014) and after (late 2016) expanded treatment policies were introduced.</p>
