<p>Home to the most PLHIV, with an estimated HIV prevalence of 20.6% among adults 15 to 49, 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> and the largest national treatment programme, South Africa has progressively expanded eligibility criteria for ART access 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> and ART availability in primary health settings 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. In 2012, 37.8% of HIV‐positive men and 55.0% of HIV‐positive women were aware of their HIV status 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, 63.1% of men and 68.4% of women in care were on ART, and 73.7% of those on treatment achieved viral suppression 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. ART initiation criteria were extended from CD4 &lt;200 to CD4 &lt;350 in 2013, then from CD4 &lt;350 to CD4 &lt;500 in January 2015, with universal test and treatment (ART initiation regardless of CD4 count) introduced in September 2016 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. In addition, the simplicity of the first‐line regimen improved, with South Africa rolling‐out fixed dose combination (FDC) first‐line ART (comprised of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/Efavirenz) in April 2013 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Finally, additional efforts to streamline treatment with strategies such as providing fast track ART pick‐up with longer medication supplies for stable patients were introduced in 2016 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. Introduction of FDC, expanded ART eligibility, and new measures to streamline treatment and improve adherence are likely to make a large impact on care engagement and adherence, moving South Africa closer to meeting the 90‐90‐90 targets following these policy changes. In fact, the summary findings of the National HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey 2017 note recent improvements in 90‐90‐90 targets. Although targets vary regionally, survey findings estimated that nationally, 78.0% and 88.9% of HIV‐positive males and females respectively were aware of their status; 67.4% and 72.2% of males and females aware of their status were on ART; and 82.1% and 89.9% and of males and females on ART were virally suppressed
