<p>The global HIV response has gained considerable momentum in increasing testing and treatment availability in the most heavily burdened regions. Spurred by findings that viral suppression would benefit not only people living with HIV (PLHIV) but also prevent transmission to uninfected sexual partners 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, international agencies and governments have instituted policies and targets to rapidly expand treatment access. UNAIDS first introduced testing and treatment targets in 2014 which specify that by 2020, 90% of HIV‚Äêpositive people are aware of their status, 90% of those diagnosed receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 90% of those on ART achieve viral suppression 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Governments adopted these targets and have more than doubled the number of people on ART in recent years. For example, the proportion of PLHIV on ART in Eastern and Southern Africa increased from 24% in 2010 to 54% in 2015
