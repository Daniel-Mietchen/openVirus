<p>HIV prevalence did not vary significantly across time at 22.8% (95% CI 18.2–27.5) in 2014 and 21.2% (CI 16.7–25.6) in 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225295-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). HIV prevalence was consistently lower for men compared to women at 18.7% (CI 12.7–24.7) versus 26.5% (CI 21.3–30.9;

 <xref rid="jia225295-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), with higher proportions of females reporting ever testing. Data on past‐year HIV testing suggested an increasing but not significant trend over time; overall, 51.0% (CI 46.4–55.6) of 2014 participants and 55.0% (CI 50.3–59.5) of 2016 participants reported past‐year HIV testing; men consistently reported less testing than women.
