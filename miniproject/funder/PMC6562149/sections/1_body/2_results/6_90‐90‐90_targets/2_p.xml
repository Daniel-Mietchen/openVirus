<p>Prior knowledge of HIV status among all HIV positive individuals (the first “90”) was consistent over time at 68.7% (CI 60.9–75.6) in 2014 compared to 72.8% (CI 63.6–80.4) in 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225295-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225295-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Prior knowledge of status was consistently lower among men both in 2014 and 2016. The proportion of PLHIV who knew their status that had evidence of currently being on ART (the second “90”) increased significantly from 80.9% (CI 71.9–87.4) in 2014 to 91.5% (CI 84.4–95.5) in 2016. Increases were marginally statistically significant for women (

Among those individuals on ART, viral suppression (the third “90”) increased significantly over time; 55.0% (CI 39.6–70.4) of the sample had viral load &lt;5000 copies/mL in 2014 compared to 81.4% (CI 72.0–90.8) in 2016. There was a particularly large increase observed for males (33.7% to 81.6%), bringing viral suppression to equivalent levels among men and women by 2016. Despite the improvements in men engaging in care, overall differences in the achievement of 90‐90‐90 targets by sex are largely due to the stark disparities in testing and knowledge of HIV status, with HIV‐positive men less likely to have been diagnosed. This is evidenced in the composite target of having 73% of all PLHIV virally suppressed. Using our imputation model (instead of multiplying out the three 90s), our findings indicate that 63.3% of PLHIV in the research area overall were virally suppressed; however, 72.0% of women achieved viral suppression – very close to the 73% target and far outperforming men at 45.8% (represented in Figure
