<p>Sensitivity analyses standardizing the 2014 to the 2016 population did not substantively change our results, with the exception of recent HIV testing: the difference in the proportion reporting past‐year HIV testing in sensitivity analysis was 54.8% versus 61.4% (

However, findings regarding the care cascade and 90‐90‐90 targets remained consistent in sensitivity analyses, including the absence of differences in known status over time, implying that while there was potentially more testing underway in 2016 as compared to 2014, this did not translate into more diagnoses.
