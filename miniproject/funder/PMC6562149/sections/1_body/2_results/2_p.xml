<p>In 2014, 43 of the 46 selected EAs were successfully enumerated; fieldworkers were not granted access to three farm areas. Of the 1527 enumerated DUs, 98.5% were approached; contact was made at 91.7%, yielding 1146 eligible individuals. A total of 1048 (91.0% of eligible participants) consented to participate; four were later determined ineligible (due to fieldworker error enrolling a non‐selected DU member), resulting in a total sample of 1044. Median cluster size was 25 (IQR: 22 to 28). In 2016, we approached 1925 DUs (95.7% of those targeted) in 46 selected EAs and were able to assess 1571 (81.6% of those approached) for study eligibility; 1060 (67.5%) dwellings had at least one eligible household member. A total of 980 participants (92.5%) enrolled; six were later determined ineligible (enrolment of non‐selected DU or DU member), data were lost for two surveys due to errors saving and uploading the survey files, and one survey was not matched to a household, resulting in an analytic sample of 971 participants. Median cluster size in 2016 was 21.5 (IQR: 17 to 27). Most common reasons for declining participation in both surveys were reported disinterest, lack of time and not feeling well. Across the surveys, 77.1% consented to HIV testing through rapid test or DBS (n = 1555).</p>
