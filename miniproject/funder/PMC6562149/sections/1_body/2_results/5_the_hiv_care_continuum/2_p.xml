<p>We assessed changes to the HIV care continuum over time among the HIV‐positive population to assess improvements in engagement in care (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225295-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Both the proportion of HIV‐positive participants with known status and the proportion linked to care were similar over time, although reported linkage within three months of diagnosis fell among both men and women (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225295-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Retention in care increased from 49.2% in 2014 to 58.4% in 2016, but was not statistically significant. Similarly, the proportion either reporting being on ART or with evidence of ART analytes increased from 56.2% to 67.2%; this difference was marginally statistically significant (
