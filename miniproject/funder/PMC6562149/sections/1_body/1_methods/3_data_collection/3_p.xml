<p>Following the survey, point‐of‐care HIV rapid antibody testing was performed by trained community health workers (CHWs) using serial HIV‐1/2 antibody rapid testing using the Alere Determine HIV‐1/2 (Alere Medical Co., Ltd, Chiba, Japan) and, if reactive, the First Response HIV 1‐2 (Premier Medical Corporation Ltd, Daman, India) 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Participants testing positive or with discrepant results were asked to undergo lancet finger‐prick to create ten 50 μL dried blood spots (DBS) using one Munktell filter card (Ahlstrom Munktell, Helsinki, Finland) and one Whatman Protein Saver #903 card, and then referred to the nearest public health care facility. Participants who declined rapid testing were asked to provide blood for DBS for laboratory HIV diagnosis (serology: ELISA confirmed with Western blot) and offered a study number to call for the results. DBS cards were dried, stored with desiccant at ambient temperature, transported to the study laboratory within six days of collection, and stored at −70°C prior to viral load, ART exposure testing and HIV serology (when point‐of‐care antibody testing was declined or discrepant).
