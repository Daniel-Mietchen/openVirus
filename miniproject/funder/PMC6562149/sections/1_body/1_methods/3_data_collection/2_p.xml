<p>For each survey, fieldworkers confirmed participant eligibility criteria (18 to 49 years, able to provide informed consent, and household residence defined as sleeping in the DU four or more nights per week); obtained written informed consent; and conducted a computer‐assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) survey at the participant's home in the preferred language (English or Setswana). The surveys elicited demographic characteristics, HIV testing and treatment history, health services utilization, sexual and other risk behaviours, and community characteristics. Participants were compensated with a mobile phone airtime voucher.</p>
