<p>Initial sample size calculations reflected targets needed for a comparison of communities over time, with power to detect 50% increase in recent HIV testing. We employed a multistage cluster sampling approach in collaboration with Statistics South Africa to access a representative sample of municipality households. Both surveys included 23 enumeration areas (EAs) from each municipality (n = 46 EAs total) selected proportionate to size based on 2011 census data. Prior to the 2014 survey, all dwelling units (DU) in selected EAs were fully enumerated, including a detailed listing of residents. The listing was used to randomly select up to 36 inhabited dwelling units (DU) or households from each EA for inclusion (1561 DUs in total). One adult (18 to 49 years) was randomly selected per DU for participation

In 2016, sampled EAs were enumerated using aerial maps including all structures within the EA boundary; research teams then drove through the EAs to note structures that were no longer inhabited and/or new structures to add to the map. Within each EA, 46 DUs were randomly selected; a higher number of households were selected in 2016 to account for the probability that not all DUs would have an eligible adult. Eligibility was assessed during fieldwork: at each selected DU research staff listed all eligible residents 18 to 49 years and used a random number generator to select an individual from the household list for inclusion. Across surveys the EAs ranged in size from 14 to 355 dwellings, resulting in probability of DU selection ranging from 1.0 to 0.13. Results and detailed methods from the first survey have been published
