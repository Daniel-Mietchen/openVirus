<p>Viral load testing was performed on Munktell DBS using the COBAS AmpliPrep for sample preparation and COBAS TaqMan HIV‐1 2.0 test (Roche Applied Science, Pleasanton CA, USA; lower limit of quantification 400 copies/mL for DBS) 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. We utilize a conservative viral suppression cut off of &lt;5000 copies/mL, which is a higher threshold than recommended for plasma due to the combined quantification of both proviral DNA (present in settings of viral RNA suppression) and cellular RNA in DBS samples
