<p>All analyses accommodated the multi‐stage survey design, including clustering and weighting 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>. Weights were created using the inverse probability of selection at each stage (EA, DU and person) and adjusted for non‐response to reflect municipality age and sex distributions 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. We calculated proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to describe overall and sex‐specific demographic characteristics, HIV testing, prevalence and care engagement. One study participant self‐reported as transgender in 2016; because sampling was based on biological sex, this individual was included in subsequent analyses in their biological sex group (male). We estimated chi‐square statistics using the second‐order Rao and Scott correction for bivariate analyses 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. Given the aim to evaluate a comprehensive prevention programme, we first estimated difference‐in‐differences models to assess changes over time within and by municipalities using generalized linear mixed effects logistic regression models, including a random intercept for enumeration area, our stratification variable and the Huber variance estimator for cluster‐robust standard error estimation 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. We found that reported past‐year HIV testing was statistically higher in Lekwa‐Teemane as compared to Greater Taung; however, care continuum outcomes, including known HIV status, did not change differentially by municipality. We therefore present combined municipal data in the current analysis comparing 2014 to 2016 data. We used generalized linear regression modelling (GLM) with log binomial models to evaluate differences in the HIV care continuum between 2014 and 2016. We first imputed missing data on HIV status and DBS outcomes (analyte and viral load) using multiple imputation by chained equations procedures, employing 50 datasets from models incorporating socio‐demographic, clinical and behavioural predictors. To account for our study design, imputation models included enumeration area and survey weights, and main analyses employed survey procedures
