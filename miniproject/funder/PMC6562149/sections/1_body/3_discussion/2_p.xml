<p>Using data from recent consecutive population‐representative surveys in two municipalities in North West Province, South Africa, we found strong evidence that HIV care engagement has improved in recent years. We found notable advances in both the second and third 90‐90‐90 targets. The proportion of PLHIV with known status who are on treatment reached 91% and the proportion of virally suppressed on treatment is estimated at 81%. Although our results suggest that prevention activities led to a higher proportion of individuals reporting HIV testing, these activities did not result in improvements in the first 90 target. Increased testing alone did not improve the proportion of PLHIV who knew their status, which remained similar over time at 69% in 2014 and 73% in 2016. Our findings suggest that shifts in the national programme are the drivers of change in these communities, as opposed to introduction of local activities designed to enhance testing and engagement in care. This finding is consistent with recent community trials, such as the ANRS Treatment as Prevention (TasP) trial in South Africa, which similarly found no difference in ART coverage in communities receiving a test and treat intervention as compared to a control condition, but demonstrated improvements overall between 2012 and 2016 during treatment expansion
