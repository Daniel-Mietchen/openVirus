<p>Our estimates of known status, the first 90, remained consistent at around 55% of men and 80% of women in 2014 and 2016, with only small, non‐significant increases. Our estimates are slightly higher than those from a comparable survey in KwaZulu‐Natal, where 52% of HIV‐positive men and 65% of women knew their status in 2014 to 2015 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, lower than another, similar study noting 68% of status knowledge among men, 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> and much lower than the 91.5% (overall) reported in the ANRS TasP trial 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. Our estimates are slightly lower than 2015 to 2016 national estimates of 74% with known status 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, and much lower than modelled estimates from mid‐2016 of 84% to 89% across provinces 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. They also diverge considerably from the 2017 National HIV Survey Summary, which estimated that 78.0% and 88.9% of HIV‐positive males and females respectively are aware of their status 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. The first “90” is the most difficult proportion to estimate as high quality data on the number of people who are living with HIV (the total population who should be included in the denominator), are not available 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>. Also difficult to come by are precise estimates of how many diagnoses have been made (those who should also be in the numerator). Other discrepancies and the wide range of estimates of the first 90 might be due to large regional differences in testing uptake; although national and regional data in this case are similar. Nonetheless, our findings contribute to growing evidence that diagnosis remains a major barrier to achieving 90‐90‐90 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> and to the increasing consensus that given the large disparity in knowledge of status among men, who test less frequently and who have poorer HIV outcomes over the lifecourse as compared to women
