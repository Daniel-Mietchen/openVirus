<p>This study compared two sequential, population‐representative samples of the general population aged 18 to 49 years in North West Province, South Africa during a period of rapid policy transition. Our findings are representative of an area of comprising 230,000 people and provide insight into the impacts of policy changes in South Africa's HIV response in a district far from the major metropolitan areas. Our findings are subject to some biases. While fewer than 10% of eligible participants declined survey participation, 23% declined HIV testing in our survey. Our participation rates are still higher than the national survey, in which only 67.7% and 58.4% of men and women respectively agreed to HIV testing

 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>. Self‐reported knowledge of status, linkage to care and retention in care is subject to misreporting. Guidance around the frequency of visits changed for stable patients between the surveys, which likely explains why our estimate of retention is lower than our estimate of those positive for ART analytes in 2016. Viral suppression is estimated from DBS; we used a high (&gt;5000 copies/mL) threshold for defining viral suppression, as cellular proviral HIV DNA and virion RNA both contribute to copy number when using DBS instead of plasma from whole blood 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. As a result, viral suppression estimates might be inflated. However, we see similar improvements in viral suppression using all thresholds. Furthermore, while there were some differences between 2014 and 2016 samples, sensitivity analysis aimed at improving sample comparability yielded similar results.
