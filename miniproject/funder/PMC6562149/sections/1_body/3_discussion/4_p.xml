<p>Our findings regarding the second 90 target, “on ART,” that 88.6% of men and 92.4% of women with known status are on treatment, are higher than similar surveys 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> and national estimates 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. National HIV Survey Summary data estimate only 67.4% and 72.2% of males and females, respectively are on ART. However, this discrepancy is likely due to differences in calculating the denominator; if more people are believed to know their status, then the number on treatment will reflect a smaller proportion. Conversely, if fewer people are believed to know their status, the estimate of the proportion on treatment will be higher. Estimates of the third 90 in South Africa are reliably over 80%

 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, which is consistent with our data. Our findings on the overall proportion of PLHIV who are virally suppressed, with 46% of men and 72% of woman living with HIV reaching viral suppression, are higher than the national survey findings of 43% and 58% of male and female PLHIV achieving suppression 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, and higher than the modelled provincial data for North West Province 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>. These differences may be due to our use of an unconditional imputation model, as opposed to simple multiplication of the 90‐90‐90 estimates. Our model allows for HIV‐positive participants who may not know their status or be on treatment to have low viral loads suggestive of suppression, as this was observed in our data and has been found elsewhere 
 <xref rid="jia225295-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>. Additionally, our higher estimate of total viral suppression could be due to utilizing the higher viral suppression threshold of &lt; 5000, based on the sample medium.
