<p>These data were collected during rapid treatment scale up and multiple treatment guideline revisions. The South African National Department of Health (NDoH) introduced the first line FDC, single pill (TDF/FTC/EFV), in 2013. As the new FDC was implemented in stages, it is likely that some patients in rural areas were still being transitioned to FDC in early 2014, at the time of the first survey, whereas by 2016 all clients would have been on a FDC regimen. Single‐pill regimens have been found to improve medication adherence

Furthermore, the NDoH extended ART qualifying criteria twice in the interim of the two surveys, with implementation of treatment access for those with CD4 &lt;500 in 2015, after the first survey, and universal access to care implemented approximately as the second survey began. While it is unlikely that universal access was implemented uniformly and immediately with the announcement, the ART expansion in 2015 likely had a large impact on increased the number of people on treatment and suppressed between the surveys. During this time, the government also introduced new adherence guidelines with efforts to streamline treatment, providing means to more rapid and longer ART prescribing for stable patients, along with introduction of strategies such as community adherence clubs in 2016. Finally, the health department also published more extensive guidance around tracing patients defaulting from care, including a push for PEPFAR partners to oversee implementation of partner tracing, which might have contributed to re‐engagement of patients.
