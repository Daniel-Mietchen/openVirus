<p>Over the span of two and a half years during which the first line FDC was introduced, CD4 thresholds were steadily removed for ART eligibility, and guidance was published on facilitating treatment and tracking defaulting patients, we found that the second 90‐90‐90 target was reached and the third is within reach in a rural area of North West Province, South Africa. We conclude that South Africa's policies have improved and facilitated access to treatment. No significant improvements were evident in the first 90 target, despite testing campaigns in the area and increases in reported HIV testing. Our findings indicate that by late 2016, women in the research area had almost achieved the 73% suppression target. Our data also indicate that woman far outperform men in meeting this target, a finding common to recent large‐scale trials

This will require targeted and differentiated testing models to encourage uptake of HIV testing by men and others less inclined to attend a clinic. Accordingly, South Africa's new National Strategic Plan

By expanding testing models beyond current clinic‐based approaches and pairing testing with facilitated linkage strategies, South Africa may be able in a position to meet its targets and grow closer to ending the threat of the HIV epidemic.
