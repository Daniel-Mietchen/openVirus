  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>To achieve epidemic control of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> by 2030, countries aim to meet 90‐90‐90 targets to increase knowledge of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content>‐positive status, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content>) and viral suppression by 2020. We assessed the progress towards these targets from 2014 to 2016 in South Africa as expanded treatment policies were introduced using population‐representative surveys.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>Data were collected in January to March 2014 and August to November 2016 in Dr. Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District, North West Province. Each multi‐stage cluster sample included 46 enumeration areas (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">EA</styled-content>), a target of 36 dwelling units (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">DU</styled-content>) per 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">EA</styled-content>, and a single resident aged 18 to 49 per 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">DU</styled-content>. Data collection included behavioural surveys, rapid 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> antibody testing and dried blood spot collection. We used weighted general linear regression to evaluate differences in the 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> care continuum over time.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Overall, 1044 and 971 participants enrolled in 2014 and 2016 respectively with approximately 77% undergoing 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> testing. Despite increases in reported testing, known status among people living with 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PLHIV</styled-content>) remained similar at 68.7% (95% Confidence Interval (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content>) = 60.9–75.6) in 2014 and 72.8% (95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> = 63.6–80.4) in 2016. Men were consistently less likely than women to know their status. Among those with known status, 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PLHIV</styled-content> on 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> increased significantly from 80.9% (95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> = 71.9–87.4) to 91.5% (95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> = 84.4–95.5). Viral suppression (&lt;5000 copies/mL using DBS) among those on 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> increased significantly from 55.0% (95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> = 39.6–70.4) in 2014 to 81.4% (95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> = 72.0–90.8) in 2016. Among all 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PLHIV</styled-content> an estimated 72.0% (95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> = 63.8–80.1) of women and 45.8% (95% 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">CI</styled-content> = 27.0–64.7) of men achieved viral suppression by 2016.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Over a period during which fixed‐dose combination was introduced, 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> eligibility expanded, and efforts to streamline treatment were implemented, major improvements in the second and third 90‐90‐90 targets were achieved. Achieving the first 90 target will require targeted and improved testing models for men.
