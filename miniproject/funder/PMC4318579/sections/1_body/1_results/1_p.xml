<p>Our model tracked a dynamic network of contacts between three types of nodes (individuals): male, female, and female sex worker (FSW). Stochastic processes were implemented for the formation and dissolution of links (heterosexual relationships); sexual acts over the links; transmission of HIV in serodiscordant acts; and death due to AIDS. Natural (non-AIDS related) turnover was implemented by tracking the age of individuals, and replacing individuals at the end of sexual activity; the network of contacts was parameterized based on contemporary data including variability in the promiscuity of individuals. The transmissibility of HIV depended on disease stage.</p>
