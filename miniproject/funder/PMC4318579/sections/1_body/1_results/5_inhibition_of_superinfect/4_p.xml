<p>Finally, we also collected statistics on the time until the turning point when the invader strain accounted for 50 percent of the infections in the population (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C,F</xref>). This time was extremely long (&gt;300 years) when the invader strain had low transmission advantage in the default scenario, and a transmission advantage of 50 percent was needed to bring it down to a median of 27 and 48 years in the low and high-prevalence setting, respectively (in comparison, the resident strain reached 50% of its steady-state prevalence in a median of 35 and 40 years in the low and high-prevalence cases; dashed gray lines). Allowing for dual infection again had the strongest impact at lower transmission advantage, followed by allowing for multiple peaks of acute-stage infectiousness.
