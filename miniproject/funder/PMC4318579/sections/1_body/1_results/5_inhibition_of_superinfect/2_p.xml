<p>When the transmission advantage of the invader strain was small, most simulations of the default scenario resulted in the extinction of the invader variant in both the high (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) prevalence settings. In contrast, the first (resident) strain was able to establish a stable epidemic in nearly all (&gt;99%; dashed gray line) simulation runs when introduced into a fully susceptible population, which indicates a strong first comer advantage at the early stages of the spread of new strains. Preserving the degree distribution of the contact network (“fixed degrees”) had negligible effect compared with the default scenario; allowing multiple peaks of acute-stage infectiousness substantially reduced the probability of extinction in the high, but not in the low-prevalence setting. Finally, allowing for unhindered superinfection and coexistence (“dual infection”) reduced the probability of extinction to near zero even with no transmission advantage, illustrating that the inhibition of superinfection was the major factor in the heightened extinction risk of the invader strain. Greater relative advantage in the transmission rate reduced the risk of extinction in all scenarios, approaching zero extinction risk at around 25 percent advantage.
