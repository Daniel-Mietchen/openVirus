<p>We tested eight scenarios (default and three test cases, each in both low and high prevalence settings) with levels of relative transmission advantage for the invader strain ranging between 0â€“50 percent. The invader strain was introduced in the population when the resident virus had attained steady-state prevalence; all combinations of scenario and transmission advantage were tested in 1000 simulation runs. We extracted several statistics to quantify the probability and rate of the expansion of the invader virus (
