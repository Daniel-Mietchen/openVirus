<p>To understand why the impact of repeated acute-stage infectivity depended on the initial prevalence of the resident strain, we calculated the contribution of superinfection events and acute-stage transmissions to the spread of the invader strain in the various scenarios (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). As expected, the contribution of superinfection was very low (&lt;5%) in the low-prevalence setting, where most individuals were uninfected at the introduction of the invader strain; in contrast, many more transmissions (~20% initially) involved superinfection of carriers of the resident virus in the high-prevalence setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Because multiple acute peaks of infectiousness take effect only when superinfection occurs, their impact on the frequency of acute transmissions was much stronger in the high-prevalence setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref>), and the increased frequency of efficient acute transmissions explains the reduced risk of extinction and faster growth of the invader strain when multiple acute peaks of infectivity were allowed in the high-prevalence scenario. In the high-prevalence setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), the relative contribution of superinfection decreases faster in the multiple acute scenario compared with the default scenario: the reason for this difference is that multiple acute peaks of infectiousness can substantially accelerate the outgrowth of the invader strain in the high-prevalence scenario (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig.</xref>), and the decline of the resident strain results in a decreasing probability that the invader (super)infects an individual who carries the resident strain.
