<p>We defined two more quantifiers based on the time it took the invader strain to grow to selected threshold levels (in both cases we derived the statistics from the simulation runs where the invader strain did not go extinct). The time to one percent absolute prevalence (infecting one percent of the total population) was selected as a low threshold that would allow for the detection of a new strain in a population (

As a baseline comparison, we plotted also the median time until the resident strain attained one percent prevalence during its initial expansion (median of 14.4 and 3.3 years for the low and the high prevalence case; dashed gray lines). At small values of the transmission advantage, growing even to one percent prevalence can take a century or more in the default scenario (e.g. a median of 114 and 228 years with a transmission advantage of one percent, in the low and high-prevalence setting, respectively). The inhibition effect was stronger in the high-prevalence setting, and was gradually lost when the transmission advantage of the invader strain was increased to about 50 percent. The dominant mechanism of inhibition was again the inhibition of superinfection: allowing for dual infection abrogated most of the effect even at low values of the transmission advantage. The other two mechanisms of interference had negligible effect in the low-prevalence scenario (
