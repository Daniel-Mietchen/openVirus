<p>Our simulation framework allowed us to investigate three potential mechanisms of interference between the resident and the invader strains. First, infection with one HIV strain may afford some protection against superinfection with another strain: both the depletion of target cells and the induction of anti-HIV immune responses are likely to create less favourable conditions for infection compared with an uninfected individual. Because the strength of such an effect is still subject to debate (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Discussion</xref>), we used the following conservative approach in the default settings for our simulations. In a sexual act between two individuals who were both infected but with different strains of the virus, both strains had a chance to be transmitted in a two-step procedure. The first step tested successful initial transmission, which had a probability based on the transmission rate of the given strain, equivalent to the first infection of an uninfected individual. Then in the second step the superinfecting virus replaced the original strain with a probability based on the relative transmission rates of the two strains: in 50% of the cases if both strains had equal transmission rate, and with smaller or greater probability if the superinfecting strain had lower or higher transmission rate, respectively, compared with the original strain (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). In this scenario, the first strain had neither advantage nor disadvantage at the within-host level, and the “inhibition effect” arose only from the assumption that the infection of each individual is dominated by a single virus strain, implying replacement rather than coexistence upon superinfection (which is a reasonable simplification for the modelling of population level spread; see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Discussion</xref>). This algorithm reduced the average probability of superinfection to 50% of that of initial infection, which is consistent with a recent prospective cohort study that estimated about two-fold lower hazard of superinfection compared with initial infection [

However, we also tested a “dual infection” scenario, in which superinfection was completely unhindered, and both strains were able to co-exist within one individual after superinfection occurred. In this scenario, in sexual acts between a dual infected and an uninfected individual both virus strains had an independent probability of being transmitted.
