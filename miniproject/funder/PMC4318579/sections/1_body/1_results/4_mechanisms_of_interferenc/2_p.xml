<p>Second, we hypothesized that the peak of infectivity that characterizes acute infection [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] may not occur again upon superinfection due to depleted target cell levels and the presence of anti-HIV immune responses. If this is indeed the case then the first virus strain to colonize a population may take advantage of a rapid early wave of expansion fuelled by a high relative frequency of efficient acute stage transmissions in a largely susceptible population (the relative contribution of acute stage transmissions in our simulations is shown in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>). In contrast, any subsequent “invader” strain is limited to the lower rates of chronic transmission that characterize mature epidemics ([
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>), and even successfully superinfected individuals represent a diminished resource if acute peak infectivity cannot be repeated. We implemented this possible mechanism by keeping track of disease stage independently of the identity of the infecting strain. If superinfection occurred after the end of acute infection, the individual was assumed to remain in chronic stage and the onward transmission of the superinfecting strain occurred according to its baseline (chronic) transmission rate. When superinfection occurred during the acute stage of the initial infection, then the superinfecting strain received the benefit of enhanced acute-stage transmission for the remaining time of the acute stage, timed from the initial infection of the individual. However, some evidence indicates that superinfection can generate a new temporary peak of viremia at least in some of the cases [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We have therefore also tested a scenario where superinfection started a new window of enhanced acute-stage infectivity.
