<p>Third, we hypothesized that, in the absence of broadly available antiretroviral treatment (ART), the first HIV epidemics may also have an impact by selectively infecting and killing highly promiscuous individuals who form the “hubs” of the network. Such individuals have been shown to be particularly important for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and they are likely to be infected preferentially due to their larger number of contacts. Indeed, in our simulations the probability of infection was strongly related to the promiscuity (preferred contact degree) of the individuals (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Using collated data from 100 simulation runs, logistic regression against log transformed contact degree (controlling also for age and gender) estimated an effect size of 2.48 (95% CI: 2.46–2.50; p&lt;10
 <sup>-10</sup>), implying that the odds of being infected increased by a factor of exp(2.48), i.e., about 12-fold for every order of magnitude increase in the preferred contact degree (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref> for the model fit); the effect was robust also in regressions on individual simulation runs (effect size range in 100 simulations: 2.26–2.66; p&lt;10
 <sup>-10</sup> for all simulation runs). As a result, an established epidemic of the resident virus strain depleted highly connected nodes of the network preferentially: the power-law exponent of the contact degree distributions (fitted to the actual number of partners in the last year) increased significantly compared with the pre-epidemic steady state (p&lt;10
 <sup>–10</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test; 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref>), which may also have put any invader strain at a disadvantage. To assess the strength of this effect, we also implemented a scenario in which all individuals who died of AIDS were replaced by an uninfected individual with the same promiscuity (preferred contact degree) as that of the deceased individual, which preserved the degree distribution of the contact network irrespective of the epidemics.
