<p>Our strategy was thus to construct a default simulation scenario using settings that we deemed most plausible (partially inhibited superinfection, with strain replacement when superinfection is successful; one-time acute peak of infectiousness; and emergent preferential depletion of highly connected individuals), then test the effect of switching off one mechanism at a time in a series of test scenarios: i) “dual infection” with possible co-existence of the two strains in the same individual and no inhibition of superinfection; ii) “multiple acute” with repeated episodes of enhanced acute-stage infectiousness upon each successful superinfection; and iii) “fixed degrees” in which the degree distribution of the contact network was preserved. This strategy allowed us to assess the relative impact of each mechanism on the population level competition dynamics, and served also as a sensitivity analysis for relaxing the assumptions of inhibited superinfection and one-time acute peak infectiousness.</p>
