<p>We also tested the effect of faster population turnover using a residence time of 20 years (as opposed to the default of 35 years) for uninfected individuals in the population. This scenario may apply to regions that experience intense population movements and/or high rates of non-AIDS mortality. Faster population turnover had little effect on the initial risk of extinction for the invader strain, but could substantially accelerate the rate of its growth in the simulation runs where it did not go extinct (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig.</xref>). The probability of extinction is influenced by the instantaneous availability of susceptible individuals, which is not affected by the rate of turnover (at a fixed population size); however, subsequent growth depends on the continuous supply of new susceptibles, which increases with the rate of population turnover.
