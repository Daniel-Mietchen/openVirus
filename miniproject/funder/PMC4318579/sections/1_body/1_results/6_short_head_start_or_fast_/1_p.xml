<p>We next investigated what happens if the invader strain enters the population when the first strain is still in its growth phase and has not yet reached steady-state prevalence. We ran simulations where the invader was introduced when the resident strain had attained 5%, 20% or 50% of its plateau prevalence level and compared the outcome to the previous default setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). As expected the first comer advantage was weaker when the second strain was introduced early in the growth phase of the first strain. However, the probability of extinction of the invader strain increased substantially already when the resident strain was at only 5% of its plateau level initially in the low-prevalence setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), or at 20% of plateau level in the high-prevalence setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The time to 50% relative prevalence of the invader strain was strongly affected when the resident strain was initially at 5% of its plateau level in the high-prevalence setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), and at 20% of plateau level in the low-prevalence setting (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). We thus conclude that (depending on the prevalence setting) some aspects of the first comer advantage are established relatively early in the initial expansion of the first successful strain.
