<p>We simulated a simple scenario of competition between two strains of the virus. To assess the maximum potential for a “first comer advantage”, we started the simulations with one of the strains (the founder, or “resident” strain) and let the epidemics attain steady-state prevalence before introducing the second (“invader”) virus strain. The transmission rate of the invader strain was equal to or greater than that of the resident strain, and its chance and pace of growth was assessed in relation to its transmission advantage over the resident strain.</p>
