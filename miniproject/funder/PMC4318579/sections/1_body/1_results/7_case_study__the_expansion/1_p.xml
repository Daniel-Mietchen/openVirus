<p>While the mechanisms of interference can slow down the invasion of new strains, the global pandemic is not static and major shifts between HIV lineages have been occurring in selected regions. The best-characterized example is the expansion of HIV-1 subtype A at the expense of subtype D in Eastern Africa [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and we used the detailed data from Uganda [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to derive a crude estimate for the transmission advantage required for the observed expansion. Between 1994 and 2002, the estimated prevalence of subtype D decreased from 11.9% to 8.1%, and the prevalence of subtype A increased from 2.8% to 3.0% in Uganda; the overall prevalence of HIV declined from 17% to 13% over the same period [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The overall decline probably reflects changes in risk behaviour and/or health interventions; with stable (17%) prevalence, the relative expansion of subtype A would roughly correspond to growing to 3.9% (~3*17/13) absolute prevalence, over a background prevalence comparable to that of our high-prevalence setting. Analyzing data from our high-prevalence default scenario, we found the closest match with the data when the transmission advantage of the invader strain was set to 25% (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), in which case the increase from 2.8% to 3.9% prevalence took 7.8 years on average (vs. 8 years in the empirical dataset). The rate of the relative expansion of subtype A observed in Uganda would thus require about 25% advantage over the resident subtype D strain, in a setting of stable overall prevalence in our simulations. Decreasing overall prevalence in the empirical data indicates a slowing turnover of infections, which requires a greater transmission advantage for the same tempo of strain replacement. This is roughly consistent with the independent empirical estimation that the overall (unadjusted) transmission rate of subtype A was 47% higher than that of subtype D in the same cohort [
