<p>We hypothesized that the effect on the spread of the invader strain may depend on the prevalence of the resident strain, and have therefore considered two scenarios, where the steady-state prevalence of the resident strain was around 0.03 and 0.2, respectively. The two scenarios were set by changing the baseline rate of transmissibility (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and Methods</xref>/Parameters); all other parameters were kept constant.

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref> depicts cases with further values of the transmission rate advantage). The resident strain attains steady-state prevalence in about 84 and 74 years in the low- and high-prevalence scenario, respectively. With equal transmission rate, the invader strain shows no appreciable growth in a hundred years in the high-prevalence scenario (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and grows, but remains in strong minority over the same time span in the majority of the simulations with the low-prevalence scenario (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). A 25 percent advantage in the transmission rate allowed the invader virus to outgrow the resident strain in both scenarios (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,D</xref>), but it still took a median of 60 and 104 years until the prevalence of the invader strain reached that of the resident strain in the low- and high-prevalence setting; due to its higher transmissibility, the invader strain was then able to attain higher steady-state prevalence compared with the initial steady state of the resident strain. Compared with the initial expansion of the resident strain, the expansion of the invader was much slower in all cases. In addition, 66.4 and 68.3 percent of the simulations with equal transmissibility of the invader resulted in the extinction of the invader virus in the low- and high-prevalence scenarios, respectively; extinction occurred in 2.4 and 1.2 percent of the cases when the invader had 25 percent transmission advantage. In contrast, with our settings the initial introduction of the resident virus was nearly always (in 998/1000 and 1000/1000 independent simulation runs of the low and high-prevalence settings, respectively) able to establish an epidemic that grew to steady state.
