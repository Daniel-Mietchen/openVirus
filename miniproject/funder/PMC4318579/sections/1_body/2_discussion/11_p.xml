<p>The interference mechanisms and first comer advantage demonstrated in this paper may also help explain why so few cross-species transmissions of SIV to humans were able to establish epidemic HIV lineages, and why no new major HIV types or groups have emerged since the middle of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It is possible that a successful reduction or elimination of the current HIV epidemic in Africa may, by eliminating the inhibiting competition effects, increase the risk for the emergence of new HIV lineages from novel cross-species transmissions.
