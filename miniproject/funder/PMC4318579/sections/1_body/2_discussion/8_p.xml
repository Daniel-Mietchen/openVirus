<p>Our results have important implications for understanding the past and for predicting the future of the HIV pandemic. The observed first comer advantage can delay evolution to “optimal virulence” [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]) in the face of increasing selection pressure from the broadening scope of ART. Widely available ART may affect resident and invader strains equally, effectively reducing the baseline rate of transmissions and transforming a high-prevalence setting towards lower prevalence. Given that most aspects of the first comer advantage were strong in both low- and high-prevalence settings in our simulations, the broadening scope of ART may not affect this phenomenon strongly.
