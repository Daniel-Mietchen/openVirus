<p>Both the probability and the rate of epidemic growth were strongly reduced for virus strains introduced into the steady state of a resident epidemic, when the default assumptions of partially inhibited superinfection and one-time acute peak of transmissibility were used in our simulations. To outgrow the resident strain over a few decades (the time scale of human observations), the invader virus needed 25 percent or greater advantage in its rate of transmissibility over the resident strain. Of the three potential mechanisms of interference investigated, the direct inhibition of superinfection had the strongest effect in both prevalence settings, while one-time acute peak transmissibility had substantial effect only in the high-prevalence setting. The depletion of highly connected nodes in the network had little effect in most of the cases. In principle, a fourth mechanism of interference could also arise, because superinfected individuals (having progressed with their first infection) tend to have a shorter remaining lifespan, and therefore a shorter window of opportunity to transmit the superinfecting strain, compared with individuals who are infected for the first time. However, restarting the clock of disease progression upon superinfection had very little effect compared with the default scenario in a set of simulations (not shown); therefore, this mechanism does not seem to play an important role.</p>
