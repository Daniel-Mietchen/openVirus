<p>Finally, we note that HIV may represent a rare combination of factors relevant for the observed first comer advantage: infection lasts and remains active for life; the inhibition of superinfection does not seem to be (strongly) strain specific [

Taken together, these factors may imply that the first comer advantage, and its consequence of delayed global mixing, may be particularly strong for HIV and weaker for most other pathogens. For example, a persistent infection controlled by strain specific immunity would correspond approximately to our HIV scenario with no inhibition of superinfection, in which case most of the population level effect was lost in the simulations. Non-persistent infections would tip the balance further in favour of the novel strain, because individuals recovered from the initial infection would be susceptible to the novel strain while ceasing to transmit or be susceptible to the first strain.
