<p>While differences are expected between the currently characterized subtypes, and those more efficient at transmission are slowly gaining ground at the expense of less transmissible subtypes, major innovations and potentially higher transmissibility may be more likely to arise from the complex diversity of HIV in Central Africa and from the recombinant forms. CRFs probably emerged against the backdrop of established epidemics and their growth to detectable levels may indicate considerable selection advantage. The rapid growth of several CRFs in recent years [
