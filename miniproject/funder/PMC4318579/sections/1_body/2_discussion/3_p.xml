<p>Our results suggest that HIV competition dynamics is indeed characterized by a strong “first comer advantage” if the first strain to colonize a local transmission group expands to near plateau prevalence before further viral strains invade. This effect slows down the diversification of the epidemics and facilitates the persistence of founder effects. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to generally characterize the competition dynamics of different HIV strains over sexual networks, including multiple possible mechanisms of interference. The specific case of competition between HIV-1 and HIV-2 has been modelled in a similar framework [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Finally, Gross et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] demonstrated that the inhibition of superinfection can preserve founder effects in the competition of equally transmissible virus strains, but have not considered network structure, alternative mechanisms of interference, or differential transmission.
