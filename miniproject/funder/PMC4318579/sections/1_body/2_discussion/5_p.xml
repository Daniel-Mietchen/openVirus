<p>Our generic modelling framework could not aim to account for all the (often population specific) complexities of human population dynamics and behaviour. For simplicity, population size was kept constant in our simulations, including instantaneous replacement of individuals who died of AIDS. With this implementation population turnover increased with HIV prevalence, e.g., the rate of death/replacement was about a third higher in the high-prevalence steady state compared with an uninfected population. Given that faster turnover reduces the first comer advantage, our results can be regarded as a conservative (under) estimation of the inhibition effect. Not replacing individuals who die of AIDS results in decreasing population size, which may further inhibit the expansion of invader strains by reducing the supply of susceptible individuals. In contrast, fast population growth or immigration may dilute the inhibition effect by increasing the influx of susceptible individuals. Migration may also play a role by introducing the same invading HIV strain repeatedly from a source population: this would eventually overcome the barrier of initial extinction, but would likely have little impact on the subsequent growth of the invader strain. Furthermore, an established HIV epidemic may also affect sexual behaviour: if high-risk sexual practices and/or promiscuity decrease in response to an ongoing epidemic, the spread of subsequent invader strains may be further inhibited. Finally, the complexities of the sexual network, e.g., assortative mating may further influence the strength of the inhibition effects.</p>
