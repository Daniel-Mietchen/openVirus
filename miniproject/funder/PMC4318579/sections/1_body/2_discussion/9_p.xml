<p>Because the mechanisms of first comer advantage do not operate at the front wave of an epidemic expanding into a susceptible population, we suggest that much of the (non-local) adaptation of HIV may have happened along these front waves, rather than in populations where prevalence has stabilized. Furthermore, considering that the currently dominant subtypes probably all expanded riding the wave of their first comer advantage, most or all of them may in fact possess suboptimal fitness and transmissibility. If the original founder strains of the early expansions were selected (at least partly) by “chance”, rather than due to high fitness, then even subsequent evolution may have constrained the subtypes to the local suboptima of the fitness landscape that were accessible from the initial sequence. This implies that the initial founder effects and the first comer advantage may have provided some benefit by preventing the fast global spread of the most transmissible HIV variants in the growth phase of the pandemic. However, the results also caution that the next stage of the pandemic may be characterized by a shift towards more transmissible strains over the slow time scales predicted by our model, and data from several regions indicate that this process has already started. HIV-1 subtype A is spreading at the expense of subtype D in Eastern Africa [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and HIV-1 is expanding at the expense of HIV-2 in Western Africa [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Our results suggest that these relatively fast replacements require a large selective advantage of the expanding strain. Indeed, subtype A is associated with higher transmissibility [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and slower disease progression [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] compared with subtype D, and HIV-2 has two orders of magnitude lower replicative capacity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and more than 3-fold lower per contact transmissibility [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] compared with HIV-1. In comparison, within individual patients the replicative fitness (a probable correlate of transmissibility) showed only about 10% variation between the fittest and the average viral genome in a study of untreated HIV-1 infected patients [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Our results indicate that variations of greater magnitude are needed to drive the relatively fast replacement dynamics of the few observed cases.
