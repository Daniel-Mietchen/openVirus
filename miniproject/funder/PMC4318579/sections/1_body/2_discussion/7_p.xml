<p>We parameterized our model based on data from generalized heterosexual epidemics in Africa, but it could easily be adapted to other routes of transmission and to concentrated epidemics. Furthermore, the results of our simulations can be applied not only to the competition of two distinct lineages (e.g., subtypes, or distinct clades of the same subtype [

The general take-home message of our work posits that the expansion of the HIV pandemic to all susceptible populations across the world has made the conditions far less favourable for the spread of “novel” virus strains, irrespective of their origin.
