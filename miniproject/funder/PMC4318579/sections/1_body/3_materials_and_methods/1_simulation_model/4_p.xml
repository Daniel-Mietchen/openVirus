<p>In the default scenario, superinfection could occur only by the replacement of the original strain with the superinfecting strain. In a sexual act between two individuals infected with different virus strains, both strains had a chance to be transmitted. Superinfection occurred if two check points were passed: initial transmission occurred according to the transmission rate of the infecting strain (modified by disease stage, if appropriate); then after successful initial transmission, the probability of superinfection was determined by the relative transmission rates (“fitness”) of the two strains as follows: P = (ν
 <sub>2</sub>/(ν
 <sub>1</sub>+ν
 <sub>2</sub>)), where ν
 <sub>1</sub> denotes the transmission rate of the virus infecting the potential recipient and ν
 <sub>2</sub> denotes the transmission rate of the strain infecting the potential transmitter. The “clock” of disease stage in the recipient was unaffected by superinfection in the default scenario; the stage of disease remained to be based on the age of infection defined by the date of the original first infection of the recipient. A new time to death was drawn randomly (from the 3–20 years range); however, it was used only if the new date of death preceded the original date determined at the initial infection: superinfection could never extend the lifespan of an individual.
