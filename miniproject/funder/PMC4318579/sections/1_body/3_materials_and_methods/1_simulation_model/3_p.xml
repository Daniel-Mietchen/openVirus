<p>Population level competition was simulated by implementing two virus types that were allowed to differ in their rate of transmissibility. The type of the infecting virus strain(s) was tracked for each infected individual. The first virus strain was introduced in a random sample of ten percent of all FSW after the initialization of the sexual network: this method allowed a reliable establishment of the “resident” epidemic with negligible risk of extinction. The second (invader) strain was also introduced in a sample of ten percent of all FSW (sampled from uninfected FSW) when the resident strain has attained a steady state in the population.</p>
