<p>We implemented three scenarios to test the potential mechanisms of interference. In the “dual infection” scenario, superinfection occurred at the same rate as initial infection (i.e., according to the transmission rate of the superinfecting strain), and the two strains co-existed in the superinfected individuals. Superinfected (dually infected) individuals were then able to transmit both virus strains independently in subsequent contacts. We did not implement a scenario in which superinfection was unhindered but co-existence not allowed, because such a situation would imply an asymmetric advantage for the superinfecting strain. In the “multiple acute” scenario, the clock of disease stage was reset upon superinfection, and the superinfecting strain started a new episode of peak acute-stage transmissibility (however, this new episode could not extend the lifespan of the individual beyond his/her original date of death, determined after the first infection). Finally, in the “fixed degrees” scenario, new individuals were added with a preferred contact degree identical to that of the individual whom they replaced after his/her death due to AIDS.</p>
