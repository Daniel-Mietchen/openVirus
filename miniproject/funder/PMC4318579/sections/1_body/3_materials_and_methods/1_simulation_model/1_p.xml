<p>We developed a stochastic, individual-based simulation model to track the spread of HIV over a dynamic network of heterosexual contacts. The network consisted of three types of nodes (individuals): males, females and female sex workers (FSW). The model tracked the age and HIV status (stage of infection and the infecting virus type) of each individual, and for males and (non-FSW) females also a fixed quantifier of promiscuity (preferred annual contact degree), and the number of distinct sexual partners in the last year (realized annual contact degree). Individuals entered the population at age 15 and were removed at age 50. The preferred contact degree of each individual was drawn from an empirical distribution according to the type of the node and was kept constant for the lifetime of the individual. The promiscuity of males and (non-FSW) females was characterized by continuous power-law distributions of the form P(x) ∼ x
 <sup>-γ</sup> (with different exponents for the two sexes) parameterized based on empirical data (
