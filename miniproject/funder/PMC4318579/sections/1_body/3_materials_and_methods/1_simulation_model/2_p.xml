<p>The simulations had a time step of one week, and each step consisted of the following procedures: a) generation of sexual acts along the links and virus transmission, b) update of HIV status, c) birth and death dynamics of individuals, d) dissolution and formation of network links. The number of sexual acts in male-female links was drawn from a Poisson distribution (discarding zeros: no links were inactive); male-FSW links always involved a single sexual act. The probability of virus transmission to uninfected individuals was determined by the baseline transmission rate of the virus strain, amplified if the transmitting individual was in the acute stage of the infection. Newly infected individuals were immediately assigned a time to death from a uniform distribution between 3–20 years (consistent with recently estimated survival curves in ART-naïve cohorts [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]), and for each infection event we recorded: the date of the event, the strain that was transmitted, the disease stage of the transmitter, and whether the transmission involved superinfection of an individual previously infected with the other virus type. For simplicity, the size of the population was kept constant (at 10,000 individuals of both sexes): all nodes who died of AIDS or left the network at age 50 (whichever came first) were replaced with a new individual of age 15. The preferred annual contact degree of new nodes was drawn from the power-law distribution of the respective gender at entry to the population. The links between males and females were allowed to form and break up at each time step. The baseline probability of break-up was set to yield an average duration consistent with empirical estimates (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and was scaled proportional to the average contact degree of the two nodes (such that more promiscuous individuals had shorter relationships [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]). Link formation was implemented such that all non-FSW individuals would have a yearly number of sexual contacts approximately equivalent to their preferred annual contact degree. At each time step, the nodes were assigned a number of half-links generated randomly in proportion to their preferred contact degree. Because males had greater mean promiscuity than non-FSW females, the number of half-links for males exceeded those of the females. New links were formed by first randomly connecting all female half-links to male half-links, then randomly distributing the remaining male half-links to the FSW. All runs were started with an initialization phase restricted to link formation and break-up until the sexual network settled to a steady state. FSWs had fixed promiscuity and were added one by one as long as there was a surplus of male half-links. The number of FSWs at steady-state was thus not pre-determined, but emerged to match and compensate the imbalance of male and (non-FSW) female links in each scenario.
