<p>The global pandemic of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections is being driven mainly by the group M lineage of HIV-1, which crossed the species barrier from chimpanzees to humans about 100 years ago [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. By the time it started to spread beyond its epicentre in Central Africa, the virus had already accumulated considerable sequence diversity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and distinct divergent clades initiated a series of rapid expansions that gave rise to the subtypes of HIV-1 group M [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The global molecular diversity of the pandemic still bears the clear footprint of the strong founder effects that characterized this initial expansion. While diversity is very high near the epicentre of the epidemic in Central Africa, the epidemics of other regions are typically characterized by the dominance of at most a few subtypes or circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The countries where more than one subtype is prevalent tend to be characterized by parallel, compartmentalized epidemics with distinct subtypes infecting different risk or ethnic groups [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and transmission chains rarely cross national borders [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While the global spatial distribution of HIV subtypes is not completely static, the diversification of the epidemic and shifts between subtypes occur very slowly in most regions [
