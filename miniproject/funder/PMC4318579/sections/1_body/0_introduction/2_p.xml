<p>Understanding the factors that set the time scale of HIV competition dynamics at the population level has great practical relevance. Subtypes differ in both transmissibility [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and further variation in these traits is bound to exist within the subtypes and in the vast diversity of unique recombinant forms (URFs) and unclassified basal lineages in Central Africa [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004093.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Virus variants that have higher transmission potential are likely to be spreading at the expense of less efficient strains, and epidemics may expand as the original variants are gradually replaced by “fitter” viral lineages. The risk and pace of these processes needs to be better characterized.
