<p>We developed a simple model of sexually transmitted HIV epidemics that allowed us to monitor the competition dynamics of distinct virus strains with varying rates of transmission. In sexually transmitted epidemics, HIV is transmitted over the network of sexual contacts, which tends to include a very limited subset of all possible contacts, i.e. the host population is very far from “free mixing”. To be able to detect effects arising from network structure, we implemented an individual based simulation that allowed us to track a dynamic network of contacts between the individuals, and to model HIV transmission along the links of the network. The model was parameterized based on data from generalized heterosexual epidemics in Africa.</p>
