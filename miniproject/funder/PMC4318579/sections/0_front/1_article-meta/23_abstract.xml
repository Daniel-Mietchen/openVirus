 <p>The African epicentre of the HIV pandemic is home to a vast array of divergent viruses; however, local epidemics in other parts of the world are typically dominated by a single variant (subtype) of the virus, with different subtypes found in the different regions. This pattern indicates that local epidemics outside Africa have been started by the introduction of single “founder” viruses in the susceptible populations. However, how these patterns persisted over several decades in the face of international migration requires further explanation. By analyzing simulated epidemics, we demonstrated that an epidemic established by the first successful founder strain can inhibit the introduction and slow down the subsequent spread of further virus strains by several mechanisms of interference. Our results have implications for the global evolution of the HIV pandemic: the fast expansion of subtypes benefited from a “first comer advantage,” and founder viruses may have been selected by random sampling, rather than due to superior transmissibility/fitness; the fast expansion of these (possibly) suboptimal virus strains may have considerably delayed the spread of more transmissible HIV variants; however, the future evolution of the pandemic is likely to be characterized by a slow expansion of viral strains with increased transmission potential.</p>
