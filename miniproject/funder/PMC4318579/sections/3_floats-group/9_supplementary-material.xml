  <title>The probability of infection as a function of the promiscuity (preferred contact degree) of the individuals: data and model fit.</title>
  <p>Using collated data from 100 simulation runs (2 million individuals total), we performed a logistic regression on the probability of infection in individuals using log transformed preferred contact degree, age and gender as explanatory variables. Purple and red lines show smoothed actual proportions of infecteds among females and males, respectively, calculated with a sliding window (moving along all individuals sorted according to contact degree; each point representing the frequency of infections among 1000 individuals). Predictions from the logistic regression (plotted as orange and green lines, using the same sliding window smoothing) provide an excellent fit to the data. Effect sizes (and 95% CI) for the three factors were estimated as follows: log10(degree): 2.48 (95% CI: 2.46–2.50), age: 0.0460 per year (95% CI: 0.0457–0.0464), female gender: 0.420 (95% CI: 0.413–0.428); all three effects were significant at p&lt;10
