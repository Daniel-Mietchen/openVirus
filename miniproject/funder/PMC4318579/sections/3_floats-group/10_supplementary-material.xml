  <title>Preferential depletion of highly promiscuous individuals among non-FSW females.</title>
  <p>(A) The frequency distribution of the annual number of sexual contacts (realized contact degree) in females in uninfected populations (purple dots) and in populations with high-prevalence epidemics (green squares), based on median data from 1000 simulation runs. Highly promiscuous individuals were selectively depleted in the presence of the virus. (B) Boxplot of the exponents of power-law distributions fitted to female individuals in batches of 1000 independent runs with no virus, low and high prevalence epidemics, respectively. Boxes depict interquartile range, median is indicated by horizontal lines within the boxes, and whiskers extend to the farthest values that are not more than 1.5 times the box width away from the box. Medians (and IQR) of the exponents were 3.86 (3.73–3.97), 3.99 (3.83–4.09) and 4.19 (3.99–4.32) in the absence of the virus and with low or high prevalence epidemics, respectively; all pairwise comparisons between the three scenarios were statistically significant (p&lt;10
   <sup>–10</sup>; Wilcoxon rank sum test). Simulation parameters were set as in
