  <title>The growth of the invader strain at different values of relative advantage in the transmission rate.</title>
  <p>The relative advantage of the invader virus was varied from zero (top row) to 50% (bottom row) in the low (left column) or high (right column) prevalence scenarios. The resident strain (solid purple line) was introduced in the population at Week 1000 (to allow the network to attain steady state); the invader strain (dashed green line) was introduced in the population when the first had already reached steady-state prevalence (at Week 5000 and 7000 for the high- and low-prevalence setting, respectively). The lines show median prevalence from simulations where the invader strain did not go extinct (out of 1000 simulation runs); shading indicates the areas between the 5% and 95% quantiles. Simulation parameters were set as in
