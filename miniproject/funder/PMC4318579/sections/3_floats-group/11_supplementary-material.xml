  <title>The effect of multiple acute infections on the competition of HIV strains.</title>
  <p>The figure compares the outgrowth of an invader virus with 5% transmission rate advantage in the high (top row) and low (bottom row) prevalence settings with default superinfection dynamics (left: A, C) or with repeated peaks of acute-stage infectiousness upon superinfection (right: B, D). The resident strain (solid purple line) was introduced in the population at Week 1000 (to allow the network to attain steady state); the invader strain (dashed green line) was introduced in the population when the first strain had already attained steady-state prevalence (at Week 5000 and 7000 for the high- and low-prevalence setting, respectively). Multiple acute peaks accelerate the outgrowth of the invader strain and the decline of the resident considerably in the high prevalence scenario (A vs. B), but not in the low prevalence scenario (C vs. D), where superinfection is rare. The lines show median prevalence from simulations where the invader strain did not go extinct (out of 1000 simulation runs); shading indicates the areas between the 5% and 95% quantiles. Simulation parameters were set as in
