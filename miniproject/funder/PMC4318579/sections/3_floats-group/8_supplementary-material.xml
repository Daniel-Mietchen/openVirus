  <title>The relative contribution of acute stage transmissions over the time course of single-strain epidemics.</title>
  <p>The proportion of transmissions originating from acute-stage transmitters decreases from high levels at the beginning of the epidemics to a steady-state around 0.15 and 0.13 in the low (purple dots) and high (green dots) prevalence epidemics, respectively, over a time scale of a few decades. Proportion data were calculated by combining transmission events recorded in 1000 simulation runs, then smoothed by averaging with a sliding window of length 100 weeks. Parameters were set as in
