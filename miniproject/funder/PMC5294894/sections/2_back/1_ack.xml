  <p>Approval was obtained prior to study start from National Research Ethics Service Regional Ethics Committee North West–Preston (reference NW/14/1467). Two amendments to the protocol have been approved by the ethics committee, the first, to change the study from a pilot study into a full study and to amend an exclusion criterion, the second, to add a laboratory analysis plan for the samples collected (current protocol version 3.0, date 26th January 2016). The local study reference is RHM MED1217. Written, informed consent is obtained from each patient-participant by research staff (by research nurse, research fellow or the principal investigator) prior enrolment and randomisation. Consent is obtained to obtain and store specimens (blood and nose/throat swabs) for additional research studies from some patients.</p>
