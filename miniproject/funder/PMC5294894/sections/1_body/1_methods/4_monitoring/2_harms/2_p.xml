<p>As participants in ED are not yet hospitalised but have a reasonable likelihood of being admitted to hospital, patients enrolled in ED who are subsequently admitted to the hospital will not automatically be counted as having experienced a SAE. Participants who are already admitted to AMU are already hospitalised however, an adverse event leading to prolongation of their existing hospitalisation will be counted as an SAE.</p>
