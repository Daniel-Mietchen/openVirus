<p>Patients are identified in the AMU and ED by research staff according to eligibility criteria and once written informed consent is obtained they are immediately randomised to the intervention or control group. Those randomised to the intervention group have a nose and throat swab performed immediately by a study doctor or research nurse and this is then tested on the FilmArray machine. Results are available after approximately 1Â h and are immediately communicated to the clinical team. Clinical data is then collected retrospectively for both groups. There are no follow up visits for either group.</p>
