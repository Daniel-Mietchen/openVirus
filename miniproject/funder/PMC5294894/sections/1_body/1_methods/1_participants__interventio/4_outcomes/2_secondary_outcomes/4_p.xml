<p>In view of the deliberately broad inclusion criteria, heterogeneity of treatment effect among different clinical groups is anticipated and therefore subgroup analysis for the primary and certain key secondary outcome measures is planned based on clinical group. Results for antibiotic use (including any use, single dose, and use of less than 48Â h duration), duration of antibiotics, admission and length of hospitalisation will be assessed separately for each clinical subgroup.</p>
