<p>Every attempt will be made to recruit patients and deliver the results of POCT prior to antibiotic use however it is understood due to the usual processes of care in hospital that on some occasions antibiotics will be have been administered before POCT is performed or before results are available to clinical teams. Therefore we plan to also undertake a 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of only those patients where antibiotics were not administered prior to POCT results being available to clinicians.
