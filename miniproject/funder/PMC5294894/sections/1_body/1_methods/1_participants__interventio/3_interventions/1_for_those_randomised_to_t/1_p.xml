<p>A nose and throat swab will be taken by a member of research staff (doctor or nurse) according to standard protocols. Combined nose and throat swabs have been described as an effective approach to maximise PCR sensitivity for a large number of respiratory viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Swabs are placed directly into viral transport medium (Sigma Virocult®, MWE, UK). The sample is analysed on the FilmArray Respiratory Panel as per training delivered by the apparatus manufacturer. Test results are normally available in about an hour using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel. In the event of a run failure, the analysis run will be repeated using the same sample. The FilmArray machines are located in or near the patient-care areas (AMU and ED). The machines may be operated by a study doctor, research nurse or research technician. The results of the test will be documented in the patient’s case notes and in the event of a pathogen being detected, a doctor from the clinical team responsible for the patient will be directly informed. The participant will also be informed of the result on the same day.
