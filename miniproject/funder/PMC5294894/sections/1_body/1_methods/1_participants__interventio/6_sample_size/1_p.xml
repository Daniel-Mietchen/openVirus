<p>Sample size is based upon the primary outcome measure of proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. Previous studies have demonstrated that around 75% of patients hospitalised in the UK with acute respiratory illness are treated with antibiotics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Two small studies in hospitalised adult patients with acute respiratory illness have demonstrated reductions in the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics of around 10â€“15% in those tested for respiratory viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. To detect a reduction in antibiotic use from 75 to 65% with a power of 0.8 and significance level of 0.05, 326 patients would be required in each group. Allowing for withdrawals in up to 10% of patients we aim to recruit 360 patients to each group (720 patients in total).
