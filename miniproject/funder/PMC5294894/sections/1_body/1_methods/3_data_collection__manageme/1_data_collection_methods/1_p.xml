<p>Clinical and demographic data will be collected at the time of enrolment by research staff from patient paper case notes and electronic medical records. Outcome data will be collected retrospectively by research staff from paper case notes, electronic medical records, electronic prescribing systems, and electronic radiological and laboratory results systems. Final clinical diagnosis will be based on clinical discharge coding and discharge summaries. All source data will be entered into a standardised paper case report form. Patients withdrawn from the study will have no further data collected. Missing data was minimal in the pilot study and is not expected to be a significant issue; the use of multiple imputation will be considered should missing data exceed 10% in the primary outcome.</p>
