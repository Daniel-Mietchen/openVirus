<p>This will be performed by a dedicated medical statistician from the University of Southampton independent from the study team. Patients tested with the rapid diagnostic test will be compared with patients treated by routine clinical care using standard descriptive and comparative statistical methods using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc; La Jolla, California) and SPSS (SPSS, Inc; Chicago, Illinois). Summaries of all baseline characteristics will be presented using means and standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges, or frequencies and percentages, as appropriate. Analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat and will compare the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics using the chi-square test for equality of proportions between groups. The effect of group (intervention or control) on the primary outcome will be further assessed using logistic regression to control for demographics (age, sex) and other co-variables. For secondary outcomes the intervention and control groups will be compared using chi-square tests for equality of proportions for binary data (including proportions) and using t-tests and non-parametric equivalent tests for continuous data (e.g. turnaround time) as appropriate.</p>
