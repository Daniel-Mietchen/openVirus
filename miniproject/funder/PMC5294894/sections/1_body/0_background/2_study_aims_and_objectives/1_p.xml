<p>This study aims to prospectively evaluate whether use of a molecular point-of-care diagnostic test will improve clinical outcomes compared to routine clinical care, in adult patients presenting to the secondary care with acute respiratory illness. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of POCT on antibiotic use. The secondary objectives include evaluating the impact of POCT on influenza antiviral use, side room facility use, duration of hospitalisation and the turnaround time of results compared with standard laboratory based PCR.</p>
