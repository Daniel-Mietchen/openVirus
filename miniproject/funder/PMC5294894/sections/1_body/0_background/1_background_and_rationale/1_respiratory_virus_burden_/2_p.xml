<p>The rate of hospitalisation in adults with influenza has been estimated at 5 to 20 per 100,000 overall [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and may be as high as 1,200 per 100,000 in those over 85 years old [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hospitalisation and death result from the complications of influenza including pneumonia and exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In adult patients hospitalised with laboratory confirmed influenza, 10–30% are admitted to critical care units and 3–15% die in hospital [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with outcomes being predicted by co-morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Estimates of the burden of influenza virus infection in hospitalised adults have traditionally been based on the incidence of the influenza-like-illness syndrome (ILI, defined as fever of &gt;38 °C and new respiratory symptoms) rather than on laboratory confirmed influenza. ILI has poor sensitivity (around 50%) and specificity (0–63%) for the diagnosis of influenza in hospitalised adults even during periods of peak activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Where estimates of disease burden are based on laboratory confirmed influenza, laboratory testing of patients is based on clinical suspicion of influenza and is generally targeted to patients with respiratory symptoms and fever. However, in addition to acute respiratory presentations, influenza may present as decompensated cardiovascular disease, collapse or diabetic emergencies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For this reason many hospitalised cases of influenza are likely to remain undiagnosed. A recent Canadian study estimated that only around one in 14 ED visits due to influenza virus infection were correctly attributed to influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is likely, therefore, that the burden of influenza and other respiratory viruses amongst hospitalised adults and its economic impact have been under-estimated. In addition to influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses, cause acute exacerbations of COPD and asthma as well as other acute respiratory presentations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which lead to large numbers of hospitalisations every year and significant burdens upon healthcare systems.
