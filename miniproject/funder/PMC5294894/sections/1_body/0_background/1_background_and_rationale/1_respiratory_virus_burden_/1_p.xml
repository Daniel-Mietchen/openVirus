<p>Respiratory tract infections are the second most common cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and viruses are the most frequently detected pathogens in acute respiratory illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics leading to excess hospitalisations and death mainly in the elderly and in patients with co-morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Annual seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended in at risk groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] however vaccine coverage rate is sub-optimal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and high quality evidence for significant protection in the elderly is lacking [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,
