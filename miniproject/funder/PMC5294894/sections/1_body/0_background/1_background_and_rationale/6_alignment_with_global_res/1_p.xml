<p>In addition to being focused on patient and healthcare organisation outcomes, this clinical research is strongly aligned with several global research priority initiatives including the World Health Organisationâ€™s Battle against Respiratory Viruses (BRaVe) initiative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and the global report into antibiotic resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The BRaVe initiative aims to catalyse multidisciplinary research on strategies to prevent and treat medically important respiratory virus infections with the goal of timely integration of research advances into public health practice. Priority areas identified include improving diagnostic tests for viral respiratory illness and improving the clinical management of patients with acute respiratory viral illness which are both addressed by this study.
