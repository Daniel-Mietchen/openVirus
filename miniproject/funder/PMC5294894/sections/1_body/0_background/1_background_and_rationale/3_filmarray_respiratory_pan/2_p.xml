<p>The FilmArray respiratory panel is broadly equivalent in accuracy to laboratory PCR, and use has been validated on nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, lower respiratory tract samples, and samples from immunocompromised patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Initial mediocre sensitivity for adenovirus detection has been greatly improved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. All of these studies show favourable outcomes with FilmArray system, including reliability, accuracy, ease of use and turnaround time although these studies were conducted in a laboratory rather at the point-of-care and a disproportionate number of these studies were conducted from samples from children rather than adults.
