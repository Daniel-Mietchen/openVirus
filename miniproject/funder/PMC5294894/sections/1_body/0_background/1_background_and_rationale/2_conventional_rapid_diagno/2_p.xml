<p>The current gold standard diagnostic test for respiratory viruses is laboratory performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is highly sensitive and specific but has turnaround times of at least 24Â h and requires specialist laboratory facilities and expertise [

These molecular platforms are comparable in accuracy to laboratory PCR, without the need for specialist laboratory support and expertise, and can potentially be used as a point-of-care test (POCT), but the evidence for molecular POCT improving patient outcomes is weak.
