<p>Rapid diagnostic tests for influenza, and other respiratory viruses, based on antigen detection in nasal samples have been available for many years but have been diagnostically inaccurate in adults, where sensitivity is around 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The poor sensitivity of these antigen-based tests limits their clinical utility and their use has not been associated with a reduction in antibiotic prescribing in adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
