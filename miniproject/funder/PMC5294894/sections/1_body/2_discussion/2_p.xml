<p>This study has the potential to improve patient care by changing practice and contribute to a health economic analysis. The outcome measures are clinically important to a large number of patients, and also crucial in antimicrobial stewardship and healthcare resource management. As a randomised controlled trial, this study will provide high-quality evidence for the potential use of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in hospitalised adults. Beyond this trial, molecular point-of-care testing for common pathogens in select populations, such as in intensive care, or other common illness presentations, such as gastroenteritis, needs to be evaluated to further improve patient care and effectively manage healthcare resources.</p>
