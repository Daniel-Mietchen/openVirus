Following community sensitisation and PrEP education, we did HIV testing and offered PrEP at health fairs and facilities in 16 rural communities in western Kenya, eastern Uganda, and western Uganda. We provided enhanced PrEP counselling to individuals 15 years and older who were assessed as having an elevated HIV risk on the basis of serodifferent partnership or empirical risk score, or who otherwise self-identified as being at high risk but were not in serodifferent partnerships or identified by the risk score. PrEP follow-up visits were done at facilities, homes, or community locations. We assessed PrEP uptake within 90 days of HIV testing, programme engagement (follow-up visit attendance at week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter), refills, self-reported adherence up to 72 weeks, and concentrations of tenofovir in hair samples from individuals reporting HIV risk and adherence during follow-up, and analysed factors associated with uptake and adherence.

Of these individuals, 69&#x02008;121 tested HIV-negative, 12&#x02008;935 of whom had elevated HIV risk (1353 [10%] serodifferent partnership, 6938 [54%] risk score, 4644 [36%] otherwise self-identified risk). 3489 (27%) initiated PrEP, 2865 (82%) of whom did so on the same day as HIV testing and 1733 (50%) of whom were men. PrEP uptake was lower among individuals aged 15&#x02013;24 years (adjusted odds ratio 0&#x000b7;55, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;45&#x02013;0&#x000b7;68) and mobile individuals (0&#x000b7;61, 0&#x000b7;41&#x02013;0&#x000b7;91). At week 4, among 3466 individuals who initiated PrEP and did not withdraw or die before the first visit, 2215 (64%) were engaged in the programme, 1701 (49%) received medication refills, and 1388 (40%) self-reported adherence. At week 72, 1832 (56%) of 3274 were engaged, 1070 (33%) received a refill, and 900 (27%) self-reported adherence. Among participants reporting HIV risk at weeks 4&#x02013;72, refills (89&#x02013;93%) and self-reported adherence (70&#x02013;76%) were high. Among sampled participants self-reporting adherence at week 24, the proportion with tenofovir concentrations in the hair reflecting at least four doses taken per week was 66%, and reflecting seven doses per week was 44%. Participants who stopped PrEP accepted HIV testing at 4274 (83%) of 5140 subsequent visits; half of these participants later restarted PrEP. 29 participants of 3489 who initiated PrEP had serious adverse events, including seven deaths. Five adverse events (all grade 3) were assessed as being possibly related to the study drug.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>During population-level HIV testing, inclusive risk assessment (combining serodifferent partnership, an empirical risk score, and self-identification of HIV risk) was feasible and identified individuals who could benefit from PrEP. The biggest gap in the PrEP cascade was PrEP uptake, particularly for young and mobile individuals. Participants who initiated PrEP and had perceived HIV risk during follow-up reported taking PrEP, but one-third had drug concentrations consistent with poor adherence, highlighting the need for novel approaches and long-acting formulations as PrEP roll-out expands.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>National Institutes of Health, President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation, and Gilead Sciences</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="para10"><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p id="para20"><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p id="para30">Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective and roll-out is expanding worldwide, including across sub-Saharan Africa. In generalised epidemic settings, strategies are needed to identify and engage individuals who might benefit from HIV prevention services, including PrEP. We searched PubMed using the terms &#x0201c;HIV&#x0201d; and (&#x0201c;pre-exposure prophylaxis&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;preexposure prophylaxis&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;PrEP&#x0201d;) and (&#x0201c;Africa&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;Kenya&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;Uganda&#x0201d;) between Jan 1, 2010, and Aug 7, 2019. We did not use any language restrictions. We also examined abstracts from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (2015&#x02013;19), the International AIDS Conference/IAS Conference on HIV Science (2015&#x02013;19), and HIV Research for Prevention (2016 and 2018). We excluded studies on cost-effectiveness, modelling, or PrEP acceptability without uptake data. We reviewed national guidelines on PrEP and programme outcomes, where reported, from Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa from 2016 to 2019. Most research studies reported on PrEP uptake among specific populations at risk for HIV, such as serodifferent couples, young women, female sex workers, and men who have sex with men. These studies resulted in a wide range of estimates of PrEP uptake from individuals attending health facilities or after community-based recruitment of specific groups. National guidelines now allow for PrEP eligibility beyond members of key populations, but programmes have often reported PrEP initiation and follow-up visits within specific subpopulations at risk of HIV. No previous studies evaluated PrEP uptake or cascade outcomes at a population level in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p id="para40"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para50">To our knowledge, this study is the first examination of a population-based strategy of universal PrEP access in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of community-wide HIV testing. Our testing approach enabled us to estimate the proportion of the entire population at elevated risk for HIV and thereby establish a denominator for calculations of PrEP uptake (rather than estimating uptake after clinic-based recruitment). A novel feature of our approach was the use of three methods to inclusively evaluate HIV risk and provide enhanced counselling on PrEP: serodifferent partnerships, self-identified risk, and real-time risk assessment using a machine learning-based score. We noted a particular gap in the PrEP cascade in terms of uptake: only one-quarter of the individuals assessed as being at elevated risk initiated PrEP within 90 days, with even lower uptake among young adults and mobile individuals. We also found lower uptake among serodifferent partners identified at a population level compared with previous studies of clinic-recruited, mutually disclosed couples. PrEP was delivered using a flexible model with options for out-of-facility PrEP visits: in this context, three-quarters of individuals who initiated PrEP attended at least one follow-up visit and more than half remained engaged in the PrEP programme at 72 weeks. However, a second notable gap in the cascade was in PrEP adherence. One-third of participants reporting HIV risk and adherence during follow-up had concentrations of tenofovir in the hair that were consistent with poor adherence (fewer than four PrEP doses per week), with even lower levels of adherence at week 4 among women and young adults.</p><p id="para60"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para70">Comprehensive HIV testing and universal access to PrEP for all individuals without HIV who are at elevated risk is one approach to offering PrEP to people who might not otherwise engage in health systems and to assessing PrEP engagement at a population level. As PrEP roll-out expands in generalised epidemic settings, our study provides insights into real-world implementation gaps in the PrEP cascade and suggests that further interventions are needed to maximise uptake and adherence, particularly among young adults and mobile populations. Novel strategies are needed to foster sustained engagement and adherence to oral PrEP and future long-acting formulations.</p></boxed-text></p><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para80">Despite remarkable progress in scaling up HIV testing and treatment worldwide, 1&#x000b7;7 million new HIV infections occurred in 2018, signalling what UNAIDS has termed a prevention crisis.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and has the potential to accelerate reductions in HIV incidence as part of combination approaches to HIV prevention.

Study staff disseminated information on PrEP at local events and meetings, including with political and religious leaders; health workers; patients with HIV; adolescents and young adults; parents; and fishing, bar, and transport workers (occupations associated with higher HIV prevalence or transactional sex).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p id="para140">Community members received basic group-based education on PrEP upon arrival at health fairs, then attended stations for collection of sociodemographic information, HIV testing, and post-test counselling. During post-test counselling, we offered enhanced individual PrEP counselling to people who tested negative for HIV and had an elevated risk of HIV acquisition: individuals in serodifferent partnerships; individuals classified as being at risk on the basis of an empirical HIV risk-prediction algorithm (risk score); or individuals who were neither in serodifferent partnerships nor identified by risk score, but who otherwise self-identified as being at risk. Serodifferent partnerships were self-identified male&#x02013;female spouses of differing HIV status or individuals who self-reported having a partner with HIV. As previously described,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the risk score was developed by applying ensemble machine learning to HIV seroconversion and sociodemographic data from the first 2 years of the SEARCH test-and-treat trial<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>). Data on sexual behaviour were not previously collected and were therefore not available for risk-score development. Among individuals not known to be in serodifferent partnerships, the score analysed region and sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, polygamy, education, occupation, alcohol consumption, and circumcision) entered in real-time into tablet computers at health fairs before the HIV-testing station. Health-fair staff recorded a dichotomous output (at risk or not at risk) on a paper card for the participant to give to the HIV post-test counsellor.</p><p id="para150">Post-test counsellors discussed individuals' potential HIV risk (eg, knowledge of partner status, concurrent partnerships, condom use, circumcision). Individuals assessed to be at an elevated HIV risk (based on serodifferent partnership, risk score, or otherwise self-identified risk) received enhanced counselling on PrEP, including information on who might benefit, how PrEP is taken, and potential adverse effects. We offered same-day or rapid PrEP initiation through SEARCH at local government HIV clinics (with one-time, study-provided transport). In 14 of 16 communities, on-site PrEP start was also offered at SEARCH health fairs. For individuals who received home-based testing, one study staff member did all of the described steps, including provision of information about PrEP, risk-score assessment, HIV tesing and post-test counselling, and offer of PrEP through local clinics (but not on-site at home).</p><p id="para160">During population-level testing, we measured HIV-1 RNA among individuals with HIV. We assessed viral suppression (&#x02264;500 RNA copies per mL) among linked HIV-positive spouses in serodifferent partnerships, but real-time results were not available for PrEP counselling. After population-level testing, we offered ongoing PrEP initiation through SEARCH at local clinics, where we did intensive outreach. Patients with HIV were asked to bring their partners who were HIV-negative or with unknown HIV status to the clinic for HIV testing and the offer of PrEP initiation.</p><p id="para170">PrEP eligibility criteria included negative HIV testing within 4 weeks, no known hepatitis B infection, and no acute HIV symptoms. Baseline creatinine testing was done but PrEP was provided at enrolment before the receipt of laboratory results. After providing written informed consent, participants were given tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) co-formulated with emtricitabine (200 mg) or lamivudine (150 mg). Follow-up visits were scheduled at week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter for up to 144 weeks. We provided a supportive delivery system with options for visits at clinic, home, or community locations of the participants' choice (eg, homes, near schools, trading centres, beaches). Visit procedures included evaluation of adverse events, self-assessed HIV risk (&#x0201c;are you currently at risk for HIV?&#x0201d;), HIV antibody testing, and PrEP refill, plus creatinine testing at week 12, week 24, and every 24 weeks thereafter. Participants who stopped PrEP were offered HIV testing and the opportunity to restart PrEP at each visit.

More than 12&#x02008;000 individuals were assessed to be at elevated risk of HIV, of whom nearly 3500 initiated PrEP within 90 days of population-level HIV testing. The greatest gap in the PrEP cascade was initial uptake, with only 27% starting PrEP; adolescents, young adults, and mobile individuals had the lowest uptake. Programme engagement up to 72 weeks was high (56%) among individuals who initiated PrEP, with 78% of these individuals having at least one follow-up visit and most engaging in visits for HIV testing. Receipt of PrEP refills and self-reported adherence were much higher among participants who perceived themselves to be at ongoing risk at follow-up visits. However, one-third of participants who self-reported adherence had drug concentrations that indicated low adherence.</p><p id="para330">We posited that universal access to PrEP and inclusive risk assessment could provide an opportunity for PrEP initiation for individuals who might not otherwise engage with health systems.

Although we have no comparator for other population-level approaches, only one-quarter of individuals assessed as at elevated HIV risk initiated PrEP within 90 days. Our study rapidly introduced PrEP in communities before national roll-out in Kenya and Uganda, and the novelty of PrEP might have mitigated against higher uptake. We have previously reported on barriers to PrEP uptake in study communities, including myths and misconceptions about this new drug, unsupportive partners, daily pill-taking, fear of side-effects, and anticipated stigma,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> similar to previous studies.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> We have also found that distance to clinic is a barrier to PrEP uptake and engagement.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Moreover, because an individual's HIV risk is potentially dynamic,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> some individuals assessed as being at elevated HIV risk at screening might not have had current sexual risk factors or partners at the time of PrEP screening.

A barrier for adolescents and young adults in our study was that these individuals were more likely to be mobile than older people. In our qualitative work, adolescents and young adults who initiated PrEP were motivated by high perceived HIV risk and beliefs that PrEP use supported pursuing life goals, but some wanted &#x0201c;proof&#x0201d;<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> of PrEP efficacy.

We did intensive outreach to serodifferent couples during population-level testing and at clinics, where couples' counselling was routinely offered, but some partners were not residing in or in care within the study communities. We also found that, overall, 80% of spouses with HIV were virally suppressed and 70% were in serodifferent partnerships for at least 3 years. These factors could have reduced the perceived need for couples to initiate PrEP. Finally, we observed sex differences in PrEP uptake among individuals without HIV in serodifferent partnerships: 49% of women and 39% of men initiated PrEP. This difference could have been related to the interest of women in discreet, female-controlled HIV prevention, or to barriers to disclosure among women with HIV. As ART and viral-load monitoring are scaled up, counselling messages for serodifferent partners<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> should be tailored on the basis of the durability of viral suppression and barriers to ART adherence for the partner who has HIV, and whether the partner without HIV infection has concurrent partners who might be viraemic or of unknown HIV status.</p><p id="para370">Among participants in our study who initiated PrEP, engagement at follow-up visits was among the highest reported to date in Kenya and Uganda in studies not solely enrolling serodifferent couples.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Three-quarters of individuals who initiated PrEP were seen at least once during follow-up, and more than half remained engaged in the PrEP programme up to 72 weeks.

We did find higher adherence among young women sampled at week 24, but only slightly more than half had tenofovir concentrations consistent with taking at least four doses per week. Given that many participants had breaks in PrEP use, concentrations of tenofovir in hair could have underestimated adherence among individuals restarting PrEP in the preceding 30 days.

We found that real-time entry of demographic data and score assessment at the point-of-contact during community-based HIV testing was feasible. In generalised epidemic settings, machine learning-based scores have shown the potential to improve the efficiency of identifying individuals for enhanced prevention compared with model-based scores or targeting traditional risk groups.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Further research is needed on optimal approaches for implementing risk scores (and results counselling), and comparing risk scores to risk self-assessment and guidelines-based eligibility. Importantly, our risk score was not used to exclude individuals from PrEP eligibility but to foster conversations about PrEP.

As ART coverage and viral suppression increase, achieving epidemic control will require intensified HIV prevention for individuals who remain at risk. Questions remain, however, about the impact and cost-effectiveness of population-level PrEP roll-out, and the levels of uptake and adherence needed to reduce HIV incidence.</p><p id="para410">This study has several limitations. During the population-level testing window, 17% of community members did not have HIV testing or a risk assessment. The risk score did not include questions about sexual behaviour, sex work, or same-sex partnerships, although we also allowed for risk self-identification. Future research should evaluate whether sexual behaviour data improve risk score performance (and optimal methods to facilitate disclosure and discussions on sexual health). Additionally, written consent was required to initiate PrEP, which might limit generalisability to settings now offering PrEP within routine care.</p><p id="para420">Rapid introduction of universal PrEP access during population-level HIV testing resulted in nearly 3500 PrEP starts within 90 days in rural Kenya and Uganda. We found that a substantial proportion of the population want PrEP and can take it, including many who would not have otherwise had access to PrEP without inclusive eligibility. As PrEP roll-out accelerates, our study provides insights into gaps in the PrEP cascade that can be addressed to optimise the impact of this powerful prevention tool. Combination approaches to HIV prevention (including oral PrEP and, ultimately, on-demand and long-acting methods) that are inclusive and offer flexible delivery, hold promise to ultimately reduce HIV incidence in generalised epidemic settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="cesec90"><title>Data sharing</title><p>A complete de-identified patient dataset sufficient to reproduce the study findings will be made available approximately 1 year after completion of the ongoing trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT01864603" id="interrefs50">NCT01864603</ext-link>), following approval of a concept sheet summarising the analyses to be done.
