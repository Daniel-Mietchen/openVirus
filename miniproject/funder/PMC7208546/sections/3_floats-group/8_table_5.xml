   <p>Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, and causes of death are listed in the 
    <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 7)</xref>. Adverse events possibly related to the study drug were creatinine elevation (n=1), dizziness (n=2), fatigue (n=1), and headache (n=1). All other grade 3 or 4 adverse events were judged to be unlikely (n=2) or not related to the study drug. One serious adverse event was judged to be possibly related to the study drug: a 71-year-old man was treated in hospital for urinary retention and found to have bilateral hydronephrosis and grade 3 creatinine elevation. Creatinine returned to baseline following relief of urinary obstruction and cessation of the study drug.
