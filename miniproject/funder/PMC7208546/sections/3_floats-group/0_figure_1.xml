  <p>PrEP uptake after population-level HIV testing in 16 communities in rural Kenya and Uganda</p>
  <p>PrEP=pre-exposure prophylaxis. SEARCH=Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health. *Empirical risk score developed on the basis of applying ensemble supervised machine learning methods to HIV seroconversion data from the first 2 years of the SEARCH test-and-treat trial, with a threshold selected to correctly classify 50% of seroconversions as at elevated risk across the three regions and minimise the number of individuals classified as at risk. Variables: age, sex, marital status, polygamy, education, occupation, alcohol, and circumcision. †Individuals neither in serodifferent partnerships nor identified by the risk score could self-identify as at risk of HIV acquisition. ‡82% initiated PrEP on the same day as seen during population-level HIV testing.</p>
