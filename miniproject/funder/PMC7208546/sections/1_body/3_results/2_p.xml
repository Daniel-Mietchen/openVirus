<p id="para240">We measured PrEP uptake among the 12 935 people testing negative for HIV who were assessed to be at elevated HIV risk: 3489 (27%) initiated PrEP within 90 days of population-level testing; 2865 (82%) of whom started PrEP on the same day as testing. Among individuals who initiated PrEP, 1733 (50%) were men, 2175 (62%) were younger than 35 years, and 3395 (97%) were tested at health fairs rather than at home (

Among individuals who were assessed to be at elevated HIV risk, 446 (19%) of 2376 adolescent girls and young women aged 15–24 years, 1226 (17%) of the 7256 individuals identified by risk score, and 3374 (45%) of 7581 individuals with self-identified HIV risk initiated PrEP (

Of 1353 serodifferent partners, 603 (45%) initiated PrEP (235 [39%] of 603 men; 368 [49%] of 750 women); 192 (26%) of 750 who did not initially start PrEP started after 90 days. Of 1014 HIV-negative residents linked to a serodifferent spouse, 729 (72%) were in a partnership for at least 3 years with a spouse living with HIV. Among 811 spouses living with HIV with HIV-RNA measured during population-level testing, 246 (82%) of 299 spouses of individuals who initiated PrEP had viral suppression (≤500 copies per mL) compared with 410 (80%) of 512 spouses of participants who had not initiated PrEP. Among individuals who initiated PrEP and were linked to a serodifferent spouse, 238 (68%) of 351 (165 [71%] of 231 women; 73 [61%] of 120 men) reported a serodifferent partnership at PrEP enrolment, suggesting that disclosure of HIV status might have occurred.
