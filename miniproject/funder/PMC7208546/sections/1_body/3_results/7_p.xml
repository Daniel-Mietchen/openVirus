<p id="para290">We analysed concentrations of tenofovir in hair samples from a sample of individuals who initiated PrEP and who reported current risk and any adherence. After accounting for sampling weights for 120 participants with tenofovir concentrations measured at week 4, 57% (95% CI 47 –67) had tenofovir concentrations consistent with taking at least four PrEP doses per week; 40% (31–51) had tenofovir concentrations consistent with taking seven PrEP doses per week (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). Adherence of at least four doses per week was highest among men aged 25 years and older (77%, 58–90) and lowest among young women aged 15–24 years (27%, 12–46). Participants sampled at week 24 had concentrations of tenofovir in hair samples consistent with similar or higher numbers of doses taken per week compared with those sampled at week 4, both overall and in most subgroups, including young women. After accounting for sampling weights for 116 participants with concentrations of tenofovir in hair samples measured at week 24, 66% (55–76) had tenofovir concentrations consistent with taking at least four doses per week, and 44% (33–55) had tenofovir concentrations consistent with taking seven doses per week. However, one-third (34%, 24–45) of individuals who initiated PrEP had drug concentrations that suggest poor adherence (fewer than four doses per week). Among individuals who initiated PrEP and reported risk at week 4, female sex and being aged 15–24 years were associated with lower odds of having concentrations of tenofovir consistent with seven doses per week; serodifferent partnership was associated with the greatest odds (
