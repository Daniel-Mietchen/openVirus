<p id="para250">We analysed predictors of PrEP uptake among 12 850 individuals assessed to have elevated HIV risk with complete covariate data (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The adjusted odds of PrEP uptake were significantly higher among individuals in serodifferent partnerships, polygamous marriages, or who were divorced, separated, or widowed, and were significantly lower among participants aged 15–24 years and 25–34 years, and among mobile individuals (mobility was defined as migration out of the community for at least 1 month, or moving residence within the past 12 months). In analyses stratified by sex, non-single marital status was associated with PrEP uptake for both men and women (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Among women, the adjusted odds of PrEP uptake were significantly lower for individuals with fishing, bar, or transport work, alcohol consumption, or mobility, and were higher among serodifferent partners.
