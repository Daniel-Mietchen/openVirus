<p id="para260">We measured PrEP programme engagement, refills, and adherence up to June 20, 2019, among 3466 individuals (excludes participants who were withdrawn or died before the first visit) who had initiated PrEP; 2693 (78%) of 3466 attended at least one follow-up visit. At week 4, 2215 (64%) individuals who initiated PrEP were engaged in the PrEP programme; 1701 (49%) received PrEP refills; and 1388 (40%) self-reported adherence to PrEP (at least one dose of the past three), of whom 1268 (91%) reported that all of the past three doses were taken (

At week 72, 1832 (56%) of 3274 were engaged, 1070 (33%) received a refill, and 900 (27%) self-reported adherence. Over time, more follow-up visits occurred at home and community sites (

In multivariable analyses of factors associated with self-reported PrEP adherence at week 24, self-assessed current HIV risk was associated with the greatest odds of adherence; serodifferent partnership, or being divorced, separated, or widowed were positively associated with adherence; and being aged 15â€“24 years was negatively associated with adherence (
