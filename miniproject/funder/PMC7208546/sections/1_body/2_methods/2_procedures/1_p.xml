 </xref> We held health fairs at multiple locations across each community over 2 weeks, followed by home-based testing for non-attendees. 1 month before testing events, we conducted community mobilisation and sensitisation on PrEP in collaboration with health officials and government leaders. Study staff disseminated information on PrEP at local events and meetings, including with political and religious leaders; health workers; patients with HIV; adolescents and young adults; parents; and fishing, bar, and transport workers (occupations associated with higher HIV prevalence or transactional sex).
