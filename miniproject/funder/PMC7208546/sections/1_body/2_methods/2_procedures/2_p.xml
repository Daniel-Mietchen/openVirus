<p id="para140">Community members received basic group-based education on PrEP upon arrival at health fairs, then attended stations for collection of sociodemographic information, HIV testing, and post-test counselling. During post-test counselling, we offered enhanced individual PrEP counselling to people who tested negative for HIV and had an elevated risk of HIV acquisition: individuals in serodifferent partnerships; individuals classified as being at risk on the basis of an empirical HIV risk-prediction algorithm (risk score); or individuals who were neither in serodifferent partnerships nor identified by risk score, but who otherwise self-identified as being at risk. Serodifferent partnerships were self-identified maleâ€“female spouses of differing HIV status or individuals who self-reported having a partner with HIV. As previously described,

Among individuals not known to be in serodifferent partnerships, the score analysed region and sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status, polygamy, education, occupation, alcohol consumption, and circumcision) entered in real-time into tablet computers at health fairs before the HIV-testing station. Health-fair staff recorded a dichotomous output (at risk or not at risk) on a paper card for the participant to give to the HIV post-test counsellor.
