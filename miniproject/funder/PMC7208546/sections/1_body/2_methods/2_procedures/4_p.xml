<p id="para160">During population-level testing, we measured HIV-1 RNA among individuals with HIV. We assessed viral suppression (â‰¤500 RNA copies per mL) among linked HIV-positive spouses in serodifferent partnerships, but real-time results were not available for PrEP counselling. After population-level testing, we offered ongoing PrEP initiation through SEARCH at local clinics, where we did intensive outreach. Patients with HIV were asked to bring their partners who were HIV-negative or with unknown HIV status to the clinic for HIV testing and the offer of PrEP initiation.</p>
