<p id="para170">PrEP eligibility criteria included negative HIV testing within 4 weeks, no known hepatitis B infection, and no acute HIV symptoms. Baseline creatinine testing was done but PrEP was provided at enrolment before the receipt of laboratory results. After providing written informed consent, participants were given tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) co-formulated with emtricitabine (200 mg) or lamivudine (150 mg). Follow-up visits were scheduled at week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter for up to 144 weeks. We provided a supportive delivery system with options for visits at clinic, home, or community locations of the participants' choice (eg, homes, near schools, trading centres, beaches). Visit procedures included evaluation of adverse events, self-assessed HIV risk (“are you currently at risk for HIV?”), HIV antibody testing, and PrEP refill, plus creatinine testing at week 12, week 24, and every 24 weeks thereafter. Participants who stopped PrEP were offered HIV testing and the opportunity to restart PrEP at each visit. Study drug and procedures were offered at no cost to the participants; no incentives were provided.</p>
