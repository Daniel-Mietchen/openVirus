Given the limitations of self-reporting (eg, recall and social desirability biases, white-coat dosing) among participants reporting any adherence to PrEP (at least one dose of the past three), we collected small hair samples (around 50â€“100 strands) at each visit (week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks thereafter) for adherence measurement via analysis of concentrations of tenofovir. We analysed tenofovir concentrations in hair among a random sample of participants who self-reported PrEP adherence and HIV risk at week 4, and in a random sample of participants who self-reported adherence and risk at week 24; sampling was stratified by age, sex, serodifferent partnership, and occupation (fishing, bar, or transport). 1 cm of hair closest to the scalp (reflecting the most recent 4 weeks of drug exposure) was analysed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using validated methods.
