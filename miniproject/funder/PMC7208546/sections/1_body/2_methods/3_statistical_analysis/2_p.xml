<p id="para200">At each follow-up visit, we assessed the proportion of individuals who (1) received PrEP medication refills and (2) self-reported adherence to PrEP (at least one dose of the past three scheduled doses, assuming the participants who were not seen were non-adherent), both among all individuals who initiated PrEP and among individuals reporting current HIV risk. We also assessed adherence on the basis of tenofovir concentrations in hair from a sample of individuals to estimate the number of PrEP doses taken per week.
