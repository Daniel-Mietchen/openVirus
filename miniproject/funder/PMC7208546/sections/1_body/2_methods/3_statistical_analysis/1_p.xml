<p id="para190">We calculated the following at the different steps of the PrEP cascade: (1) among all residents without HIV seen during population-level HIV testing, the proportion at elevated HIV risk (based on mutually exclusive categories, defined by serodifferent partnership, risk score without serodifferent partnership, or otherwise self-identified risk); (2) among individuals at elevated risk, the proportion with PrEP uptake, defined as initiation (receipt of pills) within 90 days of HIV testing during population-level testing; (3) among individuals who initiated PrEP within 90 days, programme engagement up to 72 weeks. Programme engagement was defined as follow-up visit attendance during periods defined on the basis of the date of PrEP enrolment: week 4 (–14/+28 days); week 12 (–27/+42 days); and weeks 24–72 (–41/+42 days). We censored at death or study withdrawal.</p>
