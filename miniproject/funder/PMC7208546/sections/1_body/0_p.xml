  <p id="para30">Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective and roll-out is expanding worldwide, including across sub-Saharan Africa. In generalised epidemic settings, strategies are needed to identify and engage individuals who might benefit from HIV prevention services, including PrEP. We searched PubMed using the terms “HIV” and (“pre-exposure prophylaxis”, or “preexposure prophylaxis”, or “PrEP”) and (“Africa”, or “Kenya”, or “Uganda”) between Jan 1, 2010, and Aug 7, 2019. We did not use any language restrictions. We also examined abstracts from the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (2015–19), the International AIDS Conference/IAS Conference on HIV Science (2015–19), and HIV Research for Prevention (2016 and 2018). We excluded studies on cost-effectiveness, modelling, or PrEP acceptability without uptake data. We reviewed national guidelines on PrEP and programme outcomes, where reported, from Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa from 2016 to 2019. Most research studies reported on PrEP uptake among specific populations at risk for HIV, such as serodifferent couples, young women, female sex workers, and men who have sex with men. These studies resulted in a wide range of estimates of PrEP uptake from individuals attending health facilities or after community-based recruitment of specific groups. National guidelines now allow for PrEP eligibility beyond members of key populations, but programmes have often reported PrEP initiation and follow-up visits within specific subpopulations at risk of HIV. No previous studies evaluated PrEP uptake or cascade outcomes at a population level in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

  <p id="para50">To our knowledge, this study is the first examination of a population-based strategy of universal PrEP access in sub-Saharan Africa in the context of community-wide HIV testing. Our testing approach enabled us to estimate the proportion of the entire population at elevated risk for HIV and thereby establish a denominator for calculations of PrEP uptake (rather than estimating uptake after clinic-based recruitment). A novel feature of our approach was the use of three methods to inclusively evaluate HIV risk and provide enhanced counselling on PrEP: serodifferent partnerships, self-identified risk, and real-time risk assessment using a machine learning-based score. We noted a particular gap in the PrEP cascade in terms of uptake: only one-quarter of the individuals assessed as being at elevated risk initiated PrEP within 90 days, with even lower uptake among young adults and mobile individuals. We also found lower uptake among serodifferent partners identified at a population level compared with previous studies of clinic-recruited, mutually disclosed couples. PrEP was delivered using a flexible model with options for out-of-facility PrEP visits: in this context, three-quarters of individuals who initiated PrEP attended at least one follow-up visit and more than half remained engaged in the PrEP programme at 72 weeks. However, a second notable gap in the cascade was in PrEP adherence. One-third of participants reporting HIV risk and adherence during follow-up had concentrations of tenofovir in the hair that were consistent with poor adherence (fewer than four PrEP doses per week), with even lower levels of adherence at week 4 among women and young adults.</p>

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para70">Comprehensive HIV testing and universal access to PrEP for all individuals without HIV who are at elevated risk is one approach to offering PrEP to people who might not otherwise engage in health systems and to assessing PrEP engagement at a population level. As PrEP roll-out expands in generalised epidemic settings, our study provides insights into real-world implementation gaps in the PrEP cascade and suggests that further interventions are needed to maximise uptake and adherence, particularly among young adults and mobile populations. Novel strategies are needed to foster sustained engagement and adherence to oral PrEP and future long-acting formulations.</p>
