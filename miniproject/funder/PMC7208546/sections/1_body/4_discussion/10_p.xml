<p id="para410">This study has several limitations. During the population-level testing window, 17% of community members did not have HIV testing or a risk assessment. The risk score did not include questions about sexual behaviour, sex work, or same-sex partnerships, although we also allowed for risk self-identification. Future research should evaluate whether sexual behaviour data improve risk score performance (and optimal methods to facilitate disclosure and discussions on sexual health). Additionally, written consent was required to initiate PrEP, which might limit generalisability to settings now offering PrEP within routine care.</p>
