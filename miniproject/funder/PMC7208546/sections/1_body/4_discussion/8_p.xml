<p id="para390">To our knowledge, this study is the first in sub-Saharan Africa to implement a machine learning-based risk score to identify individuals for PrEP initiation. We found that real-time entry of demographic data and score assessment at the point-of-contact during community-based HIV testing was feasible. In generalised epidemic settings, machine learning-based scores have shown the potential to improve the efficiency of identifying individuals for enhanced prevention compared with model-based scores or targeting traditional risk groups.

 </xref> Further research is needed on optimal approaches for implementing risk scores (and results counselling), and comparing risk scores to risk self-assessment and guidelines-based eligibility. Importantly, our risk score was not used to exclude individuals from PrEP eligibility but to foster conversations about PrEP. Individuals not identified by risk score who self-identified as being at risk (regardless of serodiscordance or risk score) could access PrEP, in line with WHO guidance to offer PrEP to those requesting it.
