<p id="para380">Although at least 70% of individuals reporting current HIV risk at each follow-up visit self-reported adherence to PrEP, concentrations of tenofovir in hair samples showed poor adherence (fewer than four doses per week) in one-third of those individuals. Of particular concern is that women and participants younger than 25 years had lower odds of having tenofovir concentrations consistent with daily dosing (which might be required for protection from vaginal exposure to HIV)

 </xref> at week 4. We did find higher adherence among young women sampled at week 24, but only slightly more than half had tenofovir concentrations consistent with taking at least four doses per week. Given that many participants had breaks in PrEP use, concentrations of tenofovir in hair could have underestimated adherence among individuals restarting PrEP in the preceding 30 days. Although data on cumulative tenofovir concentrations are limited in eastern Africa, studies among young women in southern Africa
