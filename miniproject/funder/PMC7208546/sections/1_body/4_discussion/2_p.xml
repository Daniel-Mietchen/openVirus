<p id="para330">We posited that universal access to PrEP and inclusive risk assessment could provide an opportunity for PrEP initiation for individuals who might not otherwise engage with health systems. Moreover, given concerns that targeting PrEP towards specific risk groups could stigmatise use,

Although we have no comparator for other population-level approaches, only one-quarter of individuals assessed as at elevated HIV risk initiated PrEP within 90 days. Our study rapidly introduced PrEP in communities before national roll-out in Kenya and Uganda, and the novelty of PrEP might have mitigated against higher uptake. We have previously reported on barriers to PrEP uptake in study communities, including myths and misconceptions about this new drug, unsupportive partners, daily pill-taking, fear of side-effects, and anticipated stigma,

Finally, although we offered universal PrEP access, our approach focused on risk assessment. Wellness framing of PrEP (as fostering protection and sexual health and wellbeing) might be more successful than risk framing
