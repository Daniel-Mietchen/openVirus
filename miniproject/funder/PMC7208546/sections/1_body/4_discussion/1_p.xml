<p id="para320">During HIV testing of more than 70 000 individuals across three regions of rural Kenya and Uganda, we evaluated a population-based approach to engage people in PrEP that included community sensitisation, group-based education, individual counselling, real-time risk-score assessment, and universal PrEP access with flexibility in refill location. More than 12 000 individuals were assessed to be at elevated risk of HIV, of whom nearly 3500 initiated PrEP within 90 days of population-level HIV testing. The greatest gap in the PrEP cascade was initial uptake, with only 27% starting PrEP; adolescents, young adults, and mobile individuals had the lowest uptake. Programme engagement up to 72 weeks was high (56%) among individuals who initiated PrEP, with 78% of these individuals having at least one follow-up visit and most engaging in visits for HIV testing. Receipt of PrEP refills and self-reported adherence were much higher among participants who perceived themselves to be at ongoing risk at follow-up visits. However, one-third of participants who self-reported adherence had drug concentrations that indicated low adherence.</p>
