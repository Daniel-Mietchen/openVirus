<p id="para420">Rapid introduction of universal PrEP access during population-level HIV testing resulted in nearly 3500 PrEP starts within 90 days in rural Kenya and Uganda. We found that a substantial proportion of the population want PrEP and can take it, including many who would not have otherwise had access to PrEP without inclusive eligibility. As PrEP roll-out accelerates, our study provides insights into gaps in the PrEP cascade that can be addressed to optimise the impact of this powerful prevention tool. Combination approaches to HIV prevention (including oral PrEP and, ultimately, on-demand and long-acting methods) that are inclusive and offer flexible delivery, hold promise to ultimately reduce HIV incidence in generalised epidemic settings.</p>
