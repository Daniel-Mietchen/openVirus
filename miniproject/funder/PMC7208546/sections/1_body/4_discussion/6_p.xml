<p id="para370">Among participants in our study who initiated PrEP, engagement at follow-up visits was among the highest reported to date in Kenya and Uganda in studies not solely enrolling serodifferent couples.

Medication refill (≥89%) and self-reported adherence (≥70%) were high among participants reporting HIV risk during follow-up, but more than half of participants who initiated PrEP reported no current HIV risk at least once, and many had breaks in PrEP use. Barriers to PrEP engagement and adherence were similar to barriers to uptake, but reasons for stopping also included changes in partnerships and risk perception.

 </xref> Among individuals who stopped PrEP, ongoing programme engagement provided opportunities for repeat HIV testing and PrEP access, and half of the participants who had stopped PrEP later restarted the drug. As prevention options expand to other modalities, such as long-acting PrEP, follow-up visits could serve as platforms for frequent HIV testing and delivery of a variety of HIV prevention options.
