<p id="para360">PrEP uptake was higher among serodifferent partners than among other groups in this study, yet fewer than half of individuals in serodifferent partnerships started PrEP within 90 days of population-level HIV testing. Our study population contrasts with previous studies that have reported high levels of PrEP initiation among mutually disclosed serodifferent couples presenting to clinics before ART eligibility or initiation.

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> We approached serodifferent partners at a population level, who might not have tested together or disclosed their HIV status. We did intensive outreach to serodifferent couples during population-level testing and at clinics, where couples' counselling was routinely offered, but some partners were not residing in or in care within the study communities. We also found that, overall, 80% of spouses with HIV were virally suppressed and 70% were in serodifferent partnerships for at least 3 years. These factors could have reduced the perceived need for couples to initiate PrEP. Finally, we observed sex differences in PrEP uptake among individuals without HIV in serodifferent partnerships: 49% of women and 39% of men initiated PrEP. This difference could have been related to the interest of women in discreet, female-controlled HIV prevention, or to barriers to disclosure among women with HIV. As ART and viral-load monitoring are scaled up, counselling messages for serodifferent partners
