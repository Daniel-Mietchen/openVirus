<p>The MBSL-3 Lab was composed of three container vehicles. The container encompassing the BSL-3 laboratory was called the main container (L×W×H: 9125×2438×2896mm); the second container, of the same size, was used for personnel cleaning and technology support and was called the auxiliary container; and the third container was the command container (L×W×H: 6300×2460×2100mm). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005622.g002">Fig 2</xref>, the main and auxiliary containers were connected by an airtight soft connection and together formed a complete BSL-3 Lab.
