<p>The diagnostic algorithm for laboratory testing and the rationale for positive/negative/suspect test results were presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005622.g005">Fig 5</xref>. We repeated the testing of the suspect and negative cases and strongly recommended collecting specimens again if collection was performed &lt;3 days post onset of symptoms. We found no evidence of RNA contamination during the entire operation. We added positive and negative controls to every experiment, and all controls produced the expected results.
