<p>Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) assays were performed using a set of published primers and probes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], targeting regions of the glycoprotein gene (F: 5’-TGGGCTGAAAAYTGCTACAATC-3’; R: 5’-CTTTGTGMACATASCGGCAC-3’; Probe: FAM-5′-CTACCAGCAGCGCCAGACGG-3′-TAMRA). RNA was amplified using the One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Japan), and 40-cycle Q-RT-PCR assays were run on the LightCycle 96 System (Roche, Switzerland). Melt curve analysis was performed to confirm the identity of the amplification products. The specimens were considered positive if there was an apparent logarithmic phase in the amplification curve, with melting point confirmed amplification products and the Ct value≤36 (Ct value&lt;26, intense positive; 26≤Ct value≤ 36, weak positive). In contrast, the specimens were considered negative if there was no apparent logarithmic phase, with the Ct value undetermined, and they were considered suspect when 36&lt;Ct value≤40.
