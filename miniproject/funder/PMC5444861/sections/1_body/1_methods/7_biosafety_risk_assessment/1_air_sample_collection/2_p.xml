<p>The virus was then concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. In brief, the pH of the virus-containing supernatant was adjusted to 7.2–7.5, after which PEG (MW 6,000) was added to a final concentration of 8%. The samples were stirred at 4°C for 2 hours and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 2 hours. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of RNase-free ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O for virus RNA preparation.
