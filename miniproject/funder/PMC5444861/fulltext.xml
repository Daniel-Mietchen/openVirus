We strictly applied multiple safety precautions to reduce exposure risks. Personnel, materials, water and air flow management were the key elements of the biosafety measures in the MBSL-3 Lab. Air samples were regularly collected from the MBSL-3 Lab, but no evidence of Ebola virus infectious aerosols was detected. Potentially contaminated objects were also tested by collecting swabs. On one occasion, a pipette tested positive for EVD. A total of 1,635 suspected EVD cases (824 positive [50.4%]) were tested from September 28 to November 11, 2014, and no member of the diagnostic team was infected with Ebola virus or other pathogens, including Lassa fever.

Infection in humans can cause Ebola hemorrhagic fever, with exceptionally high case-fatality rates of more than 50% [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The incubation period of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is 2 to 21 days [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The clinical signs and symptoms are extremely similar to those of the Marburg virus and include fever, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, rash and, in some cases, both internal and external bleeding [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Patients usually die of multiple-organ failure or hypovolemic shock. No licensed therapeutic or prophylactic treatments are currently available.</p><p>The largest outbreak of EVD has been ongoing in West Africa since December 2013. As of April 15, 2015, 25,826 cases (10,704 deaths [41.4%]) had been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although direct contact is the main route of transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], EVD is still easily contagious, and healthcare workers have constituted a considerable proportion of all cases. In particular, by April 11, 2015, 864 healthcare workers (503 deaths [58.2%]) had been infected [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Ebola virus is classified as a biosafety level-4 agent. Clinical specimen inactivation should be performed in a biosafety level-3 laboratory, and subsequent to this step, routine testing can be performed in a biosafety level-2 laboratory. However, at the time of the outbreak, West Africa had few high-level biosafety facilities, so scientists had to work under difficult and dangerous conditions associated with potential exposure risks [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It would take a fairly long time, a large staff and many resources to construct a new fixed biosafety facility, thus delaying prevention and control of the epidemic. Therefore, a mobile unit [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with both biosafety and flexibility was urgently needed to manage epidemics and emergent public health incidents such as the EVD outbreak.</p><p>In September 2014, China responded to the appeal made by the United Nations and WHO and offered assistance to the government of Sierra Leone. A truck-based mobile biosafety level-3 laboratory (MBSL-3 Lab) and a well-trained diagnostic team were then dispatched and deployed to the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Hospital, in one of the hardest-hit areas, near Freetown, to assist in EVD diagnosis. The team members and aid supplies arrived on September 17, 2014. It took approximately one week to rebuild part of the hospital into multiple functional regions to meet the specimen testing requirements, including a specimen-receiving region, a supply-storage region, a waste-incineration region, a nucleic-acid-detection region, and a staff-rest area, among others. The MBSL-3 Lab was transported by an airlift jet aircraft (Antonov An-124 Ruslan, Russia) from Beijing Capital International Airport on September 24, 2014, at 03:00 (Beijing time) to Freetown International Airport on September 25, 2014, at 14:00 (Freetown time), with a flight duration of 43 h. It took another three and a half hours to drive the MBSL-3 Lab to the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Hospital. With strict training and standard operating procedures (SOPs), clinical specimen testing began within 60 h after the arrival of the MBSL-3 Lab, enabling the diagnosis of suspected EVD cases in less than 4 hours from the time of sample receiving. In total, 1,635 suspected EVD cases (824 positive [50.4%]) were tested from September 28 to November 11, 2014, and none of the staff members was infected with Ebola virus or other pathogens. Here, we provide a brief overview of the MBSL-3 Lab and the biosafety precautions applied to manage the EVD outbreak.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>This Ebola outbreak response was a humanitarian aid mission.

RNA was amplified using the One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Japan), and 40-cycle Q-RT-PCR assays were run on the LightCycle 96 System (Roche, Switzerland). Melt curve analysis was performed to confirm the identity of the amplification products. The specimens were considered positive if there was an apparent logarithmic phase in the amplification curve, with melting point confirmed amplification products and the Ct value&#x02264;36 (Ct value&#x0003c;26, intense positive; 26&#x02264;Ct value&#x02264; 36, weak positive). In contrast, the specimens were considered negative if there was no apparent logarithmic phase, with the Ct value undetermined, and they were considered suspect when 36&#x0003c;Ct value&#x02264;40.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Specimen storage</title><p>The MBSL-3 Lab was equipped with a -20&#x000b0;C freezer and a -80&#x000b0;C freezer, and there was another -80&#x000b0;C freezer outside the MBSL-3 Lab. As a result, we could store a total of 1500&#x02013;2000 specimens. For short-term storage, namely, within 1 day, we stored the specimens at -20&#x000b0;C. For long-term storage, we stored the specimens at -80&#x000b0;C. The specimens were well packed and surface disinfected with 0.25% chlorine-containing disinfectant before storage. The Sierra Leone-China Friendship Hospital was guarded by the military guard of Sierra Leone, and the freezers were well locked.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Testing report release</title><p>Every patient was assigned a unique Outbreak Case ID by the emergency operations center jointly established by the MoHS. Each time a sample was collected, the patient was asked to complete a &#x0201c;VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVER CASE INVESTIGATION FORM&#x0201d;. The sample tube and the investigation form were marked with the Outbreak Case ID and patient name and were then delivered to us. Therefore, the Outbreak Case ID provided a unique number for tracking the patient, the specimen and the test result. The information in our testing report included the Outbreak Case ID, the Ct value yielded by Q-RT-PCR and the confirmed result (Yes/No/Suspect).</p><p>According to an agreement with the MoHS, we usually did not contact hospitals directly. Instead, we submitted the testing report to the WHO and the MoHS, which was in charge of delivering the results to hospitals.

In the case of sudden power loss, the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) could power the ventilation, illumination, auto-control system and experimental equipments for at least 45 min. Due to the lack of a stable mains supply in Sierra Leone, we employed two diesel-generating sets (200kw) for this mission.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>&#x02022; Ventilation system</title><p>A cascade of low pressure with steps of 0 Pa, -10 Pa, -20 Pa, -45 Pa and -70 Pa was realized with a ventilation system using 100% fresh filtrated air, allowing an air renewal rate of up to 20 times per hour. The air supply was purified by three-grade-filtration, namely, a primary efficiency filter (G4, plate-type), a medium efficiency filter (F8, pocket-type) and a high efficiency filter (H14, HEPA). The exhaust was purified by two-grade-filtration, namely, a high efficiency filter and a BAG-IN/BAG-OUT Filter Housing. The static cleanliness of the laboratory was up to International Standard Organization (ISO) Class 8 [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The MBSL-3 Lab was also equipped with an air conditioning system, which was a big selling point for laboratory personnel working in tropical climates.

However, the resources for medical treatment, outbreak management and laboratory research are concentrated in developed regions, and substantial expenditure would be required to build new medical systems in these areas. Because epidemic situations are always urgent, scientists thus work under inadequate conditions and face exposure risks. Therefore, rapid, safe and flexible outbreak response capacity is urgently needed [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A mobile laboratory unit can easily be promptly deployed when needed and can provide a safe working environment, which will be a vital part of the outbreak response to emerging public health events or bioterrorism acts and will make great contributions to lessening and controlling epidemics. Several mobile units have previously been used in natural disaster scenarios [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in health surveys [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], during the outbreak of severe infectious diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and in military campaigns [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Our MBSL-3 Lab meets the requirements of on-site collection, isolation, cultivation and detection of emergent infectious pathogens. This laboratory also protects humans as well as the environment and specimens, and it was designed to be functional in a field setting, even without logistical support. The major challenges in a remote location may be power supply and water supply, but there are ways to overcome them. There was an 80kVA (&#x02248;70kW) diesel generating set in the auxiliary container of the MBSL-3 Lab. Full fuel in the oil box can power the MBSL-3 Lab in continuous operation for 24h. We can bring as much fuel with us as possible using oil tanks, and wherever the MBSL-3 Lab can arrive, a refueling truck could also arrive. The MBSL-3 Lab is also equipped with a water storage tank and a water softener, and water can be re-supplied with water from a well or clear stream. If the experimenters could do not take a shower in the MBSL-3 Lab, the water requirement is not large, approximately 200L per day. In addition, the MBSL-3 Lab is equipped with a leveling system, but it still needs a 20m&#x000d7;8m level ground. This was the first time that we executed a mission in Africa. In total, 1,635 specimens were tested from September 28 to November 11, 2014, accounting for more than one quarter of the nation&#x02019;s specimen volume during the same period. In all, 824 (50.4%) specimens were EVD-positive, representing 33.3% of the total number of confirmed cases reported in Sierra Leone during the same period. The maximum number of specimens that we could reasonably process in one day is approximately 120&#x02013;150.</p><p>We developed strict SOPs, adopted comprehensive protective measures and used comprehensive medical and logistical support systems to ensure safe and orderly performance of the virus diagnosis task. In particular, the &#x0201c;Four Flows&#x0201d; biosafety protocol was strictly followed. We monitored the exposure risk during clinical specimen testing. Air samples were collected from every workspace, and the test results were all negative, indicating that the working environment was relatively safe. The surfaces of potentially contaminated objects were also swabbed. On one occasion, the pipette used to pipette samples from blood-collection tubes tested positive. Given that a portion of the specimens contained only a small sample volume, the pipette had to be placed deep into the tubes and was easily contaminated by touching the inner wall. Therefore, it was suggested that the barrel of the pipette should be disinfected with disinfectant-containing gauze after pipetting each sample to avoid personnel infection and cross-contamination of samples.</p><p>The test results played an important role in the disposal of symptomatic individuals and might, in a sense, determine their fates. For positive cases, the patients would be properly isolated and treated without visiting family members, and traditional religious funerals for the dead were forbidden. For negative cases, the patients would be separated from the positive cases and kept in an observation ward for follow-up testing or discharge to relieve the limited wards. Hence, the accuracy of the test results was crucial. False-positive results might lead to the individual being infected by positive patients, whereas false-negative results might lead to the spread of EVD to families and even the community. Our diagnostic algorithm suggested a suspect conclusion when 36&#x0003c;Ct value&#x02264;40 and strongly recommended resampling and considering clinical information and epidemiological links. Q-RT-PCR is now a preferred method for pathogen diagnosis due to its rapid and sensitive features [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but it is prone to contamination and may result in false-positive results. Therefore, we conducted every experiment in the biosafety cabinet. The cabinet and PCR room were exposed periodically to ultraviolet radiation to eliminate nucleic acid contamination. Additionally, PCR tubes were never opened. Every control included in the PCR assays produced the expected result, indicating high experimental accuracy. Moreover, the MoHS was in charge of retrospective look at the disease progresses of the patients, and to date, we have not received any feedback regarding a false diagnostic case from the MoHS.</p><p>We have shown that the positive rate of oral swabs was lower than that of blood samples. The technique and efficiency of swabbing might be one of the most important factors. Swab samples should be obtained by vigorous sampling to acquire sufficient biologic material for testing [<xref rid="pntd.0005622.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A quality-control PCR target (housekeeping gene target), such as Beta 2 Microglobulin (B2M), should be added for sample integrity assessment in the future.</p><p>Our MBSL-3 Lab continuously worked for six months and managed 4,867 specimens for EVD diagnostics. During that time, the China CDC established a fixed BSL-3 Lab near the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Hospital for long-term surveillance and to serve as the public health system for future outbreaks and epidemics.
