The complex epidemiology of HIV and the breadth of scientific, societal, and political stakeholders involved in the global response have posed challenges in terms of coordination, harmonisation, and funding. Concerted advocacy and successive global strategies to prevent and control HIV have had a major influence on the global availability of political and financial support and on national response strategies [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the campaign against HIV highlights both the importance of globally agreed definitions and the challenges of developing a common understanding of overarching goals, targets, and measures of progress.</p><p>As future global targets for the control of HIV are considered [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we aim in this article to identify relevant lessons from control programmes for three other global infectious diseases&#x02014;malaria, leprosy, and tuberculosis (TB). These were chosen because they have been the subject of international control efforts, with varying levels of success, and because they illustrate many of the problems faced by HIV control. These three programmes have faced challenges in reaching clear definitions of the concepts essential to epidemic control (<xref rid="pmed.1002735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), in sustaining political will and resources, and in meeting the needs of hard-to-reach subgroups. In the following sections, we briefly summarise epidemiological comparisons between these diseases and HIV (see <xref rid="pmed.1002735.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and then analyse the evolution of each disease control programme from the 1950s onwards, focusing on the stated global control strategy, specific targets, and major global events or initiatives (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002735.s001">S1 Table</xref> and Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002735.g001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002735.g004">4</xref>).

However, particularly in countries with a significant disease burden such as India and Brazil, continuing high numbers of new cases detected indicated that MDT had not interrupted transmission as anticipated [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Since 2005, declines in both prevalence and incidence rates have largely stalled [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and many countries with a national prevalence below 1/10,000 continue to have high incidence subnationally [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

It is instructive for HIV control to compare the complexity of the current leprosy control targets with the simple elimination target chosen in 1991. The advocacy and resources behind the 1/10,000 prevalence target put leprosy firmly on the global health agenda and helped detect and cure many cases. The no-cost delivery of MDT to endemic countries meant that, at the global level, the elimination programme was highly equitable (although some individuals had poor outcomes) [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, the perception that elimination was imminent, even as transmission continued, resulted in reduced funding for leprosy programmes in the 2000s and the loss of specialist leprosy services, as diagnosis and management of leprosy became integrated into peripheral health services [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The elimination target also became politically charged, leading to tensions between civil society organisations and global or national leprosy programmes [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, elimination rhetoric may have reduced scientific interest in leprosy, despite significant evidence gaps [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

Although drug-resistant TB was recognised at this point, the DOTS strategy assumed that increasing adherence and cure rates would prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), and access to MDR TB treatment was limited.</p><p>The targets for 2000 were met in 2005 due to improvements in living conditions and DOTS in China, India, and Indonesia, the countries with the highest burden of disease then and now [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but many countries did not meet them. The Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006&#x02013;2015 set bold new targets to halve the prevalence and death rates of TB by 2015 (as compared with the estimated prevalence in 1990).</p><p>By 2015, with active TB incidence falling by an average of 1.5% per year since 2000, the MDG to &#x02018;halt and reverse TB incidence&#x02019; was met globally [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Globally, TB mortality has fallen by 47% between 1990 and 2015, and the prevalence was almost half that of the 1990 estimate [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, there is considerable variation in outcomes between countries, and with the growth of populations, the absolute number of new TB infections globally has grown, hence the current approach to target high-burden countries, similar to the US President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) approach to HIV [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>In 2014, the WHA approved the WHO End TB strategy, 2016&#x02013;2035, which sought to reduce annual incidence of active TB to less than 10 cases per 100,000 population by 2035. This would mean that, of the 8.5 billion people expected to be alive in 2035, the number of new cases of active TB would need to be fewer than 900,000 [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], as compared with the estimated 10.4 million new TB cases in 2016, equivalent to 140 cases per 100,000 population [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The decline in active TB incidence has never been more than 1%&#x02013;2% per year at the global level [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. To meet this target, the strategy ambitiously assumes that the incidence rate falls at 10% annually between 2015 and 2025 through the optimisation of current tools and significant progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and then declines further at an average of 17% annually with the advent of new technologies including a vaccine, new drug treatments for active and latent disease, and point-of-care diagnostics [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Modelling studies suggest that achieving the SDGs would have the most significant impact on the incidence of active TB, but most of our efforts still focus on improving drugs and technologies [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Key challenges include preventing, diagnosing, and treating MDR TB. In 2016, approximately 22% of MDR TB patients were enrolled in second-line treatment, while treatment success is only 54% globally. But also important is the large, global reservoir of latent TB infection. Even if transmission were completely interrupted from now onwards, reactivation and relapse would still generate more than 10 active cases per 100,000 in 2050 [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Active TB incidence could be brought down quickly with the discovery of a vaccine to prevent infection and a postinfection vaccine that could neutralise the reservoir of latent infection [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>Achieving global TB control requires high-incidence countries to have systems and strategies to be able to accurately diagnose and deliver treatment early, universal healthcare coverage, and social protection to achieve high cure rates of active TB and MDR TB, coupled with the necessary social and economic development to sustain achievements. In short, the End TB Strategy elimination targets cannot be achieved without both rapid and substantial progress towards the SDGs [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and the development of a simple and effective mechanism for managing latent infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>HIV</title><fig id="pmed.1002735.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1002735.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Major goals and targets for HIV/AIDS.</title><p>ART, antiretroviral therapy; GFATM, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; LMIC, low- or middle-income country; MDG, Millennium Development Goal; PEPFAR, US President&#x02019;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief; UNAIDS, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1002735.g004"/></fig><p>Early in the HIV/AIDS epidemic, there were limited targets at the global level.

The year 2014 saw the development of the Fast Track strategy [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], setting out 10 targets, one of which was the &#x02018;90-90-90&#x02019; target for 2020, which remains a significant marker of progress for countries. The 90-90-90 target aims for 90% of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) to be diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed people to be on ART, and 90% of people on ART to have a fully suppressed viral load. Globally, UNAIDS estimates that 75% of PLHIV knew their HIV status at the end of 2017. Their estimates also suggest that 79% of diagnosed PLHIV were accessing treatment, and 81% of PLHIV in treatment were virally suppressed [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].

For example the target in the 2016 Declaration, &#x02018;Ensure that at least 30% of all service delivery is community-led by 2020&#x02019; (Fast Track Commitment 7 [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]) is challenging to monitor. The 2017 report on the 2016 Declaration by the UN Secretary General [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] captures examples of good practice in community-led service delivery but does not include quantitative data on global progress towards this target.</p><p>Several targets today are sensitive to the significant variation in the burden of HIV among different subpopulations, recognising inequalities in vulnerability to HIV. For example, the 2016 Political Declaration includes a commitment to reduce the number of new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women to below 100,000 per year (Commitment 5). This demonstrates that targets are seeking to respond to structural drivers of the epidemic, even if the available data suggest progress is too slow to address these; for example, in 2016, there were 360,000 new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women, only a 17% decline since 2010 [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].</p><p>As discussed above, many process targets relating to funding provision, ART coverage, and elimination of vertical HIV transmission have been achieved in several countries. However, there has been more limited progress towards impact targets, for example, around the reduction of incidence or expanding access to combination prevention among key populations. This highlights the inherent ambition of &#x02018;Ending AIDS as a public threat&#x02019;, given current rates of progress towards the constituent targets. Paradoxically, there is a risk that insufficiently nuanced rhetoric implying the end is in sight may deprioritise HIV, even while data illustrate that renewed financing and political will are critical to achieving progress towards an aspirational &#x02018;end of AIDS&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several important lessons emerge from our analysis that should be considered in developing future goals and targets for HIV control.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Engagement of stakeholders as well as multidisciplinary scientific expertise</title><p>Scientific advancement and an enabling environment to implement effective interventions are fundamental to the realisation of global targets for disease control. Alongside these factors, a strong political, social, and economic commitment is necessary at all levels of society to achieve success. Expertise from biomedical sciences, social sciences and economics, national programme delivery, patient/carer representatives, and civil society more broadly is necessary when setting new targets for disease control. National TB elimination programmes, for example, have only had sustained success in industrialised countries that saw rapid socioeconomic development and also addressed wider determinants of health. At the global level, the equitable engagement of political stakeholders is also crucial. For malaria, only three sub-Saharan African countries were present as full members at the WHA when the GMEP was adopted [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Global control strategies should, therefore, consult fully on target setting with national stakeholders from high-burden settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Balance between ambition and caution when setting targets</title><p>A balance needs to be struck between ambitious, galvanising targets that drive funding, and ones that reflect the complexities and local epidemiological variations in disease. The 1991 leprosy elimination target was criticised for being arbitrary and ignoring the impact of secondary disabilities. However, subsequent targets have not driven new funding in the same way that this single target did. Global targets have been criticised for overlooking subpopulations of high incidence and promoting oversimplified, generalisable solutions to complex problems that are nuanced. On the other hand, numerous targets have been set for HIV and TB, many of which have not been met in high-burden populations but which have helped sustain funding commitments. There is a tension between time-limited elimination targets that can keep donor interest and the desire for community approaches that invest in social capital over a longer time but have the potential to be more equitable and better serve hard-to-reach groups [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. While the language of eradication and elimination can prove seductive to donors, the risk exists of misdirecting efforts. Eradication requires significant up-front investment, which can cause its supporters to oversell its feasibility. With leprosy, achieving the global elimination target undoubtedly resulted in a decline in investment in research, even though pockets of high incidence and prevalence remain. For malaria, there is a risk of focusing elimination on areas of low incidence and prevalence to shrink the global malaria map, at the cost of control in high-incidence areas. There are therefore clear ethical considerations and consequences to be explored when setting ambitious goals and targets&#x02014;particularly around their local effects and the opportunity costs of foregoing other areas of public health.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Avoiding burdensome reporting and conflicting targets</title><p>In recent decades, the expansion of donor-driven disease programmes has led to a constant stream of so-called SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) targets and logframes (logical frameworks) to monitor projects and estimate impact [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. There is a clear utility in employing these methods to develop intermediate and adaptable targets that allow for course corrections to programmes, and these can help address inequalities by including harder-to-reach subpopulations. However, a balance needs to be struck to avoid overly burdensome reporting requirements and the potential confusion of overlapping and sometimes conflicting targets both within and across vertical disease programmes. Linked to this is a clear need to consciously distinguish between process and outcome targets. As seen with HIV control, the achievement of process targets does not necessarily translate to a decrease in new infections or mortality.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Retention of specialist skills</title><p>The experience with malaria and TB control in the 1970s and 1980s demonstrated a need to ensure retention of expert skills and specialist services while moving towards integrated health systems. The success of TB and HIV programmes are often intimately linked, with TB elimination in many settings dependent on adequate prevention and treatment of HIV [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Disease control programmes should therefore look for opportunities to jointly develop targets and integrate services and strategies where appropriate. The End TB strategy, for example, already predicates future achievement of its 2050 TB target on universal health coverage (UHC), social protection, and a range of SDG-related milestones, although relevant progress indicators have not been framed around these [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sustaining investment and political commitment as incidence falls</title><p>Finally, sustaining any elimination or eradication strategy in the end phase, as the cost per case averted increases, will require prolonged investment and continuing political buy-in. At present, 1.8 million people continue to be infected with HIV each year [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and achieving elimination will only be possible with sufficient investment in research to develop vaccines, point-of-care diagnostics, and treatments; infrastructure upgrades that address wider determinants of health; and health and surveillance systems that allow for equitable delivery and access to services. For diseases like HIV that disproportionately affect marginalised groups, equity-based service delivery targets become even more important as the elimination strategy nears its end. Human rights-based approaches that explicitly seek to tackle stigma related to HIV and give key populations a stronger voice to influence policy will be vital to ensure that equitable progress is made to control disease across all sectors of affected populations [<xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002735.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Major global events or initiatives that influenced progress in disease control efforts.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002735.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>A summary of this work was presented at a UNAIDS workshop in Glion, Switzerland, in October 2017.
