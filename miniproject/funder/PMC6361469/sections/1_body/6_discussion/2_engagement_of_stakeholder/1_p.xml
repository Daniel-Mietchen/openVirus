<p>Scientific advancement and an enabling environment to implement effective interventions are fundamental to the realisation of global targets for disease control. Alongside these factors, a strong political, social, and economic commitment is necessary at all levels of society to achieve success. Expertise from biomedical sciences, social sciences and economics, national programme delivery, patient/carer representatives, and civil society more broadly is necessary when setting new targets for disease control. National TB elimination programmes, for example, have only had sustained success in industrialised countries that saw rapid socioeconomic development and also addressed wider determinants of health. At the global level, the equitable engagement of political stakeholders is also crucial. For malaria, only three sub-Saharan African countries were present as full members at the WHA when the GMEP was adopted [
