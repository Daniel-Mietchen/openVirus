A new Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) strategy was launched, focussing primarily on increasing cure rates and improving case detection. A vertical DOTS-based strategy was widely promoted, with specialist managerial functions implemented at central, regional, and district levels and delivery carried out through primary healthcare infrastructure [
