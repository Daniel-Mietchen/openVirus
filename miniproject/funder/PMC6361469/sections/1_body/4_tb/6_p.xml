<p>In 2014, the WHA approved the WHO End TB strategy, 2016–2035, which sought to reduce annual incidence of active TB to less than 10 cases per 100,000 population by 2035. This would mean that, of the 8.5 billion people expected to be alive in 2035, the number of new cases of active TB would need to be fewer than 900,000 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], as compared with the estimated 10.4 million new TB cases in 2016, equivalent to 140 cases per 100,000 population [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. To meet this target, the strategy ambitiously assumes that the incidence rate falls at 10% annually between 2015 and 2025 through the optimisation of current tools and significant progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and then declines further at an average of 17% annually with the advent of new technologies including a vaccine, new drug treatments for active and latent disease, and point-of-care diagnostics [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Key challenges include preventing, diagnosing, and treating MDR TB. In 2016, approximately 22% of MDR TB patients were enrolled in second-line treatment, while treatment success is only 54% globally. But also important is the large, global reservoir of latent TB infection. Even if transmission were completely interrupted from now onwards, reactivation and relapse would still generate more than 10 active cases per 100,000 in 2050 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Active TB incidence could be brought down quickly with the discovery of a vaccine to prevent infection and a postinfection vaccine that could neutralise the reservoir of latent infection [
