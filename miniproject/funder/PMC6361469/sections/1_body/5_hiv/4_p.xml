<p>UNAIDS’ 2011–2015 strategy set ambitious targets beneath a broader vision statement of the Three Zeros—zero new HIV infections, zero AIDS-related deaths, and zero discrimination—which continues to frame the AIDS response [

The 90-90-90 target aims for 90% of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) to be diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed people to be on ART, and 90% of people on ART to have a fully suppressed viral load. Globally, UNAIDS estimates that 75% of PLHIV knew their HIV status at the end of 2017. Their estimates also suggest that 79% of diagnosed PLHIV were accessing treatment, and 81% of PLHIV in treatment were virally suppressed [
