 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] demonstrate the difficulty of evaluating progress against complex targets when high-quality data are not available. For example the target in the 2016 Declaration, ‘Ensure that at least 30% of all service delivery is community-led by 2020’ (Fast Track Commitment 7 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]) is challenging to monitor. The 2017 report on the 2016 Declaration by the UN Secretary General [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] captures examples of good practice in community-led service delivery but does not include quantitative data on global progress towards this target.
