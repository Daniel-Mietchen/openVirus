<p>The GMEP succeeded in eliminating malaria from many parts of the world [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but in sub-Saharan Africa, where mortality is highest, eradication was deemed technically unfeasible and was finally abandoned in 1969. In retrospect, it was clear that the humanitarian appeal of the campaign and subsequent urgency had led to an oversimplification and standardisation of the programme. In the ‘consolidation phase’, the improvements in malaria control could not be maintained without well-developed public health infrastructure. The continued high expenditure in an environment of greatly reduced transmission and disease incidence was difficult to defend. And finally, increasing resistance both of vectors to DDT and the parasites to chloroquine sealed the GMEP’s fate [
