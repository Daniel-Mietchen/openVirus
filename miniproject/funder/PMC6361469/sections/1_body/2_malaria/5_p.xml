<p>Malaria elimination, defined as a state in which interventions have interrupted endemic transmission within a geographic area with minimal risk of re-establishment [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], may be realistic for Asia, southern America, and parts of Africa. South Africa is aiming to eliminate malaria before 2020 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Elimination is a particularly attractive target for combating drug resistance in Southeast Asia. But will this process be time limited or will sustained suppression through control efforts be required indefinitely [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]? Socioeconomic and environmental development in Europe and North America allowed for the relaxation of control measures there. The development of a highly effective vaccine that can interrupt transmission and decrease the risk of transmission from mosquitoes, or gene editing of female mosquitoes so that they can carry only male-producing eggs may be important parts of a solution [
