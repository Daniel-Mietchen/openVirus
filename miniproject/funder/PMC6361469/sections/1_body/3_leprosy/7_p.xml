<p>In terms of implications for HIV control, the example of leprosy highlights both the benefits and hazards of setting strong, high-level targets. While there was significant progress in expanding access to treatment, the initiative did not recognise the complexity of leprosy elimination and did not take into account the importance of long-term disability of individuals who had ceased to be counted as cases. Leprosy demonstrates the misalignment between achieving a high-level target and implementation, in which efforts often did more to control than to end leprosy.</p>
