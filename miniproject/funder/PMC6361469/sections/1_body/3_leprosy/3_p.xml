<p>At the global level, the prevalence target of 1/10,000 was achieved by the end of 2000, with all but six countries reaching the target nationally by 2005. (Success in achieving the target was contingent on the use of the whole world population—including populations with very few leprosy cases, e.g., in Northern Europe—as the denominator.) However, particularly in countries with a significant disease burden such as India and Brazil, continuing high numbers of new cases detected indicated that MDT had not interrupted transmission as anticipated [
