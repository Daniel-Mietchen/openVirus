<p>As future global targets for the control of HIV are considered [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], we aim in this article to identify relevant lessons from control programmes for three other global infectious diseases—malaria, leprosy, and tuberculosis (TB). These were chosen because they have been the subject of international control efforts, with varying levels of success, and because they illustrate many of the problems faced by HIV control. These three programmes have faced challenges in reaching clear definitions of the concepts essential to epidemic control (
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), in sustaining political will and resources, and in meeting the needs of hard-to-reach subgroups. In the following sections, we briefly summarise epidemiological comparisons between these diseases and HIV (see 
 <xref rid="pmed.1002735.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and then analyse the evolution of each disease control programme from the 1950s onwards, focusing on the stated global control strategy, specific targets, and major global events or initiatives (see
