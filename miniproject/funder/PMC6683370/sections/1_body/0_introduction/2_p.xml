<p id="Par19">Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), a cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) for TB with substantially improved sensitivity relative to sputum smear microscopy (SSM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and scaled up in many settings worldwide. Many studies have suggested that Xpert is both feasible and cost-effective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in idealized settings. Nevertheless, in India—as in many resource-limited settings—the use of Xpert has largely been limited to the public sector (at district level or higher [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) and often restricted to high-priority populations including HIV-positive individuals, children, and people at high risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a result, in more peripheral settings where the majority of public-sector patients present for care (e.g., primary care clinics), TB diagnosis continues to rely on SSM and non-microbiological tests.
