<p id="Par18">Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the world’s most important infectious causes of morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 25% of the world’s population infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and 1.6 million deaths reported in 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Global TB incidence is declining slowly (2% per year), far short of the progress needed to achieve global targets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With only 64% of an estimated 10 million new cases reported in 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], strategies to optimize existing technologies and interventions to address gaps in TB case detection and linkage to care are desperately needed.
