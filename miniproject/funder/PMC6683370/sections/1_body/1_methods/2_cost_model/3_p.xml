<p id="Par27">For decentralized testing, we evaluated 15 different scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) with mean daily testing volumes between 0.1 (i.e., 25 samples tested per year) and ten (2500 samples/year). This range covers the expected mean daily workload of 3–6 tests per MC nationwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For centralized testing, a total of seven mean daily testing volume scenarios between 10 (2475 samples/year) and 70+ (17,411 samples/year) were assessed, including costs associated with sample transport (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Section S1.4). At the time of analysis, no published evidence on costs of establishing or operating sample transport networks for sputum specimens was available, to our knowledge. Therefore, we estimated mean per-sample transport costs based on the following: (a) distributions of MC-to-DTC ratio and mean distance from MCs to DTC (based on total service area of DTC/number of MC in the area) in India (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2), (b) hypothetical estimates of the number of specimens transported, and (c) a range of cost sharing of sample transport (5 to 100%) with other clinical specimens (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4). This cost was calculated separately for each DTC test volume scenario (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S6).
