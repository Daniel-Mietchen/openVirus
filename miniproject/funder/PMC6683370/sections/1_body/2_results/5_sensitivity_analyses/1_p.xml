<p id="Par38">When comparing decentralized against centralized testing, differences in outcome measures—epidemiological impact of Xpert (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a), costs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b), and DALYs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c)—were generally robust to one-way variation in parameter values. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d) likewise did not vary substantially in one-way sensitivity analyses, with the uncertainty boundary remaining within ± 10% of the primary estimate. Increasing the amount of pre-treatment LTFU in the centralized scenario reduced the epidemiological impact of Xpert and resulted in higher costs and less favorable cost-effectiveness. For example, when increasing the incremental probability of pre-treatment LTFU with centralized (versus decentralized) testing from 0 to 20%, the proportion of simulations favoring decentralized Xpert (assuming moderate decentralized volume, 95% centralized cost sharing, and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1000 per DALY averted) rose from 57 to 99%.
