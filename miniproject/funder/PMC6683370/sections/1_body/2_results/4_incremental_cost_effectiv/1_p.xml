<p id="Par36">Primary cost-effectiveness results are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. In the primary analysis, decentralized Xpert averted an estimated 1.25% [IQR 0.88%, 1.54%] of all TB-related DALYs, relative to centralized Xpert. Under the most unfavorable scenario for decentralized testing (low decentralized volume at 0.3 tests per day and 95% cost sharing for specimen transport in the centralized scenario), this gain came at an estimated cost of $3161 [IQR $2412; $4731] per DALY averted. Under the most favorable scenario (high decentralized volume at 3 tests per day and no cost sharing), decentralized testing was cost saving compared to centralized testing, saving a median of $338,000 [IQR − $222,000; $889,000] per 20 million people.
