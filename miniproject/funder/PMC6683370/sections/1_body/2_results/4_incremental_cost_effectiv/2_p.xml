<p id="Par37">The probability that decentralized Xpert would be cost-effective depended strongly on decentralized testing volume, degree of cost sharing for centralized specimen transport, and the cost-effectiveness threshold. For example, the probability that decentralized testing would be cost-effective relative to centralized testing ranged from 0.12 to 0.98 at a willingness to pay of $2000 per DALY averted (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). At very low peripheral testing volumes (≤ 0.3 tests per day), decentralized Xpert was unlikely to be cost-effective: even at a willingness to pay of $6000 per DALY averted, the probability of cost-effectiveness remained below 0.8.
