<p id="Par33">The unit cost of decentralized Xpert ranged from $17.20 to $60.81 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), but consistently approximated $20 per test when MCs performed at least one test a day (with small fluctuations reflecting the number of testing modules required). The unit cost of centralized Xpert depended on the degree to which the costs of sample transport could be shared with clinical specimens for non-TB disease entities (e.g., from $14.00 to $18.96 in the highest-volume scenario in Additional file
