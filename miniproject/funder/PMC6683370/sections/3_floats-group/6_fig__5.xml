  <p>Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves comparing decentralized versus centralized Xpert testing for tuberculosis (TB) in a representative simulated Indian population. The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis shows the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted via decentralized Xpert compared to centralized testing, and the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis shows the proportion of stochastic simulations falling below each corresponding cost-effectiveness threshold. Dotted vertical lines represent alternative thresholds for evaluating cost-effectiveness. For each threshold, the cost-effectiveness values are computed for the four unit-cost comparisons when centralized specimen transport is utilized at no vs. 95% cost sharing and mean peripheral testing volume ranges from 0.3 to 3 per day in the decentralized scenario
