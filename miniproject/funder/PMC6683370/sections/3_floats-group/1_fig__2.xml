  <p>Unit cost of decentralized Xpert testing. Bars show the estimated unit cost (in 2015 US dollars) of decentralized Xpert testing as a function of the mean daily number of tests performed (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis), with the annual test volume shown in parenthesis under each scenario and the cost per test shown above each bar. Blue bars indicate two representative scenarios chosen for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Costs were derived by assuming a Poisson distribution of daily test volume and number of single-module Xpert devices sufficient to ensure same-day testing for 90% of all patients. Above mean daily volumes of approximately one test per day, the unit cost remains relatively stable (between $15 and $20 per test)â€”reflecting the fact that, even though a single-module device can perform four tests per day, testing capacity must be maintained at approximately four times the actual volume in order to assure same-day diagnosis at the 90% level. At less than one test per day, excess (wasted) testing capacity grows, resulting in substantially increased unit costs at very low testing volumes
