  <p>One-way sensitivity analysis to the value of selected model parameters. Panels show the sensitivity of epidemiological outputs (reduction in DS-TB incidence in panel 
   <bold>a</bold>), costing outcomes (difference in costs in panel 
   <bold>b</bold>), and DALYs averted (in panel 
   <bold>c</bold>) comparing decentralized to centralized TB testing, and the proportion of simulations that remain cost-effective at a threshold of $1000 (panel 
   <bold>d</bold>) under one-way variation in the value of selected model parameters. Each parameter value is followed by an up/down arrow, denoting an increase (↑) or decrease (↓) in the input parameter value as listed in Table 
   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Each scenario is simulated starting in the year 2018 and is followed to the year 2028 under centralized and decentralized Xpert placement. The bars and arrows represent the median and interquartile ranges across 1000 simulations. The red mark and dashed line represent the baseline scenario with no parameter variation. The results are summarized by showing the five parameters for which variation resulted in the largest variations from the baseline scenario (increasing in impact from top to bottom)
