  <p>A total of four cost sets were compared in the cost-effectiveness analysis. All values are expressed as median with interquartile ranges in brackets, cumulative and discounted over a 10-year time horizon</p>
  <p>*In the median simulations, decentralized Xpert was less costly and more effective than centralized testing</p>
