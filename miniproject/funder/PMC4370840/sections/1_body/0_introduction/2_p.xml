<p>Epidemic spreading in interconnected networks has been recently studied. Most of these studies investigated the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) [

 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that the epidemic threshold in two interconnected random networks can be lower than that in each isolated network. In [
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Dickison et al. investigated epidemic spreading in interconnected networks and found two different regimes: in the strongly coupled case, the disease either spreads in both networks or does not spread at all; in the weakly coupled case, there exists an intermediate scenario in which the epidemic spreads in only one network. Buono et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported a study of the SIR process in partially overlapped multiplex networks and developed a theoretical framework to determine the effect of the overlap fraction on the spread of a disease. Li et al. in [
