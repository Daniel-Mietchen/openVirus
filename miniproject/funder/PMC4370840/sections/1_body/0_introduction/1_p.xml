 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] have been extensively studied, with respect to the epidemic threshold and the infection density over time, in single networks [

 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], such as Erdős–Rényi (ER) networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Watts and Strogatz (WS) networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and scale-free (SF) networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, epidemics can also spread across multiple communities or species [
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>],which are not limited to a single network. For example, a disease may spread from the animal interaction network to the human interaction network via human-animal interactions.
