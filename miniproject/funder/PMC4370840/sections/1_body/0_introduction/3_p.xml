<p>Many real-world networks are neither regular networks nor random networks. The small-world model [
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] proposed by Watts and Strogatz captures the features of high clustering and small average path length, which have been widely observed in real-world networks. These small-world features [

 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The small-world model can be constructed from a regular lattice. In such a network, each existing link is randomly rewired with a rewiring probability

 <italic>p</italic> = 0) and that of a random network (
 <italic>p</italic> = 1).
