<p>In this paper, we analyze epidemic spreading in two interconnected small-world networks with the same rewiring probability (see

 <xref rid="pone.0120701.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we account for such spatial constraints by requiring that the interconnection links can be only established from a node in one network to a node at a spatial distance

When the infection rate is low, the rewiring probability affects the global steady-state infection density, whereas when the infection rate is high, the infection density is insensitive to the rewiring probability.
