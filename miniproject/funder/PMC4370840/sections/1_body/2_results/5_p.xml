<p>To discover the different spreading patterns of epidemics, we investigate the epidemic spreading over space and time, considering various rewiring probabilities and infection rates. Initially, 16 nodes in the center of the network A are infected. From (1) and (2) of 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>, it is evident that when the infection rate is 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.19 and the rewiring probability is 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1, the disease spreads only within local clusters and ultimately dies out; by contrast, when the infection rate 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.19 is the same but the rewiring probability is 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1, the disease spreads throughout the network and persists with a non-zero infection fraction. We further explore the case when the infection rate is 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.24. As shown in (3) and (4) of 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>, the infected nodes initially infect predominantly their local neighbors when 
 <italic>p</italic> is small; when 
 <italic>p</italic> is large, however, nodes far away from the initially infected nodes may get immediately infected.
