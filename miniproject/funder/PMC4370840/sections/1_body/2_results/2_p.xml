<p>We explore the effect of the rewiring probability of the interconnected networks on the epidemic spreading. We perform simulations to obtain the infection density 
 <italic>ρ</italic> in the steady state as a function of the effective infection rate 
 <italic>λ</italic> for various rewiring probabilities. Initially, 10% of the nodes in network A are randomly chosen to be infected. The initial infection of 10% nodes are only in layer A, and nodes of layer B can get infected due to the interconnections with layer A in the following steps.
