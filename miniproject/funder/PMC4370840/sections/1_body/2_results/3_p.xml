<p>To study the effect of the small-world network features on the epidemic threshold 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>, we plot the epidemic threshold 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> as a function of the rewiring probability 
 <italic>p</italic>. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, for a fixed 
 <italic>R</italic>, the epidemic threshold decreases as 
 <italic>p</italic> increases. This is because, as 
 <italic>p</italic> increases, more links in the original lattices A and B are rewired, reducing the average distance of both networks, which enhances the spreading of epidemic. And as 
 <italic>R</italic> increases, while the number of interconnections stays the same, the interconnections can bridge distinct locations, which facilitates the epidemics spreading. When 
 <italic>p</italic> is small, the impact of the spatial length of the interconnections on the epidemic threshold is significant. When 
 <italic>p</italic> is large, however, the epidemic threshold is barely influenced by this spatial length. Both high rewiring probability 
 <italic>p</italic> and large spatial length 
 <italic>R</italic> contribute to the heterogeneity of the connections formed in the interconnected networks, which is beneficial to the spreading of epidemics. This explains why a high rewiring probability could actually diminish the effect of spatial constraints on the topology of the interconnected networks.
