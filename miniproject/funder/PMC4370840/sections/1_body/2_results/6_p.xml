<p>We further study the time evolution of the infection density 
 <italic>ρ</italic> for various rewiring probabilities and infection rates. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref> and also observed in (3) and (4) of 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>, when the infection rate is relatively low e.g. 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.24, above but close to the epidemic threshold, a higher rewiring probability leads to a faster spread and a higher steady-state infection density. When the infection rate is sufficiently high e.g. 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 0.48, as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(c)</xref>, the disease propagates rapidly in both networks and the rewiring probability has minor influence on the infection density.
