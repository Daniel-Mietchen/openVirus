<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, interconnected networks with a larger rewiring probability 
 <italic>p</italic> have a smaller epidemic threshold 
 <italic>λ</italic>

  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>, confirming the results presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. When the infection rate 
 <italic>λ</italic> (greater than 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>) is small, the average infection density 
 <italic>ρ</italic> of interconnected networks with a higher rewiring probability is larger than that of interconnected networks with a small rewiring probability. As the infection rate is further increased, however, the infection density of the interconnected networks is hardly influenced by the rewiring probability.
