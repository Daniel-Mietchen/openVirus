<p>To understand how fast an epidemic spreads spatially, we examine the average distance of the infected nodes in network A from the center of the lattice as a function of time in 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. When 
 <italic>p</italic> is small, the average distance gradually increases to the maximum distance at a low velocity. As 
 <italic>p</italic> increases, epidemics can spread spatially all over the network with less time due to the addition of shortcuts. This finding is consistent with the results presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0120701.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>.
