<p>In summary, we studied the spread of epidemics in interconnected small-world networks with spatial constraints. We found that the rewiring probability of the small-world networks strongly affects the epidemic spreading behavior. We demonstrated that the epidemic threshold decreases as the rewiring probability increases. When the infection rate is low, the steady-state infection density varies with the rewiring probability. However, when the infection rate is sufficiently high, the infection density does not differ considerably for different rewiring probabilities.</p>
