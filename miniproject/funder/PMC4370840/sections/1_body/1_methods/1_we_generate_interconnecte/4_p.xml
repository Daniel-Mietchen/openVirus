<p>In this paper, we consider the SIS epidemic spreading model. In this model, nodes can be in two possible states, susceptible (S) or infected (I). Initially, a fraction of randomly chosen nodes in network A are infected. At each time step, each susceptible node can be infected by each of its infected neighbors in the same network with probability 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> or by each of its infected neighbors in the other network with probability 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>. For example, if a susceptible node has 
 <italic>m</italic> infected neighbors in the same network and 
 <italic>n</italic> infected neighbors in the other network, the probability that it will become infected is 1-(1-
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>)
 <sup>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sup>(1-
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>)
 <sup>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sup>. Meanwhile, each infected nodes can be cured and return to the susceptible state with probability δ. The effective spreading rates are defined as 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>δ</italic> and 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>/
 <italic>δ</italic>. Without loss of generality, we set 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 1 and 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 
 <italic>λ</italic>.
