<p>Then, we connect these two nodes with an interconnection link. We define the average coupling density as 
 <italic>q</italic>; thus, there will be 
 <italic>q*N</italic> interconnection links constructed between network A and network B. Each node may have multiple interconnection links, which differs from one to one interconnections. When 
 <italic>q</italic> = 1, each node has one interconnection link on average, but not necessarily has exactly one interconnection link as in one to one interconnected network. It is possible that multiple interconnection links exist between the same pair of nodes.
