  <title>Epidemic spreading process in interconnected small-world networks.</title>
  <p>(a) illustrates the epidemic spreading pattern in network A. Initially, 16 nodes in the center of network A are infected. The rewiring probabilities are 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.1 ((1), (3)) and 
   <italic>p</italic> = 1 ((2), (4)), and the infection rates are 
   <italic>λ</italic> = 0.19 ((1), (2)) and 
   <italic>λ</italic> = 0.24 ((3), (4)). (b) and (c) present the infection density 
   <italic>ρ</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>A</italic>
   </sub> in network A as a function of time for two interconnected networks. Initially, 10% of the nodes in network A are randomly chosen to be infected. The infection rates are 
   <italic>λ</italic> = 0.24 (b) and 
   <italic>λ</italic> = 0.48 (c). The density of interconnection links is 
   <italic>q</italic> = 1. The spatial length is 
   <italic>R</italic> = 1. The network size is 
   <italic>N</italic> = 10000. The results have been averaged over 100 realizations.
