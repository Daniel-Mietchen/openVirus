  <title>Neighbour-joining tree for measles nucleotide sequences beloging to genotypes D8.</title>
  <p>MV strains detected in Sicily are shown in bold and blue color. The reference and named strains recommended by WHO are included for comparison and indicated in red color (plain and italic, respectively), together with GenBank accession numbers. The tree was based on nucleotide sequences encoding the C-terminus of the MV N gene and rooted on the WHO reference strain MVs/Madrid.SPA/94 SSPE [F]. All relevant information on genotype D8 Sicilian MV sequences included into groups A-D are reported in
