<p>The “Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan: 2012–2020” of the WHO [
 <xref rid="pone.0195256.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] aimed to achieve the elimination of measles in Europe by 2015. To date, according to latest ECDC surveillance data on measles [
 <xref rid="pone.0195256.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], only ten European Member States (EU/EEA) have reached the goal “reported zero cases”, whereas measles continues to spread across Europe because of suboptimal vaccination coverage in many EU/EEA countries. More than 17,000 cases of measles were notified in Europe from 1 June 2016 to end July 2017 and some of most populated countries, such as Italy, doubled the number of reported cases in January-February 2016.
