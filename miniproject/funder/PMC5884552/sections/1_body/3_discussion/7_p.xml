<p>Two sporadic cases were associated to the genotype H1, 100% equal to each other, showing the highest similarity to MVs circulating between 2012 and 2013 in Hong Kong, where this genotype is still endemic [

 <xref rid="pone.0195256.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Epidemiological data confirmed the phylogenetic relationships, being primarily derived from a subject returning from a work period in that area and then locally transmitted to his partner. Notably, no other H1 infections were notified thereafter.
