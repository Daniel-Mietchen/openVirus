 <xref rid="pone.0195256.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Only 3.6% (n = 8/223) received one dose of MMR/MMRV, including five children ≤5 years of age, still too young to complete the recommended immunization schedule, and two adults among the age-group 19–29 years. Only one subject with confirmed infection received two doses of vaccine (0.4%), while in four cases (1.8%) detailed vaccination data were unavailable.
