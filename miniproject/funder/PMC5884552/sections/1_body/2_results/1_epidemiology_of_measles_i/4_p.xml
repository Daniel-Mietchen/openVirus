<p>As described in 
 <xref rid="pone.0195256.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, most people who get the measles had mild illness (64.1%; n = 143/223), whereas, notably, adults were at higher risk than children of developing clinical complications (OR = 2.35; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). Generally, diarrhoea and keratoconjuntivitis prevailed (40.0%; n = 32/80 and 32.5%; n = 26/80, respectively), one-quarter of complicated patients presented pneumonia (25.0%; n = 20/80), while about 20.0% developed laryngotracheobronchitis (18.8%; n = 15/80) or showed signs of hepatopathy (17.5%; n = 14/80). Stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure and otitis were found at lower frequencies.
