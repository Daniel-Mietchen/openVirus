<p>Within this group, three Sicilian sequences resulted 100% identical to the WHO named strain and other MVs reported in different Italian regions in that time period. Besides, a single viral strain (MVs/Agrigento.ITA/2.14) and a small cluster of four identical sequences, two of which (MVs/Ragusa.ITA/42.13 and MVs/Ragusa.ITA/44.13/1) identified in children belonging to the same family, had no similarities in the BLAST database.</p>
