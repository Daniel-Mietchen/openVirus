<p>All suspected cases were notified by general practitioners (community cases) or by hospital infectious disease units throughout the region, and a confirmed measles case was defined as any person meeting both the clinical and laboratory criteria. That means an association of fever, a generalized maculopapular rash, one symptom among cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis, together with laboratory positive finding for measles IgM serology and/or viral RNA in oral fluid/urine samples. Individuals who did not fulfill the case definition were reported as “not confirmed”.</p>
