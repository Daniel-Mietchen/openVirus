<p>Measles vaccination has been implemented in Sicily, either in association with mumps and rubella (MMR) or combined with varicella (MMRV), following a two-dose schedule and it is strongly recommended for all infants between 13 and 15 months and for children at 5–6 years of age. Based on the available data from regional health authority, the proportion of children being vaccinated for MMR/MMRV has progressively fallen in recent years (coverage rate in 2016: 82.3%, range 69.5%—90.8%) and this has favoured the endemic circulation of measles virus (MV) in the general population.</p>
