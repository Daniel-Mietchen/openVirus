 <p>Pathogens shared with wildlife cause more than 60% of human infectious diseases. However, there is a scarcity of comprehensive modeling of zoonotic disease dynamics at the wildlife-human interface. Here, we use 30 years of monthly rodent-hantavirus monitoring to show that the complex seasonality in human spillover results from the interplay between an ecological cascade that shapes reservoir infection dynamics and seasonal agricultural cycles that in turn determine human-wildlife contact patterns.</p>
