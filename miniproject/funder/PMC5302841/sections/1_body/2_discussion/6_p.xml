<p>Several important limitations of this study should also be acknowledged. First, there is no surveillance data available before 1984, and it is therefore difficult to provide a possible mechanistic explanation for the rodent population peaks in 1984 and 1985. Second, although our rodent surveillance involved constant effort over time, the capture rate was estimated using an unequal number of traps between months. Third, the relationship between environmental variability and the infection rate of wildlife was not considered in the present analysis due to constraints in data availability, and this relationship may have accounted for unexpected outbreaks, e.g. the outbreaks in 1988 and 2011. Future surveillance efforts should include more detailed and frequent sampling of wildlife and hantavirus to improve our knowledge of the association between virus transmission and environmental variability.</p>
