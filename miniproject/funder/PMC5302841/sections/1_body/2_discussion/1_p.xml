<p>Public health scientists and epidemiologists are increasingly challenged to understand how environmental change and anthropogenic trends affect zoonotic disease dynamics at the wildlife-human interface [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. An effective prevention and control method of zoonotic disease is required, which integrates ecological principles of animal, human, and environmental factors [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We have shown the ecological drivers responsible for the cascading effects of environmental variability on HFRS, using a mechanistic mathematical model integrating longitudinal field surveillance, environmental change and epidemiological data. Once the wildlife and virus dynamics are taken into account, a clear picture emerges of the role of environmental variability in zoonoses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We found support for intra-annual disease cycles driven by seasonal interactions between humans and wildlife, and by an environmentally induced cascade which can switch the dynamics of
