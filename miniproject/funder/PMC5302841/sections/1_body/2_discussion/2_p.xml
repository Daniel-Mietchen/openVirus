<p>We have provided support for the hypothesis that environmental forcing, rainfall and related vegetation growth, may induce strong chain reactions [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Environmental conditions influence survival of the animal reservoir [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and affect transitions between stability, cycles and chaotic dynamics. This is consistent with numerous field studies showing that an increase in resources would allow the rodent host to survive and reproduce [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], possibly leading to a higher prevalence of infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] as hantavirus infection is life-long in natural hosts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In turn, this could lead to a greater chance of spillover to humans. Various studies cite HFRS as an example of a zoonotic disease which is linked to climate variability and environmental factors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, general predictions and a supporting model of the effects of environmental change on HFRS dynamics have not yet been empirically tested [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Our results in this study suggest that the proposed mechanism would be valuable in broadening our understanding of human exposure to hantaviruses in general.
