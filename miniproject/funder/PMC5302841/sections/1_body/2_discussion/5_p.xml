<p>The HFRS vaccination strategy has been effective and has played an important role in reducing the incidence of HFRS in Hu County [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Despite this, challenges still remain regarding the prevention and control of HFRS outbreaks. It should be noted that the incidence of HFRS evidently rebounded after 2010, even with high vaccination coverage [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Taken together with the empirical data on demography and epidemiology, the results suggest that such erratic HFRS epidemics in the study area may have been generated by high amplitude wildlife oscillations interacting with environmental stochasticity and vaccination coverage. All of this demonstrates that wildlife monitoring and modeling may not only help us to retrospectively understand the dynamics of the system, but may also provide advance warning of an outbreak.
