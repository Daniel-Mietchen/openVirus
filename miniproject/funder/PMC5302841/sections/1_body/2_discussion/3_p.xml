<p>Anthropogenic forcing has been linked to disease dynamics and relations between wildlife hosts, humans, and pathogens [

Our work provides an improved understanding of the mechanistic processes linking anthropogenic environmental change (for instance, land-use change) and disease dynamics. During the study, farmland loss was found to be associated with host resources and carrying capacity, both of which affect wildlife abundance. In addition, over the past three decades there has been a decline in the abundance of
