 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> has adapted to thrive in the ecological landscape created by agriculture. This adaptation amplifies seasonality in both transmission and spillover, which alter the spread of infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The estimated seasonality in the transmission rate shows a bimodal distribution, consistent with the seasonal timing of HFRS cases. Given the distinct roles of wildlife and agricultural activity in transmission, a reasonable explanation for this seasonal pattern is the increase in potential contact between rodents and humans in the dry season due to seasonal agricultural activities. Overall, the combination of both agricultural and seasonal environmental forcing generates a setting in which irregular epidemics arise intrinsically. These findings not only provide evidence for the long-standing hypothesis that environmental change is associated with zoonotic persistence and amplification, but also indicate that the dynamical effects of human-wildlife interactions are dependent on environment-linked processes (
