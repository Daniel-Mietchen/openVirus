<p>Total RNA was extracted from rodent lung tissue with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), the viral RNAs from the sera of patients were extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg total RNA with the RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Canada) in the presence of random hexamers primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The partial S segment sequences were obtained by PCR as described previously [

The PCR products were gel purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA sequencing was performed with the Big Dye Termination Sequencing kit on the ABI-PRISM3730 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and sequences (
