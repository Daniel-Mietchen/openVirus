<p>Human serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies against hantavirus by ELISA. Briefly, the serum samples were diluted 1:10 in PBS and incubated on a microtiter plate containing hantavirus recombinant nucleoprotein. After incubation at 37°C for 1 hour, the plate was washed six times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), then peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at a dilution of 1:10,000 was added. After the incubation and washing steps (described above), tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) substrate was added and incubated at 37°C for 10 mins. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and the plates were read on a microplate reader at 450 nm. A net absorbance value of &gt; 0.15 was considered positive.
