 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. An increase in the number of births during the wet season has been suggested [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and this was observed in the Chencang district from 1984 to 1987, 10 km away from Hu County, corresponding to a greater percentage of pregnant females during the wet seasons (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006198.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Assuming that an increased pregnancy rate is associated with rainfall, we estimated the time-varying seasonal birth rates by monthly rainfall, and set the seasonal birth index,

  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, at a value of 0 (non-breeding season) or 1 (breeding season) according to data provided by reference [
