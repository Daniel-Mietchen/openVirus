<p>Viral antigens in lungs were detected by using direct immuno-fluorescent assay as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Lung tissue samples were cut into 7–8 μm sections on a freezing microtome and fixed in acetone after air drying for at least 30 min. 100μl of FITC-labeled anti-SEOV/L99 or HTNV/76–118 hantavirus nucleoprotein typing monoclonal antibody [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] was pipetted onto each slide. Tissues were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour and washed five times with 0.02 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The samples were considered positive when yellow-green fluorescing hantavirus particles were seen under fluorescence microscopy.
