<p>Neighbor-joining trees of hantaviral S segment sequences were constructed using a GTR + I + Î“4 model in PAUP v4.0b10 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The best-fit phylogenetic model was determined by Modeltest v3.7 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. To assess the robustness of the tree topology, a set of 100 pseudoreplicates was generated and used in bootstrap analyses with the maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in PHYML [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and the neighbor-joining method implemented in PAUP v4.0b10. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree (10 million generations) was also constructed using MrBayes v3.2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Trees were highly congruent to those produced above.
