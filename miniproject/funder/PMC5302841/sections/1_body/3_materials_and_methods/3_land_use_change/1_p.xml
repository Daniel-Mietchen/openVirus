<p>During the study, the major crop production in Hu County was spring wheat and autumn maize, occupying most of the local farmland. We used the phenology of local crop production, together with the spectral features of satellite images, to select Landsat images (with a resolution of 30 m) from March to May and September to October in order to extract the areas of cropland in the Hu area in 1984, 1995, 2001, 2004, 2010 and 2014. A support vector machine (SVM) of supervised classification was applied to perform the classification process in ENVI v4.3 [
