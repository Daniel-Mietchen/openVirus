<p>The study was located in Hu County (108° E, 34° N) on the Loess Plateau of central China, an area of 1,255 km
 <sup>2</sup> and a population of approximately 600,000 people (according to the 2013 Chinese national census). We used the official monthly notification data of HFRS cases from Shaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention and associated demographic data available for Hu County between 1984 and 2014. All HFRS cases were confirmed according to the standard diagnosis set by the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China [

Serum samples were sent to the Shaanxi Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the detection of hantavirus-reactive antibodies. Between 1994 and 2014, a vaccination campaign was conducted in the study area. To assess both the vaccine efficacy and the loss of vaccine efficacy with time elapsed since vaccination, we randomly selected a total of 29,359 people from epidemic and non-epidemic villages in Hu County and monitored them [
