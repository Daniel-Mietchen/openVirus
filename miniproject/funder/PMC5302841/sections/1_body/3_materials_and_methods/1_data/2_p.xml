<p>Starting in 1984, surveillance of the rodent host population density in Hu County has been carried out on a monthly basis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006198.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In each month between 1984 and 2014, rodent trapping was carried out in the fields (farmland or wasteland, 3 km away from villages, which are the habitats for the important rodent reservoirs) in Hu County for three consecutive nights at 9 trapping sites, according to standard protocol from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Snap-traps (medium-sized steel rodent trap, brand name: Golden Cat, Guixi Mousetrap Factory, Jiangxi, China) were baited with peanuts, set each night, and recovered in the morning. At the trapping site, traps were set as 4 parallel lines of 25 traps each and were spaced at 5 m intervals. The trapped rodents were identified to species by species identification experts according to previously described criteria [

Lung tissues were removed from the trapped rodents and stored immediately at –196°C, and then transported to the biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory of Shaanxi CDC for processing. The frozen lungs were sliced with a cryostat (Leica CM1950) and preserved in a refrigerator at –80°C. Tissues and serum specimens for serological or molecular tests were handled during the various laboratory procedures in class II type A2 biosafety cabinets.
