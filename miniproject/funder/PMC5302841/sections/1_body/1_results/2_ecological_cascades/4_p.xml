<p>The magnitude of transmission rate varies with time and corresponds to time-varying contacts between susceptible and infected hosts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, environmental changes lead wildlife hosts to a critical density threshold, below which the virus cannot invade (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, a decreased carrying capacity is associated with loss of farmland area over time (
