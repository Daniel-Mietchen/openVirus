<p>The model supports our dynamical hypothesis, and captures the qualitative pattern of rodent population dynamics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006198.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In particular, the model accurately predicts the unusually low abundance between 2002 and 2005. Our analysis reveals that the exceptional 2002 population crash in autumn breeding could be traced back to a significant food shortage, as crops growing after the spring harvest in our study area were affected by extreme drought in 2002. The extent of this catastrophic drought in the area is illustrated by the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) (
