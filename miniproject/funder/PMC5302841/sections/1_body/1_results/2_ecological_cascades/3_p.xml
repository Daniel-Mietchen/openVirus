<p>The dynamics of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>agrarius</italic> normally undergoes biennial cycles, which was especially the case in the high population densities of 1984 and 2012. However, these population oscillations collapsed in 2002, initiating a population decline (

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>agrarius</italic> in our study area is affected by rainfall and resource availability during the breeding season, and our model was therefore constructed to represent these dynamics (

Bifurcation analysis demonstrates that our model produces stable population dynamics (i.e. stable equilibria, in which population numbers remain constant) at low density under low rainfall or drought scenarios, oscillations with 1â€“2 yrs. periodicity under normal rainfall, and aperiodic and chaotic dynamics (i.e. chaos, in which population numbers change erratically) for strong environmental forcing and abundant rainfall (
