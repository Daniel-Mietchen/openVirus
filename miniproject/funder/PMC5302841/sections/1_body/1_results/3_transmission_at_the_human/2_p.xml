<p>In addition, the number of HFRS cases were clustered on an annual basis during two time periods: June to July, and October to November (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006198.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The cases peaked and coincided with two important annual agricultural events, the spring and autumn harvest. Maize is sown in late October for the spring harvest at the end of May, and wheat is sown in June for the autumn harvest at the end of September and October. These agricultural activities coincide with the two rainy seasons (

 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic>, which tends to live in agricultural fields, initiates its spring breeding season in April–May, and the autumn breeding season starts in August–September [

To summarize, the incidence of HFRS cases peaked during the harvests, when the risk of exposure of farmers to infected rodents in the farmland areas would have increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006198.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, as the average incubation period for HFRS is approximately 3 weeks, ranging from 10 days to 6 weeks [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). We estimated the seasonal variation in the transmission rate explicitly by applying the discrete-time susceptible-infected-recovered model to 30 yrs. of monthly data from the area, and the fit of the full model accounts for 88% of the variability in the HFRS cases (
