<p>Intervention can explain the discrepancy between rodent dynamics and human infections at interannual timescales. In times of high rodent abundance, the response in number of HFRS cases would be expected to be large. However, the number of HFRS cases was low for 2001 and 2012, despite favorable transmission conditions due to high rodent density (

This in turn reduced the number of human hantavirus infections and controlled the susceptible population size, even though the overall human population increased in these decades (see Supporting Information). Most notably, a significant decrease in the number of susceptible individuals was observed after the mass vaccination in 2011 (
