<p>Most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and more than 70% of these originate among wildlife [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Zoonotic disease emergence and reemergence has been hypothesized to be driven by environmental and anthropological variability at the human-wildlife interface [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, recent reviews of our understanding of the determinants of spillover have shown that a critical knowledge-gap [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] exists as we lack empirically validated models of the ecological interactions between humans, wildlife reservoirs and key environmental drivers [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In order to untangle the complexity of zoonotic spillover, combined field surveillance and modeling approaches that link the contacts between humans and wildlife with disease dynamics within the wildlife reservoir are essential [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006198.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, such comprehensive investigations are still lacking for almost all zoonotic disease systems [
