<p>China has the highest incidence of HFRS worldwide. Our study area in central China, Hu County, is one of the main epidemic areas and serves as a national surveillance site to monitor the HFRS situation. Since 1984, a unique longitudinal field study of hantavirus in rodents with additional epidemiological tracking of human incidence has been conducted in the area (
