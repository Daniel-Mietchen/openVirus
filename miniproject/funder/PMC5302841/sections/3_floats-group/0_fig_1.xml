  <title>Hantavirus infections and host dynamics in Hu County of central China, 1984–2014.</title>
  <p>(A) Study area (108° E, 34° N) and sampling sites in Hu County on the Loess Plateau of central China. Crosses indicate rodent sampling sites, squares represent locations of sequences obtained from patients (black) and rodent lungs (red). (B) Mean number of log-transformed reported cases from 1984 to 2014, and the mean monthly rainfall over the same time period, indicating the two peaks of the rainy season (blue line). Monthly number of HFRS cases during the pre-vaccination era (red line): 1984–1993, and vaccination era (orange line): 1994–2014. Blue shaded region gives ±2 standard deviations of rainfall. Arrows indicate bimodal seasonal epidemics. (C) Phylogenetic tree of HTNV in the study area. The black squares represent the sequences obtained from patients, the red squares represent the sequences obtained from rodent lungs (1984–2012), and the hollow squares represent the sequence obtained in this study. (D) The monthly rodent capture rates (black line) and infection rates (red line). All capture rates are expressed as number of rodents caught per 100 trap-nights, infection rates represent number of captured rodent that carry hantavirus per 100 trap-nights. (E) Time series of HFRS cases in Hu County from 1984 to 2014, aggregated monthly.</p>
