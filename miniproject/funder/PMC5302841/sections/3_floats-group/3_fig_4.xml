  <title>Farmland loss and estimated carrying capacity in Hu County, 1984â€“2014.</title>
  <p>Left panel: Land cover maps of Hu County were produced using supervised maximum-likelihood classifications of Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Time series Landsat satellite images, covering the entire city area of Hu County, were used to detect land cover changes, including forest, farmland, building land, bare land, and water. Right panel: Area of farmland (green point) was obtained from remote sensing images, time-varying carrying capacity was estimated from 
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="ppat.1006198.e002">Eq 2</xref>. The green line shows the linear regression of farmland area over time, and the black line represents the estimated carrying capacity, and the grey area indicates the 95% credible intervals.
