  <p>(A) Rodent population density observed (black line), model-simulated density (red line), and rainfall in July (blue line, unit: mm), 1984–2014. The orange-shaded vertical bars indicate periods of drought. Model-predicted and observed density have a correlation of R = 0.73,

The black line indicates the average NDVI value of farmland from July to August, 1984–2014. Error bars give ±2 standard deviations. (C) The effect of seasonal changes in NDVI on rodent survival estimated from
