  <title>Population susceptible to hantavirus over time in Hu County, 1984–2014.</title>
  <p>(A) The predicted population of Hu County that was susceptible (black line) to hantavirus during the time period 1984–2014. The orange line represents the number of vaccinated individuals based on annual records, and the green line is the total population size. (B) Loss of vaccine efficacy over time. The rate of loss of vaccine efficacy was plotted against the amount of time since the last vaccine dose was received, based on data from our longitudinal studies. The best fit of the logarithmic relationship is shown. These estimates show a logarithmic increase in loss of vaccine efficacy over time since the last vaccine dose was received (orange), consistent with a loss in efficacy of 0.02% per year.</p>
