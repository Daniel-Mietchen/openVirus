  <title>Hantaan virus (HTNV) of S segment sequences in China.</title>
  <p>(A) Map of China, showing the distribution of the S segment of HTNV; the red dot is our study area. (B) Genetic map of HTNV; the HTNV strains present in our study area from 1984 to 2012 are clustered in one branch. (C) Phylogenetic tree of HTNV. The tree was inferred with the Bayesian method using MrBayes. Numerical values at each node indicate posterior probabilities; only values greater than 70% are shown. Sequences obtained from the study area are shown in the red boxes.</p>
