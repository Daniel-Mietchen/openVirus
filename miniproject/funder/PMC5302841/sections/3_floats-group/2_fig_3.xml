   <italic>agrarius</italic> abundance predicted by the environment-based wildlife dynamic model as a function of the environmental forcing parameter 
   <italic>δ</italic> (Eqs. 12, 13, see Supporting Information). The system heads toward extinction with drought, followed by stable population dynamics with densities that increase as rainfall increases, followed by outbreaks with abundant rainfall and amplitudes that increase with rainfall. Precipitation status (drought/normal/abundant rainfall) is quantified by the corresponding environmental forcing intensity, 
   <italic>δ</italic>, which ranged from 0 to 4.5. (B) Lyapunov exponent versus environmental forcing, predicted by the environment-based wildlife dynamic model. The black line shows the Lyapunov exponent calculated over 100 years with average environmental forcing.
