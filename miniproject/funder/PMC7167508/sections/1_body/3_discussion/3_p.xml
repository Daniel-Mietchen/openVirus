<p id="para300">Other studies have found merit in geo-targeted HIV control in African settings, particularly when hotspots comprise large numbers of people infected with HIV.

 </xref> For example, a study in Kenya found that geo-targeted HIV control was more effective than universal approaches even without considering the potential indirect benefits to surrounding areas.

 </xref> In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a hotspot along a major highway was shown to be an important corridor of HIV incidence with substantial phylogenetic linkage to surrounding populations.

 </xref> Studies of gonorrhoea have also shown localised clustering of cases, and the impact of geo-targeted interventions to these areas.

 </xref> However, empirical and modelling studies of other infectious diseases identified several factors affecting the potential effects of targeting hotspots, including the connectivity between hotspots and other areas, the reproductive numbers of infections in each location, and the timing of interventions.
