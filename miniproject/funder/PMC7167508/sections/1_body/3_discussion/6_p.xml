<p id="para330">In conclusion, we found that the HIV hotspots along Lake Victoria in Uganda, which have been hypothesised to be driving the inland epidemic in east Africa, are not a major source of HIV transmissions to the larger, lower prevalence inland populations. Lake Victoria fishing communities should be targeted for HIV control and treatment because of their high HIV burden; however, interventions in these communities are unlikely to have a broader effect on transmissions that occur inland because of their limited connectivity to inland epidemics and the relatively infrequent flow of infection between coastal and inland communities. This study cautions against equating and stigmatising high prevalence disease hotspots as population groups that drive disease spread elsewhere. More empirical studies are needed to guide modelling efforts aimed at accurately estimating the potential effect of targeted interventions.</p>
