 </xref> However, these approaches require modelling assumptions to infer the directionality of transmission between populations. By contrast, transmission flows can be estimated directly from analyses of deep-sequence data that account for within-host HIV diversity and ancestral relationships between viruses.

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> We have previously validated deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses in the Rakai population and showed that although our methods cannot prove direct transmission between two individuals, the direction of transmission can be inferred with sufficient accuracy for epidemiological analysis.

 </xref> In this analytical framework, we were further able to adjust for differential sampling of the population, and obtain population-level estimates of transmission flows, which is otherwise challenging. Although fishing communities have been assumed to be major sources of HIV transmission within east Africa,

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> our findings did not support this theory. This work highlights the use of phylogenetic approaches to not only identify but also rule out groups suspected of driving HIV spread.
