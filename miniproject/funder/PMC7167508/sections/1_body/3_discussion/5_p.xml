<p id="para320">This study has limitations. First, the RCCS surveys a subset of the inland and Lake Victoria fishing communities in Rakai, Uganda. Although the sampling fraction within our communities was high, our methodological approach and hence the generalisability of our findings rests on the assumption that unobserved transmissions are missing at random within each pairwise combination of the population groups.

 </xref> This assumption means that including a community into the cohort did not depend on the number of HIV transmissions in or out of it, and implies that estimates of viral flow can be obtained by scaling the observed flows between RCCS communities to the populations living in inland and lakeside areas (

Notably, around 30% of censused individuals did not participate in the RCCS, primarily because they were travelling for work or school, and we cannot exclude the possibility that omission of this population group might have biased our inferences. Third, we have previously reported on the quality of our deep sequence data, which was poor in some cases,

 </xref> although in sensitivity analyses reported in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 21)</xref>, we found that excluding lower quality reads did not impact study inferences. Fourth, people who were infected with HIV and on ART were excluded from this study potentially biasing our conclusions. However, ART coverage was higher in inland than in fishing communities over our analysis period,

 </xref> and so it is probable that we would have missed more transmissions from inland to fishing communities by excluding participants on ART, most of whom have suppressed viraemia. Fifth, herein we analysed around 300 phylogenetically likely sourceâ€“recipient pairs, which constitute a limited sample of the actual transmission events that occurred during the observation period. Our estimates were adjusted for observed group differences in study participation, sequence sampling, and the population surveyed, but it is possible that unmeasured or unknown factors could have influenced our findings. This study is based on a population-based sample from Rakai, Uganda, between August, 2011, and January, 2015, and thus provides a snapshot of the HIV transmission dynamics between high-prevalence fishing communities and low-prevalence inland areas in this relatively recent time period. Thus, the dynamics observed in this study might not be reflective of those in the more distant past or moving forward, particularly with continued scale-up of HIV treatment and declining HIV incidence across the region, and our findings might not be applicable to hotspots in other settings.
