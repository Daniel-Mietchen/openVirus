<p id="para280">Understanding the extent to which geographical areas with a high HIV burden contribute to transmission in neighbouring lower prevalence populations is important for guiding targeted HIV control efforts. In this study, we reconstructed HIV transmission networks in southern Uganda using deep-sequence HIV phylogenetics. We then integrated these data with individual-level information on migration to assess whether high HIV burden fishing communities (around 40% prevalence) along Lake Victoria are major sources of HIV transmission to larger, lower prevalence inland communities (around 14% prevalence). Previously, it has been shown that Lake Victoria fishing communities are geographical hotspots of HIV prevalence and incidence in the east Africa region.

Furthermore, among the few infections between lakeside and inland areas, transmission flow is more than twice as likely to be from inland to fishing areas than vice versa. These results add to earlier findings from smaller Ugandan studies suggesting that the epidemic on the Lake Victoria shores is distinct from that in the east African inland.
