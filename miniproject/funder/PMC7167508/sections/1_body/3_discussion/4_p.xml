<p id="para310">HIV spreads between geographical areas through two mechanisms: when infection is spread between sexual partners from different communities of residence, and when infection is spread by migration of people infected with HIV. Our results suggest the importance of both mechanisms with each accounting for approximately half of transmissions spanning fishing and inland areas. Migration was common with a quarter of the RCCS population classified as recent in-migrants (moved within 2 years). Previous studies across sub-Saharan Africa have shown that migrants who are HIV-negative are at higher risk of HIV acquisition, and migrants who are HIV-positive are less likely to be virally suppressed.

 </xref> Despite these findings, we did not find that migrants were at a significantly higher risk of onward transmission compared with residents. However, we found that overall, men disproportionately contributed to onward HIV transmission compared with women, and that in particular, the male to female transmission bias was greatest among men who reside (ie, did not in-migrate) in inland communities compared with women who reside in inland communities. This discrepancy in transmission by sex could partly explain why the female to male HIV prevalence ratio exceeds unity throughout sub-Saharan Africa,
