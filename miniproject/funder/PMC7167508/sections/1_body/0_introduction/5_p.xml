<p id="para110">Here, we integrated viral phylogenetic and epidemiological data to empirically measure HIV transmission flows between high HIV prevalence hotspots on Lake Victoria and larger neighbouring inland populations with substantially lower HIV burden in the Rakai region of southern Uganda. We reconstructed directed, partial HIV-1 transmission networks using deep-sequence viral phylogenetic data. Given the high population mobility, networks were interpreted in conjunction with individual-level data for migration patterns to measure transmission flows between fishing and inland communities. We hypothesised that the predominant mode of cross-community infection would be from the high-prevalence hotspots on Lake Victoria to the lower prevalence inland population.</p>
