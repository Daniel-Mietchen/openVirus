<p id="para90">With respect to HIV, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund, WHO, and UNAIDS among others have advocated geographical targeting of HIV control interventions to hotspots.

 </xref> Although targeting interventions to high-burden populations is ethically justified, and necessary for reducing HIV morbidity and mortality, it is unclear whether such focused approaches would also reduce transmission more broadly. In some cases, HIV hotspots and other high-prevalence groups have been directly or implicitly assumed to constitute core groups disproportionately disseminating infection to the wider transmission network.
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This assumption, while potentially stigmatising for residents living in hotspots, implies that geographically focused interventions would not only have a direct impact in the targeted geographies but also indirect benefits in the broader population. However, this theory of infection flow from high to low burden populations is rarely confirmed in practice, in part because it is difficult to empirically measure.
