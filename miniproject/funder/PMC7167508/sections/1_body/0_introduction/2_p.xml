  <p id="para40">High-resolution spatial mapping of HIV disease prevalence revealed numerous geographical hotspots of high prevalence throughout the African continent. This information is used to target public health interventions to hyperendemic communities to maximise cost-effectiveness of interventions, and often with the implicit assumption that HIV hotspots serve as sources of transmission to the larger, low prevalence populations. We searched PubMed for all article types published between database inception and April 15, 2019, using search terms related to “HIV”, “hotspots”, “core groups”, “spatial”, and “Africa”. Few studies have investigated the flow of HIV infection between foci of high prevalence (ie, hotspots) and relatively lower prevalence areas using empirical methods. East African communities along Lake Victoria represent some of the highest prevalence communities worldwide with levels greater than three times those in the inland population. One previous study investigated direction of HIV flow between Lake Victoria fishing and inland communities in Uganda using phylogenetic analysis of HIV consensus sequences. However, this study did not identify linkages between inland and fishing communities because of low sampling fractions, and was unable to quantify the flow of infection between the populations. Furthermore, it did not integrate data for population mobility patterns.</p>

  <p id="para60">In this study, we used HIV deep sequence data from a population-based sample to reconstruct directed HIV transmission networks, and examine the epidemic dynamics between geographical hotspots with high HIV burden along Lake Victoria and surrounding inland communities. We used data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, an open population-based cohort that provided a high sampling fraction of the communities, which is rare in phylogenetic studies, as well as detailed information on individual-level human migration patterns. We integrated HIV phylogenetic and human migration data, and showed that Lake Victoria and inland epidemics are largely distinct based on a sample of 293 phylogenetically highly supported transmission pairs. Where there is cross-community transmission, it is predominantly from inland to Lake Victoria fishing communities and not vice versa. We also show that men are more likely than women to transmit HIV, and that migrants do not contribute to onward HIV transmission in excess of their prevalence in the population.</p>

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para80">Our findings showed that within sub-Saharan Africa, HIV transmission networks in high prevalence areas can be largely disconnected from those in adjacent lower prevalence populations, and caution against equating and stigmatising HIV hotspots in sub-Saharan Africa universally as population groups that drive disease spread. Geographical targeting of high prevalence areas is essential for local populations in hotspots, but under the same conditions as in the fishing communities of the Rakai Community Cohort Study would have a limited effect on the HIV epidemic in neighbouring lower prevalence communities.</p>
