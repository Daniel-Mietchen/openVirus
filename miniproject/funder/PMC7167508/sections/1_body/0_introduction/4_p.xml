<p id="para100">In sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of new HIV infections worldwide occur, hotspots include fishing communities bordering the Great Lakes of east and central Africa. These communities typically have a high HIV prevalence, ranging from 20% to 40%, and HIV incidence exceeding 3% annually.
