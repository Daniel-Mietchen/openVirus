 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> From a public health perspective, a primary objective of mapping efforts is the identification of so-called hotspots—typically defined as spatial clusters of elevated disease burden or transmission efficiency—to target the highest risk populations, and maximise the public health effect of interventions.

 </xref> Geographically focused approaches to disease control are supported by modelling studies, which suggest that targeting a small proportion of the population with elevated contact rates and disease incidence (ie, a core group) relative to the overall population has the potential to avert most infections, otherwise known as the 80/20 rule.

 </xref> However, the overall projected impact of targeted interventions depends on the rate of transmission from core groups to the rest of the population.
