<p id="para270">An estimated 22·1% (95% CrI 17·3–27·5) of all transmissions originated from in-migrants, which was not larger than the proportion of participants who were infected who were in-migrants (

We further suspected that migration of individuals who were HIV-positive could have a larger effect specifically on cross-community transmissions between fishing and inland communities, and thus we quantified the proportion of cross-community transmissions that resulted from migration (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>). An estimated 42·2% (95% CrI 26·1–59·7) of cross-community transmissions originated from residents of inland communities who had partners in fishing communities (or vice versa from residents of fishing communities who had partners in inland communities), and 57·8% (95% CrI 40·3–73·9) originated from in-migrants from inland communities to fishing communities who had partners in fishing communities (or vice versa).
