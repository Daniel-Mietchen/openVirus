 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the transmission flows inferred among the 293 source–recipient pairs. 235 (80·2%) transmission events occurred within inland communities or within fishing communities, 30 (10·4%) occurred between them, 23 (7·8%) were from outside the Rakai region, and five (1·7%) had an unknown source location (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table</xref>). There were more transmissions from inland to fishing communities than vice versa (23
