<p id="para240">After adjusting for variation in participation and sequencing rates, an estimated 80·1% (95% credibility interval [Crl] 75·1–84·6) of transmissions were within inland communities or within fishing communities, 7·8% (5·1–11·3) were from inland to fishing communities, 3·5% (1·7–6·3) were from fishing to inland communities, 5·8% (3·5–8·9) were from outside the Rakai region to fishing communities, and 2·5% (1·0–5·0) were from outside the Rakai region to inland communities (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table</xref>). Considering that the study population comprised an estimated 16·2% of the inland population and 75·7% of the lakeside population of the region where the RCCS survey was done, it is only possible to interpret the combined estimate of transmission flows within inland and within fishing communities. The estimated adjusted flow ratio from inland to fishing communities was 2·25 (95% CrI 1·04–5·23).
