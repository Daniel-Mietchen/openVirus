<p id="para250">We next scaled the adjusted estimates within and between RCCS communities to the populations living in inland and lakeside areas of the Rakai region shown in

The predicted proportion of transmissions was 88·7% (95% CrI 84·5–91·9) within the inland area, 5·2% (3·8–7·0) within the lakeside area, 4·3% (2·3–7·0) from inland to lakeside areas, and 1·7% (0·6–3·5) from lakeside to inland areas (
