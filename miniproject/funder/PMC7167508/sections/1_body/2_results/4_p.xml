<p id="para220">From the population-based deep-sequencing data, 446 HIV transmission networks were reconstructed, which included 293 source–recipient pairs with strong phylogenetic support for epidemiological linkage and the direction of transmission (

 </xref> we expected that for approximately 800 (30·2%) of the 2652 sampled individuals, our data also contain sequences from their transmitter, suggesting that phylogenetic analysis probably did not identify all transmission events between sampled individuals. In 57 (19·5%) of the source–recipient pairs, the likely transmitter had migrated in the 2 years before diagnosis of the recipient, suggesting that the current residence of the likely transmitter at the time of the survey was not necessarily the location at which they acquired infection. We defined the source location for these 57 pairs as the origin of migration of the likely transmitter. Sensitivity analyses that re-defined the source location for likely transmitters who in-migrated in 6, 12, 36, and 48 months before diagnosis of the recipient are reported in the
