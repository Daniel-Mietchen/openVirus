<p id="para260">An estimated 59·7% (95% CrI 53·9–65·3) of transmissions in RCCS communities originated from men, whereas the majority of infected participants were women (3149 [61·2%] of 5142). To investigate this transmission bias, we stratified the source populations in inland and fishing communities by sex and migration status (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4A</xref>). The gender bias was larger in inland communities than fishing communities (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>). Further, in inland communities, the ratio in transmissions from in-migrating men compared with in-migrating women was 1·07 (95% CrI 0·44–2·66), and the ratio of transmissions from resident men compared with resident women was 2·26 (1·45–3·62). In fishing communities, the ratio in transmissions from in-migrating men compared with in-migrating women was 1·11 (95% CrI 0·57–2·16), and the ratio of transmissions from resident men compared with resident women was 1·30 (0·94–1·82).
