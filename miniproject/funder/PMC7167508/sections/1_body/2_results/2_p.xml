In the four RCCS fishing communities, 837 (48·2%) in-migrants originated from outside the Rakai area, 32 (1·8%) from locations on the shores of Lake Victoria, 536 (30·9%) from inland locations in the Rakai area, and 331 (19·1%) had no resolved source location. In the RCCS inland communities, 1873 (39·2%) in-migrants originated from outside the Rakai area, 27 (0·6%) from locations on the shores of Lake Victoria, 2062 (43·2%) from inland locations in the Rakai area, and 813 (17·0%) had no resolved source location. The proportion of in-migrants among study participants was similar in inland and fishing communities (24·1% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 28·5%), but substantially more participants migrated from inland to fishing communities (n=536) than vice versa (n=27). Among the in-migrants who moved into fishing communities, HIV prevalence was significantly higher than among in-migrants who moved into inland communities (
