<p id="para120">We did a population-based study using data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) in 36 inland communities of the Rakai region in south-central Uganda shown in

 </xref> The data were collected in two survey rounds in inland communities, and three survey rounds in fishing communities. For each survey round, the RCCS did a household census with GPS coding of household location, followed by a survey of consenting eligible participants aged 15â€“49 years to ascertain sociodemographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviours, health, and health service use. The RCCS included all age-eligible individuals capable of providing informed consent and resident within the RCCS communities for at least 1 month with the intention to stay. Detailed information was collected on migration history and sexual partners within the past year. HIV status was determined through rapid tests at the time of survey, and confirmatory enzyme immunoassays. All participants were provided with pre-test and post-test counselling, and referral of individuals who were HIV-positive for ART. Individuals were identified using permanent population identifiers, confirmed by photo identification. The last available HIV test result in the observation period was used to establish the infection status of participants (
