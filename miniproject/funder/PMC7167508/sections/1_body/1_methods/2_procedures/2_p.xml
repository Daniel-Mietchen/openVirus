<p id="para160">To interpret reconstructed sourceâ€“recipient pairs in the context of population mobility, migrants were identified at census and defined as people who had moved into a community regardless of distance travelled or whether or not the source community was under RCCS surveillance (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1C</xref>). To be included in the survey, in-migrating individuals were required to have stayed in the community for at least 1 month or, if this was not the case, they intend to stay in the community for 6 months or longer. In-migrating individuals were classified as such if they in-migrated into the cohort community within 2 years before their first visit in the observation period, and otherwise they were classified as residents. To estimate transmission flows, phylogenetically likely sources were classified as in-migrants if they in-migrated into the cohort in the 2 years before the date at which their transmission recipient was found to be infected, and it was assumed that the individual acquired infection at the community of origin. The community of origin of migration was recorded as a free response variable and geo-coded using Google Earth by Ugandan co-investigators with local expertise. Sensitivity analyses using alternative definitions of in-migrants are described in the
