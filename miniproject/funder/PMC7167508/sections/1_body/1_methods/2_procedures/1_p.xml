<p id="para150">To infer transmission networks by phylogenetic analysis, viral sequencing was done on plasma blood samples from all individuals who were infected with HIV who self-reported being ART-naive at the time of the survey. This selection criterion was motivated by the fact that self-reported ART use reflected actual ART use with high specificity and sensitivity, and that 90% of individuals who reported ART use had suppressed virus less than 1000 copies per mL of plasma,

 </xref> To capture uncertainty in phylogenetic inferences, phylogenetic relationships were evaluated in a large number of deep-sequence phylogenies sliding across the HIV genome. Pairs of individuals with evidence for phylogenetic linkage and transmission in one direction in at least 60% of phylogeny evaluations were identified and considered to be highly supported source–recipient pairs. The threshold was determined in analysis of pairs with epidemiological evidence on the direction of transmission.
