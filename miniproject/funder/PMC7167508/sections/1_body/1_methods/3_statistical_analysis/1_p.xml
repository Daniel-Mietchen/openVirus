<p id="para170">Individual geo-location and migration data were used to attribute source and destination locations for each source–recipient pair. The geo-location of each recipient in a pair was set to the community in which the recipient was found to be infected. For the phylogenetically likely source partner, the location was set to the community of residence at or shortly before the recipient was identified as HIV-positive. If the source partner had migrated within the past 2 years, the location was set as the community before migration. To estimate transmission flows in the cohort, we first counted the proportion of source–recipient pairs by source and destination locations (unadjusted estimates). Next, we adjusted for differential RCCS participation and sequence sampling rates by individual-level characteristics with Bayesian multilevel models as detailed in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 12)</xref> using the phyloflows R package version 1.1.0. Finally, we predicted transmissions flows between inland and fishing areas (predictions). To do this, we scaled the adjusted estimates of transmission flows between RCCS communities by the number of men and women in inland and fishing areas as detailed in the
