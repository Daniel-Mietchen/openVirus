  <p>HIV prevalence and migration in inland and fishing communities</p>
  <p>(A) Estimates of HIV prevalence in RCCS communities for men (blue) and women (pink) in inland communities (left panel) and fishing communities (right panel). Boxplots indicate central estimates (black bar), IQRs (box), and 95% credibility intervals (whiskers). HIV prevalence was substantially higher in fishing communities for both men and women. (B) Number of RCCS participants in inland and fishing communities by in-migration status. Participants who in-migrated within 2 years before study visit were stratified by the origin of migration, from inland communities (green), from fishing communities (purple), from outside the Rakai area (light blue), and from unknown location (grey). (C) Estimates of HIV prevalence among in-migrants to inland communities to that among in-migrants to fishing communities. HIV prevalence was higher among those individuals migrating to fishing communities than those migrating to inland communities. Sex specific estimates in panels A and C were obtained with Bayesian logistic regression models using the Stan software, version 2.19.</p>
