To better understand the potential benefits of geo-targeted control, we assessed the extent to which HIV hotspots along Lake Victoria sustain transmission in neighbouring populations in south-central Uganda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a population-based survey in Rakai, Uganda, using data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study. The study surveyed all individuals aged 15&#x02013;49 years in four high-prevalence Lake Victoria fishing communities and 36 neighbouring inland communities. Viral RNA was deep sequenced from participants infected with HIV who were antiretroviral therapy-naive during the observation period. Phylogenetic analysis was used to infer partial HIV transmission networks, including direction of transmission. Reconstructed networks were interpreted through data for current residence and migration history. HIV transmission flows within and between high-prevalence and low-prevalence areas were quantified adjusting for incomplete sampling of the population.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Between Aug 10, 2011, and Jan 30, 2015, data were collected for the Rakai Community Cohort Study. 25&#x02008;882 individuals participated, including an estimated 75&#x000b7;7% of the lakeside population and 16&#x000b7;2% of the inland population in the Rakai region of Uganda. 5142 participants were HIV-positive (2703 [13&#x000b7;7%] in inland and 2439 [40&#x000b7;1%] in fishing communities). 3878 (75&#x000b7;4%) people who were HIV-positive did not report antiretroviral therapy use, of whom 2652 (68&#x000b7;4%) had virus deep-sequenced at sufficient quality for phylogenetic analysis. 446 transmission networks were reconstructed, including 293 linked pairs with inferred direction of transmission. Adjusting for incomplete sampling, an estimated 5&#x000b7;7% (95% credibility interval 4&#x000b7;4&#x02013;7&#x000b7;3) of transmissions occurred within lakeside areas, 89&#x000b7;2% (86&#x000b7;0&#x02013;91&#x000b7;8) within inland areas, 1&#x000b7;3% (0&#x000b7;6&#x02013;2&#x000b7;6) from lakeside to inland areas, and 3&#x000b7;7% (2&#x000b7;3&#x02013;5&#x000b7;8) from inland to lakeside areas.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Cross-community HIV transmissions between Lake Victoria hotspots and surrounding inland populations are infrequent and when they occur, virus more commonly flows into rather than out of hotspots. This result suggests that targeted interventions to these hotspots will not alone control the epidemic in inland populations, where most transmissions occur.

We searched PubMed for all article types published between database inception and April 15, 2019, using search terms related to &#x0201c;HIV&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;hotspots&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;core groups&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;spatial&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Africa&#x0201d;. Few studies have investigated the flow of HIV infection between foci of high prevalence (ie, hotspots) and relatively lower prevalence areas using empirical methods. East African communities along Lake Victoria represent some of the highest prevalence communities worldwide with levels greater than three times those in the inland population. One previous study investigated direction of HIV flow between Lake Victoria fishing and inland communities in Uganda using phylogenetic analysis of HIV consensus sequences. However, this study did not identify linkages between inland and fishing communities because of low sampling fractions, and was unable to quantify the flow of infection between the populations. Furthermore, it did not integrate data for population mobility patterns.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">In this study, we used HIV deep sequence data from a population-based sample to reconstruct directed HIV transmission networks, and examine the epidemic dynamics between geographical hotspots with high HIV burden along Lake Victoria and surrounding inland communities. We used data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, an open population-based cohort that provided a high sampling fraction of the communities, which is rare in phylogenetic studies, as well as detailed information on individual-level human migration patterns. We integrated HIV phylogenetic and human migration data, and showed that Lake Victoria and inland epidemics are largely distinct based on a sample of 293 phylogenetically highly supported transmission pairs. Where there is cross-community transmission, it is predominantly from inland to Lake Victoria fishing communities and not vice versa. We also show that men are more likely than women to transmit HIV, and that migrants do not contribute to onward HIV transmission in excess of their prevalence in the population.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">Our findings showed that within sub-Saharan Africa, HIV transmission networks in high prevalence areas can be largely disconnected from those in adjacent lower prevalence populations, and caution against equating and stigmatising HIV hotspots in sub-Saharan Africa universally as population groups that drive disease spread. Geographical targeting of high prevalence areas is essential for local populations in hotspots, but under the same conditions as in the fishing communities of the Rakai Community Cohort Study would have a limited effect on the HIV epidemic in neighbouring lower prevalence communities.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">With respect to HIV, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund, WHO, and UNAIDS among others have advocated geographical targeting of HIV control interventions to hotspots.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These recommendations include calls for HIV elimination in the USA, based on targeting of geographical hotspots to &#x0201c;disrupt the kinetics of HIV spread&#x0201d;.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Although targeting interventions to high-burden populations is ethically justified, and necessary for reducing HIV morbidity and mortality, it is unclear whether such focused approaches would also reduce transmission more broadly.

The RCCS included all age-eligible individuals capable of providing informed consent and resident within the RCCS communities for at least 1 month with the intention to stay. Detailed information was collected on migration history and sexual partners within the past year. HIV status was determined through rapid tests at the time of survey, and confirmatory enzyme immunoassays. All participants were provided with pre-test and post-test counselling, and referral of individuals who were HIV-positive for ART.

In this study, we reconstructed HIV transmission networks in southern Uganda using deep-sequence HIV phylogenetics. We then integrated these data with individual-level information on migration to assess whether high HIV burden fishing communities (around 40% prevalence) along Lake Victoria are major sources of HIV transmission to larger, lower prevalence inland communities (around 14% prevalence). Previously, it has been shown that Lake Victoria fishing communities are geographical hotspots of HIV prevalence and incidence in the east Africa region.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, our results showed that HIV acquisition in the southern Ugandan inland is largely unrelated to the Lake Victoria epidemic. Furthermore, among the few infections between lakeside and inland areas, transmission flow is more than twice as likely to be from inland to fishing areas than vice versa. These results add to earlier findings from smaller Ugandan studies suggesting that the epidemic on the Lake Victoria shores is distinct from that in the east African inland.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Our results, along with previous research, imply that targeted control in these lakeside hotspots, while essential for the local population, would have minimal effect on the epidemic in the larger inland populations, which we found accounts for the vast majority of total transmissions (around 90%).</p><p id="para290">Transmission flows between high and low prevalence populations have previously been assessed through phylogenetic analyses of consensus genomes.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, these approaches require modelling assumptions to infer the directionality of transmission between populations. By contrast, transmission flows can be estimated directly from analyses of deep-sequence data that account for within-host HIV diversity and ancestral relationships between viruses.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> We have previously validated deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses in the Rakai population and showed that although our methods cannot prove direct transmission between two individuals, the direction of transmission can be inferred with sufficient accuracy for epidemiological analysis.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In this analytical framework, we were further able to adjust for differential sampling of the population, and obtain population-level estimates of transmission flows, which is otherwise challenging. Although fishing communities have been assumed to be major sources of HIV transmission within east Africa,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> our findings did not support this theory. This work highlights the use of phylogenetic approaches to not only identify but also rule out groups suspected of driving HIV spread.</p><p id="para300">Other studies have found merit in geo-targeted HIV control in African settings, particularly when hotspots comprise large numbers of people infected with HIV.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> For example, a study in Kenya found that geo-targeted HIV control was more effective than universal approaches even without considering the potential indirect benefits to surrounding areas.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a hotspot along a major highway was shown to be an important corridor of HIV incidence with substantial phylogenetic linkage to surrounding populations.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Studies of gonorrhoea have also shown localised clustering of cases, and the impact of geo-targeted interventions to these areas.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, empirical and modelling studies of other infectious diseases identified several factors affecting the potential effects of targeting hotspots, including the connectivity between hotspots and other areas, the reproductive numbers of infections in each location, and the timing of interventions.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p id="para310">HIV spreads between geographical areas through two mechanisms: when infection is spread between sexual partners from different communities of residence, and when infection is spread by migration of people infected with HIV. Our results suggest the importance of both mechanisms with each accounting for approximately half of transmissions spanning fishing and inland areas. Migration was common with a quarter of the RCCS population classified as recent in-migrants (moved within 2 years). Previous studies across sub-Saharan Africa have shown that migrants who are HIV-negative are at higher risk of HIV acquisition, and migrants who are HIV-positive are less likely to be virally suppressed.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Despite these findings, we did not find that migrants were at a significantly higher risk of onward transmission compared with residents. However, we found that overall, men disproportionately contributed to onward HIV transmission compared with women, and that in particular, the male to female transmission bias was greatest among men who reside (ie, did not in-migrate) in inland communities compared with women who reside in inland communities. This discrepancy in transmission by sex could partly explain why the female to male HIV prevalence ratio exceeds unity throughout sub-Saharan Africa,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and emphasises the growing urgency for interventions targeted to men who are HIV-positive.</p><p id="para320">This study has limitations. First, the RCCS surveys a subset of the inland and Lake Victoria fishing communities in Rakai, Uganda. Although the sampling fraction within our communities was high, our methodological approach and hence the generalisability of our findings rests on the assumption that unobserved transmissions are missing at random within each pairwise combination of the population groups.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> This assumption means that including a community into the cohort did not depend on the number of HIV transmissions in or out of it, and implies that estimates of viral flow can be obtained by scaling the observed flows between RCCS communities to the populations living in inland and lakeside areas (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 18</xref>). This study also did not capture short-term mobility patterns. Notably, around 30% of censused individuals did not participate in the RCCS, primarily because they were travelling for work or school, and we cannot exclude the possibility that omission of this population group might have biased our inferences. Third, we have previously reported on the quality of our deep sequence data, which was poor in some cases,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> although in sensitivity analyses reported in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 21)</xref>, we found that excluding lower quality reads did not impact study inferences. Fourth, people who were infected with HIV and on ART were excluded from this study potentially biasing our conclusions. However, ART coverage was higher in inland than in fishing communities over our analysis period,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and so it is probable that we would have missed more transmissions from inland to fishing communities by excluding participants on ART, most of whom have suppressed viraemia. Fifth, herein we analysed around 300 phylogenetically likely source&#x02013;recipient pairs, which constitute a limited sample of the actual transmission events that occurred during the observation period. Our estimates were adjusted for observed group differences in study participation, sequence sampling, and the population surveyed, but it is possible that unmeasured or unknown factors could have influenced our findings. This study is based on a population-based sample from Rakai, Uganda, between August, 2011, and January, 2015, and thus provides a snapshot of the HIV transmission dynamics between high-prevalence fishing communities and low-prevalence inland areas in this relatively recent time period. Thus, the dynamics observed in this study might not be reflective of those in the more distant past or moving forward, particularly with continued scale-up of HIV treatment and declining HIV incidence across the region, and our findings might not be applicable to hotspots in other settings.</p><p id="para330">In conclusion, we found that the HIV hotspots along Lake Victoria in Uganda, which have been hypothesised to be driving the inland epidemic in east Africa, are not a major source of HIV transmissions to the larger, lower prevalence inland populations. Lake Victoria fishing communities should be targeted for HIV control and treatment because of their high HIV burden; however, interventions in these communities are unlikely to have a broader effect on transmissions that occur inland because of their limited connectivity to inland epidemics and the relatively infrequent flow of infection between coastal and inland communities. This study cautions against equating and stigmatising high prevalence disease hotspots as population groups that drive disease spread elsewhere. More empirical studies are needed to guide modelling efforts aimed at accurately estimating the potential effect of targeted interventions.</p><p id="para331"><boxed-text id="cetextbox11"><p id="para332"><bold>This online publication has been corrected.
