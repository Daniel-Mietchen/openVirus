<p>RVF is transmitted to humans and other mammalian hosts, both livestock and wild ruminants (
 <italic>e.g</italic>. cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels) through mosquito (
 <italic>e.g</italic>. 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Ædes</italic> spp. and

 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Ædine mosquitoes are capable of transovarial (= vertical) transmission of RVFv to the eggs, which can survive long droughts (several years) and hatch when new water arrives during 
 <italic>e.g</italic>. the ENSO phenomenon, resulting in infected larvæ and adult mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The highest risk for humans to become infected is through direct and indirect contact with infectious animal materials (blood, body fluids or tissues of viræmic animals). Ærosol formation during 
 <italic>e.g</italic>. milking or consumption of raw milk, meat or blood form another risk for transmission [
