<p>Quantitative analysis and simulation modelling of RVFv dynamics have been undertaken on several occasions. Note that the list that follows cites only typical examples and that many more publications exist dealing with RVF modelling. The analytical models use environmental characteristics and range from post-hoc predictions of where outbreaks were to be expected during the 2006-2007 epidemic in East Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] over statistical modelling in order to identify landscape features related to RVFv transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to the identification of ranges of potential vectors [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Simulation models include temporal models using differential equations [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with extensions to spatial components [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Risk analysis of introduction into new territory (
 <italic>in casu</italic> The Netherlands) [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] has also been carried out. An overview of compartmental models, applied to the simulation of RVF dynamics, is provided by Danzetta and colleagues [
