<p>The existing models all suffer from being closed, inaccessible and specialised. The combination of R/RStudio
 <sup>Â®</sup> with the libraries 
 <monospace>shiny</monospace> and 
 <monospace>deSolve</monospace> offers the possibility to develop open-source, easily applicable, accessible and modifiable models that can, on the one hand, be adapted to a specific situation with minimal programming effort and, on the other hand, be perused by the epidemiological researcher to study different scenarios and/or the effects of different parameter settings. The model presented here has been developed for the specific situation in East Africa, but as explained above, it can easily be adapted to other areas/situations, mostly by switching on or off certain parameters or parameter groups or by the inclusion of extensions with minimal new coding. The model presented in this paper is thus to be considered a research tool, allowing the user to study the effect(s) of different scenarios in order to better understand RVFv transmission dynamics and the mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors involved, and ultimately to assist in the formulation of new research questions. The model is not a predictive tool, as too much uncertainty still exists with regards to the actual dynamics of inter-epidemic transmission of the virus.
