<p>El Niño events are currently modelled to occur every ten years. Additionally, the user is given the opportunity to include annual overall climate variability through the choice of a random series of ‘dry’ or ‘wet’ years and a seasonal within-year variation in egg eclosion to model seasonal effects on vector population size. Finally, there is the possibility of including a ‘fixed’ annual domestic animal movements between zones 1 and 2, simulating seasonal transhumance of (
 <italic>e.g</italic>.) cattle between the plateau and the floodplain. Details are to be found in 
 <bold>Seasonality and El Niño effect</bold>.
