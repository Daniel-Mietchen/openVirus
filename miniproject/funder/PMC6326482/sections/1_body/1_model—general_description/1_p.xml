<p>The model describes the RVFv transmission dynamics in six species (human population, domestic animal population and four vectors) in three different areas. The model attempts to offer maximal flexibility, whilst remaining manageable. The model allows for migration of the various species between the different areas. The different compartments in the model are presented in
