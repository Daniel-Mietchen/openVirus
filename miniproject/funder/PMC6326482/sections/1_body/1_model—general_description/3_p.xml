<p>A challenge lies in the correct modelling of the vector dynamics. More specifically, a point of attention is the distribution of feeding individuals over the different host populations (both species-wise and zone-wise). Vectors can feed on the two modelled host species (human and domestic animal), but they can also use alternative hosts (especially so in the forest zone). The latter means there is no increased mortality in case the two main hosts are not available, but this of course also influences infection prevalence in the vector population. The vector populations are furthermore limited by a density-dependent oviposition rate. The approach currently taken uses the following basic parameters (see 
 <bold>Vector feeding and infection rates</bold> for details):
