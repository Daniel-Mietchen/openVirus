<p>Each human and animal population consists of a susceptible 
 <italic>S</italic>, exposed 
 <italic>E</italic>, infective 
 <italic>I</italic> and removed 
 <italic>R</italic> (= recovered/immune) compartment. There is a flow back from the removed to the susceptible compartment in both populations, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>. immunity is not lifelong. All individuals are born susceptible and a proportion of the pregnant infected animals abort. Vectors 
 <italic>A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic> allow for vertical transmission: infected females (
 <italic>I</italic> compartment) transmit infection to their eggs (
 <italic>Q</italic> compartment), where the virus survives until the larv√¶ hatch and the resulting adults are infective. Vector 
 <italic>A</italic> furthermore has the possibility of long-term dormancy in the egg stage (both infected and non-infected).
