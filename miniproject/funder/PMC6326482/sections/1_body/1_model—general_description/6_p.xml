<p>It is understood that the necessary calculations for these density-dependent oviposition-feeding, climatic variability and transhumance processes slow down the model considerably. It was therefore decided to rewrite part of the code, doing the preparatory computations before calling the 
 <monospace>deSolve</monospace> routines (using the classical Runge-Kutta 4
 <sup>th</sup> order method), in C++ (making use of the 
 <monospace>RCCP</monospace> library). This speeds up execution by a factor of about sixty, but of course means a lower accessibility of the code. Therefore, a slower version, entirely written in R is also offered. Full details on how to install and run the model are given in the accompanying userâ€™s manual
