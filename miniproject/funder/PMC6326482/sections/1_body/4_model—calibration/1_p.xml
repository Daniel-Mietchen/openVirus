<p>The model is calibrated using data that were extracted from two studies in the Kilombero Valley in Tanzania (Morogoro region, [

 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]: the principal findings of these studies were the presence of inter-epidemic RVFv circulation in human and domestic animal populations and the location of so-called infection ‘hot-spots’ away from the floodplain and in fact closer to forested areas on the plateau. The Kilombero Valley region consists of a seasonally inundated floodplain between the densely forested escarpments of the Udzungwa mountains to the northwest and the grass covered Mahenge mountains to the southeast. The valley receives an average annual rainfall of 1200–1800 mm and the average monthly temperature ranges between 25℃ and 32℃. The valley has a diverse ecology and demography with villages consisting largely of numerous distinct groups of houses located on the margins of the floodplain where rice cultivation is the predominant economic activity. Other land use types include hunting, fishing, forestry, pastoral livestock rearing and cultivation of other crops. Several mosquito species inhabit the valley, including known vectors of RVFv, such as
