 <italic>Ædes mcintoshi</italic> floodplain populations have vertical transmission and dormant (infected and uninfected) eggs. 
 <italic>Æ. ægypti</italic> populations also have vertical transmission, but no dormancy in the eggs so only the 
 <italic>Æ. mcintoshi</italic> eggs sustain the infection during a drought spell. 
 <italic>Culex</italic> populations have neither vertical transmission nor dormancy in the eggs. Mosquito larvæ are ignored in the model (the delay they represent is simulated by means of a lower egg eclosion rate and a higher egg mortality). 
 <italic>Ædes</italic> mosquitoes generally have a lower vector competence for RVFv compared to 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. Due to heavy rains (annual flooding and the El Niño phenomenon), the infected 
 <italic>Ædes</italic> mosquito eggs hatch. The infection is quickly taken over by the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species present in that region, making an epidemic possible.
