<p>Annual variation (
 <italic>e.g</italic>. because of wet and dry years) and seasonal variation in vector egg eclosion (
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>S</italic>
 </sub>) in all three zones can be included in the model: the current approach is by penalising hatching rates during dry years (hatching rate becomes a fraction –
 <italic>π</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>δ</italic>
 </sub>– of normal rates) and by allowing hatching rates in normal and dry years to vary seasonally according to a cosine curve (see the accompanying user’s manual
