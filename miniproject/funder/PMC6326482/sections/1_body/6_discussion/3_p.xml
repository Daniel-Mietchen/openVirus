<p>The exception to the above was the vertical transmission rate (trans-ovarial transmission rate) for 
 <italic>Æ. mcintoshi</italic>. The range found in [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] (0–8.5%) is not sufficient to carry the virus from one epidemic to another in the absence of other vectors to ensure inter-epidemic transmission. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g015">Fig 15</xref>, a vertical transmission rate of 0.25 does not suffice to ensure sufficient numbers of infected eggs to trigger an epidemic at the next El Niño event. No other estimates of this parameter could be traced in the literature and it is recommended that the correct values (ranges) of this important parameter are determined experimentally.
