 <italic>Culex</italic> vector in the village and forest zones. Introduction of infection, either by means of a wildlife reservoir (line seven) or through the introduction of an infective animal, allows for maintenance of the infection within the host and vector populations. Because of the interaction between the different vectors for host-feeding opportunities, the more efficient 
 <italic>Culex</italic> vector on its own (without competition from 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species) results in higher infection transmission and higher seroprevalence levels. Again, a lot more detailed observations are required to properly quantify this aspect of the transmission dynamics.
