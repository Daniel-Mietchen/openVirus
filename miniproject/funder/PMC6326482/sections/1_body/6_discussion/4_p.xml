<p>A low level of RVFv transmission was predicted by the model (
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Using the standard values, predicted seroprevalence levels in humans and cattle at different times after the El Niño event were comparable to those observed. Seroprevalence is estimated to be 13.2% in people and 12.3% in cattle, six years after an El Niño event. The field studies found similar overall seroprevalence levels of 11.7% in people and 11.3% in cattle, five to six years after the 2006/07 RVF epidemic in the area [

 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The results are also in line with previous studies across Africa with evidence of inter-epidemic transmission of RVF [

 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The dynamics of levels of seroprevalence are of course in the first place dependent on the value employed for the loss-of-serotitre rate: currently a daily value of 1/900 is used, based on a single, rather vague reference [
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Inclusion of a wildlife reservoir (
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, second line) did not have a significant effect on the predicted levels of seroprevalence.
