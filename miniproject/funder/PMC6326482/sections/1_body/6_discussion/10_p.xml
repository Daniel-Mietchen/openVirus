<p>The model presented here needs further calibrating with datasets from other regions where there are similar or dissimilar ecologies compared to our study area in order to extend and/or improve usability of the model in different geographical, climatic settings. This model, being built with open-source software and with an easy to use interface, can be adapted by researchers and program managers to their specific needs by plugging in new parameters relevant to their situation and locality. Its use can be further expanded by including disease prevention and control interventions to model potential impact of these veterinary and public health measures on disease in people and domestic animals, for example vaccination, quarantining and vector control programs.</p>
