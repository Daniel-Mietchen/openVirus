<p>The 
 <italic>Æ. mcintoshi</italic> population in the floodplains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g009">Fig 9</xref>) is the one maintaining the infection inside the dormant eggs. Adult mosquitoes do not survive the drier period following the El Niño event and only some eggs hatch every year during the partial seasonal flooding of the plain. Substantial hatching occurs during flooding related to the El Niño event in the East African region, releasing the infection and starting the epidemics. The infection is picked up by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> sp.1 present in this area. The human population acquires the infection first, followed by the cattle population. From there on, the epidemic spreads to the village and the forest with migrating cattle and people.
