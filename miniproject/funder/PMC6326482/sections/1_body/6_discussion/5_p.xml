<p>The simulated seroprevalence levels in 
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> in both the human and livestock populations show a gradual decline during the years after an epidemic event (El Niño), which seems to imply low numbers of infective bites during inter-epidemic periods, reflecting the generally low numbers of mosquitoes in the absence of heavy rainfall associated with the El Niño events. People and cattle transiting in the forest (zone 3, Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g008">8</xref>) are exposed to infectious bites every year from the

 <italic>Culex</italic> sp.2 populations (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g011">11</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g014">14</xref>): the mosquitoes are constantly infected from the wildlife reservoir [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g006">6</xref>) are minimally exposed on an annual basis with high exposure rates occurring only every ten years (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209929.g010">10</xref>,
