<p>Most parameters could be kept at values within the ranges found in the literature, by adjusting the values of other parameters to acceptable values, based on expert opinion. In this respect, a major influence is exerted by 
 <italic>ν</italic>, the maximum number of bites ‘supported’ by an individual host. The value itself directly determines the (
 <italic>e.g</italic>.) seroprevalence levels, but this parameter also introduces a competition between the various vector species, as at present it is assumed that the ‘available’ bites are distributed proportionally between the different vectors. The effect can be seen in 
 <xref rid="pone.0209929.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, when comparing lines one and (
 <italic>e.g</italic>.) nine: 
 <italic>Culex</italic> on its own, being a more efficient vector, yields higher seroprevalence values than the standard setting, where it must share the biting opportunities with 
 <italic>Ædes</italic>.
