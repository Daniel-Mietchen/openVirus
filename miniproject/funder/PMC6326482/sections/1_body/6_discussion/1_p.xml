<p>A model on RVFv transmission in the Kilombero valley in Tanzania was run for 27 years to include three El Niño events (and thus three RVF epidemics), to allow the model to reach a state of ‘equilibrium’ and to allow model output during a period of 4-7 years after the epidemic to coincide with published observations [

 <xref rid="pone.0209929.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The model is a complex interaction of density-dependent birth, death and transmission processes and as such very sensitive to certain parameter values. The model was explored by means of scenarios and no attempt was made to include a sensitivity analysis.
