<p>The improvement over historical expectance is particularly important. The scaled RSV positive data used in this study varies in magnitude substantially from year-to-year; however, the observed mean error for peak timing is only about 1.5 weeks and thus fairly regular, allowing reasonable forecast with the historical mean. Still the model-filter forecasts exceed the accuracy of the historical mean more than two weeks prior to the predicted peak (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s013">S13 Fig</xref>); for example, model-filter forecasts of epidemic peak magnitude provide a greater reduction of error in regions with greater standard deviation of peak magnitude. Thus, regions with greater observed variability see a greater improvement of forecast accuracy from the model-filter system over historical expectance.
