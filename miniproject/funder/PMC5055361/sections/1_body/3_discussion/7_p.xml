<p>In summary, advanced warning of RSV infections can reduce delays in the care of RSV patients, who are predominantly infants and the elderly, and hence vulnerable to lingering damage to lung tissue and other negative outcomes from RSV. Our model-filter system replicates the seasonal dynamics of RSV throughout the United States, and our forecasts predict multiple outcomes, including epidemic peak magnitude with more than 60% accuracy five weeks prior to the predicted peak. Importantly, the high accuracy of forecasts predicting epidemic onset one month in advance could allow doctors to better ration the delivery of palivizumab prophylaxis. Further, the near-linear increase in accuracy with decreasing ensemble variance provides a metric of certainty for each forecast. Our results provide evidence that levels of RSV incidence can be anticipated in time to inform the distribution of prophylactics and deployment of other protective measures against RSV infection. However, real-time predictions will require that laboratory testing for RSV be resumed.</p>
