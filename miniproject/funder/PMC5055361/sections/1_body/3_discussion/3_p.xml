<p>RSV patients in medical care are overwhelmingly the very young and the elderly, because of the small size of their lungs or less-effective immune response [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Yet despite this bimodal age distribution of apparent RSV infection, asymptomatic healthy adults can transmit RSV [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As the NREVSS data do not include age-stratified infection, we were unable to simulate these differences and instead used a single age class model. Should age-stratified infection data become available, future work should explore forecast and parameter estimation with an age-stratified model. Prior work with models that account for age structure, tend to produce higher estimates of

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our parameter estimates reflect our use of a simpler model structure and produce estimates similar to those described by single-season SIR [
