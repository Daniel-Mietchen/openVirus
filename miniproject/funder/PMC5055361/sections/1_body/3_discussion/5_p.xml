 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our estimate no doubt reflects the quality and geographic scale of the RSV data, as well as the model structure. The mean value of 
 <italic>D</italic>, the duration of infection, just over 6 days, is also within the range modeled variously as 5–11 days. In our SIR model, the duration of infection functions as the duration of infectiousness, which in our model-filter may vary by time or by region depending on norms such as the time to treatment or isolation of symptomatic individuals. We found that the duration of infection, 
 <italic>D</italic>, is somewhat sensitive to the choice of γ (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Clinical and experimental data have yet to identify the viral load needed for significant RSV transmission. These information are needed to better constrain the mean duration of infectivity. Once this is more definitively established, 
 <italic>D</italic> could be fixed while other parameters are estimated by the EAKF.
