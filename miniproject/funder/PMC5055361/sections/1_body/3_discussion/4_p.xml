<p>Our data regions include up to eight states with distinct climates. Assignment of states to regions differs between the census division and HHS designations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s014">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s015">S2</xref> Tables), though there exists considerable overlap. Forecast accuracy did not differ appreciably between census divisions and HHS regions. By simulating both regional grouping systems, we further demonstrate the reliability of our results. State actors could consider forecasts from both regional classification systems, particularly for regions including Florida, a populous state in which typically RSV peaks earlier than other states.
