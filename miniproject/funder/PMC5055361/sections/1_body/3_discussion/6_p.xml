<p>More doctors and researchers are simultaneously testing for multiple viruses including RSV, using PCR-based panel assays; yet, as July of 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics no longer recommends testing bronchiolitis patients for RSV, because treatment is the same regardless of etiology. Without widespread RSV testing, the efficacy of an RSV vaccine, several of which are currently under development [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], may be more difficult to determine. Further, testing would support both study and forecast of RSV. For example, RSV data derived from testing of bronchiolitis patients and active sampling, the latter used to estimate RSV incidence across all age groups, would support development of more complicated model structures, which could be used to generate age-stratified forecasts. Ideally, these forecasts would influence individual behavior and improve health care preparedness, and thus would serve as a bulwark against bronchiolitis.
