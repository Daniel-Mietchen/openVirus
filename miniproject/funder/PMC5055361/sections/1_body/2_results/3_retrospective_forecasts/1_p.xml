 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005133.g003">Fig 3</xref> presents overall forecast accuracy as a function of lead week for RSV. Lead week is defined as the current week minus the predicted peak week, and onset accuracy is presented as the current week minus the onset week. For both regional groupings, the ensemble forecasts of peak magnitude have nearly 70% accuracy (within ±25%) with a four-week lead-time, and nearly 70% accuracy (±1 week) in forecasting the onset week with a three-week lead (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005133.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Forecasts of epidemic peak timing (±1 week) are correct with over 68% accuracy with a one-week lead-time. Forecasts of epidemic peak timing are within ±2 weeks of the observed peak 81% of the time with a two-week lead-time. Forecasts of the seasonal attack rate are accurate 89% of the time within ±25% of the observed, with a one-week lead-time. Sample forecasts are shown in
