<p>Our simulations of RSV time series using the model-filter system replicated the historical data well. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005133.g001">Fig 1</xref> presents the historical time series and model-filter simulations for RSV at the HHS regional classification system over ten seasons (2004–2005 through 2013–2014). The mean RMSE between simulated and observed scaled data over all ten seasons, in both geographical groupings, ranged from 1.08 to 2.97 (
