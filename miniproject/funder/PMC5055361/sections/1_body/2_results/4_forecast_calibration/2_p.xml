 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005133.g005">Fig 5</xref> presents the relative absolute error of magnitude and attack rate, and the absolute error for timing and onset. Error for the lowest two quartiles of ensemble variance is plotted. Forecast accuracy exceeds the mean historical error for magnitude and attack rate at least eight weeks before the predicted peak. The model-filter forecasts exceed the historical mean peak timing prediction more than two weeks before the predicted peak for the lowest two quartiles, and the onset prediction exceeds the historical mean at 4 weeks lead for the lowest quartiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005133.g005">Fig 5</xref>). For onset, this 50
 <sup>th</sup> percentile corresponds to a mean ensemble variance of 3.8, meaning that model-filter forecasts with this variance or below should be trusted over the historical mean when predicting onset four weeks in the future. A scatter plot shows the model-filter forecast error subtracted from the historical mean forecast plotted as a function of observed regional RSV standard deviation for peak magnitude, peak timing, attack rate, and onset (

 <sup>th</sup> ensemble variance, shows that in regions with greater year-to-year RSV variability, the model-filter forecasts increasingly outperform historical expectance. Linear regressions for each criterion and lead week grouping are also plotted on
