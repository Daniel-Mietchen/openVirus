<p>To generate calibrated forecasts, we used ensemble variance to infer the expected accuracy of predicted outcomes [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Forecast accuracy for each metric is plotted versus ensemble variance, grouped by lead week (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005133.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Variance is binned by percentile intervals of 10% (making ten bins), and only bins containing at least 70 runs are shown. For the onset criterion, variance is computed only from forecasts that begin before the onset. These plots show that forecast accuracy for all four metrics generally increases as ensemble variance decreases. That is, as within-ensemble agreement rises, the forecasts are more accurate. These relationships can be used to infer the expected accuracy of a real-time forecast. Further evaluation of forecast accuracy as a function of week of forecast and lead week is also presented (
