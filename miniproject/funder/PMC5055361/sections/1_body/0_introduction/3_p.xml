<p>The core component of our forecasting system is a dynamic model describing the propagation of RSV through a simulated population. Many of the dynamic models previously developed for simulation of RSV are compartmental constructs that divide a population into the different states associated with the chain of infection: susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR), as well as constructs additionally accounting for partial immunity (SIRS) and exposure (SEIRS) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Epidemiological parameters within these model structures govern the rates of transition between compartments. Typically, such parameters are either designated

RSV parameter estimates derived using these different methods or data, however, can vary widely. For example, the parameter that represents the duration of infection, 
 <italic>D</italic>, has been identified variously through antigen detection as 6.7 days [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and as nearly three months in immunocompromised individuals [

 </sub> values of 1.7 and 7.4 using an SIRS model and modified SEIRS model, respectively [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while others in the same state found a mean 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> above 9 using a SIRS that accounted for repeated infections, waning immunity, and/or age structure [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Much of this variation reflects the use of different model structures, and in part it may stem from the quality, abundance, and spatial and temporal resolution of the RSV data used to make these inferences.
