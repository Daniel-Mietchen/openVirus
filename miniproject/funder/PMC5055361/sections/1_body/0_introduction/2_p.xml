<p>The toll of RSV on the elderly is also high. RSV hospitalization rates in New York City are 1.5 times greater for individuals 75 and older than for 1-4-year-olds [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Older patients account for 25% of all ED visits [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and as populations in the developed world age, the proportion of elderly in the ED, some infected with RSV, is likely to grow. Indeed, ED crowding has been linked to delays in treatment and reduced efficacy of care for asthma and respiratory distress [

 <sub>2</sub>) recommended for children varies from 90%–95% [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Children with prolonged oxygen deprivation in the range 90%–94% SO
 <sub>2</sub>, due to a variety of causes, were found to be at risk for long-lasting cognitive damage and associated behavioral issues [
