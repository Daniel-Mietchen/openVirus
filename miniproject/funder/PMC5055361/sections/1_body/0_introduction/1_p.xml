<p>Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infects nearly all children within the first two years of life, and is the most common cause of respiratory infection and bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization for infants under the age of one [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The rate of hospitalization for RSV infection, estimated at 1.3â€“3% for children under four [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is greatest in infants younger than three months old [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], whose immune response can inundate and block smaller airways, leading to wheezing and difficulty breathing. Infants at risk for developing severe RSV infection are injected with the antibody prophylaxis palivizumab each month prior to anticipated RSV exposure. Palivizumab is highly rationed, primarily because of its high cost, so the scheduling of immunoprophylaxis is very important [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; however, even though RSV activity cycles seasonally, the precise timing and magnitude of RSV incidence varies each year. This variability not only complicates effective infant dosing of immunoprophylaxis but also may contribute to well-documented delays in emergency departments (ED) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RSV infections constitute 2% of hospital patients under age one on an annual basis [
