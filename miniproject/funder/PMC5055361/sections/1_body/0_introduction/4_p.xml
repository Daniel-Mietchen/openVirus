<p>Here, the same model-inference system developed for the generation of RSV forecasts is also used to infer critical RSV epidemiological parameters. We apply this system at a broad scale using regional RSV data from the U.S. and in so doing attempt to further resolve RSV parameter estimates. To perform this work, and as has been performed for other infectious disease systems [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we combine a simple dynamical disease transmission model with a data assimilation filter that updates the model state variables and parameters using time series observations. Here, we present this RSV model-filter system, the resulting parameter estimates, and retrospective forecasts generated for the United States. We have built this predictive system for a variety of RSV data streams. It can be deployed at the beginning of the annual RSV wintertime season and used to help reduce delays in health care and enable broader access to preventative medication.
