<p>Here, 
 <italic>p(RSV)</italic> is the probability of an RSV infection (RSV incidence in the SIR model), 
 <italic>p(g)</italic> is the probability of access to RSV testing among the entire population, 
 <italic>p(RSV|g)</italic> is the probability that someone with access to RSV testing is infected with RSV, and 
 <italic>p(g|RSV)</italic> is the probability of access to a RSV testing facility if a person is infected with RSV. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005133.e003">Eq 3</xref>, 
 <italic>γ</italic> is defined as 
 <italic>p(g)/ p(g|RSV)</italic>. We experimented with a range of possible values and selected a single value for simplicity, 
 <italic>γ</italic> = 0.001, that produces RSV forecasts with the lowest RMSE errors.
