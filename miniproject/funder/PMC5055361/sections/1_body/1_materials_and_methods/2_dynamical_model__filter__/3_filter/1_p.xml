<p>We used the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] to assimilate RSV data into the SIR model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Starting from a 300-member ensemble of randomly initialized parameter values (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s016">S3 Table</xref>), we integrated this ensemble of SIR simulations forward in time to the first observation of the season. This model-generated estimate, of both the observed infections and the unobserved state space variables and parameters, is the Bayesian prior. The EAKF is then used to update these state variable and parameter estimates for all ensemble members, thereby generating a posterior. The ensemble is then integrated forward again to the next observation and the update process is repeated. Through this iterative process of integration and update, the ensemble of simulations is optimized by the EAKF [
