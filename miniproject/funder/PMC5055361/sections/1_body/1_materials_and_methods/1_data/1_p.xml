<p>RSV specimen data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These data, sampled via antigen detection, viral isolation, and polymerase chain reaction, are collected and administered by laboratories and other medical facilities that participate in the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). The number of samples tested for RSV each week and the number of positive results were recorded, since July 2004 at the census division and Health and Human Services (HHS) region geographic scales (the states in each regional classification system are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s014">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s015">S2</xref> Tables). The RSV season runs from week 27 (around July 10
 <sup>th</sup>) through week 26 of the following year, with at least 20 tests per week during this season. Over the first ten weeks of the RSV season, incidence is low and testing is often limited; consequently, we omitted these first ten weeks and began all simulations on week 37, in mid-September, when the number of RSV tests administered typically begins to rise. To scale the number of positive tests to regions with very different reporting magnitudes, we divide by the number of laboratories reporting to each region each season. With these data, we estimated RSV incidence over nine census divisions, ten HHS regions, and ten RSV seasons. Census division RSV is presented in
