<p>The random initialization of state variables and parameters for each 300-member ensemble simulation adds an element of stochastic variation to the otherwise deterministic EAKF. To account for any effects of initialization, each 300-member ensemble simulation was repeated ten times, in each instance with a new random selection of initial state variables and parameters. We explored the sensitivity of the model-inference system to other components of the system, including the scaling factor Î³ (as described above), observational error variance (OEV), the use of inflation, and range of initial state variables.</p>
