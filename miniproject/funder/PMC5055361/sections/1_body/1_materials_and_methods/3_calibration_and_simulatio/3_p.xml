<p>The EAKF successively adjusts the ensemble of simulations and in so doing iteratively reduces the variance of the ensemble. Should this variance become too small, the EAKF algorithm puts too much weight on the simulations and ignores the observations. As a consequence, the simulations begin to ‘diverge’ from the truth. To counteract this divergence, an inflation algorithm can be applied that increases the ensemble variance a small amount prior to each filter update. We applied a type of inflation called multiplicative inflation [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and tested whether it improved forecast accuracy; however, we found that divergence was not an issue for our RSV simulations and that forecast accuracy was highest without inflation. We therefore present results for simulations without inflation.
