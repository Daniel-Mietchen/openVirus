 </sub> estimates from three time points during each outbreak: the epidemic peak estimated by the model-filter posterior, two weeks after the peak, and on the last week of the simulation time period. Retrospective forecasts were generated for 20 weeks (week 43 in late October to week 9 in early March) for each location and year by integrating the latest posterior of updated variables and parameters through to the end of the season. Forecasts were evaluated relative to lead week, defined here as the week of forecast minus the predicted peak week of the ensemble mean trajectory (i.e. negative lead weeks indicate that incidence will peak in the future).
