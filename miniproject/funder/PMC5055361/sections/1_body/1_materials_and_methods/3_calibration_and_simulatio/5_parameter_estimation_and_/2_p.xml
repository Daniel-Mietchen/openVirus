<p>We quantified forecast accuracy using four metrics: i) prediction of RSV outbreak peak timing, i.e. whether the ensemble mean trajectory prediction of peak timing is within ±1 week of the actual peak, ii) prediction of RSV outbreak peak intensity, i.e. whether the ensemble mean trajectory predicted peak outbreak incidence is within ±15% of observed peak incidence (with the observed as the denominator), iii) prediction of total RSV attack rate, i.e. whether the ensemble mean trajectory prediction of the seasonal attack rate, defined as the total number of cases per year, is within ±15% of observation, and iv) prediction of the onset of the RSV epidemic. We define the RSV onset at a threshold of γΝ for two consecutive weeks, which roughly corresponds to the CDC defined onset of 10% percent positive RSV cases for two consecutive weeks. For sensitivity, timing and onset each within ±2 weeks and magnitude and attack rate each within ±25% are also presented.</p>
