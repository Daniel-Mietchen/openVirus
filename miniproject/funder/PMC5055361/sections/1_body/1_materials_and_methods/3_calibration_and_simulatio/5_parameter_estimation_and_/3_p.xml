<p>These prediction metrics were also evaluated to determine how forecast accuracy varied as a function of the ensemble variance [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005133.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Here, we explored whether forecast accuracy improved as the variance among the 300 ensemble members decreased. Such relationships can be used to ascribe certainty to a given forecast as it is produced in real time.
