<p>In all we tested over 600 unique combinations of the scaling factor, inflation, OEV, and the initial state variable and parameter ranges for each location and year. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005133.s003">S3 Fig</xref> presents the RMSE between observations and forecasts from four of these combinations. With the selected combination, we ran simulations for the nineteen (overlapping) locations and ten years, with ten repetitions of each unique combination to account for stochastic effects. Combined results from using both CD and HHS regions are presented unless otherwise noted.
