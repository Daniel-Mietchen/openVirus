  <title>The error of RSV forecast for magnitude, timing error, attack rate, onset for each week of forecast and lead week.</title>
  <p>Blanks indicate week and lead week combinations without forecasts. Error decreases as both week of forecast and lead week increase. Including week of forecast along with ensemble variance and lead week could refine prediction calibration.</p>
