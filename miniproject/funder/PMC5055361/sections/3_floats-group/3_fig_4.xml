  <title>The fraction of RSV forecasts accurately predicting peak timing (±1 week), magnitude (±25%), attack rate (±25%), and onset (±1 week), shown as a function of ensemble variance.</title>
  <p>Forecasts are stratified by lead week, defined as current week minus predicted peak. The marker size is scaled to the number of runs in each variance bin.</p>
