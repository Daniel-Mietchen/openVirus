  <title>Historical mean prediction error minus model-filter forecasts error, plotted by region as a function of regional RSV standard deviation, and grouped by lead week.</title>
  <p>Scatter points above the zero line represent forecasts that outperform the historical mean. Both census division (CD) and HHS regions are plotted. Only forecasts with ensemble variance in the bottom 50
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, taken over the entire forecast period for each region, are shown; during some lead weeks, there are no forecasts in the bottom 50
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, hence some regions do not have all four lead week groupings (e.g. 7â€“8 weeks before the predicted onset). Positive significant linear correlations (alpha = 0.05) between difference in error and observed standard deviation are found for each forecast criterion at least four weeks in advance of the predicted peak or onset.
