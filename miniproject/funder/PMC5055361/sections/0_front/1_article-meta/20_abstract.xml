 <p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection and bronchiolitis. Prompt treatment of RSV is necessary to prevent damage to lung tissue, complications from prolonged oxygen deprivation, and the potential development of reactive airway disorders. Another respiratory disease, influenza, has been simulated and forecast with high accuracy, using an epidemiological model and data assimilation methods. Here, we adapt such a model-filter system to simulate and forecast RSV epidemics in the United States. We find that the timing and volume of RSV epidemics can be forecast with high accuracy. Advance warning of the epidemic timing and volume of RSV patients has the potential to help medical centers prepare for a surge in infected patients and thus reduce delays to treatment in emergency departments.</p>
