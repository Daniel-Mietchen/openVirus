<p>Although the sampling design of this study was adequate to evaluate the proportion of arboviruses causing acute undifferentiated fever, sample size was small and patients were only recruited from a single health center. However, the Lisungi health center is well visited by the surrounding population and all ages were represented in our study population. Moreover, the median age of our study population is 17 years, which approximates the median age of 18.6 years in the DRC (UNDESA 2017 and CIA World Factbook 2017). Another limitation in our study was the impossibility due to operational reasons to include participants over an entire year. The study was halted at the end of June, which was apparently the month with the highest number of infections. We did not investigate bacterial causes of fever through culture of blood or other bodily fluids, tests typically done in hospital settings, hereby possibly underestimating the burden of concomitant bacterial (super)infection. We therefore encourage further research elucidating the broad range of pathogens causing acute undifferentiated fever and the distribution of the insect vectors involved in arboviral transmission in urban and rural sub-Saharan African settings. Based on our findings, we recommend to include arboviral infections, namely DENV and CHIKV, in the differential diagnoses of acute fever presentation in Kinshasa.</p>
