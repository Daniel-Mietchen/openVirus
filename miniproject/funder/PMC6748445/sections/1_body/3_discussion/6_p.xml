<p>Furthermore, we were able to document the common practice of over-prescription of antimicrobials, including antimalarial drugs, in malaria RDT-negative patients, as is apparently the case nationwide in DRC as recently shown by Ntamabyaliro et al [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], close to 90% received antimalarial treatment, in addition to 15.5% of patients treated with over-the-counter antimalarials prior to presentation at the clinic. It could be questioned whether the rigorous implementation and usage of RDTs has any added benefit. A recent meta-analysis, including studies from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, evaluated data from over half a million children and adults and showed that the introduction of a malaria RDT simply shifted the antimicrobial overuse from one antimicrobial class to the other, mainly from antimalarial to antibacterial and anthelmintic drugs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Consequently, the increasing prescription rate of antimicrobials–including antibacterial, anthelmintic and antimalarial drugs, is extremely worrisome in terms of the growing global problem of antimicrobial resistance, including against
