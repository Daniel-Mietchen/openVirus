<p>We demonstrated past exposure to arboviruses too, with 30.2% of the participants having detectable IgG against DENV, which is on the higher end of the spectrum compared to other studies in Africa reporting an overall flavivirus seroprevalence ranging between 0 and 35% with a mean of 18.1% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The IgG-seroprevalence increased with age, thus suggesting a continuous exposure to flaviviruses over time. The 26.4% past CHIKV infection rate was in line with the estimated seroprevalence of 34.4% in Congo Brazzaville before the outbreak of 2011 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Remarkably, CHIKV IgG was also detected in small children, born after the 2011 epidemic, pointing towards an endemic circulation of the virus. DENV IgG testing was done with an ELISA test. Although it is widely known that there is cross-reactivity among flaviviruses, ELISA is still the most affordable–hence most commonly used–test [

Since YFV vaccination is an expected cause of cross-reaction with DENV IgG, we performed PRNT for DENV and YFV in a subset of samples, and found that the majority of samples negative with PRNT for DENV, were also negative with PRNT for YFV, suggesting that the high flavivirus IgG positivity is not likely to be the result of YFV vaccination. Due to operational reasons and the scope of the study, we did not further test for other flaviviruses and hence, we cannot rule out that the DENV IgG positivity in our study is due to other flaviviruses exposure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We noted that the congruence between DENV ELISA and PRNT was lower than in American and Asian settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], but similar to the observation in other studies in DRC [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The report of YFV vaccination was very low (below 1%), but as YFV vaccination is included in the childhood vaccination program over the last decade, this may indicate that the population is not aware of which vaccines their children get. However, the increasing prevalence of flavivirus IgG antibodies with age is congruent with a history of increasing exposure to the pathogens over lifetime and thus could not be explained by YFV vaccination. The CHIKV IgG testing was done with two tests: screening with ELISA and confirmation with IFA. We cannot exclude that positive results are due to cross-reactivity with other known (e.g. O’nyong nyong virus, Semliki Forest virus or Sindbis virus) or unknown togaviruses.
