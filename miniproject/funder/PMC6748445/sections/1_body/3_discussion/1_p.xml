<p>Although no large epidemics were reported recently, our study showed ongoing transmission of arboviruses in Kinshasa, DRC. Acute DENV, caused by DENV1 and DENV2, and CHIKV infection was demonstrated in 8.1% and 0.9% of the patients attending a first line health center with acute undifferentiated fever, respectively. Importantly, neither DENV nor CHIKV was clinically suspected, nor considered in the clinical differential diagnosis and 64.3% of patients were treated with at least one antibacterial drug of whom almost one in eight (11.7%) received dual or triple antimicrobial therapy. A possible explanation of the apparent absence of clinical and/or severe acute DENV cases in our study, and in other African settings too, is that African heritage is described to genetically protect against severe DENV. More specifically, the lower OSBPL10 expression profile in Africans is protective against viral hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [
