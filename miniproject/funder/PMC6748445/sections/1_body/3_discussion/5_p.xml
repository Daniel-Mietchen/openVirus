For the first time we were able to demonstrate the fact that arboviruses, more specifically DENV and CHIKV, circulate in the capital of DRC. The highest number of acute cases was reported in June (a dry season month), but cases were also confirmed in the other months, indicating that despite an epidemic profile, transmission persists over the rainy season in Kinshasa. This finding is consistent with observations over the past decades in Asia [
