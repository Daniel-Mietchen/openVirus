<p>However, diagnostic testing for arboviruses has several shortcomings. Hereafter, we will highlight the limitations of the tests used for acute and past infections. Five out of 19 acute DENV and 2 out of 2 acute CHIKV infections were diagnosed based on the presence of IgM antibodies only and were therefore only presumptive infections. This could have led to an overestimation of the number of acute infections. In addition, IgM antibodies can be present for several months and it is therefore possible that DENV/CHIKV was not the cause of the fever at the moment of presentation. Nonetheless, the presence of IgM antibodies suggests that DENV/CHIKV was recently circulating in the area. On the other hand, as we did not have repeated measurements or convalescent samples to demonstrate seroconversion to IgG or a four-fold increase in IgG titer, we may have missed some acute secondary dengue cases, which may have undetectable IgM antibody levels [
