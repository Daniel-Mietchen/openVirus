<p>These viral vector-borne diseases are also circulating in the Central African region. This is illustrated by CHIKV outbreaks in Kinshasa in both 2000 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and 2012 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Brazzaville in 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and the 2013 DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 2016 yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreak in Angola [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], along with the first Zika virus (ZIKV) case reported in Angola in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These outbreaks are only possible because the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito, the vector of the aforementioned arboviruses, thrives in this region. Furthermore, although not conclusive for vector competence and local transmission capability, alphaviruses (chikungunya) and flaviviruses (species not specified) were demonstrated by RT-PCR in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in Kinshasa in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
