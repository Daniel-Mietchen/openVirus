<p>Acute fever is one of the main reasons for healthcare seeking worldwide. In tropical settings, and especially sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is the first cause to be ruled out, which is done increasingly so following the World Health Organization’s 
 <italic>testing before treating</italic> policy of 2010 –through microscopic blood slide examination or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Following the introduction of this policy, together with the roll-out of the highly efficacious artemisinin-combination therapy as first-line malaria treatment and efficacious vector control, the overall malaria burden declined over the last decade [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Accordingly, clinicians face a relatively higher number of malaria-negative patients for whom they do not have a clear diagnosis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, where healthcare settings are often resource-limited, healthcare providers face the daunting challenge pinpointing the causing agent of acute fever in an adequate and timely fashion, with little to no diagnostic means other than a malaria-RDT. They mostly rely on history taking and physical examination to determine the focus and cause of infection, of which acute respiratory infection (ARI), gastroenteritis (GE) and urinary tract infection (UTI) are the three most prevalent syndromes reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, for some patients presenting with acute fever no focus of infection can be found, thus labeling them as ‘undifferentiated’–knowing that their differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from viral, bacterial, parasitic to fungal infections. Some studies have found that this ‘undifferentiated’ group among fever patients represents 20 to 40% of the grand total [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although viral illnesses are often suspected, both prescription and over-the-counter usage of antimicrobials is rampant in this group globally and their licentious usage in low-resource settings fuels the global burden of antimicrobial resistance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More insight in the exact causes of this group of ‘undifferentiated fevers’ may help curb the usage of antimicrobials and improve the clinical care of patients in low-resource settings more broadly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Still, evidence on the causes of ‘undifferentiated acute fever syndromes’ is scarce and is coming almost entirely from inpatient settings. Indeed, to our knowledge only one study in sub-Saharan Africa, namely in Sierra Leone in 2012–2013, looked in a prospective way at the etiologies of acute fever–using RDTs–in patients with self-reported or clinically confirmed fever with a maximum duration of 7 days, finding 5% acute dengue virus (DENV) infection and 39% acute chikungunya virus (CHIKV) or other alphavirus infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nonetheless, limited outbreaks and sporadic clinical cases of DENV have been reported over the last 50 years in 22 African countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Seroprevalence studies have demonstrated DENV IgG-antibodies, indicating past-infection, in 12.5% of study participants in Cameroon, 36% in Burkina Faso and 45% in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although in other areas seropositivity remained zero [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In Tanzania past infection rates are higher, reaching 50.6% in health-facility based studies and 11% in community-based studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite the presence of all four DENV serotypes, severe disease epidemics are rarely reported in Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The DENV burden in Africa is, based on modeling, estimated at 16 million symptomatic clinical infections or 16% of the global total [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In East-Africa, CHIKV outbreaks and circulation are described, such as in Kenya with a past-infection rate of 67% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the reports of epidemics in 2004 in Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in 2013 in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and in 2018 in Mozambique [
