<p>All undifferentiated fevers, together with about half of both the malaria positives and the clinically apparent differentiated fevers–identified through random selection, were tested for arbovirus exposure. For this purpose serum and plasma were stored in liquid nitrogen (-196°C) on-site and transported afterwards to the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. After six and nine months, the samples were airlifted to the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, for additional arbovirus specific tests. Molecular tests were done for DENV, CHIKV and YFV on all available samples. For ZIKV, as there was no evidence of its circulation in the area, testing was done on 50 randomly selected undifferentiated fevers and 30 clinically apparent ‘differentiated fevers’ (through the random numbers tool in Microsoft Excel). The real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) for DENV, CHIKV, YFV and ZIKV were done with in house PCR protocols currently in use in the reference laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp. The IgM and IgG antibodies for DENV and CHIKV were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA: Dengue Virus IgM Capture DxSelectTM and Dengue Virus IgG DxSelectTM from Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA and CHIKV ELISA IgM and CHIKV ELISA IgG test from Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). An optical density ratio (O.D.) on ELISA IgG or ELISA IgM &gt;1 was considered as a positive ELISA IgG or IgM result, respectively (as indicated in the kit-instructions). An indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA: anti-CHIKV IFA from Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) for both CHIKV IgM and IgG, considered to be more sensitive and specific based on the literature [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and our own experience in the clinical laboratory of the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp, was done on the ELISA positive samples and on a random selection of 20 negative samples. In case of a non-congruent result between ELISA and IFA, a malaria PCR was done to evaluate if cross-reaction between malaria and CHIKV could explain this finding [

A selection of IgG DENV ELISA positive samples (all samples with O.D. &lt;1.9 on ELISA IgG DENV and 6 randomly selected samples of the ones with O.D. &gt;1.9) were tested with DENV and YFV plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) to differentiate between past exposure to DENV or YFV (the PRNT does not discriminate natural infection from vaccination).
