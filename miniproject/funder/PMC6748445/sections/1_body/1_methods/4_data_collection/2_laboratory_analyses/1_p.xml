<p>In the on-site laboratory of the Lisungi health center, capillary blood was taken for a microscopic leukocyte count and a Giemsa-stained thin smear. Hematocrit and hemoglobin were determined using a portable spectrophotometer (Hemocontrol, EKF Diagnostics, Barleben, Germany). Malaria and dengue were diagnosed by the HRP2/pLDH RDT SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pan 05FK60 and RDT SD Bioline Dengue Duo 11FK46, respectively. The latter is an immunochromatographic one-step assay designed to detect both DENV NS1 antigen (present in first week of infection) and IgM/IgG antibodies (detectable from the fifth day of fever onwards) to DENV. HIV was not routinely tested for, given the overall low prevalence in the study area and the unavailability of HIV antiretroviral treatment according to national ethics guidelines in this setting.</p>
