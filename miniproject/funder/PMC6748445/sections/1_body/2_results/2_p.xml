<p>In the 235 participants further tested for arboviruses, 19 (8.1%) fulfilled the criteria of an acute DENV infection, of which 14 were confirmed by RT-PCR. Both serotypes DENV1 and DENV2 were detected (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Five participants were presumptively infected with DENV, based on the presence of IgM antibodies alone. All NS1 positive patients were RT-PCR positive. In contrast, only two acute CHIKV infections were suspected based on the presence of IgM antibodies. The majority of CHIKV IgM ELISA positive samples was not confirmed by IFA. On these non-congruent samples, PCR to detect

When focusing on the malaria negative cases, we observed that 8.7% (13/149) tested positive for acute DENV, 1.3% (2/149) for acute CHIKV, none for acute ZIKV, nor for YFV.
