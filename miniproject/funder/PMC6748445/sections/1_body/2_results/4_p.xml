<p>We found 71 (30.2%) patients with anti-DENV IgG antibodies, of which 60 (75.0%) contained relatively high levels of anti-DENV antibody (O.D. ≥ 1.9), the latter not depending on age (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007047.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). The PRNT on the subsample was only positive in 5.6% and 66.7% for DENV, and 25% and 20% for YFV, on samples with IgG ratio below 1.9 and above 1.9,respectively (

For these past infections, all 4 serotypes were detected: DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4 in 4, 2, 1 and 1 patient, respectively (of the 6 positively tested DENV PRNT)– 2 patients were reactive to all 4 serotypes, the other 4 only to 1 serotype. Past exposure to CHIKV was suspected with IFA IgG in 26.4% of the study participants. When taking the DENV and CHIKV positive IgG samples together, 56.6% of the study participants were suspected having been exposed to at least one arbovirus. The prevalence of past DENV and CHIKV infections increased with age, raising from 18.9% and 5.4% under 5 years of age, to 80% and 40% over 65 years of age, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007047.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The association of age is statistically significant for the past infections with CHIKV (p = 0.01) and DENV (p&lt;0.01) (

The congruence between the RDT and PCR/ELISA results for DENV was variable: in comparison to PCR the sensitivity of NS1 was 90%, in comparison to IgM ELISA the IgM RDT had a sensitivity of 30% and in comparison to IgG ELISA the IgG RDT had a sensitivity of 7.6%. The specificities were all above 99.3%.
