<p>Over the period November 2015 to June 2016, 342 patients were included from whom clinical data and on the spot malaria-RDT results were recorded. Clinical diagnoses were as follows: 70.2% undifferentiated fever, 17.0% ARI, 6.1% GE and 6.7% UTI–all three further labeled as ‘differentiated fevers’. The study population (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007047.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) consisted of 183 (53.5%) female participants and 180 (53.1%) were under the age of 18. Only 10 (2.9%) reported having a chronic disease such as diabetes or sickle cell anemia and 50 (14.6%) patients were in need of hospitalization. The reported YFV vaccination rate was as low as 1%. The vast majority (77.8%) of patients presenting in the four first days after the onset of fever, came from the commune Mont Ngafula, and a minority from neighbouring Selembao and Ngaliema–acute and past arbovirus infections were detected in patients from these three communes (

 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> was positive in 155 (45.3%) of the total number of participants (47.9% and 39.2% in undifferentiated and differentiated fever groups, respectively, p = 0.139). However, 300 (87.7%) received an antimalarial treatment, which was significantly more in the undifferentiated (92.1%) than the differentiated fever group (77.5%) (p&lt;0.001). Antibacterial drugs were frequently prescribed: 64.3% of participants received at least one antibacterial drug, significantly more in the differentiated (72.5%) than the undifferentiated group (60.8%) (p = 0.039) and 11.7% received even more than one antibacterial drug (29.4% in the differentiated and 9.6% in the undifferentiated fever group, p&lt;0.001).
