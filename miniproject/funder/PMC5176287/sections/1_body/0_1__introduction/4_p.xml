<p>East Andalusia is located in south Spain, and includes the provinces of Jaén, Almería, and Granada. Tourism and migration in this area have contributed to a wide diversity of HIV-1 viral subtypes, but subtype B is still the most prevalent [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our laboratory is the reference centre for studying antiretroviral drug resistance in this area, and we update a database that links clinical data to virological data. As we have access to the 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences in all the newly diagnosed patients in this area, we attempted to study the evolutionary history of the HIV-1 subtype B in east Andalusia, and the existence of long-term HIV-1 lineages, by using molecular epidemiology tools. We analysed which groups were at increased risk of infection, the dynamics of viral growth and its spread during the 2005–2012 period.
