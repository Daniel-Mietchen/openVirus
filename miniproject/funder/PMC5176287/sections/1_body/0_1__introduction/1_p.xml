<p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is characterised by high genetic variability caused by its high rate of nucleotide substitution [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and recombination capacity [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which has led to a wide diversity of subtypes and recombinant forms. HIV-1 subtype B is the most prevalent of these variants in central and western Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], where it is responsible for almost 70% of new infections [
