<p>The oldest lineages found in east Andalusia originated in the late 1970s and the early 1980s in the coastal area of Motril, and were formed by intravenous drug users: Cluster I (location probability = 0.64) in 1979 (95%CI: 1976–1991) and Cluster II (location probability = 0.94) in 1984 (95%CI: 1979–1994). As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, most of the more epidemiologically relevant clusters were formed by MSMs, most of which originated in the 1990s, all in Granada, with location probabilities &gt; 0.9.
