<p>The phylogenetic analyses through ML (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168099.g001">Fig 1</xref>) showed 55 clusters, which represented 47% (n = 234) of our population: 43% (101/234) of the patients grouped into 44 small clusters: 31 clusters of two patients [13 MSM, 12 heterosexual (HTX), and six intravenous drug users (IVDU)]; 13 clusters of three patients, (MSM = 7, HTX = 5 and IVDU = 1). All the other patients (57% (133/234)) were grouped into 11 clusters of five subjects or more. Their demographic, clinical and virological characteristics are offered in 
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We found 11 clusters of a larger size (≥5), eight formed by MSM and three by IVDU. It was noteworthy that one cluster was formed by 58 young subjects (median age of 33) with a median CD4+ T-cell count of 518 cells/μl. This cluster showed short branches in the ML tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168099.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which indicated short times between infections.
