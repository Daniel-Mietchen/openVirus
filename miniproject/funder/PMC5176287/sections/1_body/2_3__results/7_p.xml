<p>A Bayesian Skyline plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168099.g005">Fig 5</xref>) was used to illustrate the dynamic growth of HIV-1 subtype B, and changes in the effective size of the epidemic in the last three decades were estimated. A demographic analysis of our population showed initial growth in the 1980s, which stabilised in the 1990s. In the first decade of this century, epidemic size became smaller, but once again increased during the 2005â€“2008 period to finally stabilise. Finally, we analysed the phylodynamic profiles of the major HIV-1 clade (Cluster VI) in east Andalusia (
