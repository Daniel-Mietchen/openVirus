<p>By analysing the PR+RT genomic region, with an uncorrelated lognormal clock and using the Bayesian Skyline Plot model, we obtained a mean evolutionary rate of 2.4 (95% credible region: 1.7–3.1) x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year. The MRCA for subtype B in east Andalusia was estimated in 1970 (95%CI: 1965–1987). The Bayesian Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168099.g002">Fig 2</xref>) shows the clusters in a temporal context. The inferred tMRCA and ancestral location posterior probabilities (&gt;0.9 in all cases) for clusters are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The tree represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168099.g003">Fig 3</xref> indicates the subtype B phylogeography in east Andalusia, while the most probable ancestor location and location probability of the most relevant clusters are provided in
