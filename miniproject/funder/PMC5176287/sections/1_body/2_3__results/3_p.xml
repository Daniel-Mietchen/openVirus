<p>In order to test the integrity of clusters, we retrieved from GenBank the five most closely related (at least 95% of genetic similarity) HIV-1 sequences to all the 234 study sequences included in the clusters using ViroBLAST (

In a phylogenetic tree constructed with RAxML, we confirmed that none of the initially found clusters were broken down by adding these similar sequences from public databases, which ensures their status of real clusters circulating in east Andalusia (

It was noteworthy that sporadic GenBank sequences (particularly from other Spanish regions, but with limited available demographic information) formed part of some of east Andalusian lineages, which suggests linkage to other epidemics.
