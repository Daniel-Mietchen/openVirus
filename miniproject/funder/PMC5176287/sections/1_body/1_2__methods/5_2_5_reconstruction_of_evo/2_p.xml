<p>We used a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal clock (UCLN) [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and a demographic nonparametric model, Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The MCMC was run for 250 million states by sampling every 50,000. We estimated the evolutionary rate (Î¼, nucleotide substitutions per site per year, subst./site/year) and the time and location of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the different HIV-1 clades. For this analysis, we employed TRACER v1.6 (accessible at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/</ext-link>). Only traces with an effective sample size (ESS) of &gt; 200 were accepted after excluding an initial 10%. The BSP model allowed us to estimate effective changes in population size (Ne), and to run a demographic analysis in TRACER v1.6. To estimate the ancestral localisation of the virus and the most significant epidemiological links, we followed a discrete asymmetric Bayesian phylogeographic approach by means of Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS), and by georeferencing each sequence with discrete latitude and longitude data. We used SPREAD V1.0.6 (available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/aidslab/phylogeography/SPREAD.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.kuleuven.ac.be/aidslab/phylogeography/SPREAD.html</ext-link>.) and Bayes factor sets to identify well-supported rates and to summarise the geographic spread and the most significant epidemiological links of HIV-1 subtype B dispersal in east Andalusia. All the trees were visualised and edited with FigTree, v 1.4.0 (available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree</ext-link>). In these trees, the clusters of more epidemiologic relevance, as previously defined by ML, and with a posterior probability above 0.9 (PP&gt;0.9), were studied.
