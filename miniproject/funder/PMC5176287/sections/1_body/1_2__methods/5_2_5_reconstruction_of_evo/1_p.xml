<p>The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was applied to this data set, as implemented in BEAST v1.7.5 [

 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To improve the convergence of chains and molecular clock precision, the BEAST analysis was applied to a large set of the east Andalusian HIV-1 sequences (n = 419). A time scale in phylogenetic trees was set using the Shapiro-Rambaut-Drummond-2006 (SRD06) nucleotide substitution model, which adapts the

We estimated the evolutionary rate (Î¼, nucleotide substitutions per site per year, subst./site/year) by a previous analysis with 200 HIV-1 subtype B sequences from the viruses collected during 27 years, which were retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. These data were used to adjust a lognormal prior distribution for the clock rate (ucld.mean parameter; mean = 0.0024, stdev = 0.25).
