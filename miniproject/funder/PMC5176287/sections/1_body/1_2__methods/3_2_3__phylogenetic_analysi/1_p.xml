<p>All the sequences were edited manually and aligned using ClustalW [

A preliminary analysis was performed using maximum likelihood (ML) (
 <italic>randomised Accelerated Maximum Likelihood</italic>, RAxML), accessible through the CIPRES science Gateway [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We used the best-fit model selected by FindModel: general time-reversible (GTR) with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity across sites model and 1,000 bootstrap iterations for this analysis. The associations between the sequences with related nodes were studied, where a 70% bootstrap value was taken as a significantly reliable value [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, we confirmed these lineages by the Bayesian approach described below. We analysed the subtype B lineages of greater epidemiological relevance in detail (five or more related sequences).
