<p>The analysis included sequences generated from the earliest sample available before ART-initiation (baseline), from all the medical centres that attend HIV-1-infected individuals in east Andalusia, during the 2005–2012 period. The study population included all newly diagnosed HIV-seropositives irrespective of their HIV-infection status (chronic or recent). Of the 693 patients infected with HIV-1 from the provinces of Granada (capital city and Motril), Jaén, and Almería (capital city and El Ejido), 493 (71%) were patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B. Partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene sequences (protease (PR), codons 4–99; reverse transcriptase (RT), codons 38–247) were available and linked to demographic (risk group, age, sex, country of origin and attending hospital of origin), clinical (CD4+ T-cell count) and virological (viral load) information.
