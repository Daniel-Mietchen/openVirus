<p>The estimated mean evolutionary rate of subtype B epidemics (2.4 (95%CI: 1.7–3.1) x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year) was similar to that reported in other studies (1-3x10
 <sup>-3</sup> substitutions/site/year) [

 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This rate tended to be higher for the lineages formed largely by MSMs and IVDUs, which suggests greater transmission efficiency and faster subtype B evolution in the groups at risk of HIV-1 infection [
