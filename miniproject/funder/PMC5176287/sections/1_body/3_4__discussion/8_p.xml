<p>Several European cohorts have described the recent emergence of HIV-1 clusters, mainly among young MSMs [

 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In Spain, Yebra et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] reported a higher inclusion of MSMs into transmission clusters, and Cuevas et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] described a higher proportion of MSM clustering in the Basque country, with an important cluster that included 12 patients with the T215D revertant. Interestingly, an expansion of this cluster has been recently reported by Vega et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and Patiño-Galindo et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], who have added the origin and diversification of clusters in the 1990s. These findings may contribute to explain the growth in new infections in recent years [

 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and stress the need to increase access to HIV testing to lower transmission rates in high-risk populations.
