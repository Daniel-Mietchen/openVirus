 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] confirmed that the subtype B epidemic in east Andalusia started by diversifying before the first AIDS diagnosis was made in Spain in 1981 [
 <xref rid="pone.0168099.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As in other studies of this kind, the dates estimated with phylodynamics approaches that were sensitive to old lineages disappeared before our sampling times or past large waves of new HIV-1 introductions. In addition, this diversification might have started elsewhere.
