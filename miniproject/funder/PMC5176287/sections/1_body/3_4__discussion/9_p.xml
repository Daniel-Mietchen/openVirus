<p>In summary this is the first study of the evolutionary history of HIV-1 subtype B infection, phylodynamics and phylogeography in east Andalusia. We detected long-term lineages among high-risk populations. We present data that are extremely important to help develop preventive strategies in our scenario. We also showed how phylodynamics can be used to evaluate model occurrence of new HIV-1 outbreaks. We mapped subtype B HIV-1 migration in east Andalusia. Both phylogeographic and phylodynamic contributions should be considered when healthcare managers develop appropriate prevention strategies.</p>
