<p>Despite the fact that this work included all the available HIV-1 subtype B sequences generated for resistance testing during the study period and in the study area, the likely existence of undetected and undiagnosed HIV-infected subjects prevented us from detecting all the viral lineages that circulate in east Andalusia. In addition, this study did not take into account migration from beyond this region because we chose to focus on the net trends throughout the region, regardless of sporadic imports or exports. It would be most unlikely that all the subtype B lineages of foreign origin were circulating in our region without been noticed or sampled. We also intended to uncover the long-term well-established lineages that circulate in the region for the first time. Future studies will be designed to uncover the relationship of the east Andalusian HIV-1 epidemic to other regions or countries. Another aspect to consider is that the phylogenetic cluster definition vastly varies in the literature. Most studies have used node statistical support, genetic distance or time depth [
