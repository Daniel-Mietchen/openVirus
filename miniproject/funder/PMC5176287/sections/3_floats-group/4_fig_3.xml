  <title>Bayesian maximum clade credibility phylogeographic tree of the HIV-1 Subtype B by the Bayesian discrete approach in BEAST v1.7.5.</title>
  <p>The upper left bar represents the gradient of location probability. Nodes were drawn using a progressive ancestral probability location value of 0–1. Colours of terminal and internal branches indicate the sampling location for each sequence and the most probable ancestral location for each clade, respectively. The clusters of greatest epidemiological interest (≥5 patients grouped) are indicated by an asterisk (*).</p>
