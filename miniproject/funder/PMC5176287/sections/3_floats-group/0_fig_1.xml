  <title>ML phylogenetic tree of the global HIV-1 subtype B 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequences.
  </title>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the general time-reversible with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity across sites model of substitution implemented into RAxML. Branches are drawn on scale with the bar at the bottom, which represents 0.03 nucleotide substitution per site and a progressive bootstrap gradient value using FigTree, v. 1.4. The statistically highly supported nodes (bootstrap &gt;70%) and the clusters with five or more related sequences are indicated by an asterisk (*).</p>
