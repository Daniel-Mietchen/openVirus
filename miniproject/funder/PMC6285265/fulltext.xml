SHUV was isolated from diverse species of domesticated animals and wildlife, and is associated with neurological disease, abortions, and congenital malformations. Recently, SHUV caused outbreaks among ruminants in Israel, representing the first incursions outside the African continent. The isolation of SHUV from a febrile child in Nigeria and seroprevalence among veterinarians in South Africa suggests that the virus may have zoonotic potential as well. The high pathogenicity, extremely broad tropism, potential transmission via both biting midges and mosquitoes, and zoonotic features warrants prioritization of SHUV for further research. Additional knowledge is essential to accurately determine the risk for animal and human health, and to assess the risk of future epizootics and epidemics. To gain first insights into the potential involvement of arthropod vectors in SHUV transmission, we have investigated the ability of SHUV to infect and disseminate in laboratory-reared biting midges and mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology/Principal findings</title><p><italic>Culicoides nubeculosus</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic>, <italic>Culex pipiens pipiens</italic>, and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> were orally exposed to SHUV by providing an infectious blood meal.

In particular the order <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> comprises emerging pathogens such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has included both CCHFV and RVFV to the &#x0201c;Blueprint&#x0201d; list of ten prioritized viruses likely to cause future epidemics and for which insufficient countermeasures are available [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the veterinary field, prioritized viral diseases of animals, including RVFV, are notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties, OIE). Apart from pathogens that are recognised as major threats by WHO and OIE, many have remained largely neglected. Before the turn of the century, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus were among these neglected viruses until they reminded us how fast arboviruses can spread in immunologically na&#x000ef;ve populations [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although these outbreaks came as a surprise, in hindsight, smaller outbreaks in previously unaffected areas could have been recognised as warning signs.</p><p>Shuni virus (SHUV; family <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, Simbu serogroup) recently emerged in two very distant areas of the world [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SHUV was isolated for the first time from a slaughtered cow in the 1960s in Nigeria [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During subsequent years, the virus was isolated on several occasions from domestic animals including cattle, sheep, goats, and horses [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], from wild animals including crocodiles and rhinoceros [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and from field-collected <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More recently, SHUV was associated with malformed ruminants in Israel [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Emergence of SHUV in areas outside Sub-Saharan Africa shows the potential of this virus to spread to new areas, and increases the risk for SHUV outbreaks in bordering territories such as Europe. Isolation of SHUV from a febrile child and detection of antibodies in 3.9% of serum samples from veterinarians in South Africa shows that SHUV can infect humans as well, although its ability to cause human disease is still uncertain [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Proper risk assessments rely on accurate knowledge of disease transmission cycles. Arbovirus transmission cycles can only become established when competent vectors and susceptible hosts encounter under suitable climatic conditions. Although SHUV has been isolated from pools of field-collected <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the role of both insect groups as actual vectors remains to be confirmed. Detection of virus in field-collected insects is not sufficient to prove their ability to transmit the virus. Arboviruses need to overcome several barriers (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. midgut and salivary gland barriers) inside their vector, before they can be transmitted [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to virus isolation from field-collected vectors, laboratory studies are therefore needed to experimentally test the ability of blood-feeding insects to become infected with, maintain, and successfully transmit arboviruses (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., vector competence) [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To gain insights into the potential of <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and mosquitoes to function as vectors of SHUV, we studied the susceptibility of four main arbovirus vector species (<italic>Culicoides nubeculosus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic> biting midges, and <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> biotype <italic>pipiens</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes) for SHUV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Cell culture</title><p>African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6; ATCC CRL-1586) were cultured in Eagle&#x02019;s minimum essential medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, United States) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco), and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco).

Taken together, SHUV is able to disseminate in mosquitoes, but both the midgut and salivary glands form a barrier for SHUV.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Discussion</title><p>SHUV was previously isolated from field-collected pools of <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and from mosquitoes, but their involvement in SHUV transmission remained to be confirmed [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Here, we show for the first time that SHUV is able to infect and replicate in biting midges as well as in mosquitoes, but only the biting midge species evaluated in the present study can be considered highly susceptible to infection.</p><p>Both <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nubeculosus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic> showed high infection rates of 44% and 60% when incubated for 10 days at 25&#x000b0;C and 28&#x000b0;C, respectively. It has been demonstrated that a salivary gland barrier is absent for Orbiviruses and Schmallenberg virus in biting midges [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This knowledge, in combination with evidence of successful dissemination of SHUV to the heads indicates that the biting midge species evaluated in the present study are likely competent vectors of SHUV. Importantly, the finding that SHUV replicates efficiently in two biting midge species from a different geographic background suggests that various species of <italic>Culicoides</italic> may function as vectors of SHUV.</p><p>SHUV infection and replication in biting midges seems more efficient compared to other biting midge-borne viruses such as SBV and bluetongue virus (BTV), which generally show infection rates up to 30% [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Both SBV and BTV have caused sudden and large-scale epizootics in Europe, with devastating consequences for the livestock sector [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The relatively high susceptibility and efficiency of replication in biting midges, and recent spread of SHUV to areas outside Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], should therefore be interpreted as a warning for its epizootic potential.</p><p>In contrast to the high infection rates in biting midges, only few orally exposed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes became infected with SHUV during 10 days of incubation at 28&#x000b0;C. In addition, no evidence of successful dissemination to the salivary glands of the two mosquito species was found. SHUV replication and transmission (8%) was observed when the virus was directly injected into the thorax of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. This indicates that both the midgut infection barrier and the salivary gland barrier prevent infection and subsequent transmission of SHUV by <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Of the <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes that were orally exposed to SHUV, none became infected during 10 days of incubation at 25&#x000b0;C. Moreover, replication of SHUV was low in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic>, as evidenced by low titers when it was directly injected into the thorax. However, a relatively high percentage of mosquito saliva samples contained SHUV. We therefore conclude that the midgut barrier is the main barrier that prevents infection of <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> with SHUV. Our findings are in line with an earlier study on the closely-related SBV, which showed no evidence for involvement of <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> in virus transmission, although SBV was able to infect <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, as <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>theileri</italic> has been identified as a vector of several other bunyaviruses, this mosquito may also be a possible vector of SHUV [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, vector competence studies with additional mosquito species collected from the field are needed to fully understand the possible role of mosquitoes in natural transmission cycles of SHUV.</p><p>In this study, we determined infection, dissemination, and transmission of SHUV by infectivity assays and virus titers by EPDA (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. assays based on inoculation of samples on Vero cells which are then screened for CPE). Such infectivity assays and EPDAs have the advantage of detecting infectious virus particles, whereas other methods like qPCR that quantify genome equivalents, may include defective virus particles and thereby not accurately represent infectious virus. Of note, observed CPE in the infectivity assays and EPDAs was found to invariably correspond with SHUV RNA as determined by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006993.s001">S1 Supporting Information</xref>).</p><p>Recent outbreaks of SBV and BTV exemplified the tremendous impact of midge-borne viruses on animal health [<xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our study demonstrates highly efficient infection, replication, and dissemination of SHUV in two biting midge species (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>nubeculosus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic>). However, conclusive evidence for SHUV transmission by biting midges should be provided by experiments with infected biting midges and susceptible mammals, although these kind of experiments are costly and complex. We cannot exclude that results obtained with laboratory-reared vectors are different from those obtained with field-collected vectors. Therefore, future studies should test vector competence of field-collected <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midge and mosquito species exposed to different quantities of SHUV, to more accurately predict the risk of SHUV transmission in specific areas. These experiments in combination with behavioural and ecological research will contribute to our understanding of the transmission cycle of SHUV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006993.s001"><label>S1 Supporting Information</label><caption><title>RT-qPCR validation of Shuni virus read-out based on cytopathic effects.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006993.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006993.s002"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset Shuni virus growth curves.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006993.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006993.s003"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Dataset Shuni virus vector competence experiments.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006993.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) for kindly providing SHUV, The Pirbright Institute for kindly providing eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nubeculosus</italic>, and Barbara Drolet (USDA-ARS) for kindly providing eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic>.
