<p>The 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens pipiens</italic> colony was established in the laboratory from egg rafts collected in the field in The Netherlands during August 2016. Egg rafts were individually hatched in tubes. Pools of approximately 10 first instar larvae were identified to the biotype level using real-time PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The colony was started by grouping larvae from 93 egg rafts identified as the 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> biotype. Mosquitoes were maintained at 23°C with 16:8 light:dark cycle and 60% relative humidity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Adult mosquitoes were kept in Bugdorm-1 rearing cages and maintained on 6% glucose solution 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Cow blood or chicken blood (Kemperkip, Uden, The Netherlands) was collected in BC Vacutainer lithium heparin-coated blood collection tubes (Becton Dickinson, Breda, The Netherlands), and stored at 4°C. Blood was provided through a Parafilm M membrane using the Hemotek PS5 feeding system for egg production. Egg rafts were transferred to square larval holding trays (25 x 25 x 8 cm, Kartell) filled with tap water and two drops of Liquifry No. 1. Hatched larvae were fed with a 1:1:1 mixture of bovine liver powder, ground rabbit food, and ground koi food. Pupae were collected every 2 days and placed in Bugdorm-1 insect rearing cages.
