<p>Proper risk assessments rely on accurate knowledge of disease transmission cycles. Arbovirus transmission cycles can only become established when competent vectors and susceptible hosts encounter under suitable climatic conditions. Although SHUV has been isolated from pools of field-collected

 <xref rid="pntd.0006993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the role of both insect groups as actual vectors remains to be confirmed. Detection of virus in field-collected insects is not sufficient to prove their ability to transmit the virus. Arboviruses need to overcome several barriers (
