<p>Numbers of VMMCs performed by age stratum were taken from client intake records at facilities for 2009–2014 and from the National District Health Information System [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199453.s002">S2 File</xref>). In the EMOD model, these VMMCs were distributed over time directly to male individuals of the appropriate age. The ICL model distributed VMMCs directly to the 15–49 age group, with boys in the 10–14 age group entering the model as newly circumcised with a delay of 5 years to simulate the onset of sexual maturity. For the Goals model, VMMC numbers were translated into proportions of adult men newly circumcised, by dividing the VMMCs by the corresponding male target population (by age stratum), adding that percentage coverage to the baseline (2008) MC coverage percentage, and subtracting MC coverage among men aging out of the sexually active group. This approach implicitly (and optimistically) assumes that there is no replacement of traditional MCs by VMMCs.
