<p>In the Goals model, ART reduces the HIV transmission probability per sex act by 80% in the 'status quo' scenarios (except for Bulawayo and Harare, for which the reduction is 75% according to best model fits), increasing to 90% in the Fast Track scenario in all provinces. In the ICL model, ART reduces the per-partnership transmission probability by 85% in all scenarios. EMOD simulates viral suppression from ART and assumes suppressed individuals are non-infectious.</p>
