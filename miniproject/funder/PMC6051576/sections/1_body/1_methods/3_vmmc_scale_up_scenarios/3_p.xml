<p>Our second scale-up scenario supposes that the VMMC program targets—scale-up to 80% coverage among 15–29 year old men and 30% among 10–14 year-olds—are achieved by 2021 and maintained thereafter. We evaluate this scenario in two possible settings, which capture developments with other HIV interventions in Zimbabwe over the same time period. In a 'status quo' setting, the VMMC program could be accompanied by continuations of recent trends in antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up, with constant coverage of prevention interventions and constant rates of risk and (non-VMMC) protective behaviors. For the Goals model, this translates to extrapolating the trend in the proportion of people on ART from 2014–2016 [

Alternatively, ambitious scale-up programs for both ART and prevention interventions could be enacted to reach UNAIDS Fast Track targets for 2030 [
