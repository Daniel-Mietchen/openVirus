<p>Our ingredients-based unit cost for VMMC included national-level costs for demand creation but excluded the costs of monitoring and evaluation, provincial and district management and coordination, resource mobilization, and partner-level overheads [
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This may mean that we have overestimated the cost-effectiveness of VMMC. Other uncertainties may arise from selective uptake; that is, we may have overestimated impact if VMMC clients are lower risk than average, or underestimated it if they are of higher risk. Market research in Zimbabwe in 2013 found that men taking up VMMC generally had attitudes suggesting low risk, but their actual behaviors were not measured [
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, men might adopt riskier behaviors after circumcision (behavioral risk compensation), which would lead to overestimation of VMMC impact. However, a study of Bulawayo province in Zimbabwe over 2012–2015 found no indication of risk compensation [
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], similarly to Kenya [
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Uganda [
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A further source of impact overestimation could be elevated risk during wound healing, but there is currently no evidence for or against this in Zimbabwe. Lastly, our modeling study did not aim to evaluate the possible impact of early infant male circumcision—which could be a useful and cost-effective strategy in the longer term, despite requiring a different implementation infrastructure—to supplement current adolescents- and adult-targeted strategies that are essential for short-term impact [
