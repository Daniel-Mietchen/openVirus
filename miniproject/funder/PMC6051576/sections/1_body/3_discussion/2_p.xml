<p>The ranges for impact produced by the three models are fairly wide, reflecting real uncertainty in VMMC impact and its determinants, particularly the current level of HIV incidence. For example, differences between the two models without age structure (Goals and ICL) stem from the ICL model considering only ages 15–49 (versus all ages) and depicting a lower proportion of total incidence occurring among men than women, though both models are consistent with historical data. Additional uncertainty comes from the age distribution of incidence relative to the age distribution of new VMMCs. The age-structured EMOD model may, in this respect, have provided the best impact estimate, although data limitations make it difficult to fully validate modeled age structure in sexual networks. Nevertheless, our results are in line with earlier evaluations of VMMC cost-effectiveness in other sub-Saharan African settings; for example, VMMC was estimated to cost between $131 and $3,160 per infection averted across three regions in Mozambique [

 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], likely because HIV incidence is very high there. The consistency across (past and current) modeling results provides credibility, especially given the distinct structures of our three models (Section D in
