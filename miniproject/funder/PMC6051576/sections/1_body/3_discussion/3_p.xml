<p>Compared to projections used to inform Zimbabweâ€™s first VMMC program plan (ASCOP) in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the current models estimated fewer infections averted, a higher cost per infection averted, and a later time at which the savings from averted ART will begin to compensate for VMMC investments. One reason for this is that the program reported fewer VMMCs performed in 2015 and 2016 than the targets set out in the ASCOP, and the 80% coverage target was postponed from 2017 to 2021. Furthermore, HIV incidence as of 2016 is lower than what was projected in 2014, possibly reflecting an emerging impact from ART scale-up.
