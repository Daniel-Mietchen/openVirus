<p>In our scenarios in which no future VMMCs are performed (i.e. the program ended in 2016) or the program is halted in 2018/19 as current funder commitments expire, coverage in the 15â€“49 year old cohort falls gradually back to the baseline level of 9.2% as uncircumcised 14-year-old boys age into the cohort and circumcised 49-year-old men age out.</p>
