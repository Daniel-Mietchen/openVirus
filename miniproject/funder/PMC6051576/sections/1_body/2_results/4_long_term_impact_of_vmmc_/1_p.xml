<p>In the Fast Track scenario with accelerated scale-up of ART and additional prevention interventions alongside VMMC (Section C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0199453.s001">S1 File</xref>), HIV incidence will be reduced to low levels, so that there are fewer remaining infections avertable by VMMC, and therefore the number of VMMCs needed to avert one infection and the cost to avert one infection are both higher (
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Nevertheless, the marginal impact of VMMC is still substantial: new infections at 2030 under Fast Track would be up to 20% higher if VMMC were dropped from Fast Track and if MC coverage stayed at the 2016 level throughout 2030 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199453.g002">Fig 2</xref>). For example, according to the Goals model, we would see 19,600 infections in 2030 in a Fast Track setting without VMMC, compared to 16,100 infections in a Fast Track setting with VMMC.
