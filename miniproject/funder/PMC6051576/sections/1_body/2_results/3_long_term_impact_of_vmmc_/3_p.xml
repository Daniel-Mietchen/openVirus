<p>While additional funds will be required to meet the VMMC target by 2021, after the target is reached, fewer annual resources will be required to maintain VMMC coverage. Over 2009–2030, the cost to avert one HIV infection with VMMC will be only $2,100–3,250. The models agree that once the target VMMC coverage levels have been reached, the net annual cost of maintaining treatment provision and the VMMC program together will be lower than what it would cost to maintain treatment in the absence of the VMMC program, because the aversion of new infections by VMMC will reduce the long-term treatment need. The 'break-even point' occurs in 2022 in the Goals projections, 2030 in the ICL projections, and 2035 in the EMOD projections (
