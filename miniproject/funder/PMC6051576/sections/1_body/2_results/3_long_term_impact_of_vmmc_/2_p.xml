<p>Achieving the VMMC targets by 2021, with maintenance thereafter, will avert 108,000–171,000 infections (10–13% of all new infections) over 2009–2030. VMMC is an efficient intervention, requiring only 19–30 circumcisions per infection averted. Sustaining the accelerated VMMC program will require continued funding and support. Indeed, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), one of the main funders, plans to continue supporting VMMC programs in 14 countries and aims to achieve saturation by 2020 in priority districts [

We estimate that if funders discontinue support for the VMMC program when their current commitments end in 2018/19, then 37,500–126,000 infections will be averted over 2009–2030, requiring 14–40 circumcisions per infection averted.
