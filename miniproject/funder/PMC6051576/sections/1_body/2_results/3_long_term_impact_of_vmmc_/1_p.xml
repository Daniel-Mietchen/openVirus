<p>Against a 'status quo' backdrop of continued ART scale-up, we evaluated the impact of VMMC over the longer timeframe of 2009–2030 (
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199453.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The VMMCs provided up to 2016 will avert 24,400–69,800 new infections (2.3–5% of all new infections) over 2009–2030, even if no further VMMCs are performed. Infections averted after 2016 result primarily from young men circumcised between 2009 and 2016, who age into their life stage of highest HIV incidence in next years.
