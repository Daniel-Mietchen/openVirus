<p>Thus far we have assumed a constant ART unit cost of $251 per person per year, but in reality the cost may decline over time in response to antiretroviral price drops and improvements in the efficiency of service delivery. This has been predicted and targeted in the strategies of major global donors. If, for example, we allow a linear decline from $251 in 2017 to $200 by 2026, then the savings from averted ART costs due to VMMC over 2017–2030 are $47–178 million, rather than the default $55–198 million.</p>
