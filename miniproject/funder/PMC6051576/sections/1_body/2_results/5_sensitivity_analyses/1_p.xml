<p>We carried out a series of sensitivity analyses (
 <xref rid="pone.0199453.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Thus far, we did not discount future outcomes; as a first sensitivity analysis, we applied a discounting of 3% per year to both future impacts and costs, back to 2015 as the reference year. Over 2009–2030, we found that discounting would increase the cost of VMMC per infection averted from $2,100–3,250 to $2,400–3,700, as the health impact lags behind the cost.
