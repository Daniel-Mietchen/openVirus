<p>Zimbabwe adopted VMMC as a priority HIV prevention strategy in 2007 and began service delivery in 2009. Its initial plan was to reach 80% coverage among young men (ages 15–29) by 2017. Pilot studies and modeling of expected impact and cost [

 <xref rid="pone.0199453.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] informed the strategy, design, and programmatic targets for VMMC scale-up between 2009 and 2015. Despite successes in service provision, uptake was slower than expected (with 845,000 VMMCs reported by 2016), possibly as a result of negative perceptions of circumcision in a traditionally non-circumcising country [

A modeling study indicated that the program was reaching an efficient and impactful age bracket (13–29 year-olds) via school-based campaigns but boosting uptake among already sexually active young men would increase short-term impact and cost-effectiveness [
