   <bold>Costs of VMMC and ART in the scenario in which the program targets for 2021 are achieved in a 'status quo' setting (without Fast Track), compared to our counterfactual scenario of no VMMCs ever, from (A) the Goals model, (B) the ICL model, and (C) the EMOD model.</bold> Shown are the cost of VMMC if the program targets are met and maintained (green bars), the cost of ART if the program targets are met and maintained (orange bars), and the cost of ART in the counterfactual scenario with no VMMC ever (red curves). As in previous tables and Figs, Goals (A) and EMOD (C) consider all age groups and ICL (B) only ages 15â€“49.
