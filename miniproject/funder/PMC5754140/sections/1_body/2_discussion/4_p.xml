<p>Besides, we also identified a direct neutralizing antibody that effectively blocked the entry of PRV in the absence of complement, 1H1, which targets the domain I of gB. This is the first complement-independent neutralizing epitope of PRV gB reported to date to our knowledge. The 1H1 mAb binds gB at the bottom of domain I, which is very close to the fusion loops. Although the atomic interaction details cannot be elucidated by the low-resolution EM structure, the binding region of 1H1 mAb can be definitely determined, which is also confirmed by the mutagenesis work. Three copies of Fab fragment surround the peripheral of fusion loops, making it probably unable to reach the membrane of host cells. In the context of full-length IgG, the other Fab arm might render extra steric hindrance, which further blocks the interactions between gB and cell membrane. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the observation that gB fusion loops directly interact with lipid bilayer captured by cryo-EM imaging [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the 1H1 mAb could probably recognize gB in different conformations, including pre-fusion, post-fusion and the intermediates in between, which is possibly the reason contributing to its high neutralizing efficacy. In addition, these observations also indicate that domain I of gB could possibly serve as an ideal immunogen to elicit direct neutralizing antibodies against herpesviruses.
