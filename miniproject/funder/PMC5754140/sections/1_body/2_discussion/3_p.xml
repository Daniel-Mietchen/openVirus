<p>It has been established that the entry of herpesviruses involves multiple viral glycoproteins and possibly multiple receptors as well, and gB was also shown to play a role in receptor binding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, all the antibodies targeting domain IV of gB reported to date do not directly block PRV entry but dependent on the complement effect instead, as shown by cell-based assays 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This phenomenon implies that domain IV is probably not a receptor binding site for PRV gB, and that it might retain the same fold before and after membrane fusion with only domain rearrangement in the process of gB conformational changes to mediate membrane fusion. These findings would thus provide important clues to understand the entry mechanisms of PRV and other herpesviruses.
