<p>In summary, we combined both immunological and structural approaches to systematically characterize the envelope protein gB of an emerging highly pathogenic PRV variant. We identified two classes of neutralizing antibodies that effectively block PRV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, which utilize different mechanisms with complement dependence or without respectively. These two classes of antibodies recognize gB with epitopes in two separate domains and thus indicate these domains as potential subunit vaccines to prevent PRV infections. These findings would intensify our understanding of the immunogenic properties of PRV glycoproteins and provide important guidance for antiviral drug design and vaccine development.
