<p>In common with other members in the 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family, PRV harbors a pool of glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to form a huge machinery for virus entry, among which gB is the main fusogen responsible for inducing membrane fusion [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated gB as an effective immunogen to elicit complement-dependent neutralizing antibodies against PRV infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our studies further supported the conclusion and identified other antigenic sites to elicit direct neutralizing antibodies as well. Combining our findings with previous reports, we can conclude that domain IV is the immunodominant region of PRV gB. Based on the gB structure we present in this study, domain IV is located on the apexes of the gB trimer to form a "crown", making it fully accessible for both antibody and potential receptor recognition. This domain is quite conceivable to become a hotspot for antibody targeting and thus a suitable candidate to develop subunit vaccines.
