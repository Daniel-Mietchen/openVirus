<p>Pig kidney (PK-15) cells (CL33, obtained from ATCC) and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells (GNO10, obtained from cell resource center of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. PRV strain HN1201 was isolated in 2012 from an affected pig farm in China [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and was propagated in Vero cells. PRV strains Bartha-K61, HB98, RA, SU, 188–5, 072–1, and BH1 were provided by the National Research Center for Veterinary Medicine, China. To make the current epidemic status and the major molecular changes of PRV clear, a phylogenetic analysis based on all PRV genomes available in the GenBank database was performed using the distance-based neighbor-joining method in MEGA4 software (
