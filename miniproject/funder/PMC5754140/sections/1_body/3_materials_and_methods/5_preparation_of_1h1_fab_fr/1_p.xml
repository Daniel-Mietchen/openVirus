<p>The coding sequences for 1H1 variable fragments (VH and VL) were fused to the sequence encoding constant regions of a mouse IgG1 (CH, CL and Fc) to generate chimeric IgG1 expression vector using the backbone of pCAGGS plasmid. Two mutant protein-expressing plasmids (1H1_NL and 1H1_SL) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to replace N103 or S105 in HCDR3 with alanine (

After three to seven days post transfection, the supernatants containing secreted IgG1s were harvested and subjected to HiTrap ProteinG chromatography (GE Healthcare). Target proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 3.0) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/600 pg column (GE Healthcare). Fab fragments were generated by ficin digestion and purified using the pierce mouse IgG1 Fab preparation kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The products were buffer-exchanged into a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl by an additional round of size-exclusion chromatography for crystallization.
