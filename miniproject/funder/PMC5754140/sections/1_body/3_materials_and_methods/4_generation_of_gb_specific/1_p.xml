<p>To generate gB-specific mAbs, purified recombinant PRV-gB (100 μg/mouse) was blended with Freund’s complete adjuvant and used to immunize 6-week-old female BALB/c mice. Booster immunizations were performed twice with 3-week intervals. Then the spleen cells were isolated and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for reactivity to purified PRV-gB by standard indirect ELISAs. Positive hybridoma clones were subcloned by limited dilution at least three times. The mAbs were initially captured from hybridoma cell culture supernatants by affinity chromatography with a Protein G HP column (GE Healthcare) and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography.</p>
