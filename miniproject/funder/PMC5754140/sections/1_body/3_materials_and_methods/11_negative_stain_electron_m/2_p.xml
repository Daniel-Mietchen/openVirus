<p>A total of ~8000 particles were semi-automatically picked from 200 micrographs using e2boxer.py in EMAN2 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] method. All the subsequent classification and reconstruction processes were conducted with relion-2.0 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] using the phase-flipped particles without further CTF corrections. After several rounds of iterative 2D and 3D classifications, a stack of ~3000 particles was selected with 3 copies of 1H1 Fab bound to a gB trimer. The stack was subjected to 3D refinement with 3-fold symmetry applied, which resulted in a reconstruction of 35 Ã… resolution as determined by the gold-standard fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.5 cut-off value (
