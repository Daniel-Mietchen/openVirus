<p>To prepare the PRV gB-1H1 Fab complex, soluble PRV gB and 1H1 Fab samples were mixed with a molar ratio of 1:1.5 and incubated at 4°C for 2 h. The mixture was then separated by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The complex sample at a concentration of 0.02 mg/mL was applied to glow-discharged copper grids coated with continuous carbon films and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The excessive stain liquor was blotted with a filter paper and let the grid to air-dry. The specimen was then loaded onto a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a field emission gun for data collection, which was operated at 200 kV acceleration voltage and with a defocus range of—(1–3) μm. Images were recorded with a 4k×4k BM-Eagle CCD camera with a calibrated pixel size of 1.36 Å.</p>
