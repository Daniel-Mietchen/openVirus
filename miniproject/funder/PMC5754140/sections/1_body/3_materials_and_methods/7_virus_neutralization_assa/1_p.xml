<p>PK-15 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Pseudorabies viruses (200 times of TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) were incubated with serial two-fold dilutions of the 1H1 mAb at 37°C for 1 h prior infecting cells. Then, the mixture was added to PK-15 monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h. Each concentration was conducted with eight replicates. The supernatant was removed after incubation and replaced by fresh DMEM medium. The cells were cultivated for another 72 h at 37°C before analysis. The cellular pathology was directly observed using microscopy. All experiments were conducted in three independent trials. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was measured to describe the neutralization titer of each antibody. To identify complement-dependent neutralization activities, the experiment was conducted following the same protocol as above except that fresh rabbit serum (working concentration: 5%) as an exogenous complement was added into the virus-antibody mixture before infecting the cells. The data was graphed using GraphPad Prism 5 for presentation (San Diego, CA).
