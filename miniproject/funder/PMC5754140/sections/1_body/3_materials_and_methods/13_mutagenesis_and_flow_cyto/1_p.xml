<p>The gene sequence encoding the full length wild type PRV gB (amino acids 1â€“914) was cloned into the vector pEGFP-N1 to generate a gB expression vector with an EGFP tag fused at the C-terminus. A QuickChange site-directed mutagensis kit was used to obtain the mutants with the indicated mutations (Q206A, D210A, R214A, R215A or Mut4). Mut4 denotes the quadruple mutant with all four amino acids replaced by Alanine. Protein expression was verified by fluorescence microscopy.</p>
