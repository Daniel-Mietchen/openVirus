<p>The binding between the 1H1 mAb and gB/mutants was analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells with large T antigen (293T cells, obtained from cell resource center of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences) were transfected with these plasmids above separately. After 24 h, the transfected cells were incubated with 1H1 mAb at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then washed 3 times with 1×PBS to remove the unbound antibodies. Subsequently, the cells were further incubated with APC-linked goat anti-mouse IgG (minimal x-reactivity) (Biolegend, U.S.A) secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature (avoiding light). Again, discard the liquid and wash 3 times with 1×PBS. Finally, the cells were loaded onto the flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur) to detect the APC fluorescence signals.</p>
