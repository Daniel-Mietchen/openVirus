<p>The protein samples were concentrated to 10 mg/mL for crystallization using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 18°C. PRV gB was crystallized with a reservoir solution of 34% PEG200 and 0.1 M citric acid, pH 6.5. The crystals of PRV-gB-D_IV were obtained in reservoir solution containing 0.05 M calcium chloride dihydrate and 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0. The 1H1 Fab was crystallized with a reservoir solution of 0.2 M potassium sulfate and 20% PEG3350, pH 6.8. X-ray diffraction data was collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) BL17U at a wavelength of 0.97915 Å [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Structures were determined by the molecular replacement method using the Phaser program [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] in the CCP4 suite [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The PRV gB structure was solved using the HSV-1 gB structure (PDB ID: 2GUM) as the search model. The Fab structure (PDB ID: 1SY6) was used as the search input for 1H1 Fab structure determination. Initial restrained rigid-body refinement was performed using PHENIX [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which was followed by manual rebuilding and adjustment in COOT [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Further refinement was performed using PHENIX [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The stereochemical qualities of the final models were assessed using MOLPROBITY [
