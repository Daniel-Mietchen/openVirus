<p>Both proteins (HN1201 strain [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]) were expressed with the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The PRV gB construct covers nearly the full-length ectodomain, including residues A59 to N752, followed by a C-terminal 6×His tag. The PRV-gB-D_IV includes two continuous regions, residues A59 to S148 and N546 to T700, linked by a GGSG polypeptide, and a 6×His tag is fused at the C terminus. The GP67 signal sequence was engineered at the N-terminus of each protein to facilitate secretion during protein production. To produce recombinant proteins, Hi5 cells were infected with high-titer recombinant baculovirus and grown for 48 h. The cell culture supernatant was harvested by centrifugation applied to metal affinity chromatography with a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). The eluted product was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/600 pg column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl and 150 mM NaCl (pH 8.0). The final product reached a purity of ~95% as shown by SDS-PAGE.
