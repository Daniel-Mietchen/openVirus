<p>Though with low resolution, the reconstructed map clearly shows the feature of gB trimer in the center and three copies of 1H1 Fab density branching out at one end. We first fitted the crystal structure of PRV gB into the density map using CHIMERA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which showed a high degree of matching. The atomic structure of 1H1 Fab was further fitted into the remaining density using SITUS [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with several rounds of orientation search. The special hinged structure of the Fab density allowed us to distinguish the relative orientation of heavy chain and light chain of Fab molecules despite the low resolution of the reconstruction. All the fitting processes were performed following the rigid-docking protocols without local adjustments. No obvious clash or close contact was observed in the final pseudo-atomic model, which was used for further structural analysis. All the EM density related figures were rendered using CHIMERA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
