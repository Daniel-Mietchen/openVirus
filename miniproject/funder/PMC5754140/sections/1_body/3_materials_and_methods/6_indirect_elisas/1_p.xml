<p>Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with purified PRV-gB and PRV-gB-D_IV at 200 ng/well in a carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6) at 4째C overnight. Plates were blocked at 37째C for 1 h with PBST containing 5% skimmed milk. Antibodies were then added in the well and incubated for 1 h at 37째C. After three times of washing, the wells were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz) for 40 min at 37째C. The plates were washed again for five times before the reaction substrate TMB was added. The reaction was conducted in dark at room temperature for 5 min and was stopped with 2 M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. The optical density at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450</sub>) of each well was read using a microplate reader (Thermo). Statistical presentations were generated with GraphPad Prism 5 (San Diego, CA).
