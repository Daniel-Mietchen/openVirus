<p>The V gene sequences of each mAb clone were amplified as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, 10
 <sup>6</sup> hybridoma cells were collected by centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol regent (Takara) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Reverse transcription and PCR amplification were performed using a set of primers [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. PCR products were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using a commercial kit (Tiangen). The DNA fragments were cloned into the pMD 18-T vector (Takara) and sequenced individually.
