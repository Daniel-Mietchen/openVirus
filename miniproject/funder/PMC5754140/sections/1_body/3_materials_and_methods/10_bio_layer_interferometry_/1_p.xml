<p>The binding affinities of wild type 1H1 Fab or mutants to PRV gB were measured by BLI at room temperature (298K) with the Octet RED96 biosensor method (ForteBio, Inc.). The runnning buffer is composed of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl and 0.005% (vol/vol) Tween 20. Soluble gB was immobilized on an Ni-NTA-coated biosensor surface and then exposed to a series of analytes at different concentrations (6.25–100 nM for 1H1_WT, 62.5–1000 nM for 1H1_NL or 1H1_SL). Background subtraction was used to correct the errors of sensor drifting. The data was processed by the ForteBio’s data analysis software and plotted with Origin 8.0 program.</p>
