<p>Pseudorabies virus (PRV) belongs to the family

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is an important nervous system tropic pathogen in livestock and infects a variety of mammalian species, including ruminants, carnivores, and rodents [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Pigs, the natural host of PRV, are a unique animal species that can survive a productive PRV infection and suffer life-long latent infections in the peripheral nervous system [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For other susceptible animals, PRV infection is usually fatal [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In pigs, the clinical signs of infection vary with the age of the infected individuals. Newborn piglets infected with PRV may develop nervous system disorders and even deaths. For adult pigs however, PRV infection often leads to respiratory diseases. In addition, the virus can even cross the placental barrier of pregnant sows to infect the fetuses and cause abortion [
