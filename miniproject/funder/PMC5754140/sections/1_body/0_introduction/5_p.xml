<p>In this work, we immunized mice with soluble PRV gB to generate gB specific mAbs and identified a total of 15 neutralizing antibodies that effectively block PRV entry with either complement dependent or independent mechanisms. To locate their epitopes, we also determined the crystal structure of PRV gB and verified the binding footprints by mutagenesis. These findings would enormously advance our understanding of PRV gB immunogenicity and provide important guidance for antiviral drug design and vaccine development.</p>
