<p>Similar to other herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), PRV gB induces protective humoral immunity against viral infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Though PRV has not been reported to infect humans, an antibody raised against PRV gB were observed to cross-react with HSV gB [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], indicating the gBs of different herpesviruses may share some common epitopes. Previously, 26 gB-specific mAbs were identified that cannot directly neutralize PRV

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Further biochemical studies mapped the epitopes of these antibodies to be within three main regions of gB, residues 59–126, 216–279, and 540–734, respectively [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Most antibodies target epitopes within residues 540–734 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In order to develop better therapeutics and vaccines, more efforts should be made to characterize the structural and immunogenic properties of gBs of these emerging highly pathogenic PRV variants.
