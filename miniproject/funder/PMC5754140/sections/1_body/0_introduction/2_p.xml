<p>Although several countries have eradicated PRV, such as the USA, New Zealand and many members of the European Union, it is still circulating sporadically in many regions all around the globe [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Highly pathogenic PRV variants have emerged in numbers of pig farms in China since late 2011 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The driving force behind the high virulence of emerging PRV variants remains unknown. The marketed attenuated live vaccine Bartha-K61 is widely used in the pig industry of China in recent years. Unfortunately, Bartha-K61 cannot confer effective protection against the emerging PRV variants [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, the epidemics have the potential to spread outside China to reach the surrounding countries, posing great threats to the pig industry of Asia-Pacific and south-east Asia. Further research on the emerging PRV variant strains is urgently required to control the epidemic situation and further eradicate the disease [
