<p>To precisely identify the epitope of 1H1 mAb, we made great efforts to determine the structure of PRV gB-1H1_Fab complex. Unfortunately, we failed to obtain high quality diffractive crystals of the complex. As an alternative approach, we conducted 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction by negative stain electron microscopy (EM) method. A 35 Å resolution EM map of PRV gB in complex with 1H1 Fab was obtained (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006777.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). In this complex, there are three copies of 1H1 Fab binding to the three protomers in the bottle-shaped gB trimer, which follows the rule of 3-fold symmetry (
