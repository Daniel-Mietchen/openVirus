<p>The 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding full-length wild type or mutant PRV gB and the 1H1 mAb was applied to stain the transfected cells. The binding was visualized and quantified by flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g005">Fig 5</xref>). As expected, a PRV gB mutant with all the four residues replaced by alanine (Mut4) completely abolished the binding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Interestingly, Q206A and D210A single mutations displayed no obvious effect on the binding, and mutant R215A only slightly reduced the binding affinity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g005">Fig 5B, 5C and 5E</xref>). The R214A single mutation, however, significantly impaired the reactivity of PRV gB to 1H1 Fab (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), with the same effect as the quadruple mutant (Mut4). To exclude the possibility that gB mutants failed to be displayed on cell surface due to misfolding, we also stained the cells transfected with gB mutants encoding plasmids by 5G12 mAb which targets the crown region of gB. As shown by the flow cytometry-based assays, all five mutants could be detected on the surface of transfected cells with similar expression levels as the wild type gB (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006777.s008">S7 Fig</xref>), which demonstrated that the inability of 1H1 mAb to bind gB mutants expressing cells solely results from the substitution of key interacting residues within the epitope. Collectively, these observations implied that the main epitope of 1H1 neutralizing antibody is probably located in the 210-helix region of PRV gB, among which the residue R214 plays a critical role in the interactions.
