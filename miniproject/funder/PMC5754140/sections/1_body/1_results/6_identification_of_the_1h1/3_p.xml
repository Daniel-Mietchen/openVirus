<p>Though only one glycan residue was observed in the density map of 1H1 Fab (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), there is probably a long glycan chain attached to N103 in the HCDR3 loop as the glycosylation modification in eukaryotic cells often involves multiple glycan residues. Therefore, the space between the 210-helix and 220-strand could possibly accommodate the glycan chain and the 220-strand is probably involved in the interactions with glycans (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). As glycans play a minor role in the interaction as shown by previous biochemical studies, the main binding footprint would thus fall into the 210-helix region. To further verify the location of 1H1 epitope, we performed mutagenesis on the four candidate residues in the 210-helix to test their effects on the interactions.
