<p>According to the structure, the epitope of 1H1 was unambiguously mapped to the bottom of domain I in PRV gB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>). The binding of 1H1 Fab to PRV gB is likely mediated by the HCDR3, LCD1 and LCDR3 loops, among which the HCDR3 probably interacts with the 220-strand region and the LCDR1 and LCDR3 mainly recognize the 210-helix (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). We then analyzed all the residues within 5 Ã… distance in the binding interface to identify the key residues governing the interactions. Among them, four residues in the 210-helix (Q206, D210, R214 and R215) and two in the 220-strand (K221 and E223) seemed to contribute the most interactions, which form a two-portion discrete footprint on the surface of PRV gB (
