<p>As the only complement-independent neutralizing antibody identified, the 1H1 mAb recognize PRV gB in regions different from all the other 14 mAbs. To further characterize the antigen recognition properties of this mAb, we solved the crystal structure of 1H1 Fab at a resolution of 2.5 Å (

Compared with the wild type 1H1 mAb, the affinities of both the NL and SL mutants decreased almost 1000 times and the binding kinetics also displayed significant differences. The intact 1H1 mAb binds PRV gB with a quite slow kinetics but seems not to dissociate, while the two mutants are much faster in both binding and dissociation processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g003">Fig 3C–3E</xref>). These observations demonstrated that the glycans in the HCDR3 loop play a key but not indispensible role for antigen recognition of 1H1 mAb.
