<p>We expressed the ectodomain of PRV gB with the Bac-to-Bac expression system. The purified soluble gB protein was then applied to immunize mice. A total of 43 gB-specific mAbs were originally selected by indirect ELISAs from hundreds of hybridoma cells. Virus entry inhibition assay was then conducted to assess the neutralizing activities of these mAbs. The tests were performed with addition of exogenous rabbit complement or without in parallel to identify the potential complement dependent neutralizing activities (See details in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref>). Fifteen neutralizing mAbs in total were identified, which effectively blocked PRV entry into pig kidney cells (PK-15) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006777.t001">Table 1</xref>). Among them, fourteen mAbs blocked the virus entry only in the presence of complement, indicating they exerted the neutralizing activity by complement effect. The remaining one, 1H1 mAb, however directly neutralized the virus without addition of complement (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006777.t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, 1H1 mAb might block PRV entry by interfering with either the receptor binding or membrane fusion processes.
