<p>In order to further characterize the immunogenic properties of PRV gB and identify the epitopes of these neutralizing antibodies, we determined the crystal structures of PRV gB and gB-D_IV at 3.1 and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The overall structures of PRV-gB and HSV gB are highly similar, with a sequence identity of 52% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006777.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). The two structures could be well superimposed with an overall rmsd of 0.962 Å (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Similar to other class III viral fusion proteins, PRV gB exists as homotrimers and each protomer could be divided into five domains. Each domain could be superimposed better with their counterpart in HSV gB than the entire gB molecule, as slight domain movement was observed for domain IV relative to the other portion of gB molecule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In the middle of each gB protomer, a potential furin cleavage site was identified and thus the protein would intend to be processed into two fragments during expression in the cell (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Consistent with this feature, the soluble gB displayed three-band SDS-PAGE profile though eluted as a monodispersed peak in size-exclusion chromatography (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006777.s004">S3B Fig</xref>). Similar cleavage processing was also observed in HSV gB [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while it is unclear whether the cleavage is required for the fusogenic activity of gB.
