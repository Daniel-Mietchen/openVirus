<p>As the only complement-independent neutralizing antibody, we further analyzed the neutralizing efficacies of 1H1 mAb against eight different PRV strains, including vaccine strains (Bartha and HB98), classical virulent strains (RA and SU), and the current emerging variant strains (HN1201, 188–5, 072–1, and BH1). Interestingly, the 1H1 mAb displayed a broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against all PRV strains tested though with varied efficacies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g001">Fig 1</xref>). It effectively neutralized HN1201, BH1, 188–5, RA, and Bartha strains, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 15.2 to 31.6 μg/mL. In comparison, it is less effective to block the entry of the SU, 072–1, and HB98 strains, for which the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values varied from 68.31 to 92.73 μg/mL. As 1H1 mAb targets PRV gB and the gBs of different PRV strains share more than 95% sequence identities (
