<p>Previous studies have indicated residue 540–734 of PRV gB as a hotspot to elicit complement-dependent neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As the gBs of HSV and PRV share a sequence identity of ~52% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006777.s003">S2 Fig</xref>), we assume that PRV gB would adopt a similar fold as that of HSV gB. In analogy to the structure of HSV gB, residue 540–734 is supposed to be at the upper portion of domain III central helix and the entire domain IV. Thus, we recombinantly expressed a truncated PRV gB protein, denoted as PRV gB-D_IV, which includes the domain IV and a portion of the adjacent domain III central helix (

With both the soluble PRV gB and PRV gB-D_IV, we tested the binding of all 15 neutralizing antibodies to these two soluble proteins to locate the binding sites. Based on the ELISA experiments, all the 14 complement-dependent neutralizing antibodies can bind to both gB and gB-D_IV (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006777.s005">S4 Fig</xref>), indicating the epitopes of these antibodies are very probably within the domain IV of gB. With these observations and previous reports [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006777.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], this region is therefore a suitable immunogen to elicit complement-dependent neutralizing antibodies against PRV infection. In contrast, the 1H1 mAb only reacted with gB but not gB-D_IV (
