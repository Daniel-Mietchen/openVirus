 <p>Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an emerging veterinary pathogen that infects many domestic animals. Since 2011, highly pathogenic PRV variants have emerged in many farms in China and posed great economic burdens to the animal industry. However, the current marketed vaccines cannot provide effective protection against these emerging strains. The envelope glycoprotein B (gB) is a major viral antigen known to play a crucial role in PRV entry. In order to control PRV epidemics and treat associated diseases, we combined structural and immunological approaches to generate potential neutralizing antibodies targeting PRV gB and investigate their working mechanisms. A total of 15 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were identified with good neutralizing activity. Among them, fourteen mAbs target the domain IV of PRV gB and block virus entry though complement effect. In contrast, the remaining 1H1 mAb recognizes domain I of PRV gB, which can neutralize virus entry independent of complement and probably by interfering with the membrane fusion process. Our work reveals the structural details and immunogenic properties of PRV gB and may offer important guidance for developing antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against PRV infections.</p>
