  <title>Amino acid sequence alignment of gBs from different PRV strains.</title>
  <p>The gB sequences of all the PRV strains analyzed in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006777.g001">Fig 1</xref> are aligned, which shows more than 95% sequence identity. The potential key residues in the 1H1 epitope are highly conserved among all PRV strains as indicated by blue pentagrams.
