  <title>Neutralizing efficacies of 1H1 mAb against different PRV strains.</title>
  <p>Purified 1H1 mAb was used for virus neutralizing assay to test its efficacy against 8 different PRV strains, including vaccine strains (Bartha and HB98), classical virulent strains (RA and SU), and the current emerging variant strains (HN1201, 188–5, 072–1, and BH1). The neutralizing profile of each strain is represented by different symbols as indicated in the legend. Each experiment was conducted with 3 replicates. The error bars representing standard deviations from the mean are shown correspondingly.</p>
