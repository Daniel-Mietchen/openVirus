  <title>Size-exclusion chromatograms and SDS-PAGE profiles of PRV gB and gB-D_IV soluble proteins.</title>
  <p>(A) A standard elution profile for molecular weight calibration. The five standard samples used in this analysis are given at the right side with the molecular weights labeled accordingly. Both gB (B) and gB-D_IV (C) exist as trimers in solution estimated by the elution volumes. The SDS-PAGE profile of gB shows three bands, corresponding to the full-length gB (gBa) and furin cleaved products (gBb and gBc), respectively. The gB-D_IV shows a single band in the SDS-PAGE profile, indicating high stability of this truncated protein.</p>
