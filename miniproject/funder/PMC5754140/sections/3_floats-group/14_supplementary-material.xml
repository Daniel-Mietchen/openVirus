  <title>Flow cytometry analysis to detect the surface display of PRV gB mutants in transfected cells.</title>
  <p>The 293T cells were transfected with either WT gB or mutant expression vectors. The transfected cells were first stained by 5G12 mAb and then the APC-linked secondary antibody was applied for detection by flow cytometry. Cells transfected with pEGFP-N1 empty vectors (negative control) are represented by solid black areas, and those transfected with WT gB (A) or mutants (B-F) expression plasmids are shown as red silhouettes in each panel.</p>
