  <title>The electron density of glycan residue in the HCDR3 loop of 1H1 Fab.</title>
  <p>The 1H1 Fab is shown as cartoon and colored by chains (heavy chain: magenta; light chain: cyan). The side chain of N103 (HCDR3) and attached glycan residue are shown as sticks and colored by elements. The electron density (2Fo-Fc map, at 1.0 Ïƒ contour level) of the glycan residue is shown as black meshes.</p>
