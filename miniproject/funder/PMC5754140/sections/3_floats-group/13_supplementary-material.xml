  <title>Negative stain EM analysis and 3D reconstruction of PRV gB in complex with 1H1 Fab.</title>
  <p>(A) A representative negative stain micrograph of gB-1H1_Fab complex. (B) Typical 2D class average images of the complex, top and side views. The density corresponding to Fab molecules are indicated by red arrows. (C) Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curve of the final reconstruction. The gold-standard 0.5 cut-off value is indicated by blue dashed lines, which corresponds to a resolution of 35 Ã…. (D) Euler angle distribution of the final reconstruction shown at both top and side views. The 3-fold axis of the complex is indicated by a black triangle.</p>
