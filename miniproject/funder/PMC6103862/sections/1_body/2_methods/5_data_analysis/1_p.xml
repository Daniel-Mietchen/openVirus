<p id="Par28">All interviews were transcribed and carefully reviewed for accuracy. We analysed all interviews using the thematic framework approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The thematic framework approach to qualitative data analysis is a five-step process that involves: (1) 
 <italic>familiarization</italic> with transcripts, (2) 
 <italic>developing a theoretical framework</italic> based on interview guidelines, and recurrent and important themes in individual transcripts, (3) 
 <italic>coding</italic> the transcripts using the framework, (4) 
 <italic>summarizing data in an analytical framework</italic> to create brief summaries of participant responses, and (5) 
 <italic>data synthesis, and interpretation</italic> to compare themes and sub-themes across interviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Analyses of the interviews yielded three themes and seven sub-themes for each phase of the mission. These were divided into the following categories: risk factors (socio-psychological factors, behavioural factors and biological factors); protection measures (health measures, social measures and global health diplomacy actions); and challenges. We present the results according to the three phases of the mission.
