<p id="Par20">Ebola virus disease (EVD) threatened global health security when an outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By June 2016, a total of 28 616 confirmed, probable and suspected EVD cases had been reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, resulting in 11 310 deaths by 10 June 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. EVD spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This transmission mode, and HCWs’ frequent contact with infected patients place HCWs at a high risk of infection. Incidence of EVD among HCWs was 103-times higher than that of the general population between May 23 and Oct 31, 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. By May 20, 2015, 869 HCWs were infected, and 507 HCWs had died in West Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. HCWs have the highest levels of crude mortality rates, and the mortality rate of HCWs in Sierra Leone was as high as 80% (as of 26 October 2014) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. HCWs EVD infection was not limited to West Africa, but spread with the disease to the United States and Spain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. High rates of HCWs’ EVD infection were reported in Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in West Africa. By August 14, 2014, approximately 36% of the infected HCWs worked in ETCs in Liberia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Preventing EVD and other infections among HCWs is crucial to improving future public health responses around the world [
