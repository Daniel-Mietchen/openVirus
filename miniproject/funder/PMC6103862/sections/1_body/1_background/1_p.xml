<p id="Par19">Health care workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the battle against infectious diseases, placing them at a greater risk of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For example, a reported 419 HCWs have contracted Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) within health care facilities, of whom 97 (23.15%) have died [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The first reported nosocomial Crimeane Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) outbreak in Pakistan in 1976 resulted in 10 infected HCWs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. During the outbreak of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Uganda between August 2000 and January 2001, 14 of the 22 (64%) HCWs in Gulu were infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Three HCWs were infected during the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Republic of the Congo in 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In another outbreak in Uganda during 2007â€“2008, 14 of the 192 infected people were HCWs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These high rates of infection suggest that HCWs lack sufficient knowledge about clinical presentation and infection control measures of VHFs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and also lack appropriate protective equipment.
