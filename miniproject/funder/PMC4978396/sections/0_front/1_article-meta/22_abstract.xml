 <p>In May 2015, local transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) was reported in Brazil and since then, more than 1.5 million human cases have been reported in Latin America and the Caribbean. This arbovirus, primarily found in Africa and Asia, is mainly transmitted by 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Viremic travelers returning from America to European countries where 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> is established could become the source for local transmission of ZIKV. In order to estimate the risk of seeding ZIKV into local mosquito populations, the susceptibility of European 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> to ZIKV was measured using experimental infections. We demonstrated that 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> from Europe were not very susceptible to ZIKV. The threat for a Zika outbreak in Europe should be limited.
