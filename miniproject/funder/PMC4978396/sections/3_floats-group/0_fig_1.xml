   <bold>/mL.</bold> 16â€“24 mosquitoes were sampled each day. Infection rates were measured as the percentage of mosquitoes with infected bodies among the total number of analyzed mosquitoes. Disseminated infection rates were estimated as the percentage of mosquitoes with infected heads (i.e., the virus has successfully crossed the midgut barrier to reach the hemocoel) among the total number of mosquitoes with infected bodies. The transmission efficiency was calculated as the overall proportion of females with infectious saliva among the total number of tested mosquitoes. AE =
