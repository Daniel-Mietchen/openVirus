 <italic>albopictus</italic>: Nice (43°42’N, 7°15’E) and Bar-sur-Loup (43°42’N, 6°59’E) in France) were collected using ovitraps. Eggs were immersed in dechlorinated tap water for hatching. Larvae were distributed in pans of 150–200 individuals and supplied with 1 yeast tablet dissolved in 1L of water every 48 hours. All immature stages were maintained at 28°C ± 1°C. After emergence, adults were given free access to a 10% sucrose solution and maintained at 28°C ± 1°C with 70% relative humidity and a 16:8 light/dark cycle. The F1 generation of
