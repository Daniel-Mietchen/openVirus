<p>For head/body homogenates and saliva samples, Vero E6 cell monolayers were inoculated with serial 10-fold dilutions of virus-containing samples and incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C followed by an overlay consisting of DMEM 2X, 2% FBS, antibiotics and 1% agarose. At 7 dpi, overlay was removed and cells were fixed with crystal violet (0.2% Crystal Violet, 10% Formaldehyde, 20% ethanol) and positive/negative screening was performed for cytopathic effect (body and head homogenates) or plaques were enumerated (head and saliva samples). Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Eurobio), Penicillin and Streptomycin, and 0.29 mg/mL l-glutamine.</p>
