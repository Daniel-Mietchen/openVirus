<p>Infectious blood-meals were provided using a titer of 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50/</sub>mL. Seven-day old mosquitoes were fed on blood-meals containing two parts washed rabbit erythrocytes to one part viral suspension supplemented with ATP at a final concentration of 5 mM. Rabbit arterial blood was collected and erythrocytes were washed five times with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 24 h before the infectious blood-meal. Engorged females were transferred to cardboard containers with free access to 10% sucrose solution and maintained at 28°C and 70% relative humidity with a 16:8 light/dark cycle. 16–24 female mosquitoes from each population were analyzed at 3, 6, 9, and 14 days post-infection (dpi) to estimate the infection rate, disseminated infection rate and transmission efficiency. Briefly, legs and wings were removed from each mosquito followed by insertion of the proboscis into a 20 μL tip containing 5 μL FBS for 20 minutes. The saliva-containing FBS was expelled into 45 μμL serum free L-15 media (Gibco), and stored at -80°C. Following salivation, mosquitoes were decapitated and head and body (thorax and abdomen) were homogenized separately in 300 μL L-15 media supplemented with 3% FBS using a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin Technologies) then stored at -80°C. Infection rate was measured as the percentage of mosquitoes with infected bodies among the total number of analyzed mosquitoes. Disseminated infection rate was estimated as the percentage of mosquitoes with infected heads (i.e., the virus had successfully crossed the midgut barrier to reach the mosquito hemocoel) among the total number of mosquitoes with infected bodies. Transmission efficiency was calculated as the overall proportion of females with infectious saliva among the total number of tested mosquitoes. Samples were titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells.
