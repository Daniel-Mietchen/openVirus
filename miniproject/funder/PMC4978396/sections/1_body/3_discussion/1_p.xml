<p>ZIKV could be transmitted, spread and maintained in Europe either via (i) Madeira where the main vector

 <italic>aegypti</italic> has been established since 2005 or (ii) Continental Europe where

 <italic>albopictus</italic> is known to have been present since 1979 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We demonstrated that ZIKV was amplified and expectorated efficiently in saliva by European 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Madeira. This contrasts with the lower vector competence for ZIKV of French 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. Taking these observations and the overall average lower temperatures of most regions of Europe into account, the risk of major outbreaks of Zika fever in most areas of Europe, at least for the immediate future, appears to be relatively low.
