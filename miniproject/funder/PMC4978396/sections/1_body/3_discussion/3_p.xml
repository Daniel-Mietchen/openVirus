<p>Autochthonous cases of CHIKV and DENV have been reported in Europe since 2007: CHIKV in Italy in 2007, South France in 2010, 2014, and DENV in South France in 2010, 2013, 2015, and Croatia in 2010 [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> first detected in Europe in 1979 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] has played a central role in this transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, there might be a risk of a similar establishment of ZIKV in Europe upon the return of viremic travelers [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> from South France were less competent for ZIKV infection requiring 14 days to be expectorated in the mosquito saliva after infection. Therefore, we can suggest that the Asian tiger mosquito from Southern France and more widely, Europe, are less suitable to sustain local transmission of ZIKV compared to CHIKV and perhaps, DENV.
