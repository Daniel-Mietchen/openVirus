<p>To test whether 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from a European territory were able to transmit ZIKV, we analyzed the vector competence of two 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations collected on the island of Madeira based on three parameters: viral infection of the mosquito midgut, viral dissemination to secondary organs, and transmission potential, analyzed at 3, 6, 9, and 14 dpi. Only mosquitoes presenting an infection (i.e. infected midgut) were analyzed for viral dissemination. The two populations presented similar infection (

 <italic>aegypti</italic> Funchal were able to transmit ZIKV at 9 (1 individual among 20 tested) and 14 dpi (1 among 20) (
