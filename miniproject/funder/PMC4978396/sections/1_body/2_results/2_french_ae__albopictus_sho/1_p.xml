<p>To determine if 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> present in continental Europe were able to sustain local transmission of ZIKV as previously observed with CHIKV and DENV, we evaluated the vector competence of two 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations collected in Nice and Bar-sur-Loup in the South of France. When compared with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the two 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations showed similar infection rates at 3 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.08) and 6 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.11) and disseminated infection rates at 9 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.62) and 14 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.10) (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> Bar-sur-Loup tested at 14 dpi was able to transmit ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004901.g001">Fig 1</xref>). When analyzing the number of viral particles in heads, only few mosquitoes were infected (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> Bar-sur-Loup exhibited 2 viral particles at 14 dpi (
