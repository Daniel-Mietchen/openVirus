<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) (genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) is an emerging arthropod-borne virus transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. ZIKV infection in humans was first observed in Africa in 1952 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and can cause a broad range of clinical symptoms presenting as a “dengue-like” syndrome: headache, rash, fever, and arthralgia. In 2007, an outbreak of ZIKV on Yap Island resulted in 73% of the total population becoming infected [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Following this, ZIKV continued to spread rapidly with outbreaks in French Polynesia in October 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], New Caledonia in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and subsequently, Brazil in May 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. During this expansion period, the primary transmission vector is considered to have been 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, although 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> could potentially serve as a secondary transmission vector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] as ZIKV detection has been reported in field-collected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in Central Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As Musso et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] observed, the pattern of ZIKV emergence from Africa, throughout Asia, to its subsequent arrival in South America and the Caribbean closely resembles the emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). In Europe, returning ZIKV-viremic travelers may become a source of local transmission in the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in Continental Europe and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in the Portuguese island of Madeira. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> originated from Asia was recorded for the first time in Europe in Albania in 1979 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], then in Italy in 1990 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is now present in all European countries around the Mediterranean Sea [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This mosquito was implicated as a vector of CHIKV and DENV in Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> disappeared after the 1950s with the improvement of hygiene and anti-malaria vector control. This mosquito reinvaded European territory, Madeira island, in 2005 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and around the Black Sea in southern Russia, Abkhazia, and Georgia in 2004 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The species was responsible for outbreaks of yellow fever in Italy in 1804 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and dengue in Greece in 1927–1928 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004901.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To assess the possible risk of ZIKV transmission in Europe, we compared the relative vector competence of European 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations to the Asian genotype of ZIKV.
