<p id="Par35">The individual contribution of each covariate on the probability of dengue propagation is shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S4. Several models were evaluated (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S4); Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the best and most relevant models. The chosen final model, denominated M2, had the following variables: number of imported dengue cases, number of tweets, but also their interaction; DENV in mosquitoes and maximum temperature, all of them with time lag of 4 weeks in relation to the outcome variable (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). According to Model M2, an increase in one unit in the number of imported dengue cases, number of tweets, number of DENV positive samples in mosquitoes and maximum temperature corresponded to an increased chance of 5.93, 1.06, 1.92 and 1.76 in the propagation of dengue cases transmission, respectively. The probability of dengue propagation, according to Model M2 is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b. As previously demonstrated, we validated the model using out-of-sample data (from 2017 onwards) with good estimation results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).
