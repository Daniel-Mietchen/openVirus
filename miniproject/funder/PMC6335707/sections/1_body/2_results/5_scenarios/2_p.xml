<p id="Par37">We also assessed the effect of imported cases and viral detection in mosquitoes on the probability of dengue propagation, according to Model M2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Tweets and maximum temperature were fixed. Again, detecting imported dengue cases was strongly associated with an increased probability of dengue propagation, which was further increased by detecting viruses in mosquitoes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the stars indicate the estimated probabilities observed in 2012 to 2017, according to Model M2. The predictions were in accordance with the observations: 2016 was the year with highest dengue activity, and probability of local transmission and propagation (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a).
