<p id="Par36">To better visualize the effect of each covariate in the probability of local transmission and propagation of dengue, we applied the models in three specific moments of the epidemic curve: the beginning phase in January, the peak in March and the no transmission period in July (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The probability of transmission initiation (Model M1) in these scenarios is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. Tweets were fixed in their mean values. The results show that detecting imported dengue cases causes an important increase in the probability of local transmission, and the presence of more mosquitoes can further increase this probability.
