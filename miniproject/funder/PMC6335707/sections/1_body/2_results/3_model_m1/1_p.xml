<p id="Par34">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the covariates associated with the outcome of at least one case of dengue occurring in a week (M1). The preliminary models, with the individual contribution of each covariate, at different time lags, are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S3 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S3. The combination of multiple covariates into the multiple regression model strongly improved the goodness-of-fit of the probability models, based on the reduced AIC and residual deviance indices. Several models were evaluated (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S3) and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows those considered the best and most relevant. Among them, the best model, denominated M1, contained the following variables: number of imported dengue cases, number of tweets and IMFA, all of which with a time lag of 3 weeks in relation to the outcome variable (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). According to model M1, an increase in one unit in imported dengue cases, tweets and IMFA corresponded to an increased chance of 1.64, 1.02, and 7.61 for local dengue cases to occur, respectively. The resulting probability of local transmission of dengue introduction is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b. This figure also shows the probability of local dengue transmission using the out-of-sample validation data (from 2017 onwards) and demonstrates the good estimation capacity of the model, despite the very few cases detected during this period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).
