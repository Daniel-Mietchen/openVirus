<p id="Par38">We evaluated the accuracy of the M1 and M2 models for classifying weeks with high risk of dengue initiation and dengue propagation, using the ROC curve. For the local initiation of transmission model (M1), the probability cut-off points of 0.2 and 0.6 were selected, while 0.2 and 0.5 were selected for the propagation of transmission model (M2) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Models M1 and M2 had high accuracy and specificity (true negative rate), but moderate sensitivity (true positive rate). Probabilities resulting from our models were then aggregated in three different levels of risk: low, moderate and high-risk levels (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The majority of the confirmed local cases of dengue occurred during the periods where the probability was considered high-risk for both transmission initiation (M1, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a) and propagation (M2, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b) models. We observed that both risk decision models reflected the seasonal pattern of the disease during the five epidemic periods of our analyses.
