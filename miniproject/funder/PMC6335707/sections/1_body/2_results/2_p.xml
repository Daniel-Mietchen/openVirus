<p id="Par33">The majority of imported cases came from inside the country, especially from east and southern states. Rio de Janeiro was the most visited city (24.4%). Only 10 cases (4.6%) were registered as from abroad; their origins were: Mexico (4), Paraguay (3), Colombia (1), Bolivia (1), Indonesia (1) and Costa Rica (1) (Additional file

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). From the 3932 suspect cases, 697 (17.7%) were confirmed. The confirmed cases had a mean age of 37 years (range 1–89 years) and equally distributed between sexes (49.8% male). The highest number of imported cases per week was 19, while mean and maximum values of locally transmitted cases per week were 2 and 38 cases, respectively. Reports of imported dengue cases preceded local transmission of the disease (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Tweets with dengue content ranged from 0 to 186 per week (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), with a positive correlation to dengue data. Temperatures followed a seasonal pattern with the minimum value of 4.93 °C (weekly mean) in July, and a maximum value of 38.05 °C (weekly mean) in February (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Humidity and precipitation were evenly distributed throughout all years. Larval indices varied from 0.35 (HI) and 0.42 (BI) in the winter, to 5.76 (HI) and 8.17 (BI) in the summer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Indices above 3.9 are considered indicative of high risk for dengue transmission, according to the Brazilian health authorities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], varied between 0–1.76 in this study. Dengue virus presence in mosquitoes was detected only in 20 weeks (8.5%), with up to 6 positive traps in a single week (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). During this period, DENV subtypes 1, 3 and 4 were detected in mosquitoes (data not shown).
