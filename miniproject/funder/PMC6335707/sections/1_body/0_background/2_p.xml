<p id="Par16">According to official records, dengue was introduced to Brazil in the 1980s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Since then, it has been characterized by geographical spread and an increase in the incidence of reported cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As an exception, the subtropical southern region of Brazil has not yet established stable local transmission of the disease, despite the presence of the vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Porto Alegre, the largest city of the southernmost state, the first record of an imported dengue case occurred in 2002 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but local transmission was confirmed only in 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Even though the number of dengue cases in the southern region of Brazil has increased in recent years, it is much lower than other regions of the country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], mostly because of the local temperate climate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There are cold winters, with the temperature ranging from -3 ºC to 18 °C, which are less suitable for mosquito reproduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Several countries or regions in the northern hemisphere (including Florida in the USA, southern Italy, France and Spain) have similar weather patterns and risk factors for dengue introduction, including the proximity to endemic regions, presence of competent vectors, nonimmune population, and lack of citizen engagement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The city of Porto Alegre has experienced several episodes of dengue introduction in the last few years and has developed an integrated surveillance and prevention protocol that includes entomological, virological and active epidemiological components.
