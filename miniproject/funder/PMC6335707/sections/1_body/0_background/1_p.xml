<p id="Par15">Dengue is one of the world’s most important neglected tropical diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; its incidence and the risk of epidemics have increased &gt; 30-fold in recent decades, alongside the geographical expansion of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the major vector for dengue virus (DENV) transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is estimated that there are approximately 390 million dengue infections each year, of which 96 million are thought to manifest clinically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Dengue transmission is observed in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Americas, Southeast Asia, Western Pacific and Africa. There are frequent cases in non-endemic areas, including the USA and Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In these areas, dengue is responsible for an increasing number of travel-related acute febrile illnesses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Travel-related illnesses are reported in 20–70% of subjects returning from tropical to temperate countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; more severe and potentially fatal forms of dengue infection have been reported in up to 16% of those cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The currently available vaccine is only partially effective and not recommended for dengue-naive individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, there is an increasing incidence and geographical expansion of dengue transmission, increasing the socioeconomic burden, whilst current control strategies are ineffective [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. New risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into future risk under scenarios of socioeconomic and environmental change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The surveillance of vulnerability and receptivity risk factors together with dengue notification data can provide more accurate data to inform the prioritization of research, health policies and financial resources towards dengue control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Efforts to improve dengue surveillance in non-endemic areas are especially important during mass gatherings (sports, cultural and religious events) due to the growth of the global population and the global mobility of people infected with diseases [
