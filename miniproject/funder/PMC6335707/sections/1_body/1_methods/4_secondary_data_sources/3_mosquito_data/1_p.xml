<p id="Par23">The routine larval surveys carried out in the city provided two entomological indices: house index (number of positive containers/total number of houses inspected) and Breteau index (number of larvae positive containers/total number of containers found) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Another source of mosquito data is based on the collection of adult 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito by the MI-Aedes system, using the sticky trap MosquiTRAP (Ecovec LTDA, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The surveillance system had 935 sticky traps distributed in 29 of the 80 neighborhoods (44% of the study area), at a separation of 250 m, as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The traps were inspected weekly. Data for this study encompasses 234 weeks, from September 2012 to March 2017. The entomological index provided by the system was the Index of mean number of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (IMFA, total number of female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> captured divided by the number of inspected traps).
