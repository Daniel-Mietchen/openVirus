<p id="Par20">To identify which dengue viruses were circulating in the mosquito population, we evaluated virus presence in adult (male and female) 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes captured by the adult trap, MosquiTRAP part of the entomological surveillance program of the city, described below [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Mosquitoes from traps were collected weekly and stored in tubes containing nucleic acid conservation solution, guanidine thiocyanate (250 μl, 1.5%). Each tube contained mosquitoes from the same trap (mean = 2 mosquitoes). For the analysis, mosquitoes were macerated using zirconium microspheres for 20 s in a FastPrep-24 (MPBiomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, USA), then centrifuged at 10,000× 
 <italic>rpm</italic> (5 min). To extract the viral RNA, the supernatant (20 μl) of samples was pooled into groups of 20 mosquitoes. RNA extracts were obtained using the BioGene Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (Bioclin, Belo Horizonte, Brazil). One-step RT-PCR was optimized and carried out using an iTaq Universal Probes One-Step Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) in a QuantStudio 5 (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, USA) system. The one-step RT-PCR consisted of a 20 min reverse transcription step at 50 °C and then 2 min of Taq-polymerase activation at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of PCR at 95 °C for 15 s and 55 °C for 1 min. The primers and probe sequences used in these analyses have been described previously [
