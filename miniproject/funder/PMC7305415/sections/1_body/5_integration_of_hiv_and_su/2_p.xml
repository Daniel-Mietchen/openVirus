<p>As with all models of complex systems, the models of Cepeda et al and Bórquez 
 <italic>et al</italic>. require numerous input values to parameterize their many moving parts and make quantitative predictions under a range of hypothetical scenarios. Many of these inputs – such as the reduction in sexual HIV transmission afforded by adherent ART use – are relatively well‐established after decades of concentrated study. Others, such as the effectiveness against HIV acquisition of interventions reducing stimulant use, are less certain. Fundamentally, the inclusion of comorbid conditions and corresponding intervention types within HIV transmission modelling frameworks represents a relatively new frontier, requiring structural considerations, modelling assumptions and input values for which the requisite empirical evidence is still nascent.
