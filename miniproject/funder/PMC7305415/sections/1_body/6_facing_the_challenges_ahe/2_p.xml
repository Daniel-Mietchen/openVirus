<p>In constructing such policy‐relevant models, it is important to evaluate specific policies with attention to the underlying epidemiological context and existing health system, rather than expecting that conclusions or principles relevant to one setting will necessarily be generalizable to others. It follows that integrating HIV and other services may not be the best use of resources in some cases. While there is strong global momentum towards integrating health systems and providing UHC, there are likely many cases where integrating care may marginalize at‐risk populations, produce regressive outcomes in terms of equitable sharing of health resources, or result in inefficient use of scarce healthcare resources that could be put to better use in other ways. Using models to investigate these unintended effects can help us more transparently and systematically consider the broader consequences – both positive and negative – of specific integration policies in specific settings.</p>
