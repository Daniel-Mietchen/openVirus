<p>In conclusion, this Supplement helps to define a path towards more evidence‐based decision making in the context of integrating services for HIV and other conditions. It is currently hypothesized by many that such integration will lead to better health outcomes for patients and populations and more efficient use of resources. Coupled with collection of empirical data on the costs and effectiveness of specific interventions, models can help us to understand the contexts in which that hypothesis might be supported and those in which integration of HIV and other health services may not be such a priority. Better data and better models can help to define specific policy options and provide evidence as to which of those options should be advanced, and which should be reconsidered. Models are an important component of an evidence‐based decision‐making process for integrated HIV services, but current models also illustrate the urgent need to strengthen the research enterprise responsible for producing the data on which such models rely. In order to end the AIDS epidemic in the next decade while also achieving UHC, we must prioritize the collection of better data on integrated HIV services and the improvement of models themselves – and we must do so well before 2030 approaches.</p>
