<p>The papers in this Supplement illustrate the potential value of modelling to inform policy relating to the integration of services for HIV and other conditions. But they also underscore the tremendous amount of work that still needs to be done in this area. Currently, very few data exist as to the effectiveness and costs of specific, scalable programmes that could effectively integrate HIV services and other health systems. Examples of data that could advance this field include: (a) implementation studies with embedded costing analyses of feasible integration programmes, from screening for diabetes and hypertension among PLHIV in care to integrated management of HIV and substance use for people who drink hazardously or use drugs; (b) pragmatic trials [

Collection of such data in a range of epidemiological and economic settings could bolster the ability of models to project long‐term impact and assess the cost‐effectiveness of such interventions, thereby informing more effective policy and motivating the next generation of data‐driven modelling.
