<p>These articles help illustrate that the concept of “integrated HIV services” itself is not – and need not be – uniform across all situations. For example in settings with generalized HIV epidemics, non‐communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, are exacting an increasing toll of morbidity and mortality as populations living with HIV age. As such, implementing routine (or even expanded) diagnostic testing and screening for some of these conditions among PLHIV could be an important step forward in certain settings [

In contrast, in settings where HIV is concentrated among people who inject drugs (PWID) and thus overlaps strongly with hepatitis C and risk of drug overdose, integration of HIV services with substance use services and hepatitis C treatment programmes might be the overriding priority [

In some settings, services for certain other conditions may be well established, such that integrated care might consist primarily of forming linkages between these services and those for HIV, enabling PLHIV to “link out” and thus access more comprehensive care. In other settings, however, services for other conditions may be more rudimentary, and an important dimension of integration could be in the utilization of HIV facilities to strengthen care for PLHIV while also providing some amount of care for HIV‐negative persons. Regardless of how “integrated HIV services” are conceptualized, integration has the potential to effect synergistic benefits by achieving economies of scope, using the same infrastructure to provide multiple services. Because of this potential benefit, integration of HIV and other services merits careful evaluation.
