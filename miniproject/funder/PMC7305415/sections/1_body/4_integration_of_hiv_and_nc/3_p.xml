<p>While integrated HIV/NCD programmes may be cost‐effective in some settings, the costs of treatment for PLHIV on ART may be high due to contraindications between common medications for NCDs and ART. A third analysis, by Boettiger 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>], presents such a counterexample. These authors use data from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database to inform a 20‐year simulation of adults receiving ART in Thailand. In this simulated cohort, they estimate that the cost of providing statin therapy to reduce the risk of CVD events would be high compared to its effect. As a result, very large reductions in the cost of those statins would be needed for such an approach to be considered cost‐effective under thresholds that are currently thought to be realistic.
