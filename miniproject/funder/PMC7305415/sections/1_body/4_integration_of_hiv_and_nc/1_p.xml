These authors demonstrate how models can provide support throughout the policy‐making process – from estimating disease burden to elucidating policy options to forecasting comparative epidemiological impact, cost‐effectiveness and budget impact of different potential decisions. Similarly, Kintu and colleagues [
 <xref rid="jia2sup25525-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>] discuss opportunities, challenges and trade‐offs of integrating NCD and HIV services in sub‐Saharan Africa from a policy perspective – including potential increases in efficiency from leveraging HIV platforms to address NCD management, reductions in quality due to overburdened healthcare staff, potential inequalities given the large burden of NCDs in the general population and the need for additional funding to support integration of services. While highlighting potential pitfalls, both papers hypothesize that the benefits of integration may often outweigh the risks in high‐burden settings – and they provide a roadmap for how quantitative models and innovative policy making can support the process of examining these trade‐offs.
