<p id="Par48">The RF model with meteorological factors demonstrated a satisfactory prediction accuracy and can be used to predict the epidemic level, demonstrating its potential and practical applicability. The autocorrelation and seasonal variation of the dependent variables are crucial for the prediction model. In addition, the synchronous effects of meteorological factors and their cumulative effects over a period of time were combined to improve the model. Future studies should be conducted to explore an RF model with meteorological and other variables for the development of a useful tool for predicting other major infectious diseases.</p>
