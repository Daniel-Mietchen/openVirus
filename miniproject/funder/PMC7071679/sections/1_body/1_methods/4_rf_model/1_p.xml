<p id="Par28">RF model is an ensemble machine learning method proposed by Breiman [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It creates multiple CARTs, wherein each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample of the original training data using a randomly selected subset of input variables, and taking the average outputs of the CARTs as the final prediction. One of its most important features is the calculation of the variable importance, which measures the association between a given variable and the accuracy of the prediction, based on the percentage of increase in the mean square-error (%IncMSE).
