<p id="Par21">ARIMA model, namely the Box−Jenkins model, has been widely used for time series analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The seasonal ARIMA, that incorporates seasonal variation based on ARIMA model, performs better in the presence of clear seasonal patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is denoted as ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)
 <sub>s</sub>, where p, d and q indicate the orders of general auto-regression (AR), differencing and moving average (MA) terms; P, D and Q are the orders of seasonal AR, differencing and MA terms, respectively; and s is the seasonal periodicity (s = 52 weeks in this study) [
