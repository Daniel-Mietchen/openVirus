 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> compared the RF and ARIMA/X models, the predictive outputs of which were reported in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The RF model with meteorological factors outperformed the ARIMA/X models in both model fitting and prospective stages in terms of RMSE and MAPE. The values predicted by the RF model matched the actual values very well, with a MAPE of approximately 20%. The performance of the ARIMAX model was comparable to that of the ARIMA model with a high MAPE of approximately 30%.
