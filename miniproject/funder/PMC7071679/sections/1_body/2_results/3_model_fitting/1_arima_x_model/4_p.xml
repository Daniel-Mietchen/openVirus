<p id="Par41">An RF model was constructed using atmospheric pressure, precipitation and their lagged terms, relative humidity, 1–4 week lag morbidity and time variable as predictors. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> indicated that the lag dependent terms were the most imperative among all the applied predictors. The atmospheric pressure and its lagged terms were the most vital meteorological factors, followed by a lag in precipitation.
