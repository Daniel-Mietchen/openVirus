<p id="Par47">This study had a few limitations. First, some mild cases may use home therapies, and cases with atypical symptoms may be misdiagnosed, therefore, the reported data may underestimate the level of morbidity. Second, only meteorological factors were considered to improve the prediction ability. Other factors associated with infectious diarrhea may also be used as good predictors and should be studied further. Third, similar to other machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks, the RF model cannot explain the specific non-linear relationship between meteorological factors and the disease.</p>
