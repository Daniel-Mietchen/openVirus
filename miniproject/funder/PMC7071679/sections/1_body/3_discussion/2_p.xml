<p id="Par44">The RF model is more suitable than the ARIMA/X method for predicting an infectious diarrhea epidemic within the study region. The performance of the ARIMAX model was comparable to that of the ARIMA model, which suggested that the introduction of meteorological factors did not significantly optimize the prediction accuracy of the ARIMA model. This finding was consistent with the findings of other previous studies [

Compared with the ARIMA/X models, the prediction error of the RF model decreased by approximately 50 and 30% in the training and testing sets, respectively. This is because the RF model can better fit non-linear relationships. Moreover, compared with the ARIMAX model, the RF model is not influenced by the multicollinearity, mainly because of the random selection of variables for each tree in the RF [

All of them exhibited a certain degree of importance, which suggested that the RF model comprehensively combined the climatic variables and their lagged effects. In particular, the models partly underestimated the incidence of infectious diarrhea in 2017. This is primarily due to the sharp increase in morbidity in 2017, which indicated that the potential influencing factors might have changed over a 52-week period, such as increase in the number of outbreaks, or changes in the pathogen spectrum [
