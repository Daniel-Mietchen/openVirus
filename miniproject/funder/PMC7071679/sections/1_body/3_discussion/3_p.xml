<p id="Par45">Atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and relative humidity were all correlated with the incidence of infectious diarrhea in Jiangsu Province with 0–2 week, 0 week and 0–3 week lag, respectively. However, Tao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] reported that the atmospheric pressure and relative humidity were related to the 0–1 week lag diarrhea morbidity in Lanzhou city (northwest China). The relative humidity was related to 4-week lag in the incidence of diarrhea in Beijing city (north China) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This difference may be due to the regional differences in pathogen composition and climatic conditions. Furthermore, the meteorological factors significantly contributed to the forecasting ability of the RF model, with atmospheric pressure as the main contributor. Potential mechanisms can include the influencing pathogen survival and air barrier. A high atmospheric pressure may be conducive to the survival of infectious diarrhea causing microorganisms, such as the rotavirus, in the environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A high atmospheric pressure can hinder the airflow and serve as a barrier to the spreading of airborne pathogens thereby increasing their concentration at a smaller scale, which may lead to more diarrhea infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The precipitation had a moderate importance in the RF model, particularly the 3-week lag effect. This implied that the precipitation during the previous 3 weeks may influence the morbidity and can thus be used in its prediction. The relative humidity was identified as the least important factor. The relative humidity in Jiangsu Province exhibited a narrow variation at the weekly level, and did not fit well with the morbidity. These findings may help future studies in analyzing the specific relationship between the climate and infectious diarrhea.
