<p id="Par43">The incidence of infectious diarrhea in Jiangsu Province exhibited a long-term gradual growth trend. Mathematical prediction models are urgently required to reinforce integrated management to monitor, control and prevent infectious diarrhea. We constructed an RF model with meteorological factors, which delivered a good accuracy in predicting the incidence of infectious diarrhea with a MAPE of approximately 20%. It can relatively estimate the seasonal fluctuation of this disease well. The model may be used as an important tool by public health authorities.</p>
