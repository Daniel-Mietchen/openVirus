<p id="Par46">Notably, the prediction performance is likely to vary in different climatic regions. The generalizability of the RF model for the incidence of infectious diarrhea in Jiangsu Province to other regions might not be straightforward. However, the use of the RF model incorporating meteorological factors in the detection and prediction of infectious diarrhea may provide an opportunity for reallocating healthcare resources more efficiently in other regions. In addition, considering the autocorrelation and clear seasonality of infectious diarrhea, the 0–4 week lag morbidity and time variable were incorporated into the RF model and were more important than the meteorological factors in improving the prediction accuracy of the RF model. These strategies should be used as a reference when fitting similar RF models.</p>
