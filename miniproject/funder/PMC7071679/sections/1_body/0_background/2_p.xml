<p id="Par15">The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been widely used as classical method for diarrhea incidence prediction, however, it has some limitations at the same time [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] developed a multivariable ARIMA (ARIMAX) model considering temperature and rainfall but only achieved high short-term predictive accuracy, possibly because the ARIMAX model assumed linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. However, meteorological factors have been reported to be non-linearly associated with the infectious diarrhea epidemic [
