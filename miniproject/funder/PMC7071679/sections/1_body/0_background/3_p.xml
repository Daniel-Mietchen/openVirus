<p id="Par16">The RF model is a new regression method and can address the limitations of ARIMA/X models in the prediction of diarrhea incidence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It can effectively extract non-linear relationships from data. The RF model uses independent variables to create classification and regression trees (CARTs), wherein each constituent tree is trained on a potentially non-linear regression space. The RF model may achieve predictive stability in terms of the actual instable morbidity. Using the RF model, the training set for each tree is randomly selected from the data, and the final predicted value is the average of all CART outputs. RF model has been widely used for infectious-disease prediction such as West Nile virus infection and Bovine viral diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Notably, Michael et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported that an RF model has advantages over the ARIMA model in predicting avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks. However, no studies have used an RF model to predict the incidence of infectious diarrhea .
