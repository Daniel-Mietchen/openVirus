<p id="Par17">This study was aimed at developing an optimal RF model for predicting infectious diarrhea epidemics with meteorological factors in Jiangsu Province, China. Meanwhile, the performance of the RF model was compared with those of the ARIMA/X models. The model can be used to develop an early warning system for infectious diarrhea to facilitate preventive strategies in a more effective manner.</p>
