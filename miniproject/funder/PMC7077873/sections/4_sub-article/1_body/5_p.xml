<p>We are particularly grateful for the Reviewers’ suggestions for additional analyses and interpretation; these have undoubtedly strengthened the manuscript. In particular, we have: formulated a more specific hypothesis to be tested in the analysis; constructed a directed acyclic graph to specify the putative causal pathway between index TB case HIV status and household contact latent TB infection, accounting for mediating factors and confounders to identify the minimal sufficient adjustment set of covariates for estimating the direct causal effect; and refined statistical modelling approached to estimate posterior distributions against clinically meaningful outcomes (the proportion of household contacts with tuberculin skin test induration ≥5mm and ≥5mm). Together, we hope that these revised analyses are now methodologically rigorous and will provide strong evidence of clinical and public health relevance.</p>
