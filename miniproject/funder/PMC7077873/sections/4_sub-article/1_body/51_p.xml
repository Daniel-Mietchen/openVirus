<p>Thank you. We have added text to describe the two thresholds selected for analysis (≥5mm and ≥10mm) – Lines 205-208. In particular, we note that the updated 2018 latent TB guidelines emphasise that there is no gold-standard test for latent tuberculosis infection and that there is no consensus about optimal thresholds for a) use in predicting subsequent progression to active tuberculosis, or b) to inform treatment decisions, either for individual people, or groups of patients. Therefore, we elected to select two conventionally-used thresholds in our analysis: ≥5mm and ≥10mm.</p>
