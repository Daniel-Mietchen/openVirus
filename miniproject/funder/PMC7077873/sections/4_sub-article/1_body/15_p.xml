<p>Thank you for this comment. Having carefully reviewed the Reviewer’s extremely helpful suggestions here and below, we have revised our analysis strategy to model the proportion of household contacts with TST induration ≥5mm and ≥10mm. We had previously attempted to model TST induration as a continuous mixture distribution, but appreciate that this approach may have been difficult to interpret and have had less immediate public health relevance. We believe that our revised analyse provides stronger evidence of greater clinical and public health relevance (see Statistical Methods section – line 188-288 for revised description of analytic approach.).</p>
