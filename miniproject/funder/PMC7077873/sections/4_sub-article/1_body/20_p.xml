<p>Thank you. As described in response to point 3 above, we have revised our modelling approach to be hypothesis driven, and adapted variable inclusion strategy to be based upon the causal pathways inferred by the directed acyclic graph. We hope that this principled approach provides strong rationale for the model specification approach taken.</p>
