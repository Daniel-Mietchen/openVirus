<p>Again, we thank the Reviewer for this insightful comment. The Reviewer rightly notes that that some variable previously identified as confounders may have in fact been mediators. To address this comment, before conducting our revised statistical analysis, we undertook two actions. Firstly, we formulated a more-specific testable hypothesis to be addressed by the analysis, namely: “are household contacts of HIV-positive index TB patients less likely to have latent TB infection?”. Secondly, we constructed a directed acyclic graph based on our knowledge and literature of the epidemiology of TB transmission to specify the putative causal pathway between index TB case HIV status and household contact latent TB infection, accounting for mediating factors and confounders and to identify the minimal sufficient adjustment set of covariates for estimating the direct causal effect. This graph can now be seen in Supplemental Figure 1. By explicitly describing the proposed causal pathway between index case HIV status and household contact latent TB infection, we hope that this will have resulted in a more rational approach to variable inclusion in models. Indeed, variables that the Reviewer identified as potential mediators in the relationship were no longer required to be adjusted for in the fully specified model.</p>
