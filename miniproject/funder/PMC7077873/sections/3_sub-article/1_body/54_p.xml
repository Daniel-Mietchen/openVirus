<p>3. Lines 236- 249. Four factors are mentioned as associated with diameter induration from fitting a multivariable model in this section: study site, HIV-status of contacts, HIV-status of index case and proportion of the day spent with index case. It is unclear whether these were ‘independent’ associations. Following from point #2 it makes sense to control for study site when evaluating the effect of HIV-positive status (as study site is a confounder). Viceversa, it seems inappropriate to control for HIV-status in the model focusing on study site as the exposure as HIV-status is a consequence of residency and not a cause. Authors should consider fitting different models according to the exposure of interest and control only for confounding factors, not mediator or possible colliders. Finally, what about age? There is not mention of age (strongly associated in univariable analysis) in the multivariable model (Figure 2).</p>
