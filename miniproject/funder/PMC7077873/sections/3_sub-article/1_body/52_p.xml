<p>Thus, for example what is the clinical relevance of a difference in risk of 3.68 (95% 3.04-4.41) comparing the two sites? Is this a risk or, being the endpoint continuous, a difference in mm? I would have been more relevant to show that the proportion of people with a diameter &gt;5 mm (or &gt;100 mm) was higher in one site compared to the other. All other detected differences are even smaller than 3.7 (mm?). Figure 3 clearly shows means in mm.</p>
