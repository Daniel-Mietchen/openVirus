<p>In terms of the first major comment from reviewer #2, I'm not quite sure if they are just suggesting some more discussion of the likely direction of bias based on the minor differences between those with vs without TST results, or suggesting imputing outcome data for the missing TST results. I would suggest the former would be fine, but I don't think the latter is necessary.   </p>
