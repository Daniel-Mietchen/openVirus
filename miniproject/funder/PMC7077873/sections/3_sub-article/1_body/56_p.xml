<p>5. Identifying predictors of larger diameter seems the main aim of the analysis. Nevertheless, message appear to be contradictory. Lines 241-243 implies that HIV-status of index case is indeed a predictor. In contrast in the Discussion it is stated that ‘In this study, we found that contacts of HIV-positive index cases had similar median posterior TST induration diameters to contacts of HIV-negative household contacts, even when stratified by study sites with markedly different epidemiological patterns of HIV and TB’. In general, there is a lack of standardisation in the presentation of results (HIV-status and age seem to be the only important predictor from reading the Conclusions of the abstract; HIV-status and duration of contacts with index case in the last paragraph of the Discussion). If the aim of the paper is direct public health efforts to specific target populations the identification of this population is rather confusing</p>
