<p>2. In the Discussion it is stated that the induration was greater in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative contacts after controlling for confounding factors. My understanding is that potential confounding was controlled by fitting random intercepts for each household to allow partial pooling of estimates and to account for clustering of characteristics within households. Correct? Going back for example to the comparison by sites, there were clear differences in terms of prevalence of HIV, frequency of contact with the index case as well as modality of sleeping (in the same bed as index case or not). All these are causes of diameter induration but consequences of residency so are more mediators than confounders. How does the multilevel Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson mixture model account for mediation?</p>
