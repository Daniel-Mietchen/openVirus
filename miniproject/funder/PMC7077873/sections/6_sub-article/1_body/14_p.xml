<p>Thank you for this comment and recommendation. We have revised the analysis to adjust for only index case age and province in the regression models now. Results are reporting in lines 274-302, and displayed visually in the new Figure 2. To allow readers to interpret data on TST positivity by other key characteristics (including age group of household contact), we have added a new Table 2 and Figure 1 reporting crude results.</p>
