<p>4. It is ok to keep the DAG Figure as supplementary material but the text in the Methods need to be expanded to clarify the strategy used to construct the multivariable binomial regression. In other words, it has to be said that under the assumption described in the DAG age and province are the only two confounders and that controlling for these factors would remove all backdoor pathways of measured confounding. This appears later in results (lines 235-237) but the set of confounders listed (apart from index case age which is an ancestor of exposure and outcome) none of the others (study site, household contact sex and HIV status, sex, HIV status and microbiological TB status) seem to match the DAG.</p>
