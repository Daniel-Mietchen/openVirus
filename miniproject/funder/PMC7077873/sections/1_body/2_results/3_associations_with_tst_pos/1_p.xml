<p>In the directed acyclic graph (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230376.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), study site and index case HIV status were identified as the minimal sufficient adjustment set of covariates for estimating the direct effect of index case HIV status on latent TB infection. Models fitted to data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230376.g002">Fig 2</xref>) showed marked differences between study sites in the proportion of household contacts with TST induration ≥5mm and ≥10mm, with contacts from Mangaung having consistently higher percentages of positivity compared to contacts from Mangaung. Both study sites showed that the probability of household contact TST positivity was highest where the index TB case was young and decreased with index case, but these trends were most pronounced among contacts from Mangaung. Across all index case ages, the mean proportion of contacts with a TST reaction ≥5mm and ≥10mm were consistently higher where the index case was HIV-negative.
