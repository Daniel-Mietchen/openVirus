<p>In multivariable regression analysis, there was strong evidence that a greater percentage of household contacts resident in Mangaung compared to Capricorn had TST ≥5mm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.08, 95% credible interval [CI]: 2.13–4.58) and ≥10mm (OR: 4.52, 95% CI: 3.03–6.97). Where the index TB case was HIV positive, household contacts were less likely to be TST positive at the ≥5mm threshold (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.56–1.14), or at the ≥10mm thresholds (0.77, 95% CI: 0.53–1.10). The posterior probability that the odds of TST induration ≥5mm were lower in household contacts of HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative index cases was 90%; for TST induration ≥10mm it was 92%.</p>
