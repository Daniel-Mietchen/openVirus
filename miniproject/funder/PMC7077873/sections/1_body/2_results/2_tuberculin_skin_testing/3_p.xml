<p>There were substantial differences between study sites in the percentage of TST positive household contacts when examined by key index TB case and household contact characteristics (
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Across all characteristics (excluding among household contacts who were previous smokers, where numbers were small), the percentage of household contacts with either a TST induration ≥5mm or ≥10mm were higher in Mangaung. In Capricorn 11.4% of household contacts of HIV-positive index cases and 9.8% of household contacts of HIV-negative index cases had TST induration of ≥5mm; however, in Mangaung 19.7% of household contacts of HIV-positive index cases and 24.8% of household contacts of HIV-negative index cases had TST duration of ≥5mm. This difference in percentage by site was apparent at the ≥10mm threshold. Whereas in Capricorn TST positivity rates were similar for male (10.9%) and female (10.5%) household contacts, in Mangaung female (23.4%) contacts were more likely to be TST positive than male contacts (19.6%) at the ≥5mm thresholds. Household contacts who were current smokers had a higher percentage of TST positivity at both the ≥5mm and ≥10mm thresholds in both Capricorn and Mangaung.
