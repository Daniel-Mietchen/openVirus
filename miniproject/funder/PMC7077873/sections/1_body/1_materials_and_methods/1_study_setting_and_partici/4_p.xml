<p>For this analysis, we only included participants randomly allocated to the intervention arm of the trial. In the intervention arm, households received a home visit within 14 days of recruiting the index TB patient, where a household census was undertaken, and a socio-demographic and health questionnaire was completed for each household contact. Household contacts were screened for symptoms of TB, and sputum was collected from participants able to produce it–irrespective of the presence of symptoms–with Xpert and culture requested to be performed at the local National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) mycobacterial laboratory, and with subsequent linkage to treatment for positive results. HIV testing and counselling with linkage to care and prevention services was offered to all household contacts who did not have previously confirmed HIV infection or who were not taking ART. Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) initiation in the household was offered to HIV-positive individuals and children younger than five years without TB symptoms; we also offered TB preventive treatment to HIV-negative household contacts older than five years. Initially, following National TB Guidelines, home initiation of IPT was based on the presence of a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) for HIV-infected individuals and children under five years of age. Approximately midway through the study having a positive TST result was removed from Guidelines[

However, we continued until study end to offer home IPT initiation for HIV-seronegative individuals with a positive TST.
