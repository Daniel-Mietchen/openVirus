Index TB cases of all ages who had been diagnosed with TB within the preceding six-weeks were eligible to participate, providing they were a permanent resident of one of the study districts, and with no plans to relocate during the study. We excluded TB cases older than seven years if they did not have a microbiologically-confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary TB; children seven years-or-younger were eligible if they had either microbiologically-confirmed or microbiologically-unconfirmed TB, diagnosed by a doctor. Severely-ill and deceased patients were included if consent to participate was obtained from a close family member. We excluded TB cases who were incarcerated or receiving long-term in-patient care.
