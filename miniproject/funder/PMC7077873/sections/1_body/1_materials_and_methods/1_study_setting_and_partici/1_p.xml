<p>We conducted an epidemiological analysis of data collected during a household cluster randomised trial (ISRCTN16006202) conducted in two provinces of South Africa investigating the effect of intensified home screening and linkage to treatment for TB and HIV on TB-free survival.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] We purposefully selected two study sites with very different annual TB incidence. The study sites were Mangaung Municipality in the Free State (2016 population: 787,803); and Capricorn District in Limpopo Province (2016 population: 1,330,436).[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Antenatal HIV seroprevalence and the annual TB incidence for 2015 in Mangaung and in Capricorn were 31.7% and 616/100,000, and 21.6% and 328/100,000, respectively.[
