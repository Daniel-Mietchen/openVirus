<p>Tuberculin skin testing using purified protein derivative (PPD; from a variety of manufacturers, owing to limited global supply) was offered to all household contacts. TST was administered by study nurses who received study-specific training. Quality of TST testing was evaluated by supervisors to ensure standardization at both sites. An intradermal injection of 0.1 milliliter of PPD was placed in the volar aspect of the left forearm to raise a visible bleb. Household contacts were visited 48â€“72 hours after placement for reading. The presence of induration was recorded, and two dots were marked at each margin on the long axis of the forearm. The induration diameter was then measured using a millimeter ruler.[
