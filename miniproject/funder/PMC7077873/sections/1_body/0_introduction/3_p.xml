<p>Using data collected prospectively from participants in the intervention arm of a household cluster-randomised trial being conducted in South Africa, we set out to describe the prevalence of latent TB infection among household contacts of pulmonary TB index cases, and thereby identify population groups that may receive the greatest benefit and could be targeted in efforts to expand access to TB preventive therapy, or for roll-out of novel TB vaccines. Using a Bayesian multilevel modelling analysis approach, we additionally aimed to provide evidence for how shared household risk factors between index cases (particularly HIV status) and household contacts interact to determine household contact prevalence of latent TB infection within provinces with differing TB and HIV epidemics.</p>
