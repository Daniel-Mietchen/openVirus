<p>An estimated one-quarter of the world’s population are latently-infected with

 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] To achieve the End-TB strategy, the World Health Organization (WHO) has prioritised the identification and delivery of tuberculosis (TB) preventive interventions to people at high-risk of infection.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In sub-Saharan Africa, people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continue to have substantially-higher incidence of active TB disease than people without HIV, despite high levels of population coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in many settings.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] TB preventive therapy significantly reduces the risk of progression to active disease for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals,[

 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and newer more tolerable and shorter regimens are becoming available through national HIV and TB programmes.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, coverage of TB preventive therapy remains unacceptably low and innovative approaches to prioritise groups at the highest risk of disease are urgently needed.[
