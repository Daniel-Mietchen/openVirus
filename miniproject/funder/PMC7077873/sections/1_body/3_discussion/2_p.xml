<p>Of particular concern was the extremely high prevalence of latent TB infection among children aged 0–4 years in Mangaung, with 22% and 20% having indurations of ≥5mm and ≥10mm respectively. Similar rates were reported in a township in the Western Cape [

We are evaluating an intervention to protect household contacts and improve TB free survival in contacts of TB index patients in the parent cluster randomised trial; results will be reported once the trial has concluded.
