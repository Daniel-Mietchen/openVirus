<p>We found that, after adjusting for important confounders, household contacts of HIV-positive index cases had substantially lower odds of latent TB infection at both the ≥5mm and ≥10mm thresholds, with differences particularly apparent when compared between study sites. In the Capricorn study site–which included many participants living in rural areas, has a lower HIV prevalence, and almost half the TB annual TB incidence of Mangaung[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]–the proportion of household contacts with immunological evidence of latent TB infection was lower than in Mangaung (which is characterised by large, densely-populated urban and peri-urban townships and high HIV prevalence) across all age bands. In both sites, the prevalence of TST positivity began to decline after approximately age 34–44 years, and may represent a survivorship effect with disproportionate population mortality among younger adults with TB infection over the past 10–20 years who have not survived into older age due to HIV-related mortality.[
