<p>In conclusion, we found strong evidence of a very high burden of latent TB infection among household contacts of TB cases in two provinces of South Africa, with worryingly high infection rates among young children in Mangaung, Free State. We found evidence that household contacts of HIV-positive index cases were less likely to have latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases. In addition to urgent public health action to reduce TB transmission, new approaches are required to reach population groups at greatest risk and deliver effective TB preventive treatment.</p>
