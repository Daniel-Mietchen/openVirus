<p>From a public health perspective, a number of recommendations arise from this analysis. In high HIV prevalence settings, substantially greater evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of household contact screening vs. current standard of care (primarily delivered in conjunction with passive detection of active TB cases, with few resources available for contact tracing activities, and occasionally through active case finding activities) is needed. Shortened, more tolerable TB preventive treatment regimens may significantly alter what is feasible and acceptable to deliver to individuals and communities,[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and operational research to develop, refine and evaluate new models will be critical to achieving success. Importantly, as data from the current analysis demonstrates, a single delivery approach generalised across all population groups in highly-differentiated epidemiological settings are unlikely to be successful. Instead, local public health authorities need local-relevant data on the trends and patterns of infection and disease within their populations to inform the design of a suite of TB prevention interventions. This will require a renewal of local public health capacity, as well as strengthened links within and between communities.
