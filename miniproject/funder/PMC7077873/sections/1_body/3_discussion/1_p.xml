<p>In this analysis of &gt;2,500 household contacts of index TB patients in the intervention arm of a cluster-randomised trial in two provinces of South Africa, we found a high prevalence of latent TB infection, with contacts living in Mangaung (a locality with very high annual TB burden), older contacts, and contacts of microbiologically-confirmed index TB cases having a greater prevalence of infection. In contrast, we found that household contacts of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection compared to contacts of HIV-negative index TB cases.</p>
