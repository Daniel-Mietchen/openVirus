<p>There is uncertainty over the role of HIV in the infectiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly with immune reconstitution due to ART.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] This is partly because of the lack of a robust test for diagnosis of recent TB infection in settings where community force of infection is high, and data suggesting that HIV infection may lead to a shorter duration of symptomatic pulmonary disease and with less cavitation and lower bacillary load in people living with HIV.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230376.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In a high-TB burden community, TST induration in a household contact may represent infection as a consequence of household exposure from an index case, infection from other community contacts, or both. In this study, we found that contacts of HIV-positive index cases had a lower prevalence of TST positivity compared to contacts of HIV-negative household contacts, even when stratified by study sites with markedly different epidemiological patterns of HIV and TB. Although by no means conclusive and assuming that contacts of HIV-positive and HIV-negative index cases had similar patterns of exposure outside of the household, this suggests that HIV-positive TB patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are less infectious than HIV-negative TB patients. A greater understanding of the possible reasons for this is required, including through comparison of the rate of generation of infectious quanta between HIV-positive and HIV-negative people, and although challenging, prospective cohort studies of incidence in latent TB infection (perhaps using newer, more accurate tests) combined with epidemiological and social mixing data should be considered.
