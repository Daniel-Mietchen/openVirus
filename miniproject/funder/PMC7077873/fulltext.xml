We set out to investigate whether index TB case HIV status was linked to a higher probability of latent TB infection among household contacts.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Data were collected prospectively from participants in the intervention arm of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST). TST induration was estimated at two cut-offs (&#x02265;5mm, &#x02265;10mm). Multilevel Bayesian regression models estimated posterior distributions of the percentage of household contacts with TST induration &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm by age group, and compared the odds of latent TB infection by key risk factors including HIV status index case age and study province.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,985 household contacts of 924 index cases were assessed, with most 2,725 (91.3%) undergoing TST. HIV prevalence in household contacts was 14% and 10% in Mangaung and Capricorn respectively. Overall, 16.8% (458/2,725) had TST induration of &#x02265;5mm and 13.1% (359/2,725) &#x02265;10mm. In Mangaung, children aged 0&#x02013;4 years had a high TST positivity prevalence compared to their peers in Capricorn (22.0% vs. 7.6%, and 20.5% vs. 2.3%, using TST thresholds of &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm respectively). Compared to contacts from Capricorn, household contacts living in Mangaung were more likely to have TST induration &#x02265;5mm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.08, 95% credibility interval [CI]: 2.13&#x02013;4.58) and &#x02265;10mm (OR: 4.52, 95% CI: 3.03&#x02013;6.97). There was a 90% and 92% posterior probability that the odds of TST induration &#x02265;5mm (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.56&#x02013;1.14) and &#x02265;10mm (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.53&#x02013;1.10) respectively were lower in household contacts of HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative index cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>High TST induration positivity, especially among young children and people living in Mangaung indicates considerable TB transmission despite high antiretroviral therapy coverage. Household contact of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010897</institution-id><institution>Newton Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>96783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0329-9613</contrib-id><name><surname>MacPherson</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010897</institution-id><institution>Newton Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>96783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Webb</surname><given-names>Emily L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010897</institution-id><institution>Newton Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>96783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinson</surname><given-names>Neil A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT089673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0329-9613</contrib-id><name><surname>MacPherson</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by the South African Medical Research Council and the UK MRC Newton Fund (SAMRC grant number: 96783).

Index TB cases of all ages who had been diagnosed with TB within the preceding six-weeks were eligible to participate, providing they were a permanent resident of one of the study districts, and with no plans to relocate during the study. We excluded TB cases older than seven years if they did not have a microbiologically-confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary TB; children seven years-or-younger were eligible if they had either microbiologically-confirmed or microbiologically-unconfirmed TB, diagnosed by a doctor. Severely-ill and deceased patients were included if consent to participate was obtained from a close family member. We excluded TB cases who were incarcerated or receiving long-term in-patient care.</p><p>Because of the profusion of backyard dwellings, a household was defined as all rooms under a contiguous roofed area linked by doorways or windows through which air could pass. Household contacts of index TB cases were defined as individuals who slept overnight at least once or shared at least two meals in the same household as the index case in the 14 days prior to the index case&#x02019;s diagnosis of TB.</p><p>For this analysis, we only included participants randomly allocated to the intervention arm of the trial. In the intervention arm, households received a home visit within 14 days of recruiting the index TB patient, where a household census was undertaken, and a socio-demographic and health questionnaire was completed for each household contact. Household contacts were screened for symptoms of TB, and sputum was collected from participants able to produce it&#x02013;irrespective of the presence of symptoms&#x02013;with Xpert and culture requested to be performed at the local National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) mycobacterial laboratory, and with subsequent linkage to treatment for positive results. HIV testing and counselling with linkage to care and prevention services was offered to all household contacts who did not have previously confirmed HIV infection or who were not taking ART. Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) initiation in the household was offered to HIV-positive individuals and children younger than five years without TB symptoms; we also offered TB preventive treatment to HIV-negative household contacts older than five years. Initially, following National TB Guidelines, home initiation of IPT was based on the presence of a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) for HIV-infected individuals and children under five years of age. Approximately midway through the study having a positive TST result was removed from Guidelines[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and we then offered home IPT initiation to all children under five years of age and all HIV-infected individuals irrespective of the TST result. However, we continued until study end to offer home IPT initiation for HIV-seronegative individuals with a positive TST.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Tuberculin skin testing</title><p>Tuberculin skin testing using purified protein derivative (PPD; from a variety of manufacturers, owing to limited global supply) was offered to all household contacts. TST was administered by study nurses who received study-specific training. Quality of TST testing was evaluated by supervisors to ensure standardization at both sites. An intradermal injection of 0.1 milliliter of PPD was placed in the volar aspect of the left forearm to raise a visible bleb. Household contacts were visited 48&#x02013;72 hours after placement for reading. The presence of induration was recorded, and two dots were marked at each margin on the long axis of the forearm. The induration diameter was then measured using a millimeter ruler.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>All index TB cases (or their representative if deceased or severely unwell) and household contacts provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Consent to participate in research was obtained for children &#x0003c;18 years from their parent or guardian, and assent was obtained from children 7&#x02013;18 years. Approvals were obtained from ethical review committees of the University of Witwatersrand and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>We summarised the characteristics of index cases and their household contacts using medians, ranges and proportions, and compared the two study sites. To account for missing values in the HIV status of index cases (4.9%) and HIV status of household contacts (5.0%), we did multiple imputation using additive regression, bootstrapping, and predictive mean matching.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>To investigate whether index case HIV status was associated with evidence of latent TB infection, we fitted two multilevel Bayesian regression models with Bernoulli likelihood distribution to the TST data. The first model investigated the proportion of household contacts with TST induration &#x02265;5mm, and the second the proportion of household contacts with TST induration &#x02265;10mm. TST thresholds were based on conventionally-used definitions for latent TB infection. We plotted a directed acyclic graph to describe the putative causal pathway between index case HIV-positivity and household contact latent TB infection, and to identify the minimal sufficient adjustment set of covariates for estimating the direct effect of index case HIV status on latent TB infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230376.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Random intercepts for each household were included to allow partial pooling of estimates and to account for clustering of characteristics within households.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] We placed weakly informative priors on intercepts (normal[mean = 0, sd = 2]), beta coefficients (normal[mean = 0, sd = 2]), and on the standard deviation of random intercepts (half-Cauchy[0,1]). Parameters and their credible intervals were estimated using Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures implemented in Stan, interfaced through the `brms 2.9.0`package in R.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The percentage and 95% uncertainty intervals of household contacts with TST induration reactions &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm were estimated by drawing samples from model posterior distributions, and fitting to index case age distributions, stratified by study site and index case HIV status.

In contrast, we found that household contacts of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection compared to contacts of HIV-negative index TB cases.</p><p>Of particular concern was the extremely high prevalence of latent TB infection among children aged 0&#x02013;4 years in Mangaung, with 22% and 20% having indurations of &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm respectively. Similar rates were reported in a township in the Western Cape [<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and in Matlosana in younger individuals.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Evidence increasingly shows that young children (&#x0003c;5 years old) are predominantly exposed to infectious TB outside their immediate household.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A high prevalence of latent TB infection among this group is indicative of intense community transmission and high prevalence of undiagnosed infectious TB,[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] meaning that urgent public health action is required to increase case detection and protect vulnerable groups and individuals. We are evaluating an intervention to protect household contacts and improve TB free survival in contacts of TB index patients in the parent cluster randomised trial; results will be reported once the trial has concluded.</p><p>We found that, after adjusting for important confounders, household contacts of HIV-positive index cases had substantially lower odds of latent TB infection at both the &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm thresholds, with differences particularly apparent when compared between study sites. In the Capricorn study site&#x02013;which included many participants living in rural areas, has a lower HIV prevalence, and almost half the TB annual TB incidence of Mangaung[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]&#x02013;the proportion of household contacts with immunological evidence of latent TB infection was lower than in Mangaung (which is characterised by large, densely-populated urban and peri-urban townships and high HIV prevalence) across all age bands. In both sites, the prevalence of TST positivity began to decline after approximately age 34&#x02013;44 years, and may represent a survivorship effect with disproportionate population mortality among younger adults with TB infection over the past 10&#x02013;20 years who have not survived into older age due to HIV-related mortality.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>There is uncertainty over the role of HIV in the infectiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly with immune reconstitution due to ART.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] This is partly because of the lack of a robust test for diagnosis of recent TB infection in settings where community force of infection is high, and data suggesting that HIV infection may lead to a shorter duration of symptomatic pulmonary disease and with less cavitation and lower bacillary load in people living with HIV.[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In a high-TB burden community, TST induration in a household contact may represent infection as a consequence of household exposure from an index case, infection from other community contacts, or both. In this study, we found that contacts of HIV-positive index cases had a lower prevalence of TST positivity compared to contacts of HIV-negative household contacts, even when stratified by study sites with markedly different epidemiological patterns of HIV and TB. Although by no means conclusive and assuming that contacts of HIV-positive and HIV-negative index cases had similar patterns of exposure outside of the household, this suggests that HIV-positive TB patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are less infectious than HIV-negative TB patients. A greater understanding of the possible reasons for this is required, including through comparison of the rate of generation of infectious quanta between HIV-positive and HIV-negative people, and although challenging, prospective cohort studies of incidence in latent TB infection (perhaps using newer, more accurate tests) combined with epidemiological and social mixing data should be considered.</p><p>From a public health perspective, a number of recommendations arise from this analysis. In high HIV prevalence settings, substantially greater evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of household contact screening vs. current standard of care (primarily delivered in conjunction with passive detection of active TB cases, with few resources available for contact tracing activities, and occasionally through active case finding activities) is needed. Shortened, more tolerable TB preventive treatment regimens may significantly alter what is feasible and acceptable to deliver to individuals and communities,[<xref rid="pone.0230376.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and operational research to develop, refine and evaluate new models will be critical to achieving success. Importantly, as data from the current analysis demonstrates, a single delivery approach generalised across all population groups in highly-differentiated epidemiological settings are unlikely to be successful. Instead, local public health authorities need local-relevant data on the trends and patterns of infection and disease within their populations to inform the design of a suite of TB prevention interventions. This will require a renewal of local public health capacity, as well as strengthened links within and between communities.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this analysis. There were differences in characteristics between individuals who received and did not receive TST in the study, with HIV-positive individuals less likely to complete testing. This could potentially have resulted in selection bias, although it is uncertain in which direction this could have influenced estimates. Although ART status of household contacts was recorded, we were unable to evaluate the interaction between HIV status, ART and age on TST induration diameter due to the small numbers of young children with HIV in this epidemiologically-important age group. PPD was intermittently available during the trial period due to a global shortage, and we had to purchase PPD from different suppliers. We didn&#x02019;t record Bacille Calmette&#x02013;Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccination status of household contacts, although coverage of BCG vaccination is high in South Africa. Although standardised training and regular quality assessment of TST procedures was provided (including periods where study coordinators swapped between sites), it is possible that performance of TST (which is subject to operator and measurement error) may have varied between sites. We evaluated the effect of intensity of exposure to index cases by categorising into self-reported groups; although very resource-intensive, future studies may wish to measure exposure prospectively using diaries or contact sensor approaches. Our estimate of the effect of index case HIV-positive status on TST positivity in household contacts can only be interpreted as causal under the assumption of a correctly specified DAG model. Moreover, unmeasured confounding may be an issue, particularly due to latent variables identified but uncontrolled for in the DAG. Finally, in the absence of a gold-standard test for latent TB infection and the limitations of TST, our estimates of prevalence are likely to be subject to some misclassification bias.</p><p>In conclusion, we found strong evidence of a very high burden of latent TB infection among household contacts of TB cases in two provinces of South Africa, with worryingly high infection rates among young children in Mangaung, Free State. We found evidence that household contacts of HIV-positive index cases were less likely to have latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases. In addition to urgent public health action to reduce TB transmission, new approaches are required to reach population groups at greatest risk and deliver effective TB preventive treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0230376.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Characteristics of household contacts who did and did not receive tuberculin skin testing.</title><p>Putative causal pathways are shown by arrowed lines.

I am unclear why the length of induration as a continuous variable was used as the primary endpoint. The diameters of 5 and 10 mm have been mentioned as standard clinical cut-off.</p><p>Thus, for example what is the clinical relevance of a difference in risk of 3.68 (95% 3.04-4.41) comparing the two sites? Is this a risk or, being the endpoint continuous, a difference in mm? I would have been more relevant to show that the proportion of people with a diameter &#x0003e;5 mm (or &#x0003e;100 mm) was higher in one site compared to the other. All other detected differences are even smaller than 3.7 (mm?). Figure 3 clearly shows means in mm.</p><p>2. In the Discussion it is stated that the induration was greater in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative contacts after controlling for confounding factors. My understanding is that potential confounding was controlled by fitting random intercepts for each household to allow partial pooling of estimates and to account for clustering of characteristics within households. Correct? Going back for example to the comparison by sites, there were clear differences in terms of prevalence of HIV, frequency of contact with the index case as well as modality of sleeping (in the same bed as index case or not). All these are causes of diameter induration but consequences of residency so are more mediators than confounders. How does the multilevel Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson mixture model account for mediation?</p><p>3. Lines 236- 249. Four factors are mentioned as associated with diameter induration from fitting a multivariable model in this section: study site, HIV-status of contacts, HIV-status of index case and proportion of the day spent with index case. It is unclear whether these were &#x02018;independent&#x02019; associations. Following from point #2 it makes sense to control for study site when evaluating the effect of HIV-positive status (as study site is a confounder). Viceversa, it seems inappropriate to control for HIV-status in the model focusing on study site as the exposure as HIV-status is a consequence of residency and not a cause. Authors should consider fitting different models according to the exposure of interest and control only for confounding factors, not mediator or possible colliders. Finally, what about age? There is not mention of age (strongly associated in univariable analysis) in the multivariable model (Figure 2).</p><p>4. There is no discussion of the fact that proportion of day spent with index case showed a significant association with diameter induration but sleeping in the same bed with the index case was not. What are the possible speculations for these findings?</p><p>5. Identifying predictors of larger diameter seems the main aim of the analysis. Nevertheless, message appear to be contradictory. Lines 241-243 implies that HIV-status of index case is indeed a predictor. In contrast in the Discussion it is stated that &#x02018;In this study, we found that contacts of HIV-positive index cases had similar median posterior TST induration diameters to contacts of HIV-negative household contacts, even when stratified by study sites with markedly different epidemiological patterns of HIV and TB&#x02019;. In general, there is a lack of standardisation in the presentation of results (HIV-status and age seem to be the only important predictor from reading the Conclusions of the abstract; HIV-status and duration of contacts with index case in the last paragraph of the Discussion). If the aim of the paper is direct public health efforts to specific target populations the identification of this population is rather confusing</p><p>6. Title of Table 1 should be. Characteristics of index cases (top) and household contacts (bottom) by Study site</p><p>7. Lines 224-227. From the introducing text a reader would expect to see the comparison of percentage of positivity in the 0-4 years old vs. &#x0003e;4 years old stratified by site, not the difference in proportion of positivity in the 0-4 years old by site alone.</p><p>8. Line 255. What was the p-value for this 3-way interaction? Wonder whether instead of describing the effect of age by HIV-status/study would have been more informative to give the differences according to HIV-status by age/study strata?</p><p>9. Abstract line 60. Data were collected prospectively as part of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST).</p><p>I would rephrase making it clear from the start that this analysis only include the data from the intervention arm. Essentially is a cohort study using a single arm of a trial. This only becomes clear from reading the full paper.</p><p>10. Page 16, four lines form the end. Typo mortality instead of morality</p><p>11. Page 19. what does BCG stand for? Spell out</p><p>12. Figure 1. Add a footnote to clarify that top of the figure is for cut off 5 mm and bottom for 10 mm?</p><p>13. Figure 2. Are these mean differences in diameter or RR? RR of what?</p><p>14. Figure 3 How can age of house contact be -1? Why is only the range [-1; +3] shown?</p><p>Reviewer #2: I commend the authors for the important study on the major public health problem in South Africa. Although study results are compelling, there are few methodological issues which need to be addressed/further explained in order to improve this manuscript.</p><p>Major Issue</p><p>&#x02022; Page 18, paragraph 5, limitations: Authors have acknowledged that there were differences between individuals who received and did not TST in the study and these differences could have resulted in selection bias. I would suggest they use the data on those who did not receive TST to investigate how it could have influenced the results.</p><p>Minor Issue</p><p>&#x02022; Page 6 line 151: Authors need to describe cut-offs of skin induration for LTBI under Tuberculin skin testing sub-section of Material and Methods section and which guidelines the cut-offs are based on.</p><p>In addition, the manuscript is clearly written in a professional manner. Conclusions are presented in an appropriate fashion and are supported by the data If there is a weakness, it is minor methodological issues (as I have noted above).</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Wednesday, 29th January 2020</p><p>Dear Prof Lessells,</p><p>Re: PONE-D-19-29656. Prevalence and risk factors for latent tuberculosis infection among household contacts of index cases in two South African provinces: analysis of baseline data from a cluster-randomised trial</p><p>I write on behalf of my co-authors to thank the reviewers for their careful review, and appreciate the opportunity to respond with a revised submission. Please see a point-by-point response below.</p><p>We are particularly grateful for the Reviewers&#x02019; suggestions for additional analyses and interpretation; these have undoubtedly strengthened the manuscript. In particular, we have: formulated a more specific hypothesis to be tested in the analysis; constructed a directed acyclic graph to specify the putative causal pathway between index TB case HIV status and household contact latent TB infection, accounting for mediating factors and confounders to identify the minimal sufficient adjustment set of covariates for estimating the direct causal effect; and refined statistical modelling approached to estimate posterior distributions against clinically meaningful outcomes (the proportion of household contacts with tuberculin skin test induration &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;5mm). Together, we hope that these revised analyses are now methodologically rigorous and will provide strong evidence of clinical and public health relevance.</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p><p>Yours Sincerely,</p><p>Peter MacPherson</p><p>(On behalf of the authors)</p><p>RESPONSE TO REVIEWER 1&#x02019;S COMMENTS</p><p>1. This an interesting analysis of a single arm of a clustered randomised clinical trial conducted in two study sites with different annual incidence of TB (Mangaung Municipality in the Free State and Capricorn District in Limpopo Province).

Having carefully reviewed the Reviewer&#x02019;s extremely helpful suggestions here and below, we have revised our analysis strategy to model the proportion of household contacts with TST induration &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm. We had previously attempted to model TST induration as a continuous mixture distribution, but appreciate that this approach may have been difficult to interpret and have had less immediate public health relevance. We believe that our revised analyse provides stronger evidence of greater clinical and public health relevance (see Statistical Methods section &#x02013; line 188-288 for revised description of analytic approach.).</p><p>3. In the Discussion it is stated that the induration was greater in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative contacts after controlling for confounding factors. My understanding is that potential confounding was controlled by fitting random intercepts for each household to allow partial pooling of estimates and to account for clustering of characteristics within households. Correct? Going back for example to the comparison by sites, there were clear differences in terms of prevalence of HIV, frequency of contact with the index case as well as modality of sleeping (in the same bed as index case or not). All these are causes of diameter induration but consequences of residency so are more mediators than confounders. How does the multilevel Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson mixture model account for mediation? </p><p>Again, we thank the Reviewer for this insightful comment. The Reviewer rightly notes that that some variable previously identified as confounders may have in fact been mediators. To address this comment, before conducting our revised statistical analysis, we undertook two actions. Firstly, we formulated a more-specific testable hypothesis to be addressed by the analysis, namely: &#x0201c;are household contacts of HIV-positive index TB patients less likely to have latent TB infection?&#x0201d;. Secondly, we constructed a directed acyclic graph based on our knowledge and literature of the epidemiology of TB transmission to specify the putative causal pathway between index TB case HIV status and household contact latent TB infection, accounting for mediating factors and confounders and to identify the minimal sufficient adjustment set of covariates for estimating the direct causal effect. This graph can now be seen in Supplemental Figure 1. By explicitly describing the proposed causal pathway between index case HIV status and household contact latent TB infection, we hope that this will have resulted in a more rational approach to variable inclusion in models. Indeed, variables that the Reviewer identified as potential mediators in the relationship were no longer required to be adjusted for in the fully specified model.</p><p>To answer the question about partial pooling &#x02013; yes, including a random intercept term for households allows information to be shared between households, reducing uncertainty whilst accounting for the clustering of characteristics between households.</p><p>4. Lines 236- 249. Four factors are mentioned as associated with diameter induration from fitting a multivariable model in this section: study site, HIV-status of contacts, HIV-status of index case and proportion of the day spent with index case. It is unclear whether these were &#x02018;independent&#x02019; associations. Following from point #2 it makes sense to control for study site when evaluating the effect of HIV-positive status (as study site is a confounder). Viceversa, it seems inappropriate to control for HIV-status in the model focusing on study site as the exposure as HIV-status is a consequence of residency and not a cause. Authors should consider fitting different models according to the exposure of interest and control only for confounding factors, not mediator or possible colliders. Finally, what about age? There is not mention of age (strongly associated in univariable analysis) in the multivariable model (Figure 2). </p><p>Thank you. As described in response to point 3 above, we have revised our modelling approach to be hypothesis driven, and adapted variable inclusion strategy to be based upon the causal pathways inferred by the directed acyclic graph. We hope that this principled approach provides strong rationale for the model specification approach taken.</p><p>We have now added additional text to describe the effect of index case age on household contact latent TB prevalence (lines 328-329), and have plotted new figures that we believe better convey the importance of household contact age on the risk of TST induration (Figure 1).</p><p>5. There is no discussion of the fact that proportion of day spent with index case showed a significant association with diameter induration but sleeping in the same bed with the index case was not. What are the possible speculations for these findings? </p><p>In our revised model, neither proportion of day spent with index case nor sleeping in the same bed as the index case were identified as variables necessary to include in the final models. Thus the inconsistent results described above may have bene an artifact of the previous modelling approach.</p><p>6. Identifying predictors of larger diameter seems the main aim of the analysis. Nevertheless, message appear to be contradictory. Lines 241-243 implies that HIV-status of index case is indeed a predictor. In contrast in the Discussion it is stated that &#x02018;In this study, we found that contacts of HIV-positive index cases had similar median posterior TST induration diameters to contacts of HIV-negative household contacts, even when stratified by study sites with markedly different epidemiological patterns of HIV and TB&#x02019;. In general, there is a lack of standardisation in the presentation of results (HIV-status and age seem to be the only important predictor from reading the Conclusions of the abstract; HIV-status and duration of contacts with index case in the last paragraph of the Discussion). If the aim of the paper is direct public health efforts to specific target populations the identification of this population is rather confusing. </p><p>Thank you for these helpful comments. We hope that the revised modelling approach described in response to points 1-5 above have addressed these concerns. In addition, we have made substantial revisions to the Discussion and Conclusion to provide greater clarity of the clinical and public health implications of the research findings.</p><p>7. Title of Table 1 should be. Characteristics of index cases (top) and household contacts (bottom) by Study site</p><p>Thank you, we have made this change.</p><p>8. Lines 224-227. From the introducing text a reader would expect to see the comparison of percentage of positivity in the 0-4 years old vs. &#x0003e;4 years old stratified by site, not the difference in proportion of positivity in the 0-4 years old by site alone. </p><p>Thank you &#x02013; we have revised this paragraph to add clarity.</p><p>9. Line 255. What was the p-value for this 3-way interaction? Wonder whether instead of describing the effect of age by HIV-status/study would have been more informative to give the differences according to HIV-status by age/study strata? </p><p>In the revised models, we have removed analysis of the three-way interactions. Instead, we have presented fitted posterior distributions of TST positivity for index case age groups stratified by index case HIV status and microbiological status, study site, and household HIV status.</p><p>10. Abstract line 60. Data were collected prospectively as part of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST).</p><p>I would rephrase making it clear from the start that this analysis only include the data from the intervention arm. Essentially is a cohort study using a single arm of a trial. This only becomes clear from reading the full paper. </p><p>Thank you. We have added this to the Abstract</p><p>11.

I commend the authors for the important study on the major public health problem in South Africa. Although study results are compelling, there are few methodological issues which need to be addressed/further explained in order to improve this manuscript.</p><p>We thank the Reviewer for these comments.</p><p>2. Page 18, paragraph 5, limitations: Authors have acknowledged that there were differences between individuals who received and did not TST in the study and these differences could have resulted in selection bias. I would suggest they use the data on those who did not receive TST to investigate how it could have influenced the results.</p><p>Thank you. In Supplemental Table 1, we have presented characteristics of participants, stratified by whether TST testing was done or not. We hope that this provides the clarity required. </p><p>3. Page 6 line 151: Authors need to describe cut-offs of skin induration for LTBI under Tuberculin skin testing sub-section of Material and Methods section and which guidelines the cut-offs are based on. </p><p>Thank you. We have added text to describe the two thresholds selected for analysis (&#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm) &#x02013; Lines 205-208. In particular, we note that the updated 2018 latent TB guidelines emphasise that there is no gold-standard test for latent tuberculosis infection and that there is no consensus about optimal thresholds for a) use in predicting subsequent progression to active tuberculosis, or b) to inform treatment decisions, either for individual people, or groups of patients. Therefore, we elected to select two conventionally-used thresholds in our analysis: &#x02265;5mm and &#x02265;10mm.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0230376.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0230376.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lessells</surname><given-names>Richard John</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Richard John Lessells</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Richard John Lessells</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0230376" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
