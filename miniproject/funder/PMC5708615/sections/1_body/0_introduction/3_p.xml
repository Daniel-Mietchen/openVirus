<p>Real-time internet-based biosurveillance methods for vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as dengue virus (DENV), other arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), malaria, and Kinetoplastida have now been studied in several tropical and temperate countries [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These VBDs affect many low- and middle-income regions of the world with rapidly rising internet access but relatively limited conventional surveillance infrastructure and often delayed dissemination of VBD surveillance data to key stakeholders [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In such regions, internet-based biosurveillance methods (which are often real time and free) may thus be useful as a supplementary, timely surveillance signal to aid in public health preparedness, situational awareness, and response to VBDs, although there may be considerable limitations to their accuracy in low- and middle-income countries because of limited and/or heterogeneous internet access [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite now numerous published studies on internet-based biosurveillance for VBD, most reviews of this topic are now relatively old and do not focus on communicable diseases, let alone VBD [
