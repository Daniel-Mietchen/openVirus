<p>In this narrative review, we succinctly describe the various internet data streams and their applications in biosurveillance for vector-borne viruses, parasites, and other pathogens, including Zika virus (ZIKV), DENV, other arboviruses, malaria, 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic> spp. (Lyme disease) in a range of settings, including low- and middle-income countries. Through these case examples, we cover the rationale for developing these methods, the types of internet data they employ, their accuracy, and their possible uses in public health practice. We comment on the strengths and limitations of existing studies in this field and conclude with some perspectives regarding the challenges and future directions in using internet-based biosurveillance for the surveillance and control of VBD.
