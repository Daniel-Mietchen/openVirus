<p>Since the landmark Google Flu Trends paper by Ginsberg et al. [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The putative advantage of real-time internet-based surveillance systems like Google Flu Trends put forth by Ginsberg et al. (and by subsequent authors of many other papers in this field) is that timely surveillance is a cornerstone of public health response to influenza and other pathogens—yet even in well-resourced regions, conventional surveillance is not real time, and there is generally a delay of at least one to two weeks before finalized data are available. Such delays may be unacceptable in public health practice, particularly in the context of an epidemic or pandemic, when early detection may improve response and control. Google Flu Trends was initially proposed to be useful for public health practice because it was initially able to predict epidemic peaks by two weeks [
