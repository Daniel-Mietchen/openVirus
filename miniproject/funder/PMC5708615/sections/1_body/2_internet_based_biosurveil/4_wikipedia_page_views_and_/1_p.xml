<p>Wikipedia is a widely used, free, open-source, searchable encyclopedia and the fifth most visited website globally [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Trends in specific Wikipedia article views are provided via WikipediaTrends, with a granularity to the day and normalized as a function of all Wikipedia article views and searches for that time period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Similar to the concept of Twitter and Google-based VBD surveillance, time series of Wikipedia topic views related to a specific communicable disease are thus obtainable and may serve as a proxy of that disease’s activity. Beyond capturing only a fraction of the search volumes of other big data sources like Google and Twitter, the primary limitation of WikipediaTrends is that it is unable to provide geographically defined page-view estimates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, other Wikipedia metadata sources allow limiting the searches to a specific language, thus indirectly determining trends in Wikipedia topic views by certain countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Generous et al. used this approach to examine the accuracy of Wikipedia-based predictive models in detecting changes in DENV and noted low to very low model prediction error in detecting monthly WHO-reported case count changes in Thailand (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.86) and weekly case counts for Brazil (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.93), although the lack of spatial resolution makes Wikipedia-based VBD surveillance quite limited for public health practice [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, it is unclear what proportion of this model’s predictive ability was accounted for by Google searches directing users toward the Wikipedia website. Since this study was conducted, Wikipedia has changed WikipediaTrends metrics to exclude such search engine redirects [
