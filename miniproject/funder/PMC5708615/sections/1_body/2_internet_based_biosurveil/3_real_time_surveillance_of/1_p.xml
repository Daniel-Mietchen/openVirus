<p>Twitter is another promising large data source for VBD detection because user Tweets are geotagged to precise location, and an estimated 500 million daily Tweets are archived in real time [

In contrast with Google search logs, all Tweets are public, and extracting key Tweet words related to arboviruses has been explored as a method of VBD real-time detection. While Twitter does not aggregate normalized trends about specific Tweet terms, various application programming interfaces enable Twitter mining, and customized R packages allow the parsing of Twitter data in a biostatistical environment [

Tweets are often longer and have a more complex ontology than Google searches, so a variety of bioinformatic approaches have been required to dissect relevant terms from the corpus of a Tweet, thus posing a considerable technical challenge in using this data source. However, this also allows for capturing more personal Tweets, which would be more likely to represent true cases of a VBD rather than re-Tweets of a media or MoH announcement regarding disease activity. Aside from this, the concept of Twitter disease prediction is broadly similar to Google-based prediction, with time trends in Tweet volumes used as predictor terms in regression models that are fitted and validated against conventional-reference MoH DENV surveillance data. Such Twitter-based DENV models have been examined in Brazil, with two studies examining the performance of Twitter models in predicting DENV activity on a national and city scale against MoH data [

While the best performance of Twitter-based DENV surveillance was noted at a national aggregate scale (r = 0.98), and performance varied on finer spatial scales, Twitter does appear to offer remarkable spatial granularity. Souza et al. were able to track disease activity in locales as small as 100,000 persons. Importantly, the evaluation by Souza et al. also determined that disease incidence and population size generally influenced the accuracy of Twitter-based DENV surveillance on a city scale, although Twitter models still performed moderately well in some small-size and/or low-incidence cities. In their study, Gomide et al. also demonstrated how filtering Tweets to those specific to individual cases of DENV improved model performance [
