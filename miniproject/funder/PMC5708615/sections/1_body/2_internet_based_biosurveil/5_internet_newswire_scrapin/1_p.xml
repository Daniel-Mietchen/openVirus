<p>Informal reporting of epidemics and outbreaks through internet newswires has been demonstrated to be reasonably accurate and often more timely than official public health agency announcements [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The ProMed system was one of the earliest examples of scraping unstructured internet newswire data to rapidly detect outbreaks and epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The HealthMap project, launched in 2006, is an extension of this concept and provided an automated platform that offers outbreak and epidemic data signals scraped hourly from internet newswire feeds in addition to public health agency web alerts. In its current form, HealthMap draws data from four internet newswire streams (two English, two Chinese), the ProMed system, online official Eurosurveillance and WHO outbreak alerts, zoonosis outbreak databases, and the Geosentinel travel-illness network.

HealthMap therefore combines both conventional epidemiological and internet data streams in an automated, real-time fashion for a broad range of pathogens [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. HealthMap also contains a more recent and semicurated function allowing for “crowd-sourced” epidemic surveillance (“Outbreaks Near Me”), a concept similar to the
