<p>The performance of HealthMap in detecting DENV diffusion in the tropics was carefully evaluated by Hoen et al., who determined the sensitivity and specificity of HealthMap in detecting new DENV circulation in previously DENV-nonendemic regions in Latin America and used the CDC’s Yellow Book as a reference standard for DENV surveillance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Over a 1.5-year period, HealthMap detected new autochthonous spread of DENV, with an overall sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 85% when compared to the CDC reference. This study also indicated the promising granularity of automated newswire scraping surveillance systems like HealthMap, with the detection of new DENV epidemics on a provincial scale. HealthMap’s DengueMap, a collaboration with the CDC, offers such granular surveillance to public health and clinical end users, including estimates of regions at risk for DENV spread. During the ZIKV epidemic, HealthMap has offered similar granular detail about locales with ZIKV circulation [
