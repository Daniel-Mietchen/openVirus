<p>Beyond disease detection, internet newswire scraping has also been explored for rapid determination of epidemic model parameters and even modeling the effect of interventions to inform public health preparedness and decision-making early in the course of VBD epidemics. Such an approach was demonstrated as feasible during the 2010 Haiti cholera and 2014–2015 West Africa Ebola epidemics [

 <sub>0</sub>, predicted final outbreak size, and the duration of the ZIKV Colombia epidemic by using HealthMap data in conjunction with Google Trends time series data (for the search term “Zika”), the latter used to smooth incidence curves estimated by HealthMap data [

 <sub>o</sub> estimated from HealthMap and Google data overlapped with those estimated from formal MoH-reported ZIKV case counts. Digital data yielded similar estimates for the proportion of the susceptible population that would require vaccination, should a 100% efficacious vaccine have been developed before the end of the epidemic. This study made the point that important epidemic transmission parameters can be determined by using digital data alone should there be limited or no conventional surveillance infrastructure; however, it was unclear what proportion of HealthMap-measured ZIKV cases would be attributable to media reporting of Colombian MoH case counts or WHO case summaries.
