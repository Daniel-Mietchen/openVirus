<p>Taken together, Google-based DENV surveillance appears more accurate in the setting of (i) DENV endemicity, (ii) high burdens of disease (which may also lower the threshold for populations searching about DENV-related terms when experiencing a febrile syndrome), and (iii) climates characterized by seasonal high rainfall periods resulting in seasonal or semiseasonal peaks of disease. Its performance in nonendemic settings, such as the returning traveler to a nonendemic country, seems more limited, even in the context of high internet access. While there is some evidence that it is dependent on larger temporal and spatial scales, its performance has been shown to be excellent in a single hyperendemic city with a weekly temporal resolution [
