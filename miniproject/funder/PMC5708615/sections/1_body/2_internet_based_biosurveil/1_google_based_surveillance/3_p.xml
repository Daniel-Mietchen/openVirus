<p>This approach was soon extended to DENV with two independent, concurrent studies by Althouse et al. and Chan et al. [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Both groups fitted and validated Google search query-based DENV prediction models. Chan et al. presented a univariate prediction model (combining the search activity trends of multiple Google terms related to DENV), and Althouse et al. presented multivariate prediction models employing multiple model validation techniques. Model performance was good in both studies. Chan et al. noted their model performed well in Brazil (r = 0.99), India (r = 0.94), Singapore (r = 0.94), and Indonesia (r = 0.94) when comparing predicted DENV holdout time series data (that is, predicted trends of DENV on a prospective period of time not used for the fitting of the predictive model) to Ministry of Health (MoH) time series data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Althouse et al. found holdout correlations in Singapore (r = 0.93) and Bangkok (r = 0.88) by using a support vector machine model used to predict DENV outbreaks; Singapore and Bangkok showed areas under the receiver-operator curves ranging from 0.9 to 0.99. Notably, the model by Chan et al. performed most poorly in Bolivia (r = 0.83). While Bolivia’s internet access is less than Singapore’s, which may partly explain the difference in performance between these two countries, Bolivia has higher internet access than India and Indonesia [
