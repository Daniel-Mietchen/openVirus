<p>From the study by Chan et al., disease burden thus appeared to be a predictor of the accuracy of Google-based DENV surveillance. This was confirmed by Gluskin et al. in a study that modeled determinants of the same model’s accuracy in several diverse areas of Mexico [

An important finding of this study was that GDT’s performance often deteriorated with finer spatial resolution, that is, it often performed best when the model was applied on a national scale (all Mexico 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.91) versus the state level (with R
 <sup>2</sup> values as low as = 0.1, although performance in some states such as Chiapas was as high as R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.88). It was noted that those regions with less DENV burden (e.g., the state of Chihuahua) had worse GDT performance. Temperature and precipitation (which would support a strong seasonal trend of DENV cases) were also noted to be key predictors. Intriguingly, this correlation between climate and the performance of internet-based biosurveillance has been noted in tropical regions for influenza, with a suggestion that those tropical regions with less temperate cyclical influenza activity may experience worse performance of internet-based biosurveillance, partly because of less seasonal autocorrelation [
