<p>The estimated daily volume of Google searches exceeds 3.5 billion [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and such searches are logged with precise geolocation (by IP address; the IP addresses themselves are then purged and not retained) and time. From an “unbiased sample” of these searches, Google provides de-identified, normalized, region-specific trends in search activity via the Google Trends website [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For more common terms, this allows a weekly estimate of, e.g., the proportion of Google searches of the term “influenza” in a particular city in the United States relative to all Google searches in that week and location. Pioneering work by Ginsberg and Polgreen noted that trends in internet search terms about influenza were closely correlated with time series of influenza cases reported to public health agencies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This led to the development of Google Flu Trends in 2009, a customized bivariate logit model containing search activity time series of multiple distinct search terms related to influenza summed into a single predictive term, thus capturing the sensitivity and specificity for a range of Google search terms [
