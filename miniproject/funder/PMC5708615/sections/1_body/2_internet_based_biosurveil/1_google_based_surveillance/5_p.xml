<p>This dependence of Google-based DENV surveillance accuracy on DENV burden was further supported in a study by Milinovich et al. that noted a poorer performance of Google-based DENV prediction in Australia (

While Milinovich et al. only used a single Google search term to predict DENV activity, the discrepancy between internet access and performance of Google-based DENV surveillance may reflect the low incidence of DENV in Australia, which only experiences small local outbreaks in one state (Queensland) in addition to travel-imported cases [

This study also demonstrated a breakdown of predictive accuracy with finer spatial resolution, with poorer predictions in any one state compared to those based on Australia-wide aggregated data. Such a possible dependency of Google-based DENV surveillance on larger spatial scales is potentially concerning because, ultimately, public health action is taken locally and best guided by more granular surveillance data. However, as mentioned above, the models presented by Althouse et al. showed high predictive accuracy in two individual cities—Singapore and Bangkok—at weekly and monthly resolutions, respectively [
