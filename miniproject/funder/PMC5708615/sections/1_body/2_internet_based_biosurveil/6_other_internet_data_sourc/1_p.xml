<p>While Facebook is the third most visited website in the world, its data are generally less amenable to enhance communicable disease surveillance because of the lack of public access to much of the data [

As a result, this digital data stream has primarily been evaluated with respect to its potential to spread misinformation or clinically useful material rather than as an epidemic surveillance or prediction tool [

While this study had a very limited validation and the reference data set was difficult to reproduce (Skype-calling individual clinicians in conflict zones with deteriorating public health infrastructure to confirm whether leishmaniasis had been seen in regions where YouTube and Facebook posts indicated disease), the findings were nevertheless valuable for exploring a possible public health application of social media in a conflict zone.
