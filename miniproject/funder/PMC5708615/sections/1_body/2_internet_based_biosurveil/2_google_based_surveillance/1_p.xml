<p>Google search data have also been explored for enhancing the surveillance of several other arboviruses. As part of a scoping study to screen the suitability of Google-based surveillance for a range of pathogens, Milinovich et al. determined the correlation of Google search terms with monthly Australian MoH surveillance for endemic alphaviruses (Ross River virus [RRV] and Barmah Forest virus [BFV]), a nonendemic alphavirus (Chikungunya virus [CHIKV]), and a local neurotropic flavivirus (Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE]). While a robust external validation of a prediction model was not an aim of this study, it was notable that Google data performed best in the detection of arboviruses endemic in Australia (RRV, BFV, MVE) and worst for CHIKV, which had, to date, only been detected in travelers returning to Australia [

Intriguingly, there also appeared to be a better performance for the endemic alphaviruses that generally have a higher number of case counts, higher symptomatic attack rates, greater geographic distribution, and more regular seasonal variation in activity compared with MVE, which causes a very low proportion of notifiable and/or symptomatic cases and only sporadically causes outbreaks [

Such findings offer more evidence that Google-based surveillance is somewhat dependent on disease burden (which, in turn, likely prompts local population awareness of a particular arbovirus) and cyclical epidemiology. Importantly, Milinovich et al. examined the performance of Google-based surveillance of these pathogens on finer spatial scales and found that accuracy broadly deteriorated on a subnational scale.
