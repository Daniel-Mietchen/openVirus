<p>This narrative review leveraged a broader search review strategy developed for an ongoing systematic review and meta-analysis for internet-based biosurveillance of any pathogen. This original literature search used the MEDLINE (PubMed) database (as of February 2, 2016), in addition to EMBASE (as of February 4, 2016) and Web of Science (as of February 4, 2016). An example of the search ontology for MEDLINE is presented in the supplementary material. From these literature search results, we then restricted to those studies pertaining to the internet-based biosurveillance of any bacterial, viral, or parasitic VBD, with no restriction by country income status. To identify further digital disease literature relevant to the recent ZIKV pandemic, which emerged during and after the initial literature search, we also searched MEDLINE using the term “Zika” (current to February 2017). We also searched specific websites describing the characteristics of individual digital data sources, such as

While a structured evaluation of study quality was not undertaken for this narrative review, we did adopt aspects from a review by Nuti et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Althouse et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005871.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to identify key items of quality and usability to consider in each article reviewed, including the spatial and temporal scale of predictions, the public health relevance of the phenomenon predicted by the models, and whether or not the models were validated on a hold-out set of data (that is, on data not used to fit the model).
