  <title>Box 1. Critical areas of research to improve the transition of internet-based biosurveillance into surveillance and control operations for VBDs</title>
  <list list-type="bullet">
   <list-item>
    <p>Meta-analysis of all published studies that have validated digital disease detection methods against reference public health data to determine the best estimates of accuracy of internet-based VBD surveillance by pathogen type, country income, internet access, and pathogen epidemiology.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Implementation science studies to identify which sorts of digital data streams have actually been used during VBD epidemics, how they were used, and whether their timeliness had an impact on outbreak or epidemic control.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Qualitative measurement of public health end user perceptions and sentiment regarding what features of digital disease detection systems are more important for practical use in VBD control, whether the systems are felt to be trustworthy, and how they would consider using them in VBD control.</p>
