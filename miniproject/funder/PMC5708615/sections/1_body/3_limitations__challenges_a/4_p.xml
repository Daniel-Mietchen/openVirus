<p>Another key limitation to internet-based VBD surveillance has been the typical use of a Pearson correlation coefficient as a measure of instrument validity. While this does allow some kind of standardized comparison between the different types of data and would allow a valuable meta-analysis that could explore determinants of internet-based VBD surveillance performance, the Pearson correlation coefficient is highly prone to influential data points, makes an assumption that time series data points for communicable disease case counts are independent, and may be of limited use to public health end users who may be more interested in the early detection and prediction of VBD epidemic onset, epidemic peak, R
 <sub>0</sub>, total epidemic size, and other more practice-orientated quantitative surveillance goals [
