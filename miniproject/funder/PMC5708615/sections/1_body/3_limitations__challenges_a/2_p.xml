<p>Yet despite these promising examples, internet-based VBD surveillance arguably faces an unclear future in public health and clinical medicine. Despite over five years of academic publications, which often claim the importance of real-time digital data for VBD surveillance, and valuable conceptual frameworks, which suggest how digital data streams can be integrated into public health practice, there are little published data—to our knowledge—that have indicated how these novel forms of surveillance have actually been used in public health response or clinical medicine nor what measurable impact they have had on epidemic control or clinical care. Redressing this dearth of implementation science for these novel forms of VBD surveillance should be a core priority for this field (
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pntd.0005871.box001">Box 1</xref>), particularly because feedback from end users of these methods would be invaluable for improving the development of future novel digital epidemiological tools for these and other pathogens and could form the backbone of a roadmap to implement these new technologies into public health practice across a range of settings. For example, we do not know if end users find the trade-off between accuracy and timeliness of internet data streams an acceptable one. Moreover, it is unclear if such end users find methods validated at coarse spatial or temporal scales at all useful for public health practice and whether they completely trust studies which have only externally validated the performance of predictive models over a short period of time (if at all), particularly given the important lessons learned regarding the deteriorating performance of Google Flu Trends over several years [

An evaluation of end users of an influenza A/H5N1 web-based expert epidemic intelligence system indicated that sensitivity and timeliness were perceived as the more important aspects of this type of internet-based zoonotic influenza surveillance approach, and similar efforts could be extended to end users of internet-based VBD surveillance methods [
