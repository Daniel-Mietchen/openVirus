<p>When considering the future role of internet big data in enhancing VBD surveillance and control, it is important to recognize that the developers of these digital surveillance methods have long cautioned that they are designed to augment rather than replace conventional surveillance data [

Along these lines, another promising opportunity is the use of internet data streams as a measurement of human behavior rather than as a proxy for disease incidence itself. A recent effort to clarify the drivers of the spatiotemporal dynamics the 2014 CHIKV outbreak in Martinique used just such an approach by using Twitter to measure local awareness and interest in protection against CHIKV, thereby allowing an evaluation of how such factors impact on the spread of this virus [
