<p>The putative advantages of internet data for communicable disease surveillance are clear; namely, these data are free, fast, and may offer valuable surveillance signals in regions with limited conventional surveillance infrastructure and rising internet access. Such regions generally experience the brunt of VBD, although it is worth emphasizing that internet access may vary considerably between and within countries with high burdens of VBD [

The widespread use of HealthMap by international public health agencies, the partnership between the CDC and HealthMap’s DengueMap, the recent integration of internet-based DENV prediction platforms into broad nongovernmental organization (NGO) DENV initiatives [

A recent pilot evaluation of US communicable disease surveillance professionals indicated that the majority were looking for new data sources to inform public health decision-making, and more specifically, that the majority found internet search and media scraping as moderately useful for early outbreak situational awareness [
