   <bold>a-c</bold>. Network graphs of three hypothetical models: 4a) Hypothetical network constructed from structural elements of Kaokoveld network representing the five main regions and their mixing dynamics. Structures were simplified so that no regional subcomponents had any ties between them at T
   <sub>0</sub>. 4b) Hypothetical network from (4a) with 3% more ties between the subcomponents, all added at random. 4c) Hypothetical network from (4b) with 2% more ties (5% more than (4a)) between the subcomponents, all added at random.
