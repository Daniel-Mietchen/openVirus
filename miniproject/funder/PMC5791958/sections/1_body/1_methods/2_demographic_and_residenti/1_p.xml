<p>All participants completed a survey that included questions about demographics, location of current residence, and current sexual partnerships. Because of the high mobility of Kaokoveld residents, people’s “home” village (where they have longstanding familial or marital ties) are not always where they most recently resided; however, we were able to triangulate participants’ answers about their home villages with data regarding recent travel and time spent in non-home villages to ensure we were recording each participants’ main current residence. Villages fall into one of several locally recognized and delineated regions and, for each home village, we recorded its corresponding region. Because there were so many home villages represented in our dataset (&gt;100) relative to our participant sample size, and because sample size per village was highly variable (range: 1–65), we analyzed participant location at the region level. The majority of study participants (n = 391) named home villages in one of five local Kaokoveld regions—Marienfluss (n = 51), Ozosemo (n = 91), Omaanda (n = 104), Ehama (n = 84), and Omunjandu (n = 61). Twenty-eight participants either lived in outside regions (including Angola, Kaokoveld peripheries, or outside of Kaokoveld, n = 18) or in one of the four Kaokoveld urban settlements (Opuwo, Okanguati, Epupa, Etanga, n = 10).</p>
