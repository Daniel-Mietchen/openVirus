<p>We asked participants to tell us the names of all people with whom they had had vaginal intercourse in the past six months, each partner’s home village, the last time they had sex, and the name of their partner’s spouse (if applicable). Because concurrency and extramarital sexual partnerships are broadly culturally acceptable in Kaokoveld, participants were generally forthcoming about their recent sexual partners. We detected some underreporting from women, especially married women, but given the detail of questions about participants’ sex partners, it was difficult for participants to exaggerate their partner numbers.</p>
