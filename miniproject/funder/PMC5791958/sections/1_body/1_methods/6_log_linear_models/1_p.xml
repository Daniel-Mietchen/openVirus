<p>We fit a series of log-linear models to test our predictions about the relationship between HSV-2 prevalence and variable sexual mixing patterns in Kaokoveld. Log-linear models allow us to explore the impact of partner-selection at a higher level of complexity than more commonly used preferred-mixing models. Although preferred mixing includes a term for in-group preference (i.e., the proportion of partners of people from group 
 <italic>i</italic> who are also from group 
 <italic>i</italic>), it also assumes that all other partners (from groups 
 <italic>j</italic>) are selected proportionally [

While we know that people in Kaokoveld are overwhelmingly more likely to select sex partners from nearby geographic areas (i.e., geographic partner homophily is high in all regions), we suspect that variability in both homophily and heterophily influence transmission dynamics of HSV-2. In contrast to preferred mixing, log-linear models allow us to estimate heterogeneity in selective mixing across subpopulations (e.g., different regions in Kaokoveld) from a mixing matrix (
