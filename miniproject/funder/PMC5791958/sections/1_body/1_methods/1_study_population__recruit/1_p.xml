<p>In 2009, we conducted eight months of field-based interviews and HSV-2 diagnostics in 28 villages in Kaokoveld, Namibia. Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited any sexually active, culturally recognized adult residing in Kaokoveld at the time of study. Because most villages in Kaokoveld have a small number of people in residence at any one time (&lt;50 adults), we used convenience sampling and interviewed all present adults who were willing to participate (N = 446; 213 women, 233 men). Twenty-seven participants were removed from the analyses because they either had an inconclusive HSV-2 test (n = 25) or refused the HSV-2 test (n = 2); thus our sample size for analyses was 419 (200 women, 219 men). Although we aimed to have equal numbers of participants in each age category (≤25 years, 26–35 years, 36–45 years, ≥46 years), 68% and 60% of our female and male samples, respectively, was made up of participants in the younger two age categories. However, the age distributions of participants were not significantly different by data-collection location; thus, our region-based analyses are not biased by differences in the samples’ age structures. Because HSV-2 is neither stigmatized nor consistently understood as a viral STI by the study community, we have no reason to think that our sample is biased by people’s perception of their HSV-2 status.</p>
