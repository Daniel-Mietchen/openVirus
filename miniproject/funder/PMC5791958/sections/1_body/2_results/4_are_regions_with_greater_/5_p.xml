<p>Omunjandu is more centrally located than either the Marienfluss or Ozosemo, and actually sits between Omaanda and Ehama. And, although Omunjandu had the lowest degree of within-region mobility and sexual-partner homophily of the three remote regions, it also had the highest HSV-2 prevalence (48%). Furthermore, Omunjandu’s coefficients for differential within-region mobility and homophily were similar, though larger, than Ehama’s. While our log-linear results for differential mobility and homophily were significant for all regions, including Ehama and Omunjandu, the stark differences in HSV-2 prevalence between the regions may be due to an insignificant difference in the age structure of the samples we collected in Ehama and Omunjandu. Our sample in Ehama contained a larger number of members of the youngest age group (≤25 years old) than Omunjandu, which contained a larger number of members of the oldest age group (≥45 years old). Consistent with most epidemiologic investigations of HSV-2 prevalence [

Although our data indicate that older people in Kaokoveld travel less (participants ≤35 years old reported 823 total trips while those ≥35 years old reported 458 total trips), they are not more likely to restrict their travel to local destinations. Furthermore, although the age-group difference between regions in our sample was not significant (
