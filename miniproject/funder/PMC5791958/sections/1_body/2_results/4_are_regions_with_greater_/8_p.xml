<p>To demonstrate the epidemiological effects of bridging in highly homophilous networks, we simulated a simple viral STI epidemic on a set of hypothetical heterosexual network models with structural and mixing features mimicking those in our Kaokoveld dataset. The graph in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g004">Fig 4a</xref> is composed of five distinct network subcomponents that approximately represent the differential homophily and heterophily of the five main Kaokoveld regions. The subcomponents all include heterophilous contacts but no connections are permitted between the subcomponents at the initial T = 0. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g004">Fig 4b and 4c</xref> show the same structures as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g004">Fig 4a</xref>, except we rewired them to include 3% and 5% more random ties, respectively, across the subcomponents. Although preference for ties between homophilous nodes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g004">Fig 4b &amp; 4c</xref> are clearly still dominant, even modest amounts of bridging can erode boundaries between subcomponents.
