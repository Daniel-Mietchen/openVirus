<p>Thus far, we have discussed how our empirical work in Kaokoveld helps us understand very localized transmission dynamics of HSV-2, an endemic, largely low-morbidity viral STI. However, even highly remote rural communities like those of the Kaokoveld pastoralists are not social or epidemiologic islands. There is mobility in and out of Kaokoveld from other parts of rural Namibia and Angola, with growing evidence that rural-urban mobility is becoming increasingly common [

 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but increased exposure and changing ecology and social mores may eventually erode those taboos. More immediately, however, these emerging mobility patterns could foster more contact between heterophilous community members because increased urban movement, made possible by vehicular travel, could increase sexual-partnership formation between rural-living people when visiting urban locales.
