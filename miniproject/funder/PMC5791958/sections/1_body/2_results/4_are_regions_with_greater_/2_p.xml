<p>Given our assertion that higher proportions of within-region mobility indicates geographic isolation and limited access to outer areas, these three regions appear to be the most functionally remote in our dataset. The Marienfluss (42%), Ozosemo (39%), and Omunjandu (48%) are also the regions with the highest HSV-2 prevalences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g002">Fig 2</xref>), further suggesting that remoteness is at least partially associated with high HSV-2 prevalence. In our sample, HSV-2 prevalence was 50% among participants who resided in urbanized towns of Kaokoveld (Opuwo, Okanguati, Epupa, Etanga), but the sample size was extremely small (n = 10) and unlikely to accurately reflect urban prevalence.
