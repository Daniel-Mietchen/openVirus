<p>When we simulated these networks to form and dissolve ties over time with a very simplistic HSV-2-like epidemic dynamic running over the tie-formation and tie-dissolution models, the virus spread faster and reached more elements of the whole network as bridging across subcomponents increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g005">Fig 5a–5c</xref>). In the least connected network (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g004">4a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191168.g005">5a</xref>), the virus spreads completely throughout a single subcomponent but the nodes in all the other structures of the network mostly remain susceptible. As we increased connectivity, the virus spread faster and further—overwhelming another giant subcomponent (
