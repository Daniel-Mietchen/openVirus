<p>Compared with the Marienfluss, Ozosemo is more proximately located to its closest urban center (Epupa) and adjacent regions, but a gravel road that functions as the main artery for vehicle travel across Kaokoveld separates Ozosemo from the Marienfluss, Ehama, Omaanda, and Omunjandu. This fact does not functionally impede movement between the regions but may reflect a longstanding separateness. According to participant responses to our mobility questions, participants living in the Marienfluss, Ehama, Omaanda, and Omunjandu traveled to the urban areas of Okanguati, Opuwo, or Etanga for clinic care, livestock trading, and other economic or social purposes, while only Ozosemo residents primarily traveled to Epupa for these purposes. Partner homophily in Ozosemo was lower than in the Marienfluss (0.71 and 0.9, respectively), but Ozosemo and the Marienfluss were similar in that, compared to the other regions, they drew non-homophilous partners from the smallest range of external areas (

Additionally, Ozosemo had the second lowest percentage of wealthy herd owners in our dataset, after the Marienfluss. Thus, further work in this area should explore the relationship between poverty and remoteness, even within seemingly homogenous communities.
