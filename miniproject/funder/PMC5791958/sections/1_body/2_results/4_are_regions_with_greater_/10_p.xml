<p>Robust models of HSV-2 dynamics account for the virus’s dormancy periods and variable shedding rates, and they also consider other host biological characteristics (e.g., prevalence of HSV-1, partner sero-discordance rate), all of which prevent real-world endemic HSV-2 from completely saturating a population [

However, since we lack necessary data from Kaokoveld for more precise HSV-2 modeling, we modeled a simple viral STI that has very low per-act transmissibility (1.2%) but also has lifelong infectiousness (i.e. a susceptible-infected, or SI, model). Given enough time, simple SI models always reach 100% prevalence, so we focus, not on the equilibrium points, but on the progression of the epidemic after 250 time steps (~eight months; approximately the earliest time step at which equilibrium is approached in the three models). The epidemic moves faster with increasing subcomponent bridging (
