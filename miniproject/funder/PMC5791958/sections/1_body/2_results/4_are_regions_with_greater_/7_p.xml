<p>We argue that heterophilous bridging is particularly epidemiologically significant when it involves densely connected small networks, such as in Kaokoveld, which allow for accelerated disease transmission on a local scale. Increasing contact bridges between dense networks may result in locally amplified viral transmission that can pulse out (or back in) on a broader geographic scale, especially when bridges form with populations with high proportions of susceptible people. Rural communities undergoing ecological or subsistence changes, particularly in ways that affect mobility and social contact structures, are important to this dynamic: they can be the source of epidemic acceleration and importation to newly contacted communities or they can be the recipients of newly imported pathogens, which, upon entry into small highly connected sexual networks, can spread rapidly.</p>
