<p>The Marienfluss is both remote and distant. By Euclidean distance, Marienfluss villages are ~170km from the regionâ€™s most common urban destination, Opuwo, which, despite being the farthest urban area from the Marienfluss, has the most traversable route throughout the year. Furthermore, the Marienfluss population is among the poorest in Kaokoveld, with none of the Marienfluss participants interviewed having a large enough herd to qualify as wealthy by local standards (&gt;50 cows or &gt;100 goats; our unpublished data from unstructured interviews with local informants in 2009). In fact, very few Marienfluss participants had any livestock at all (n = 8 out of 53). Thus, people in the Marienfluss have less money (e.g., to pay hitchhiking fees) and fewer reasons (e.g., to sell/trade cattle) to travel long distances. The relatively higher poverty in the Marienfluss could be exacerbating the effects of remoteness; thus, simultaneously increasing constraints on partner selection and further disadvantaging people from accessing treatment.</p>
