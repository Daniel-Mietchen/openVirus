<p>To answer this question, we first needed to determine whether there was meaningful variation in the functional remoteness of the Kaokoveld regions. We ran a set of log-linear models to assess variation in mobility between the regions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191168.t005">Table 5</xref>). We found that within-region mobility was common overall, but that geographic mixing varied significantly by region. The regions with the highest proportion of within-region mobility were the Marienfluss, Ozosemo, and Omunjandu, with the Marienfluss and Ozosemo having the highest degree of homophilous mobility.
