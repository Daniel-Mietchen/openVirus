<p>We ran a set of log-linear models and found that the model accounting for differential homophily (i.e., where homophily varies by region, according to the mixing matrix; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191168.t002">Table 2</xref>) is the best fit (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191168.t004">Table 4</xref>). The Marienfluss (e
 <sup>5.951</sup> = 384.1), Ozosemo (e
 <sup>3.693</sup> = 40.2), and Omunjandu (e
 <sup>3.031</sup> = 20.7) have the highest proportions of geographic homophily in sexual-partner selection compared with ranges of the coefficient exponents from Omaanda, Ehama, other regions, and Kaokoveld cities, which range from 3.9â€“14.9. Among our five sampled regions, the Marienfluss, Ozosemo, and Omunjandu also have the highest HSV-2 prevalences.
