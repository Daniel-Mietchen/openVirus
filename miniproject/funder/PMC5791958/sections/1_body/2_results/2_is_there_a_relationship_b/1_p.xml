<p>Using a univariate logistic regression model, we found a mildly significant relationship between individuals’ proportion of homophilous sexual partners and having HSV-2 (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.04–3.13; p = 0.04). This weakly significant result indicates that, while high degrees of homophilous partnering accounts for some of the HSV-2 risk in Kaokoveld, other factors may be important as well. Also, the drivers of homophily may not be uniform across Kaokoveld; geographic homophily sometimes indicate cultural, familial, or personal preference, while in other cases, homophily indicates constraints on partner access and availability. Kaokoveld is diverse in its terrain and ecological characteristics but, overall, Kaokoveld could be described as remote, with some areas being more traversable than others, so that people in some areas may be less restricted by geography than others. It is also worth noting that the average number of partners over a six-month period also varies by region (
