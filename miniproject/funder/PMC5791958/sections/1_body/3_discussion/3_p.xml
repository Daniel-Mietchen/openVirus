<p>In remote communities with high HSV-2 prevalence, small population size, densely connected sex networks, and low access to potential partners in other networks, people who are selecting new partners are more likely to select someone who is seropositive than someone who is selecting from a potentially larger pool. Even with higher contact rates (e.g., Omaanda (2.9) vs. Marienfluss (1.9), 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191168.t003">Table 3</xref>), having a more heterophilous partner pool may increase the likelihood of selecting a seronegative partner. In fact, the average number of current partners (over the previous six months) was lowest among participants from the Marienfluss and Ozosemo, the two regions with the highest partner homophily. Thus, even though the individual-level behavior of people in the high-prevalence regions was less risky, because of the effects of remoteness (more homophilous mixing, smaller and denser sexual networks), people living in these regions were embedded in riskier networks.
