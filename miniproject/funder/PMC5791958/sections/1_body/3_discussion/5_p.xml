<p>What we are observing in Kaokoveld is that, one’s network, as opposed to their personal behavior, is the primary source of relative viral STI risk, which is a structural type of risk that is not unique to Kaokoveld or even remote subsistence-living people. In Kaokoveld, where concurrency is culturally acceptable and broadly practiced, remoteness constrains partner choice. We can compare the geographic constraints in Kaokoveld to different constraining phenomena in the United States where African-American women have a statistically-indistinguishable number of sexual partners from white women and are often less likely to be involved in risky sexual behavior than white women, yet they contract STIs at much higher rates. This is because, despite the fact that the behavior among African-American women is no more risky than that of other American women, they are more likely to have partners with riskier behavior [

The risky networks in which African-American women are embedded are analogous to those in Kaokoveld; however, in contrast to remote-living women in Kaokoveld, African-American women are not constrained by landscape but, rather, they experience greater social, economic, and institutional remoteness than other American women [
