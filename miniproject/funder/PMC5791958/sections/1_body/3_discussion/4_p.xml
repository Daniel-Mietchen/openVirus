<p>In circumstances with modest partner concurrency, having fewer concurrent partners may increase the per-act contact rate for a given partnership, which, when one of those partners is seropositive, would increase the likelihood of HSV-2 transmission between that partner set. The HSV-2 per-act transmission rate is very low (&lt;3% [
