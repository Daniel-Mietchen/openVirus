<p>We see relevant parallels between the network structures underlying HIV spread across sub-Saharan Africa and present structures in Kaokoveld which are subject to change in response to rapidly changing economic, social, and ecological environments. The HIV pandemic that swept across eastern [

 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] spread through major labor migration routes (e.g., long-haul truckers and miners) and amplified in the small local networks of rural settlements. Among some of the first studies that investigated the transmission pathways of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, Bwayo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] identified long-haul truckers in Kenya as a high-risk or “core” group, and that, among truckers surveyed in Kenya, seroprevalence increased with distance traveled. Extremely high HIV prevalence was also common among female sex-workers (e.g., 76% seroprevalence among barmaids in Uganda) who serviced long-haul truckers in East Africa [

Among high-risk groups in South Africa, Ramjee et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] found that the female partners of migrant workers, including long-haul truckers, were more likely than the partners of non-migrant workers to take additional partners when their spouses were gone, leading to increased density of small local networks and accelerated local HIV spread.
