<p>Our network simulations show that, when coupled with strong in-group preferences, very small increases in out-group contact can have powerful impacts on epidemic dynamics in small remote populations. Despite the fact that travel is still mostly rural in Kaokoveld, access to urban areas has increased with greater presence of automobiles. Furthermore, urban populations are not only growing but are increasingly populated by people settling from outside Kaokoveld. Population growth for Opuwo, the capital city of the Kunene district and the largest urban center of Kaokoveld, was over 4% between 2001–2011, which is greater than the growth in Namibia’s two largest cities (Windhoek, Oshakati) and twice as much as growth for the entire Kunene district [

Kaokoveld is within the Kunene province, which has one of the lowest HIV prevalences in Namibia, but the other provinces along Namibia’s northern boarder, Oshana, Ohangwena, and Omusati, have among the highest HIV prevalences and some of the densest populations in Namibia [

These changing population and mobility dynamics might not break up the clusters in the Kaokoveld networks, especially in highly remote and homophilous areas, but initial mobility changes may lead to more bridges into those networks, increasing the likelihood of HIV importation or the spread of more virulent strains of endemic diseases (e.g., resistant gonorrhea).
