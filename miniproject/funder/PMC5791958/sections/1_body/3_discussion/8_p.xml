<p>The type of commerce and mobility that fostered HIV spread across broad regions of sub-Saharan Africa are not present in northwestern Namibia or many other remote rural areas of Africa. However, climate-change-induced alterations to local ecologies, in conjunction with increased urbanization, may have big impacts on rural livelihoods, especially for subsistence-living people. We warn that, along with alterations to transmission pathways that increase exposure, remote communities could see importation of novel STIs, and their densely connected networks of high proportions of susceptible people would foster rapid epidemic spread. Current HSV-2 transmission trends may serve as a bellwether for potential HIV spread into Kaokoveld from the high HIV prevalence and densely populated adjacent districts. There is also evidence that, in rural sub-Saharan African communities with high HIV prevalence, ecological shocks (e.g., decreased rainfall) drive household economic decisions that lead to increased HIV transmission [

Drought intensification will force ecological and economic adaptations for many rural living Africans; we cannot ignore the fact that such adaptations can dramatically alter sexual and support networks in ways that increase STI exposure—including but not limited to HSV-2—among communities who already struggle for lack of access to preventive care and treatment.
