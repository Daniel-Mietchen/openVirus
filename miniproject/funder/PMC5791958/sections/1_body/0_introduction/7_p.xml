<p>While a high overall prevalence was not a surprising finding, given the cultural acceptability of concurrency (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191168.t001">Table 1</xref>), significant geographic heterogeneity in prevalence was unexpected because pastoralist mobility coupled with very high prevalence would be expected to result in widespread transmission across the community in a way that would reduce heterogeneity. The variance in prevalence was not explained by urban proximity; in fact, qualitatively, it appeared that the regions with the highest HSV-2 prevalence were actually far away from urban areas or other regions [
