<p>Delivering effective healthcare to rural areas is difficult for many reasons [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Rural, and particularly, remotely-living people are often far from healthcare facilities, which are concentrated in urban areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], making essential components of primary healthcare hard to access, leading to significant health disparities between rural- and urban-living people [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Contributing to the problem of access, remote communities are often sparsely populated. Healthcare improvements for small populations have modest impacts on public-health objectives, which de-incentivizes investing in improved access [

 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Because of the particular implications remoteness has for human health, due to high subsistence mobility, indigeneity, and cultural isolation [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], it has been suggested that remoteness be considered as a distinct condition and not solely a secondary characteristic of rural living [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, remoteness exacerbates the challenges presented by high-mobility livelihoods to identify infection “hot-spots,” estimate disease burden, provide treatment (including longterm management of incurable viral STIs), and conduct contact tracing and other infection-control measures, such as vaccination [
