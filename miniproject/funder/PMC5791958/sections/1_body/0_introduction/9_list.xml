  <p>At the individual level, is there a relationship between having a higher proportion of partners from one’s residential region (partner homophily) and having HSV-2-specific antibodies? Are people who have a higher proportion of geographically homophilous partners more likely to have HSV-2?</p>

  <p>If there is a relationship between homophily and HSV-2 positivity at the individual level, does the relationship hold at the regional level? Are the overall reported sexual contacts by people of some regions more likely to be homophilous than others?</p>

  <p>If we say a region is 
   <italic>functionally</italic> remote, we are saying that some factor other than simple distance prevents residents of that region from accessing the landscape, resources, and people of other regions, and we should be able to see the effect of that in people’s travel patterns. Thus, we ask: are people from regions with higher degrees of partner homophily also more likely to travel to destinations (villages, cattleposts) within their own region (geographic homophily)?
