<p>Because of the important link between social strategies and ecological behavior, we argue that STI burden should be understood, at least in part, as an environmental health problem, particularly in remote subsistence communities. Despite the high variation among bacterial and viral STIs with regard to epidemic dynamics, both are a major source of disease burden in many remote sub-Saharan African communities [

In addition to the challenge of providing testing and treatment in remote settings that could reduce infection duration (curable bacterial infections), infectiousness (incurable viral infections), and incidence, concurrency of sexual partnerships is common, traditional, and strategically advantageous in remote populations with high subsistence mobility [

 <sub>t</sub>) of HIV, which, like herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), has a very low per-act transmission probability [
