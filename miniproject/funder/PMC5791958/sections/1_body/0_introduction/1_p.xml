<p>Rural communities suffer disproportionately from the global infectious disease burden [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While infectious disease is still the major cause of mortality in urban and rural sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the majority of the infectious diseases of poverty are suffered by the rural poor in developing countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) make up an important portion of this burden [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and complications from untreated non-HIV STIs are among the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality among rural women [
 <xref rid="pone.0191168.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], indicating that STI treatment for these communities is neither adequate nor timely.
