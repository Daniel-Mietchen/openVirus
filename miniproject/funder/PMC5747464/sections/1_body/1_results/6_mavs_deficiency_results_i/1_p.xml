<p>Our experiments indicated that the nsP1 mutant virus is more sensitive to monocyte-mediated antiviral effects, that monocytes express type I IFN in response to RRV infection, and that the induction of type I IFN in monocytes during RRV infection occurs via a MAVS-dependent mechanism. Based on these data, we hypothesized that viral loads in tissues would be equivalent in RRV-T48 and RRV-T48-nsP1
