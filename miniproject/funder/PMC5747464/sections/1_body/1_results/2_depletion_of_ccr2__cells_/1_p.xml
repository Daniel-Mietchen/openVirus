<p>To assess whether depletion of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> cells rescues viral loads of the attenuated nsP1 mutant virus, WT and CCR2-DTR mice were administered DT as described above, inoculated with RRV-T48 or RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>, and viral loads in skeletal muscle tissue at 5 dpi were quantified by qRT-PCR. Consistent with our previous findings [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected WT mice at 5 dpi were reduced compared with RRV-T48-infected mice (9-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic>, &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Compared with viral RNA levels in RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected WT mice, viral RNA levels in the skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected CCR2-DTR mice were increased (28-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic>, &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and were similar to viral RNA levels detected in the skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-infected CCR2-DTR mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similarly, the amount of viral RNA in the ankle joint of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected CCR2-DTR mice was increased (4-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic>, &lt; 0.001) compared with the amount of viral RNA in the ankle of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), suggesting that the nsP1 mutant virus also is more sensitive to monocyte-mediated control in this tissue. CCR2-DTR mice infected with either virus also had increased viral loads in the serum at this time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), further supporting an important role for CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> cells in the control of RRV infection. In addition, RRV-T48 and RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected CCR2-DTR mice displayed a marked defect in weight gain over the course of 5 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Importantly, this effect was specific to RRV-infected DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice, as age-matched na√Øve CCR2-DTR mice administered DT in a similar manner did not exhibit the same defect in weight gain (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). To confirm a role for inflammatory monocytes in protection, enriched bone marrow Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) were adoptively transferred into DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice 1 h prior to infection with RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue at 5 dpi in these mice were similar to the viral RNA levels detected in RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected WT mice. In addition, adoptive transfer of enriched bone marrow Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes into DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice reversed the marked defect in weight gain observed in RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected CCR2-DTR mice that did not receive monocytes (
