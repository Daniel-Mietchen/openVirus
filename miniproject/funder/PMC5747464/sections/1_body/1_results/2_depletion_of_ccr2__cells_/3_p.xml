<p>As both Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes and NK cells are depleted when CCR2-DTR mice are treated with DT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we assessed whether depletion of NK cells alone would enhance viral loads in RRV-T48 or RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected mice. Administration of an anti-NK1.1 depleting antibody at one day prior and two days after virus inoculation effectively depleted NK cells (NK1.1
 <sup>+</sup>CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>Ly6C
 <sup>-</sup>CD3Îµ
 <sup>-</sup>) in the blood (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) but did not diminish the frequency of Ly6G
 <sup>+</sup> neutrophils (Ly6G
 <sup>+</sup>CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>CD43
 <sup>lo</sup>Ly6C
 <sup>+</sup>) or Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes (Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup>CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>CD43
 <sup>+</sup>Ly6G
 <sup>-</sup>) in the blood (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Consistent with our previous results [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], depletion of NK cells had no effect on the amount of viral RNA detected in skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48- or RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) or weight gain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In contrast, administration of an anti-Gr1 antibody effectively depleted Ly6G
 <sup>+</sup> neutrophils and reduced the frequency of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). We detected increased viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected mice treated with the anti-Gr1 antibody compared with control antibody-treated mice (3-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Similar to DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice, in which we observed depletion of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes but not neutrophils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g001">Fig 1</xref>), administration of anti-Gr1 antibody resulted in significantly reduced weight gain of RRV-T48 and RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected mice compared with mice treated with a control antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The effects of the anti-Gr1 antibody treatment on viral loads in the skeletal muscle of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected mice and weight gain was less pronounced than observed in DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice and was associated with a less robust depletion of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) compared with DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting that a more complete depletion of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes is required to fully enhance the pathogenicity of the attenuated RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup> mutant virus. To evaluate the extent to which depletion of neutrophils contributed to the effects of anti-Gr1 antibody treatment on viral loads and weight gain, mice were administered anti-Ly6G antibody. Treatment with anti-Ly6G antibody resulted in robust depletion of neutrophils, but not monocytes or NK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). However, anti-Ly6G antibody did not affect viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) or weight gain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), suggesting that the effect of anti-Gr1 antibody treatment on viral loads and weight gain was due to the depletion of monocytes. These data further suggest that monocytes play an antiviral role during acute RRV infection.
