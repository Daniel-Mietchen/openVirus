<p>To evaluate whether the effects of depletion of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> cells on RRV infection are independent of T or B cells, we bred the CCR2-DTR transgene onto the 
 <italic>Rag1</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup> C57BL/6 background. 
 <italic>Rag1</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with or without the CCR2-DTR allele were treated with DT in the same manner and assessed at 5 dpi for effects on viral loads in skeletal muscle tissue and for effects on weight gain. Consistent with our previous findings [

 <italic>Rag1</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice at 5 dpi were reduced compared with RRV-T48-infected

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (10-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic>, &lt; 0.001) (

 <sup>-/-</sup>;CCR2-DTR mice were elevated compared with viral RNA levels in the skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-nsP1

 <sup>-/-</sup> littermates (8-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic>, &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) and were similar to viral RNA levels detected in the skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-infected 
 <italic>Rag1</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup> and 
 <italic>Rag1</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup>;CCR2-DTR mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). RRV-T48 and RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected 
 <italic>Rag1</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup>;CCR2-DTR mice also displayed a marked defect in weight gain during the 5 day study (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that the effects of depletion of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> cells on disease severity and viral burdens during RRV infection occurs independently of any potential effects, direct or indirect, on T and B cell responses.
