<p>We next assessed whether depletion of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> cells affected virus-induced disease severity or viral burdens at later times post-infection. For these experiments, WT and CCR2-DTR mice were administered DT at day -1 and day +2 relative to virus inoculation and mice were monitored for 10 days, the peak of the acute disease phase [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], for effects on weight gain and for the development of virus-induced musculoskeletal disease signs. CCR2-DTR mice infected with either virus displayed reduced weight gain compared with virus-infected WT mice (

 <sup>6M</sup>-infected CCR2-DTR mice developed more severe defects in hind limb gripping ability and gait compared with RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), and these disease signs were similar in severity to those detected in RRV-T48-infected WT mice. Furthermore, despite being a full 8 days after the last administration of DT, viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected CCR2-DTR mice were increased compared with viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected WT mice (5-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic>, &lt; 0.01) and similar to viral RNA levels detected in mice infected with RRV-T48 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These data suggest that early depletion of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes during RRV infection results in a lasting impact on disease severity and virus control. Collectively, our findings suggest that the nsP1 mutant virus is more sensitive to the antiviral effects of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes, and that in the absence of these cells this mutant virus has a similar capacity to infect and cause disease as the WT virus.
