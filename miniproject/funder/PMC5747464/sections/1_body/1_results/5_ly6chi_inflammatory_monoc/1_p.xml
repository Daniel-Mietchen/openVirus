<p>Given that Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes express type I IFN in an IRF3/IRF7-dependent manner in response to co-culture with RRV-infected cells, we next assessed whether monocytes express 
 <italic>Irf7</italic> and/or type I IFN during infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. WT C57BL/6 mice were mock-infected or infected with either RRV-T48 or RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>, and Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes were enriched by FACS-sorting cells from the blood and the muscle tissue (RRV-infected mice only) at 5 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref>). As an additional control, Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes were enriched from the bone marrow of mock-infected mice. In order to recover a sufficient number of monocytes via FACS sorting, tissues from 3 mice per group were combined into a single sample, and the experiment was performed twice. Total RNA was isolated from the sorted cells and analyzed by qRT-PCR for expression of murine type I IFN genes and 
 <italic>Irf7</italic>. The expression of IFNβ, IFNα4, and IFNα2 were not detected in cells sorted from RRV-infected mice above levels detected in cells from mock-infected mice. Given that type I IFN mRNAs are tightly regulated [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and that IRF7 has been reported to function as the main transcription factor driving type I IFN production during CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], we analyzed expression of 
 <italic>Irf7</italic> in the sorted cells. Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes FACS-sorted from the blood and the muscle tissue of mice infected with either virus had higher levels of 
 <italic>Irf7</italic> gene expression compared with monocytes from mock-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). These data suggest that 
 <italic>Irf7</italic> is expressed in monocytes both in the circulation and at local sites of infection during RRV infection.
