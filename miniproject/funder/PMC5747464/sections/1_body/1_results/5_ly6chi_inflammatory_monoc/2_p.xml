<p>We next assessed whether the enriched Ly6C

 <sup>+</sup>Ly6G
 <sup>-</sup> monocyte population was positive for viral RNA via qRT-PCR. Consistent with our studies 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we found that monocytes sorted from skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-T48- or RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>-infected mice were positive for viral RNA (

 <sup>+</sup>F4/80
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages that had been FACS-sorted from muscle tissue of RRV-T48-infected mice at either 5 or 7 dpi as previously described [
