<p>In previous studies [

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, which lack the capacity to respond to type I IFNs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], were equivalent, suggesting that the reduced viral loads of the nsP1 mutant virus in skeletal muscle tissue of WT mice are due to some aspect of the type I IFN response. To determine if monocytes are a source of type I IFN during RRV infection, we enriched mouse bone marrow monocytes and co-cultured them with RRV-infected Vero cells to mimic the events

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After 18 hours of co-culture, total cellular RNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR for expression of murine type I IFN. Importantly, given that Vero cells are primate in origin and lack the complete type I IFN gene cluster due to a homozygous deletion on chromosome 12 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], the monocytes are the only source of murine interferons in the culture. We found that the expression level of IFNα2 mRNA was increased in WT monocytes co-cultured with RRV-T48- or RRV-T48-nsP1

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), indicating that both viruses can elicit a type I IFN response in monocytes. We next investigated the signaling pathway leading to type I IFN gene expression in monocytes. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, the induction of IFNα2 mRNA in monocytes was dependent on the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7, as IFNα2 mRNA expression levels were reduced in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). These data suggest that the induction of type I IFN in monocytes in response to RRV is dependent on RIG-I like receptor (RLR) signaling through the adaptor molecule MAVS, resulting in IRF3 and/or IRF7-driven transcription of type I IFN genes.
