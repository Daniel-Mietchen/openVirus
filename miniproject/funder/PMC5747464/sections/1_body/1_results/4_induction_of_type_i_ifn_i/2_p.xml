<p>To further interrogate a role for direct infection, we first determined whether the induction of type I IFN in monocytes in the co-culture required the phagocytic activity of monocytes. Monocytes were co-cultured with Vero cells infected with RRV-GFP either in the presence or absence of the phagocytosis inhibitor Latrunculin B [

To further evaluate the role of direct infection of monocytes in the induction of type I IFN, monocytes were cultured in the presence of Vero cells electroporated with either RRV-GFP RNA or with RRV-GFP replicon RNA, in which the structural genes required for new particle production are replaced with the GFP gene [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Electroporation of Vero cells with full-length RRV-GFP RNA or with RRV-GFP replicon RNA resulted in a similar percentage of GFP-positive Vero cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006748.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the induction of type I IFN in monocytes co-cultured with RRV-infected cells requires the production of virus particles that infect monocytes and activate type I IFN expression by a MAVS- and IRF3/IRF7-dependent mechanism.
