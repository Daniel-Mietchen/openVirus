 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], in monocytes for the induction of IFNÎ±2 mRNA in response to RRV infection suggested that direct viral infection of monocytes may be necessary for the induction of type I IFN. To assess whether the monocytes in this system are infected with RRV, we co-cultured monocytes with Vero cells infected with a RRV capable of expressing GFP under the control of a second subgenomic promoter (RRV-GFP) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A portion of monocytes (~40%) co-cultured with Vero cells infected with RRV-GFP became GFP-positive, as measured by flow cytometry, although the fluorescence intensity of the GFP signal for many of the monocytes was reduced in comparison with RRV-GFP-infected Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006748.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Although it remains possible that the monocytes phagocytosed GFP-positive Vero cells or engulfed GFP released from dying Vero cells, these data suggest that monocytes can be infected with RRV.
