 <sup>−/−</sup> mice correlated with reduced viral loads in skeletal muscle tissue at the time point (5 dpi) this tissue is infiltrated with NK cells and inflammatory monocytes [

 <sup>6M</sup> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], suggesting that the mutations in nsP1 render the virus more susceptible to monocyte-mediated antiviral defenses. Murine Ly6C

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. To investigate the role of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes in control of RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup> infection, we used transgenic CCR2 depleter mice in which the CCR2 locus was modified to place a simian diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), separated by an aphthovirus 2A cleavage site, under control of the endogenous CCR2 promoter (CCR2-DTR) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These mice have been used in numerous studies for efficient

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. To confirm these data in our laboratory, CCR2-DTR mice and littermate wild-type (WT) control mice were administered diphtheria toxin (DT) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection one day prior and 2 days after either mock-inoculation or inoculation with RRV-T48 or CHIKV. At 24 hours (h) after the last DT administration, we measured the frequency of various cell populations in the blood by flow cytometry. Similar to other studies [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], in mock-, RRV-, and CHIKV-inoculated CCR2-DTR mice, we detected depletion of both Ly6C

 <sup>+</sup>) in the blood of DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice was increased compared with WT mice, indicating that this cell population was not deleted by DT treatment. Consistent with these data, Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes and NK cells in the blood of CCR2-DTR mice were CFP
