<p>The injury and inflammation of musculoskeletal tissues observed during infection with arthritogenic alphaviruses is likely initiated by direct infection of these tissues. In humans and experimentally-infected mice, viral infection of musculoskeletal tissues promotes a robust host inflammatory response, some aspects of which have been directly implicated in the musculoskeletal tissue damage [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, musculoskeletal tissues of CHIKV- or RRV-infected humans and mice are heavily infiltrated with monocytes and macrophages [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and several studies suggest that these cell populations promote the pathogenesis of acute CHIKV and RRV infection. In mice, treatment with macrophage toxic agents such as silica [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] prior to CHIKV or RRV infection resulted in less severe acute virus-induced disease. Furthermore, treatment of RRV-infected mice with methotrexate accelerated the development of musculoskeletal disease signs, and this enhancement was associated with an increased influx of monocytes into musculoskeletal tissues [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), or CCL2, a chemokine responsible for monocyte egress from the bone marrow and migration into certain tissues within inflammatory contexts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], is elevated during CHIKV and RRV infection of humans and mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Treatment of mice with bindarit, a small molecule that inhibits production of MCP-1 and other MCPs, reduced the severity of both CHIKV- and RRV-induced disease signs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Collectively, these findings support a pathogenic role for monocytes and macrophages during CHIKV and RRV infection. However, some studies also have suggested a protective role for these cell populations. Administration of clodronate-loaded liposomes to mice prolonged viremia following CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], suggesting that monocytes, macrophages, and/or other phagocytic cells contribute to control of virus infection. In addition, CHIKV infection of

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that monocytes protect from more severe forms of joint pathology.
