<p>Despite this robust host inflammatory response, the immunological mechanisms that mediate control of acute alphavirus infection in musculoskeletal tissues are not well defined. One component of the innate immune response to arthritogenic alphavirus infection, the type I interferon (IFN) response, is essential for control of these infections, as mice with defects in type I IFN signaling succumb rapidly to CHIKV and RRV infection [
