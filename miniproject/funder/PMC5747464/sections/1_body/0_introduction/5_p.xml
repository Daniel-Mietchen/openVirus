<p>In previous studies, we identified an attenuated strain of RRV (DC5692) that in contrast to the virulent RRV-T48 strain does not cause severe musculoskeletal disease in mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We used these two strains in chimeric virus studies to define viral virulence determinants [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Through this work, we identified polymorphisms in nsP1 that, when introduced into the RRV-T48 genome, enhanced RRV-T48 sensitivity to type I IFN and attenuated RRV-T48 infection in WT and

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The attenuation of this nsP1 mutant virus (RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>) in both WT and 
 <italic>Rag1</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice correlated with reduced viral loads in skeletal muscle tissue at the time point this tissue is infiltrated with inflammatory monocytes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this study, we used CCR2-DTR mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], which express the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) under control of the CCR2 promoter, to further investigate the role of inflammatory monocytes during acute alphavirus infection. Depletion of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes resulted in increased disease severity and viral burdens in mice infected with the nsP1 mutant virus as well as in mice infected with CHIKV, suggesting that Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes protect from alphavirus infection. Type I IFN gene expression was induced in monocytes co-cultured with CHIKV- or RRV-infected cells in an 
 <italic>Irf3</italic>;
 <italic>Irf7</italic>- and 
 <italic>Mavs</italic>-dependent manner, indicating that monocytes express type I IFN in response to alphavirus infection or alphavirus-infected cells. Consistent with these data, monocytes and macrophages sorted from skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-infected mice were positive for viral RNA and had elevated expression levels of 
 <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA, a transcription factor that promotes type I IFN production. Similar to mice depleted of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes, viral loads in the muscle tissue of 
 <italic>Mavs</italic>-deficient mice infected with WT RRV or the nsP1 mutant virus were equivalent. Furthermore, reconstitution of 
 <italic>Irf3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>-/-</italic>
 </sup>;
 <italic>Irf7</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with CCR2-DTR bone marrow rescued mice from severe infection, and this effect was reversed by depletion of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells are capable of inducing an antiviral response. These studies suggest that Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes contribute to control of acute alphavirus infection by a MAVS-and IRF3;IRF7-dependent mechanism.
