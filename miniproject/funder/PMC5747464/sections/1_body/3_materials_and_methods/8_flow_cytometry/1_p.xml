<p>Quadriceps muscles were dissected, minced, and incubated for 1.5 h with vigorous shaking at 37°C in digestion media (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 15 mM HEPES, 2.5 mg/ml Collagenase Type 1 [Worthington Biochemical], 1.7 mg/ml DNase I [Roche], 1x gentamicin [Life Technologies], 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Following digestion, cells were passed through a 100-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon) and banded on Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane Laboratories) to isolate infiltrating leukocytes. Additionally, peripheral blood was collected at time of harvest in 100 mM EDTA, and red blood cells were lysed using BD PharmLyse buffer (BD Biosciences). Spleens were dissected from mice and passed through a 100-μm cell strainer. Following red blood cell lysis, cells were washed in 1x PBS and passed through a 70-μm strainer, and total viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion. Isolated leukocytes from all samples were incubated with anti-mouse FcγRII/III (2.4G2; BD Pharmingen) for 20 min on ice to block nonspecific antibody binding and then stained in FACS buffer (1x PBS, 2% FBS) with the following Abs: anti-B220 (RA3-6B2), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-F4/80 (BM8), anti-Ly6C (HK1.4), anti-Ly6G (1A8), anti-CD43 (1B11), anti-CD64 (X54-5/7.1), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-CD45.1 (A20), and anti-CD45.2 (104). Cells were fixed overnight in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on an LSRFortessa using FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson). Further analysis was done using FlowJo Software (Tree Star).</p>
