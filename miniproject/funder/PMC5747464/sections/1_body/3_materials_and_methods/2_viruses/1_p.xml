<p>The T48 stain of RRV (GenBank accession no. GQ433359) was isolated from 
 <italic>Aedes vigilax</italic> mosquitoes in Queensland, Australia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Prior to cDNA cloning, the virus was passaged 10 times in suckling mice, followed by two passages on Vero cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. RRV strain DC5692 (GenBank accession no. HM234643), from which the attenuating mutations in nsP1 were derived [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], was isolated in 1995 from 
 <italic>Aedes camptorhynchus</italic> mosquitoes at Dawesville Cut in the Peel region of Western Australia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The virus was passaged once in C6/36 cells, once in Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81), and once in BHK-21 [C-13] (ATCC CCL-10) cells prior to cDNA cloning [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup> encodes the six nonsynonymous DC5692 nucleotides in the nsP1 gene [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The SL15649 strain of CHIKV (GenBank accession no. GU189061) was isolated from a serum sample collected from a febrile patient in Sri Lanka in 2006. This virus was passaged two times in Vero cells prior to cDNA cloning [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Plasmids encoding infectious cDNA clones of RRV and CHIKV have been described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Virus stocks were prepared from cDNA clones as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, plasmids were linearized and used as a template for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription with SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Ambion). RNA was electroporated into BHK-21 cells and at 24 h post-electroporation, cell culture supernatant was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 1,721 x 
 <italic>g</italic>. Clarified supernatants were aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C. Viral titers were determined by plaque assays using BHK-21 and Vero cells as described [
