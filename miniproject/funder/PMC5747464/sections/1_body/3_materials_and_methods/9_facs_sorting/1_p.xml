<p>Muscle and peripheral blood samples were obtained and processed as described above. Total viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion. Isolated leukocytes from all samples were incubated with LIVE/DEAD Violet Dead Cell Stain (Molecular Probes) for 30 min on ice in 1x PBS to identify dead cells. Isolated leukocytes were incubated with anti-mouse FcÎ³RII/III (2.4G2; BD Pharmingen) for 20 min on ice to block nonspecific Ab binding and then stained in FACS buffer (1x PBS, 2% FBS) with the following Abs: anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-Ly6C (HK1.4), and anti-Ly6G (1A8). Cells were then analyzed and sorted on a FACSAria sorter using FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson).</p>
