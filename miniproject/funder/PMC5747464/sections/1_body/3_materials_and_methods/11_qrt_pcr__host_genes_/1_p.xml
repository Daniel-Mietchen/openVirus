<p>RNA was isolated from cells collected in TRIzol reagent using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies). Random primers (Life Technologies) were used to generate random-primed cDNAs, which were then subjected to qPCR analysis using TaqMan primer/probe sets specific to 18S rRNA, murine IFNα2, IFNβ, IFNα4, or Irf7 (Applied Biosystems). IFNα2, IFNβ, IFNα4, or Irf7 expression was normalized to 18S values to control for input amounts of cDNA. The relative fold induction of amplified mRNA were determined by using the Ct method [
