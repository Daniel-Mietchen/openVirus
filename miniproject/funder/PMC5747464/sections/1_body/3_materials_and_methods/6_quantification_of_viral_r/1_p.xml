<p>RNA was isolated from TRIzol homogenized tissues using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies). Absolute quantification of RRV RNA was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A sequence-tagged (small caps) RRV-specific RT primer (4415 5’-ggcagtatcgtgaattcgatgcAACACTCCCGTCGACAACAGA-3’) was used for reverse transcription. A tag sequence-specific reverse primer (5’-GGCAGTATCGTGAATTCGATGC-3’) was used with a RRV sequence-specific forward primer (4346 5’-CCGTGGCGGGTATTATCAAT-3’) and an internal TaqMan probe (4375 5’-ATTAAGAGTGTAGCCATCC-3’) during qPCR to enhance specificity. To create standard curves, 10-fold dilutions, from 10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies, of RRV genomic RNAs synthesized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were spiked into RNA from BHK-21 cells and reverse transcription and qPCR were performed in an identical manner. The limit of detection was 100 genome copies. CHIKV RNA in tissues was quantified by qRT-PCR as previously described [
