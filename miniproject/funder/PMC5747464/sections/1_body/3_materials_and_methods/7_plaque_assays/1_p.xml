<p>Virus-containing samples were serially diluted 10-fold, and dilutions were adsorbed onto BHK-21 monolayers for 1 h at 37°C. Monolayers were then overlayed with medium containing 0.5% immunodiffusion agarose and incubated at 37°C for 36–40 hours. Plaques were visualized using Neutral Red staining and enumerated to determine the PFU/ml of each sample.</p>
