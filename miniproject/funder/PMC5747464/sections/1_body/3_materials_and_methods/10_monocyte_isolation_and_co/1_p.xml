<p>Vero cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 2 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well the day prior to infection (MOI of 1 PFU/cell). In some experiments, Vero cells were electroporated with viral RNA, then plated at a density of 3 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well 5 hours prior to the addition of enriched monocytes. Monocytes were isolated from mouse bone marrow using the EasySep Mouse Monocyte Isolation Kit (Stem Cell Technologies) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The degree of monocyte enrichment was assessed by flow cytometry, and the average purity of the enriched population was 91% Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes. Enriched bone marrow monocytes were plated with Vero cells at a density of 1 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> monocytes per well 5 hours after viral infection of the Vero cells. In some experiments, monocytes were added to the Vero cells in the presence of 1 uM Latrunculin B (Sigma). Co-cultures were harvested 18 hours after plating of the monocytes for analysis. Cells were harvested either into TRIzol reagent for RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis or collected for staining and flow cytometry analysis.
