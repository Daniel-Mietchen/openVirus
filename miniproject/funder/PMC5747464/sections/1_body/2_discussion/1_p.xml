<p>Infection with an arthritogenic alphavirus can result in acute and chronic pain and inflammation in musculoskeletal tissues. Numerous studies have demonstrated that arthritogenic alphaviruses target and replicate in musculoskeletal tissues, suggesting that the musculoskeletal disease is initiated by viral replication in the affected tissues. However, the immunological mechanisms that mediate control of alphavirus infection in musculoskeletal tissues are not well-defined. An improved understanding of these mechanisms may identify new therapeutic targets for the prevention or treatment of alphavirus-induced musculoskeletal disease.</p>
