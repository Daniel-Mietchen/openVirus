 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], suggested that monocytes or monocyte-derived cells are pathogenic effectors during arthritogenic alphavirus infections. However, the precise effects of these broadly-acting depletion methods on different immune cell subsets, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, in the context of these infections has not been extensively investigated. Additionally, the mechanism(s) by which bindarit acts to inhibit chemokine production is not well-defined, although modulation of the classical NF-κB pathway has been reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], suggesting that other mechanisms in conjunction with CCL2 inhibition may contribute to the reduced disease severity observed in RRV- or CHIKV-infected mice treated with bindarit. In addition, CHIKV-induced musculoskeletal disease was more severe in

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which displayed diminished recruitment of monocytes and enhanced recruitment of neutrophils to tissues, suggesting that monocytes may protect from more severe forms of CHIKV-induced musculoskeletal disease. Collectively, these studies, combined with the findings reported in this study, suggest that monocytes may serve both pathogenic and protective roles during arthritogenic alphavirus infections. Indeed, monocytes have been implicated previously in contributing to both protection and pathology during viral infections of the CNS [
