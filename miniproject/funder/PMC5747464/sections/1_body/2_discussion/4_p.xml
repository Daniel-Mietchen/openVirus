<p>As discussed above, in previous studies we found that the nsP1 mutant virus was more sensitive to the antiviral effects of type I IFN 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and that viral loads of WT RRV and the nsP1 mutant virus in skeletal muscle tissue were similar in

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice and mice depleted of inflammatory monocytes suggested that monocytes are a source of type I IFN. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, we found that co-culture of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes with RRV-infected cells resulted in the induction of type I IFN gene expression in monocytes. These findings are consistent with studies showing that human monocytes produce type I IFNs in response to infection or exposure to CHIKV [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The induction of type I IFN in Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes was dependent on the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 and the signaling adaptor MAVS. These findings imply that the expression of type I IFN is triggered by viral infection of the monocytes, with subsequent sensing of viral RNA present in the cytoplasm by a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) that signals via MAVS. Consistent with this model, human monocytes and monocyte-derived cell lines have been reported to be susceptible to infection by CHIKV and RRV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, whether the infection of human monocytes results in productive virus replication is less clear. Monocytes in PBMCs isolated from CHIKV-infected patients stained positive for CHIKV antigen by flow cytometry [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and infection of the human myeloid MM6 cell line with RRV resulted in an infection in which viral RNA was detectable, but production of infectious virus was low [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], suggesting that productive viral replication in myeloid cells may be restricted compared to infection in other cell types. Using flow cytometry, we found that a subset of murine Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes became GFP-positive when co-cultured with cells infected with a recombinant RRV that expressed GFP from a second subgenomic reporter. We also found that the induction of type I IFN in Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes was dependent on viral particle production, as co-culture of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes with cells electroporated with full-length viral RNA, but not replicon RNA incapable of progeny virus production, resulted in the induction of type I IFN expression in the monocytes.
