<p>In summary, these studies have defined an important antiviral function for inflammatory Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes in acute RRV and CHIKV infection, whereby monocytes mediate improved virus control and reduced viral disease severity. In the case of RRV, these studies also suggest that the antiviral activity of monocytes can be subverted by determinants in the nsP1 protein, which mediates capping of viral RNAs that potentially influence host recognition of infection. In combination with previous studies that suggested additional protective roles for inflammatory monocytes during CHIKV infection [
