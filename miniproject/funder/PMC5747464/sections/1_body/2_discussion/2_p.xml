<p>In previous studies, we found that introduction of specific mutations in the nsP1 protein of the virulent RRV-T48 strain resulted in viral attenuation in mice, reduced viral loads in muscle tissue concurrent with immune cell infiltration, and increased viral sensitivity to type I IFN [

Thus, we reasoned that investigating the immunological mechanisms that mediate enhanced control of this attenuated virus would reveal aspects of the inflammatory response to RRV infection in musculoskeletal tissues that contribute to control of the infection. Indeed, we found that depletion of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> cells restored viral loads of the nsP1 mutant virus (RRV-T48-nsP1
 <sup>6M</sup>) in the muscle tissue at 5 days post-inoculation to levels detected in mice infected with WT RRV. At this time point, the immune cell infiltrate within musculoskeletal tissues is composed predominantly of monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although both Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes and NK cells are effectively depleted in DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice, we have shown both previously [

In contrast, antibody-mediated depletion of monocytes and neutrophils, but not neutrophils alone, also increased viral loads and disease severity in mice infected with the nsP1 mutant virus. Collectively, these data suggest that the nsP1 mutant virus has enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral effects of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes.
