<p>Monocytes as a source of type I IFN during alphavirus infection is supported further by several experiments 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, we found that Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes sorted from both the blood and muscle tissue of mice infected with RRV expressed higher levels of 
 <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA, a critical regulator of type I IFN production in CHIKV-infected mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], compared with Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes sorted from control mice. Second, similar to mice depleted of Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes, we found that viral loads in the muscle tissue of

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with WT RRV or the nsP1 mutant virus were equivalent. Third, consistent with previous studies showing that WT bone marrow can rescue

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice from lethal CHIKV infection [

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with CCR2-DTR bone marrow were protected from severe RRV infection. These studies suggesting that type I IFN production by hematopoietic cells is sufficient to control acute alphavirus infection. Finally, DT treatment of

 <italic>Irf7</italic>
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with CCR2-DTR bone marrow strongly enhanced disease severity and viral loads in skeletal muscle tissue, suggesting that CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells, including inflammatory monocytes, are capable of inducing an antiviral response. These findings, together with our findings that induction of type I IFN in monocytes exposed to RRV-infected cells is IRF3/IRF7 and MAVS-dependent, suggest an important role for MAVS-mediated type I IFN production by Ly6C
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes for control of acute alphavirus infection.
