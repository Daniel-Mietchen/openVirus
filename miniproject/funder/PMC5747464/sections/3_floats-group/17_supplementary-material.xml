   <sup>-/-</sup> mice were co-cultured for 18 h with uninfected or RRV-T48-infected Vero cells. Cells were incubated with LIVE/DEAD Violet Dead Cell Stain, incubated with anti-mouse FcÎ³RII/III to block nonspecific antibody binding, and then stained with the following antibodies: anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-Ly6C (HK1.4), and anti-CD45 (30-F11). The percent viability of Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup>CD11b
   <sup>+</sup>CD45
   <sup>+</sup> cells was determined by flow cytometry (n = 3/group).
