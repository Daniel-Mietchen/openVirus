  <title>Depletion of CCR2
   <sup>+</sup> cells enhanced viral loads in tissues and the severity of acute RRV infection.
  </title>
  <p>WT or CCR2-DTR C57BL/6 mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 1,000 PFU of RRV-T48 or RRV-T48-nsP1
   <sup>6M</sup>. At days -1 and +2 relative to infection, mice were i.p. administered DT. 1 h prior to virus infection, Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> monocytes were adoptively transferred into a subset of CCR2-DTR mice. At 5 dpi, viral RNA levels in (A) skeletal muscle tissue and (B) contralateral ankle tissue were quantified by qRT-PCR. (C) At 5 dpi, infectious virus in the serum was quantified by plaque assay. (D) The percent starting body weight was determined daily (n = 6–17 mice/group). Data are pooled from three independent experiments. 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test (A-C) and a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (D). *,
