  <title>Induction of type I IFN expression in monocytes co-cultured with RRV-infected Vero cells requires new virion production.</title>
  <p>(A-B) Enriched WT bone marrow monocytes were co-cultured with Vero cells electroporated with full-length RRV-GFP RNA or replicon RRV-GFP RNA in which the structural genes are replaced with the GFP gene. After 18 h of co-culture, (A) the percent GFP
   <sup>+</sup> Vero cells was measured by flow cytometry, and (B) IFNα2 mRNA expression level in monocytes was quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are normalized to 18S rRNA levels and are expressed as the relative expression (
   <italic>n</italic>-fold increase) over expression in uninfected Vero cells without monocytes. 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test. ***, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.
