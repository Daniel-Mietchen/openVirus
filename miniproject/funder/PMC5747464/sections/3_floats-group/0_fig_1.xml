  <p>(A, B, C) WT (n = 6–7 mice/group) or CCR2-DTR (n = 5–6 mice/group) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with (A) PBS, (B) RRV-T48, or (C) CHIKV. At days -1 and +2 relative to infection, mice were i.p. administered DT. 24 h after the last DT administration, the frequency of Ly6C
