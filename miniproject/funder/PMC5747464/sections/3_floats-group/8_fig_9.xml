   <sup>-/-</sup> (n = 10/group) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 1,000 PFU of RRV-T48 or RRV-T48-nsP1
   <sup>6M</sup>. At 5 dpi, viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue were quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are pooled from three independent experiments. 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined by one-way ANOVA with a Tukeyâ€™s multiple comparison test. **,
