  <title>Depletion of CCR2
   <sup>+</sup> cells enhanced viral loads in tissues and the severity of disease during acute CHIKV infection.
  </title>
  <p>WT (n = 9) or CCR2-DTR (n = 6) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 1,000 PFU of CHIKV. At days -1 and +2 relative to infection, mice were i.p. administered DT. (A) The percent starting body was determined daily. At 5 dpi, (B) viral RNA levels in the contralateral ankle were quantified by qRT-PCR and (C) infectious virus in the serum was quantified by plaque assay. Data are pooled from three independent experiments. 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined by a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (A) and by Student’s t-test (B, C). *, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05; **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***,
