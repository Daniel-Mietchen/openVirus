  <title>Antibody-mediated depletion of NK cells, monocytes, and neutrophils.</title>
  <p>WT C57BL/6 mice were administered (A) anti-NK1.1 (n = 4) or a control antibody (n = 4), (B) anti-Gr1 (n = 8) or a control antibody (n = 8), or (C) anti-Ly6G (n = 4) or a control antibody (n = 4) at day -1 and day +2 relative to infection with the indicated viruses. At 5 dpi, depletion of NK cells, neutrophils, and Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the circulation was assessed by flow cytometry.
