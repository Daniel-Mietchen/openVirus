  <title>Induction of type I IFN expression in monocytes requires virus infection.</title>
  <p>(A-B) Enriched WT bone marrow monocytes were co-cultured with Vero cells infected with RRV-GFP (n = 3/group). After 18 h of co-culture, GFP expression in Vero cells and monocytes was measured by flow cytometry. (A) Shown are representative histograms. (B) The percent GFP
   <sup>+</sup> monocytes and Vero cells. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (C-D) Enriched WT bone marrow monocytes were co-cultured with uninfected or RRV-GFP-infected Vero cells in the presence or absence of 1 μM Latrunculin B. After 18 h of co-culture, (C) IFNα2 mRNA expression level in monocytes was quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are normalized to 18S rRNA levels and are expressed as the relative expression (
   <italic>n</italic>-fold increase) over expression in uninfected Vero cells without monocytes. (D) The percent GFP
   <sup>+</sup> Vero cells and monocytes were measured by flow cytometry based on GFP expression within the CD45
   <sup>-</sup> Vero cells and the CD45
   <sup>+</sup> monocytes. Data are combined from two independent experiments. 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
