  <title>Inflammatory monocytes express 
   <italic>Irf7</italic> and are viral RNA-positive during RRV infection 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with PBS or 1,000 PFU of RRV-T48 or RRV-T48-nsP1
   <sup>6M</sup>. At 5 dpi, Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> monocytes were enriched from the bone marrow or FACS-sorted from the blood and from enzymatically-digested muscle tissue. (A-C) Representative flow cytometry gating of cells sorted from the (A) bone marrow, (B) blood of RRV-infected mice, and (C) skeletal muscle of RRV-infected mice. (D) 
   <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA expression levels in enriched cell populations were quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are normalized to 18S rRNA levels and are expressed as the relative expression (
   <italic>n</italic>-fold increase) over expression in Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> bone marrow monocytes from uninfected mice. Each data point represents monocytes sorted from the combined tissues of 3 mice. Each bar represents the arithmetic mean of two independent experiments. (E-F) RRV RNA levels in enriched monocyte/macrophage populations sorted from bone marrow of uninfected mice or skeletal muscle tissue of RRV-infected mice were quantified by qRT-PCR. (E) Each data point represents monocytes sorted from the combined muscle tissues of 3 mice. (F) Each data point represents monocytes/macrophages sorted from the muscle tissue of 2 mice (5 dpi) or a single mouse (7 dpi).
