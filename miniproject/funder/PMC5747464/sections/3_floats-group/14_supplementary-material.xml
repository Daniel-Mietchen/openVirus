  <title>Enriched Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> monocytes for adoptive transfer.
  </title>
  <p>The purity of Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> monocytes isolated from the bone marrow was assessed by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with anti-mouse FcÎ³RII/III to block nonspecific antibody binding and then stained with the following antibodies: anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-Ly6C (HK1.4), and anti-Ly6G (1A8). Shown are representative FACS plots from one of three independent experiments.
