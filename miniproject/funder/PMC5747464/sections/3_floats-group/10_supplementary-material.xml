  <title>Flow cytometry gating of monocytes, neutrophils, and NK cells in blood.</title>
  <p>WT (n = 6-7/group) or CCR2-DTR (n = 5-6/group) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with (A) PBS, (B) RRV-T48, or (C) CHIKV. At days -1 and +2 relative to infection, mice were i.p. administered DT. At 24 h after the last DT administration, the frequency of Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> monocytes (Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup>CD11b
   <sup>+</sup>CD43
   <sup>+</sup>Ly6G

   <sup>-</sup>), and neutrophils (Ly6G
