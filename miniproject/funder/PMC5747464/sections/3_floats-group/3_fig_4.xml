  <title>Depletion of CCR2
   <sup>+</sup> cells enhances pathogenicity of the attenuated RRV-T48-nsP1
   <sup>6M</sup> mutant virus.
  </title>
  <p>WT or CCR2-DTR C57BL/6 mice (n = 3–7 mice/group) were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 1,000 PFU of RRV-T48 or RRV-T48-nsP1
   <sup>6M</sup>. At days -1 and +2 relative to infection, mice were i.p. administered DT. (A) The percent starting body weight and (B) musculoskeletal disease score were determined daily. (C) At 10 dpi, viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue were quantified by qRT-PCR. 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined by a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (A, B) and by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test (C) *, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05; **,
