  <title>Antibody-mediated depletion of Ly6C
   <sup>hi</sup> monocytes exacerbates acute RRV infection.
  </title>
  <p>WT C57BL/6 mice were administered (A and B) anti-NK1.1 (n = 4) or a control antibody (n = 4), (C and D) anti-Gr1 (n = 8) or a control antibody (n = 8), or (E and F) anti-Ly6G (n = 4) or a control antibody (n = 4) at day -1 and day +2 relative to infection with the indicated viruses. At 5 dpi, (A, C, E) viral RNA levels in skeletal muscle tissue were quantified by qRT-PCR, and (B, D, F) the percent starting body weight was determined daily. Data are from one (anti-NK1.1 and anti-Ly6G) or two (anti-Gr1) independent experiments. 
   <italic>P</italic> values were determined by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparison test (A, C, E) or a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (B, D, F). *,
