 <p>Mosquito-transmitted arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Mayaro virus, and Ross River virus (RRV), cause large disease outbreaks. Infection with these viruses results in severe pain and inflammation in joints, tendons, and muscles, likely due to direct viral infection of these tissues, that can persist for years. Monocytes and macrophages have been implicated in the damaging effects of the inflammation, however, the role of these cell types in control of alphaviral infection are poorly understood. Using mouse models and an attenuated RRV with mutations in the nsP1 gene, we found that monocytes are critical to control acute infection and to reduce disease severity. Furthermore, we found that monocytes respond to virus-infected cells by increasing expression levels of type I interferon, a critical antiviral defense system. The induction of type I interferon in monocytes was dependent on MAVS, a signaling protein downstream of cytosolic viral RNA sensor proteins. Similar to monocytes, MAVS was required to control infection with the nsP1 mutant RRV. These studies suggest that monocytes control acute alphavirus infection and that determinants in nsP1, the viral RNA capping protein, counteract this response. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting these cells for the treatment of these viral inflammatory diseases should do so without compromising their role in innate immunity.</p>
