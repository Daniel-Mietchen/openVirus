 <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV) are mosquito-transmitted alphaviruses that cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. Monocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of these infections; however, their specific roles are not well defined. To investigate the role of inflammatory Ly6C
  <sup>hi</sup>CCR2
  <sup>+</sup> monocytes in alphavirus pathogenesis, we used CCR2-DTR transgenic mice, enabling depletion of these cells by administration of diptheria toxin (DT). DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice displayed more severe disease following CHIKV and RRV infection and had fewer Ly6C
  <sup>hi</sup> monocytes and NK cells in circulation and muscle tissue compared with DT-treated WT mice. Furthermore, depletion of CCR2
  <sup>+</sup> or Gr1
  <sup>+</sup> cells, but not NK cells or neutrophils alone, restored virulence and increased viral loads in mice infected with an RRV strain encoding attenuating mutations in nsP1 to levels detected in monocyte-depleted mice infected with fully virulent RRV. Disease severity and viral loads also were increased in DT-treated CCR2-DTR

  <sup>hi</sup> monocytes with RRV-infected cells resulted in induction of type I IFN gene expression in monocytes that was

  <sup>-/-</sup> mice with CCR2-DTR bone marrow rescued mice from severe infection, and this effect was reversed by depletion of CCR2

  <sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells are capable of inducing an antiviral response. Collectively, these data suggest that MAVS-dependent production of type I IFN by monocytes is critical for control of acute alphavirus infection and that determinants in nsP1, the viral RNA capping protein, counteract this response.
