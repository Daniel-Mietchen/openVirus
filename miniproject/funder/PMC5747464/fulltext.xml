disease. Monocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of these infections; however, their specific roles are not well defined. To investigate the role of inflammatory Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes in alphavirus pathogenesis, we used CCR2-DTR transgenic mice, enabling depletion of these cells by administration of diptheria toxin (DT). DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice displayed more severe disease following CHIKV and RRV infection and had fewer Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and NK cells in circulation and muscle tissue compared with DT-treated WT mice. Furthermore, depletion of CCR2<sup>+</sup> or Gr1<sup>+</sup> cells, but not NK cells or neutrophils alone, restored virulence and increased viral loads in mice infected with an RRV strain encoding attenuating mutations in nsP1 to levels detected in monocyte-depleted mice infected with fully virulent RRV. Disease severity and viral loads also were increased in DT-treated CCR2-DTR<sup>+</sup>;<italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with the nsP1 mutant virus, confirming that these effects are independent of adaptive immunity. Monocytes and macrophages sorted from muscle tissue of RRV-infected mice were viral RNA positive and had elevated expression of <italic>Irf7</italic>, and co-culture of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes with RRV-infected cells resulted in induction of type I IFN gene expression in monocytes that was <italic>Irf3</italic>;<italic>Irf7</italic> and <italic>Mavs</italic>-dependent. Consistent with these data, viral loads of the attenuated nsP1 mutant virus were equivalent to those of WT RRV in <italic>Mavs</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Finally, reconstitution of <italic>Irf3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>;<italic>Irf7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with CCR2-DTR bone marrow rescued mice from severe infection, and this effect was reversed by depletion of CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that CCR2<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells are capable of inducing an antiviral response. Collectively, these data suggest that MAVS-dependent production of type I IFN by monocytes is critical for control of acute alphavirus infection and that determinants in nsP1, the viral RNA capping protein, counteract this response.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Mosquito-transmitted arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Mayaro virus, and Ross River virus (RRV), cause large disease outbreaks. Infection with these viruses results in severe pain and inflammation in joints, tendons, and muscles, likely due to direct viral infection of these tissues, that can persist for years. Monocytes and macrophages have been implicated in the damaging effects of the inflammation, however, the role of these cell types in control of alphaviral infection are poorly understood. Using mouse models and an attenuated RRV with mutations in the nsP1 gene, we found that monocytes are critical to control acute infection and to reduce disease severity. Furthermore, we found that monocytes respond to virus-infected cells by increasing expression levels of type I interferon, a critical antiviral defense system. The induction of type I interferon in monocytes was dependent on MAVS, a signaling protein downstream of cytosolic viral RNA sensor proteins. Similar to monocytes, MAVS was required to control infection with the nsP1 mutant RRV. These studies suggest that monocytes control acute alphavirus infection and that determinants in nsP1, the viral RNA capping protein, counteract this response. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting these cells for the treatment of these viral inflammatory diseases should do so without compromising their role in innate immunity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI08725</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1811-2938</contrib-id><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Thomas E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI052066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haist</surname><given-names>Kelsey C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI122517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haist</surname><given-names>Kelsey C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by Public Health Service grant R01 AI108725 (T.E.M.) from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

These viruses cause both endemic and explosive epidemics of debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. CHIKV has caused epidemics of unprecedented scale within the past decade in many regions of the world. Beginning in 2004, CHIKV re-emerged from Africa and spread to islands in the Indian Ocean, India, and countries in Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, and Europe [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In October of 2013, local transmission of CHIKV occurred on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since that time, the virus has spread throughout much of the Americas resulting in approximately two-million confirmed and suspected cases in 45 countries and territories [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>CHIKV and RRV infection typically present with a sudden onset of high fever and severe pain and inflammation in peripheral joints [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This acute phase lasts for 1 to 2 weeks and often resolves without further complications. However, some disease signs and symptoms, such as joint swelling, joint stiffness, arthralgia, arthritis, and tendonitis/tenosynovitis, can last for months to years in 10&#x02013;50% of patients [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The injury and inflammation of musculoskeletal tissues observed during infection with arthritogenic alphaviruses is likely initiated by direct infection of these tissues. In humans and experimentally-infected mice, viral infection of musculoskeletal tissues promotes a robust host inflammatory response, some aspects of which have been directly implicated in the musculoskeletal tissue damage [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, musculoskeletal tissues of CHIKV- or RRV-infected humans and mice are heavily infiltrated with monocytes and macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and several studies suggest that these cell populations promote the pathogenesis of acute CHIKV and RRV infection. In mice, treatment with macrophage toxic agents such as silica [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or clodronate-loaded liposomes [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] prior to CHIKV or RRV infection resulted in less severe acute virus-induced disease. Furthermore, treatment of RRV-infected mice with methotrexate accelerated the development of musculoskeletal disease signs, and this enhancement was associated with an increased influx of monocytes into musculoskeletal tissues [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), or CCL2, a chemokine responsible for monocyte egress from the bone marrow and migration into certain tissues within inflammatory contexts [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], is elevated during CHIKV and RRV infection of humans and mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Treatment of mice with bindarit, a small molecule that inhibits production of MCP-1 and other MCPs, reduced the severity of both CHIKV- and RRV-induced disease signs [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Collectively, these findings support a pathogenic role for monocytes and macrophages during CHIKV and RRV infection. However, some studies also have suggested a protective role for these cell populations. Administration of clodronate-loaded liposomes to mice prolonged viremia following CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], suggesting that monocytes, macrophages, and/or other phagocytic cells contribute to control of virus infection. In addition, CHIKV infection of <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice resulted in more severe arthritic disease characterized by an absence of monocytes and macrophages and increased numbers of neutrophils in musculoskeletal tissues [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that monocytes protect from more severe forms of joint pathology.</p><p>Despite this robust host inflammatory response, the immunological mechanisms that mediate control of acute alphavirus infection in musculoskeletal tissues are not well defined. One component of the innate immune response to arthritogenic alphavirus infection, the type I interferon (IFN) response, is essential for control of these infections, as mice with defects in type I IFN signaling succumb rapidly to CHIKV and RRV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although studies indicate that expression of the receptor for type I IFN on nonhematopoietic cells is essential for control of CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the cellular sources of type I IFN are less clear. Experiments in bone marrow chimeric mice indicate that hematopoietic cell <italic>Irf3</italic>;<italic>Irf7</italic> and <italic>Tlr3</italic>, signaling molecules that when activated promote type I IFN expression, mediate protection against CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], suggesting that hematopoietic cells are one important source of type I IFN during alphavirus infection.

An improved understanding of these mechanisms may identify new therapeutic targets for the prevention or treatment of alphavirus-induced musculoskeletal disease.</p><p>In previous studies, we found that introduction of specific mutations in the nsP1 protein of the virulent RRV-T48 strain resulted in viral attenuation in mice, reduced viral loads in muscle tissue concurrent with immune cell infiltration, and increased viral sensitivity to type I IFN [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, we reasoned that investigating the immunological mechanisms that mediate enhanced control of this attenuated virus would reveal aspects of the inflammatory response to RRV infection in musculoskeletal tissues that contribute to control of the infection. Indeed, we found that depletion of CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells restored viral loads of the nsP1 mutant virus (RRV-T48-nsP1<sup>6M</sup>) in the muscle tissue at 5 days post-inoculation to levels detected in mice infected with WT RRV. At this time point, the immune cell infiltrate within musculoskeletal tissues is composed predominantly of monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although both Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes and NK cells are effectively depleted in DT-treated CCR2-DTR mice, we have shown both previously [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and in this study that antibody-mediated depletion of NK cells alone has no effect on viral loads or disease severity. In contrast, antibody-mediated depletion of monocytes and neutrophils, but not neutrophils alone, also increased viral loads and disease severity in mice infected with the nsP1 mutant virus. Collectively, these data suggest that the nsP1 mutant virus has enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral effects of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes.</p><p>Studies in mice using alternative methods to deplete or inhibit the migration of monocytes, as well as other myeloid cell populations, such as the administration of silica and carrageenan [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], clodronate-loaded lipsomes [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or the CCL2 inhibitor bindarit [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], suggested that monocytes or monocyte-derived cells are pathogenic effectors during arthritogenic alphavirus infections. However, the precise effects of these broadly-acting depletion methods on different immune cell subsets, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, in the context of these infections has not been extensively investigated. Additionally, the mechanism(s) by which bindarit acts to inhibit chemokine production is not well-defined, although modulation of the classical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway has been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], suggesting that other mechanisms in conjunction with CCL2 inhibition may contribute to the reduced disease severity observed in RRV- or CHIKV-infected mice treated with bindarit. In addition, CHIKV-induced musculoskeletal disease was more severe in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which displayed diminished recruitment of monocytes and enhanced recruitment of neutrophils to tissues, suggesting that monocytes may protect from more severe forms of CHIKV-induced musculoskeletal disease. Collectively, these studies, combined with the findings reported in this study, suggest that monocytes may serve both pathogenic and protective roles during arthritogenic alphavirus infections. Indeed, monocytes have been implicated previously in contributing to both protection and pathology during viral infections of the CNS [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>As discussed above, in previous studies we found that the nsP1 mutant virus was more sensitive to the antiviral effects of type I IFN <italic>in vitro</italic> and that viral loads of WT RRV and the nsP1 mutant virus in skeletal muscle tissue were similar in <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The restoration of viral loads of RRV-T48-nsP1<sup>6M</sup> to WT RRV levels in both <italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and mice depleted of inflammatory monocytes suggested that monocytes are a source of type I IFN. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we found that co-culture of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes with RRV-infected cells resulted in the induction of type I IFN gene expression in monocytes. These findings are consistent with studies showing that human monocytes produce type I IFNs in response to infection or exposure to CHIKV [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The induction of type I IFN in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes was dependent on the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 and the signaling adaptor MAVS. These findings imply that the expression of type I IFN is triggered by viral infection of the monocytes, with subsequent sensing of viral RNA present in the cytoplasm by a RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) that signals via MAVS. Consistent with this model, human monocytes and monocyte-derived cell lines have been reported to be susceptible to infection by CHIKV and RRV [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, whether the infection of human monocytes results in productive virus replication is less clear. Monocytes in PBMCs isolated from CHIKV-infected patients stained positive for CHIKV antigen by flow cytometry [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and infection of the human myeloid MM6 cell line with RRV resulted in an infection in which viral RNA was detectable, but production of infectious virus was low [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], suggesting that productive viral replication in myeloid cells may be restricted compared to infection in other cell types. Using flow cytometry, we found that a subset of murine Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes became GFP-positive when co-cultured with cells infected with a recombinant RRV that expressed GFP from a second subgenomic reporter. We also found that the induction of type I IFN in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes was dependent on viral particle production, as co-culture of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes with cells electroporated with full-length viral RNA, but not replicon RNA incapable of progeny virus production, resulted in the induction of type I IFN expression in the monocytes.</p><p>Monocytes as a source of type I IFN during alphavirus infection is supported further by several experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>. First, we found that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes sorted from both the blood and muscle tissue of mice infected with RRV expressed higher levels of <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA, a critical regulator of type I IFN production in CHIKV-infected mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], compared with Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes sorted from control mice. Second, similar to mice depleted of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, we found that viral loads in the muscle tissue of <italic>Mavs</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with WT RRV or the nsP1 mutant virus were equivalent. Third, consistent with previous studies showing that WT bone marrow can rescue <italic>Irf3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>;<italic>Irf7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice from lethal CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], we found that lethally-irradiated <italic>Irf3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>;<italic>Irf7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with CCR2-DTR bone marrow were protected from severe RRV infection. These studies suggesting that type I IFN production by hematopoietic cells is sufficient to control acute alphavirus infection. Finally, DT treatment of <italic>Irf3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>;<italic>Irf7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with CCR2-DTR bone marrow strongly enhanced disease severity and viral loads in skeletal muscle tissue, suggesting that CCR2<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells, including inflammatory monocytes, are capable of inducing an antiviral response. These findings, together with our findings that induction of type I IFN in monocytes exposed to RRV-infected cells is IRF3/IRF7 and MAVS-dependent, suggest an important role for MAVS-mediated type I IFN production by Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes for control of acute alphavirus infection.</p><p>In summary, these studies have defined an important antiviral function for inflammatory Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in acute RRV and CHIKV infection, whereby monocytes mediate improved virus control and reduced viral disease severity. In the case of RRV, these studies also suggest that the antiviral activity of monocytes can be subverted by determinants in the nsP1 protein, which mediates capping of viral RNAs that potentially influence host recognition of infection. In combination with previous studies that suggested additional protective roles for inflammatory monocytes during CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006748.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], our findings further indicate that the development of therapeutics targeting monocyte recruitment or function for the treatment of these infections should do so without compromising the roles of these cells in innate immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals.
