  <p>Distribution of Gag and PR-RT HIV codons harboring adapted HLA associations in Mexico and Canada/United States. (A to C) Gag codons; (D to F) PR-RT codons. Panels A and D show HIV codons harboring adapted associations in Mexico, and panels B and E show HIV codons harboring adapted associations in Canada/United States. The number in each box corresponds to the number of HLA-adapted associations observed at that specific position. Panels C and F provide a merged map showing HLA-adapted associations present in Mexico only (blue), Canada/United States only (gray), and in both cohorts (red).</p>
