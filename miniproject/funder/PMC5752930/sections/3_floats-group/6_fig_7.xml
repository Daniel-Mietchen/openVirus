  <p>Comparison of HAP 
   <italic>P</italic> value distributions between Mexico and Canada/United States. −Log
   <sub>10</sub>
   <italic>P</italic> value transformations for the top 201 Gag HAPs found in Mexico and Canada/United States (A) and the top 157 PR-RT HAPs found in Mexico and Canada/United States (B) are shown. Transformed 
   <italic>P</italic> values are ranked from smallest (least significant) to largest (most significant) in each cohort and plotted as paired observations. The red line represents the null expectation. (C and D) −Log

   <italic>P</italic> value distribution of shared versus unique HAPs observed in Mexico in Gag (C) and PR-RT (D).
