  <p>Entropy differences in Gag and PR-RT on HIV from Mexico and Canada/United States. Comparison of Shannon entropy scores at each HIV position between cohorts. Each box represents an HIV codon. The top panel shows the 500 Gag positions; the bottom panel shows the 99 protease (PR) and the first 335 reverse transcriptase (RT) codons. Positions with significantly different Shannon entropies between Mexico and Canada/United States (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) are colored blue for positions with higher entropy in Mexico and gray for positions with higher entropy in Canada/United States. Black dots denote positions with different consensus amino acids between cohorts. The complete list of entropy values for Gag and PR-RT is available in Tables S4 and S5 in the supplemental material, respectively.
