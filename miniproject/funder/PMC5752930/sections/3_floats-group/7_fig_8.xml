  <p>Weaker HLA-associated footprint in Mexico compared to that in Canada/United States. (A) Pairwise comparisons of the absolute log-transformed odds ratios (Absolute lnOR) for all HAPs identified in Mexico and/or Canada/United States that were restricted by HLA alleles observed in a minimum of 10 individuals in both cohorts (
   <italic>n</italic> = 995). (B) Same as panel A but restricted to shared HAPs (i.e., those identified in both cohorts at a q value of &lt;0.2 in the original analysis; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 131). Results support a significantly weaker HLA-associated footprint in Mexico than in Canada/United States. (C) The difference in the percentage of persons expressing the restricting HLA and harboring the relevant adapted HIV variant in Mexico versus Canada/United States, where a negative value indicates the variant is less frequently found among HLA-expressing persons in Mexico. The horizontal line denotes the median, box edges denote the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers denote 10th to 90th percentiles, and individual outliers are labeled. The 
   <italic>P</italic> value is derived from a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test applied to the corresponding variant frequencies between cohorts. (D) The difference in the percentage of persons lacking the restricting HLA and harboring the relevant adapted HIV variant in Mexico versus Canada/United States. The 
   <italic>P</italic> value is derived from a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test applied to the corresponding variant frequencies between cohorts.
