  <p>Comparative Gag immune escape map for Mexico and Canada/United States. The escape map shows the location of HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV-1 subtype B 
   <italic>gag</italic> sequences from Mexico (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1,450) and Canada/United States (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1,320) at 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and q &lt; 0.2. The reference sequence represents the cohort-specific consensus sequence: blue for Mexico and gray for Canada/United States. Black dots denote codons where the consensus sequence differs between cohorts. (A) Gag positions 1 to 300; (B) Gag positions 301 to 500. One hundred amino acids are displayed per line; vertical bars separate blocks of 10 amino acids. Adapted amino acids are shown in boldface green letters and nonadapted amino acids are shown in boldface blue letters, along with their restricting HLA allele(s) (blue for Mexico, gray for Canada/United States, and red for shared associations observed at a q value of &lt;0.2 in both cohorts). Published optimal epitopes harboring HLA-polymorphism associations are shown above the consensus sequences in black. The complete list of associations can be found in Tables S7 and S8 in the supplemental material.
