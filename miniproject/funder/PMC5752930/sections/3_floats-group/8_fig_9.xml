  <p>HLA-associated HIV polymorphisms showing stronger HLA-associated selection in Mexico than in Canada/United States. We took all HLA-associated HIV polymorphisms (HAPs) identified in Mexico that were restricted by HLA alleles observed in a minimum of 10 individuals in Canada/United States and applied a phylogenetically corrected logistic regression test to compare their strengths of association across cohorts. HAPs displaying significantly stronger HLA-associated selection in Mexico (
