 <caption>
  <p>Genetic diversity of HIV-1 subtype B Gag and PR-RT from Mexico and Canada/United States. Unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees inferred from Gag (
   <italic>n</italic> = 2,771) (A) and PR-RT (B) sequences (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3,084), drawn on the same genetic distance scale. Branch color indicates the cohort to which the sequence belongs. Purple branches denote the HXB2 subtype B reference sequence. (C) Number of clusters defined by within-cluster patristic distances of ≤1.5% and bootstrap support of ≥90% in each tree. Median pairwise genetic distance comparison between Mexico (blue box) and Canada/United States (gray box) for Gag (D) and PR-RT (E).
