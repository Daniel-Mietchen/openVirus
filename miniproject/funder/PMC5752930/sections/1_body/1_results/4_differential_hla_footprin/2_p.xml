<p>In PR-RT, we identified 157 HAPs (78 adapted and 79 nonadapted) restricted by 58 HLA alleles, occurring at 70 codons, in the Mexico data set. In the Canada/United States data set we found 371 HAPs (201 adapted and 170 nonadapted) restricted by 78 HLA alleles, occurring at 105 codons (again significantly more than those in Mexico; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0039) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Overall, these summed to 470 unique HAPs identified in PR-RT, of which 58 (12.3%) were identified in both cohorts, 99 were identified only in Mexico, and 313 were identified only in Canada/United States at the predefined statistical threshold of a q value of &lt;0.2. Of note, all 7 codons (5 in Gag and 2 in PR-RT) where the consensus amino acid differed between cohorts showed evidence of HLA selection.
