<p>Given the marked immunogenetic differences in neighboring North American populations, we hypothesized that HLA-associated polymorphisms also would differ between them. We identified HAPs in the Mexican and Canada/United States data sets using established methods (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and constructed HIV immune escape maps showing HAPs identified in one or both cohorts at a q value of &lt;0.2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Tables S7 and S8). In the Mexico data set, we identified a total of 201 HAPs (108 adapted; 93 nonadapted) that occurred at 95 (of 500; 19%) Gag codons that were restricted by 66 HLA alleles. In the Canada/United States data set, we identified a total of 534 HAPs, significantly more than those in the Mexico data set (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), at 166 (32.3%) Gag codons that were restricted by 77 HLA alleles. Overall, these summed to 662 unique HAPs identified in Gag, of which 73 (11.02%) (35 adapted and 38 nonadapted, occurring at 26 Gag codons) were identified in both cohorts, 128 were identified only in Mexico, and 461 were identified only in Canada/United States at the predefined statistical threshold of a q value of &lt;0.2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), the total proportion of p24
 <sup>Gag</sup> codons harboring HAPs was lower than that of the rest of Gag, both in Mexico (12.1% [28/231] for p24 versus 24.5% [66/269] for other Gag proteins) and in Canada/United States (19.0% [44/231] versus 45.4% [122/269]). This is expected given p24
 <sup>Gag</sup>'s high overall sequence conservation (&gt;50% of codons are 99.5% to 100% conserved, which precludes identification of HLA associations at these positions). However, if one instead uses the total number of variable codons as the denominator, p24 ranks among the richest areas in the HIV proteome for HLA associations (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) which is true also for Mexico.
