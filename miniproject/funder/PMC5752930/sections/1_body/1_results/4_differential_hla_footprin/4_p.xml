<p>However, we also observed a substantial number of novel HAPs in Mexico that were not within previously described optimal epitopes. Moreover, these novel HAPs tended to be associated with Amerindian HLA alleles. Examples include A*02:06-F44Y, B*35:16-X82I, A*26:01-D230E, B*39:02-R286X, B*39:02-N315X, B*39:02-E319D, B*35:12-X357G, A*02:06-P386X, and A*68:03-K436R in Gag; B*39:06-V15I in protease; and A*02:06-I274V and A*02:06-V276I in RT.</p>
