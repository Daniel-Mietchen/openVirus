<p>As noted above, a substantial fraction of HAPs was observed in both cohorts at a q value of &lt;0.2, further supporting the existence of universal HLA-associated escape pathways across human populations globally. These shared associations included canonical CTL escape pathways within epitopes restricted by protective HLA class I alleles, including B*57:01/B*57:03-Gag-T242N (within the TW10 epitope restricted by these alleles), B*27:05-Gag-R264K and L268M (within the B*27-restricted KK10 epitope) (
