<p>Although our results reveal an overall weaker HLA footprint on HIV in Mexico than Canada/United States, nevertheless there are some exceptions. To identify these, we took all HAPs identified in Mexico that were restricted by HLA alleles observed in a minimum of 10 individuals in Canada/United States and applied a phylogenetically corrected logistic regression test to compare their strengths of association across cohorts. Of the 233 HAPs analyzed (137 in Gag and 96 in PR-RT), 45 (19.31%) exhibited significantly stronger selection, as measured by higher absolute lnOR, in Mexico than in Canada/United States (all

Among these were A*24:02-374G, A*02:06-386P, B*15:01-126S, and B*08:01-398Q in Gag, B*39:01-15 in PR, and C*04:01-324D in RT, suggesting that these HLA alleles mount stronger and/or more consistent immune pressure on these HIV sites in the Mexican population than those farther north. Of note, we found no examples of Mexican HAPs that exhibited diametrically opposed selection in Canada/United States (that is, where the significant HIV-adapted form for a given HLA allele in Mexico represented the significant nonadapted form in Canada/United States or vice versa).
