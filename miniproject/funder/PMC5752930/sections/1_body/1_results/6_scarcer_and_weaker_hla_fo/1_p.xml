<p>HLA class I typing of highly admixed human populations can be challenging due to elevated genetic diversity. To rule out ambiguous and/or imputed HLA calls as possible contributors to our observation of scarcer and weaker HLA footprints on HIV in Mexico, we repeated all analyses, excluding 255 HLA loci for which the original types were ambiguous in the Mexican cohort (these included 222 [92 HLA-A, 92 HLA-B, and 39 HLA-C] loci with phase ambiguities and 33 HLA-A or -C types that had been imputed due to failed amplification/sequencing). Results were entirely consistent with those of the original analysis (Fig. S1). First, the number and location of HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in Mexico were &gt;80% consistent with those reported in the original manuscript (∼20% discordance is expected given our use of a q value correction for multiple testing; at a q value of &lt;0.2, we expect ∼20% of identified associations to be false positives) (Fig. S1A). Second, the 
 <italic>P</italic> values of HLA-associated polymorphisms identified in the original and revised analyses are highly concordant (Spearman's 
 <italic>R</italic> of 0.825, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. S1B). Most importantly, results of the reanalysis fully corroborate our original observations of significantly fewer and weaker HLA-associated footprints in Mexico than in Canada/United States (Fig. S1C to H). These results indicate that the scarcer and weaker HLA footprints on HIV in Mexico are not explained by challenges associated with HLA typing in this population.
