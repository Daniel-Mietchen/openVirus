<p>A total of 252 HLA class I alleles, defined at subtype-level resolution, were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> and Table S6). Of these, 140 were observed in both cohorts, 67 were observed exclusively in Mexico, and 45 were exclusively in Canada/United States. In Mexico, the most frequent HLA alleles were A*02:01, A*24:02, and A*02:06 for the A locus; B*35:01, B*39:05, and B*40:02 for the B locus; and C*04:01, C*07:02, and C*03:04 for the C locus. In Canada/United States, these were A*02:01, A*03:01, and A*01:01 for the A locus; B*07:02, B*35:01, and B*08:01 for the B locus; and C*07:02, C*07:01, and C*04:01 for the C locus (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and q &lt; 0.2) in frequency between Mexico and Canada/United States (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) (note that when HLA frequencies were computed separately by cohort, 81 alleles differed significantly in frequency between Canada and Mexico, 77 between the United States and Mexico, and only 57 between Canada and the United States [Table S6]). Of these 86 HLA alleles, 41 were significantly more frequent in Mexico than in Canada/United States; these included A*24:02, A*02:06, A*68:01, A*31:01, A*68:03, B*39:05, B*40:02, B*39:06, C*04:01, C*07:02, and C*01:02 alleles, which are enriched in mestizo and Amerindian populations (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), most canonical protective HLA alleles (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) were enriched in the Canada/United States cohort compared to that from Mexico (e.g., B*57:01, B*58:01, B*27:05, B*13:02, B*42:01, B*44:03, A*25:01, and A*32:01). Overall, these results reveal marked immunogenetic differences between Mexico and Canada/United States cohorts.
