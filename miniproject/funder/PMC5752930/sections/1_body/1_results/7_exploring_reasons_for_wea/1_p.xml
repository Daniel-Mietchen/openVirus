<p>Two possibilities, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, could explain the scarcer and weaker HLA footprints on HIV in Mexico. The first is that HLA-restricted CTL responses on a given HIV codon are weaker, and/or the virus-preferred escape pathways less predictable, in Mexico than elsewhere. Therefore, for each shared adapted HAP restricted by an HLA allele observed in a minimum of 10 individuals in both cohorts, we compared its prevalence in persons expressing the restricting HLA with the hypothesis that if HLA-mediated selection was weaker or less predictable in Mexico, polymorphism prevalence in HLA-expressing persons would be lower overall in Mexico than in Canada/United States. The second possibility is that HIV sequences circulating in Mexico already harbor a high burden of HLA-adapted mutations, thus reducing the power to detect further enrichment of these variants in persons expressing the restricting HLA. We therefore also compared the prevalence of each shared adapted HAP in persons lacking the restricting HLA with the hypothesis that if circulating adaptation was higher in Mexico, these values would be higher overall in Mexico than in Canada/United States.</p>
