<p>On the other hand, the frequencies of HAPs among individuals lacking the relevant HLA allele were not overall significantly different between cohorts (

Taken together, our observations suggest that even though preadaptation of HIV to certain common HLA alleles is observed in Mexico, the sparser and weaker HLA footprints on HIV in Mexico overall are more attributable to weaker CTL pressure (and/or less reproducible escape) in this population than in those to the north.
