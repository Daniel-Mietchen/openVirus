<p>When we applied these analyses to all 61 adapted shared HAPs, we observed that, overall, the proportion of individuals expressing the restricting HLA and harboring the adapted HIV variant was a median of 2.9% lower in Mexico compared than in Canada/United States (IQR, âˆ’11.25 to 0.65%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0020 by Wilcoxon matched-pairs test) (

There was, nevertheless, a wide distribution in the data, with certain polymorphisms observed more frequently in one cohort than in the other. For example, among the HAPs that were observed more frequently among HLA-expressing persons in Canada/United States than in Mexico were well-characterized escape mutations restricted by protective HLA alleles, including Gag B*57:03-242N (with 45.5% [5/11] of Mexican B*57:03s selecting for N and 75% [18/24] of Canada/United States B*57:03s), Gag B*58:01-242N (60% [12/20] and 86.5% [44/51] for Mexico and Canada/United States, respectively), and B*51:01-RT135T (described above). In contrast, a minority of HAPs were observed more frequently among HLA-expressing persons in Mexico, including Gag B*57:03-146P (observed in 81.8% versus 54.8% of B*57:03-expressing persons in Mexico compared to Canada/United States).
