<p>We take the well-described B*51:01-RT I135T mutation as an example. While it is identified in both cohorts, its lnOR of selection is 1.23 in Mexico versus 2.40 in Canada/United States, a statistically significant difference (phylogenetically informed logistic regression test 
 <italic>P</italic> value of 8.4 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>). Computing the frequencies of RT I135T in HLA-B*51:01- and non-B*51:01-expressing individuals across cohorts, we note that less than 50% (68/143) of B*51:01-expressing Mexican individuals harbor 135T compared to nearly two-thirds of B*51:01-expressing individuals in Canada/United States (105/144) (

This suggests that the weaker association between B*51:01 and RT-135T in Mexico is because B*51-restricted CTLs in this population do not respond as strongly or frequently to the TI8 epitope (or that HIV does not escape as reproducibly via selection of T at this position in response to this pressure) as the HIV subtype B-infected populations to the north. On the other hand, the prevalence of RT-I135T in persons lacking B*51:01 is approximately 20% in both cohorts (282/1,350 and 256/1,330 for Mexico and Canada/United States, respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.3 by Fisher's exact test), suggesting that the weaker association between B*51:01 and RT-135T in Mexico is not attributable to elevated frequencies of circulating HIV harboring this mutation.
