<p>We first assessed HIV subtype B diversity and phylogenetic relationships between our cohorts. Gag and PR-RT sequences were available for 1,450 and 1,529 individuals, respectively, in Mexico, and 1,320 and 1,555 individuals, respectively, in Canada/United States. Cohort-specific consensus amino acid sequences differed at only 5 (of 500; 1%) Gag codons (positions 30, 312, 389, 403, and 490) and 2 (of 434; 0.5%) PR-RT codons (PR 93 and RT 272). Overall, Gag amino acid entropy was significantly higher in Mexico than Canada/United States (median 0.056 versus 0.026), respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001. In particular, 38.2% (191/500) of Gag codons showed significantly higher entropy in the Mexican cohort, while only 4% (20/500) showed higher entropy in the Canada/United States cohort (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.08) and in terms of the proportion of codons with significantly higher entropy in one cohort versus the other (∼17 to 18%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and Table S5). We next inferred phylogenies from Gag and PR-RT nucleotide alignments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). As expected, overall Gag sequence diversity exceeded that of PR-RT. Also as expected, given their proximity on the North American continent, Mexico and Canada/United States sequences were quite intermixed in their phylogenies (fixation indices [F
 <sub>ST</sub>] were very low for both Gag [0] and PR-RT [0.006]). Moreover, while no statistically supported clusters containing sequences from both cohorts were found at a genetic distance of ≤1.5% and bootstrap support of ≥90%, increasing the distance threshold to 4.5% yielded 3 clusters for Gag and 4 in PR-RT containing sequences from both cohorts with 90% bootstrap support. On average, Mexican Gag and PR-RT sequences exhibited higher median patristic distances compared to those of Canada/United States sequences (Gag, 0.1612 and 0.1132; PR-RT, 0.1145 and 0.0912 for Mexico and Canada/United States, respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 in both cases). Overall, results support an interlinked North American HIV-1 subtype B epidemic where overall nucleotide diversity is higher in Mexico.
