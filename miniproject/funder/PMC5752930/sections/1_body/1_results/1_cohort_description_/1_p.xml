<p>We studied two cohorts of antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1 subtype B chronically infected individuals from Mexico (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,612) and Canada/United States (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,641). Both cohorts were predominantly male (Mexico, 78.5%; Canada/United States, 85.1%). Median age at enrollment was 30 (interquartile range [IQR], 24 to 38) years in Mexico and 37 (32 to 44) years in Canada/United States. The median plasma viral load was 4.75 (IQR, 4.18 to 5.27) log
 <sub>10</sub> RNA copies/ml in Mexico and 4.98 (4.55 to 5.46) log
 <sub>10</sub> RNA copies/ml in Canada/United States. Median CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell counts were 311 (IQR, 121 to 519) cells/μl in Mexico and 260 (110 to 400) cells/μl in Canada/United States. Calendar years of enrollment were 2000 to 2014 in Mexico and 1996 to 2004 in Canada/United States.
