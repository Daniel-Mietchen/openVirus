<p>We extended this analysis by comparing HAP selection strength across cohorts in a pairwise fashion. To do this, we took the union of all HAPs identified in either Mexico and/or Canada/United States that were restricted by HLA alleles observed in a minimum of 10 individuals in both cohorts (it is not possible to compare strengths of selection of HAPs restricted by HLA alleles that are not observed, or only very rarely observed, in a given cohort). This yielded a total of 995 HAPs for analysis (Table S9). Pairwise comparison of the absolute log-transformed odds ratios (absolute lnOR) of selection for each HAP across the two cohorts revealed statistically significantly higher values for Canada/United States (median, 1.1; IQR, 0.57 to 1.8) than in Mexico (median, 0.67; IQR, 0.32 to 1.4) by Wilcoxon matched-pairs test (

Similarly, results remained consistent when the analysis was restricted to shared HAPs (a total of 73 HAPs in Gag and 58 in PR-RT were observed in both Mexico and Canada/United States and were restricted by HLA alleles observed in at least 10 individuals in both cohorts). Again, the absolute log-transformed odds ratios of selection of these HAPs were significantly higher in Canada/United States (median, 1.8; IQR, 1.3 to 2.5) than in Mexico (median, 1.7; IQR, 1.1 to 2.0) overall (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 by Wilcoxon matched-pairs test) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). These results remained consistent upon stratification by HIV protein and when analysis was restricted to unique HLA-HIV codon pairs (
 <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;0.05 in all cases; data not shown). Thus, our observations indicate that, on a per-HAP basis, HLA footprints on HIV in Mexico are, on average, significantly weaker than those in Canada/United States.
