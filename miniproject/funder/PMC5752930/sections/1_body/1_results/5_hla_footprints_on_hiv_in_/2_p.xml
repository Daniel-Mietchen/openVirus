<p>The scarcer HLA footprint in Mexico likely is at least partially attributable to the higher HIV and HLA diversity in Mexico than that in Canada/United States (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This increases the total number of HLA-HIV pairwise comparisons required for Mexico, yielding a more stringent 
 <italic>P</italic> value cutoff mapping to a q value of &lt;0.2 for this cohort. Indeed, HAP identification required 726,206 HLA-HIV comparisons for Mexico compared to 592,677 for Canada/United States, such that a q value of &lt;0.2 mapped to 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−4</sup> in Mexico but 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−3</sup> in Canada/United States (Tables S7 and S8). However, our observations are not solely explained by multiple-comparison correction. This is because, in addition to HLA footprints being scarcer overall, the statistical strengths of association between HLA alleles and HIV codons in Mexico also are weaker overall than those observed in Canada/United States. For example, a comparison of ranked −log
 <sub>10</sub>-transformed 
 <italic>P</italic> values for the top 201 Gag and 157 PR-RT associations between cohorts (201 and 157, because these represented the total number of HAPs identified at a q value of &lt;0.2 in Gag and PR-RT in Mexico) reveals that the Canada/United States one was always higher (i.e., more significant) than its corresponding Mexican one of the same ranking (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">B</xref>). This indicates that the strongest HLA footprints in Mexico overall are far weaker than the strongest HLA footprints in Canada/United States. Moreover, when analyzing only the −log
 <sub>10</sub>
 <italic>P</italic> value distribution of HAPs identified in Mexico, we observed lower (less significant) overall values for those identified exclusively in Mexico compared to those shared with Canada/United States for both Gag (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and PR-RT (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0435) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">D</xref>). Thus, the strength of association between HLA alleles and HIV codons appears to be inherently weaker in Mexico than in Canada/United States, and of the HLA footprints that are detectable in Mexico, the strongest tend to be ones that are already known, whereas the novel HAPs restricted by unique mestizo HLA alleles tend to be even weaker.
