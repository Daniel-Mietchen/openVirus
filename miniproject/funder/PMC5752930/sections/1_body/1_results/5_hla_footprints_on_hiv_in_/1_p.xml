<p>A particularly striking observation from our analysis was the overall lower number of HLA footprints in Mexico than in Canada/United States, despite cohorts being of comparable sizes. For example, considering only HIV codons at which adapted associations were identified with one or more HLA alleles, not only did the Mexican cohort exhibit fewer such codons in Gag than the Canada/United States cohort (108 at 75 Gag codons versus 273 at 133 Gag codons, respectively;

Specifically, of all Gag codons harboring HLA-adapted associations, fewer than 10% were identified exclusively in Mexico, while the remainder were observed in both cohorts (41%) or in Canada/United States only (49%) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">C</xref>). Similar results were observed for PR-RT (78 adapted associations at 49 positions in Mexico versus 201 adapted associations at 87 positions in Canada/United States; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), where 10% were exclusively observed in Mexico, 40% were observed in both cohorts, and 50% were observed in Canada/United States only (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">F</xref>). As a result, the number of immunogenic zones (defined as consecutive HIV amino acids harboring an adapted HLA association) also differed markedly between cohorts: whereas stretches of up to 11 positions under HLA pressure were observed in Canada/United States (e.g., Gag 118 to 128), the longest such zone was only 3 amino acids for Mexico. Furthermore, where immunogenic zones did occur in Mexico, these tended to coincide with zones also identified in Canada/United States (e.g., Gag 146 to 148 and PR 35 to 37).
