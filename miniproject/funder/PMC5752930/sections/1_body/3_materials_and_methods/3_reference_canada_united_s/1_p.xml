<p>A reference population, comprising two published cohorts of antiretroviral treatment-naive, HIV-1 subtype B-infected individuals from Canada (the British Columbia Observational Medical Evaluation and Research [HOMER] cohort; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,103) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and the United States (AIDS Clinical Trials Group [ACTG] protocol 5142 participants who also provided human DNA under ACTG protocol 5128; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 538) (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), for whom HIV sequences linked to HLA class I types were available, was used as a comparison group. The Canada/United States cohort was chosen as a reference because the epidemics in these two countries and in Mexico are geographically linked, concentrated in persons with similar risk factors, and predominantly HIV subtype B. The Canada/United States cohorts, along with another from Australia, were previously used to identify HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV subtype B (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); here, the Canada/United States cohorts were reanalyzed for HLA footprints specific to North America. As described previously (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), the majority of HLA class I types were defined at subtype-level resolution; missing or intermediate-resolution data were imputed to subtype level using a machine-learning algorithm trained on HLA-A, -B, and -C subtypes from &gt;13,000 individuals with known ethnicity (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Extensive validations of method robustness to HLA imputations are provided in reference 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, as are instructions for access to paired HIV/HLA data from this cohort.
