<p>For 
 <italic>pol</italic> (PR-RT) sequences, amplification of HIV protease (99 amino acids) and the first 335 amino acids of the RT was performed using a previously described in-house protocol (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Sequences were obtained with a 3730xl genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher) and assembled using the automated base-calling software RECall (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Negative controls were included in all amplification runs and monthly phylogenetic controls were performed, including laboratory HIV strains, to detect possible contamination.
