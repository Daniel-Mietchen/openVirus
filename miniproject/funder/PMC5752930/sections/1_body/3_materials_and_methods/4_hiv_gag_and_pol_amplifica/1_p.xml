<p>Viral RNA was isolated from cryopreserved plasma (1 ml) using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). For 
 <italic>gag</italic> amplification, primers 623Fi, AAATCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAG (HXB2 genomic nucleotide positions 623 to 649), and 2cRx (2826 to 2849) were used for the first-round reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>) with a Super Script III OneStep RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the following PCR conditions: 30 min at 55°C and 2 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 2 min at 68°C, and finishing with 5 min at 68°C. Second-round products were obtained with primers G1, GCAGGACTCGGCTTGCTGAA (positions 691 to 710), and G10, TATCATCTGCTCCTGTATC (2343 to 2325), using Platinum 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and the following PCR conditions: 3 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, and 2 min at 72°C, and finishing with 5 min at 72°C. All positive 
 <italic>gag</italic> products confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Sequences were obtained with eight primers (G2F, GCGGCGACTGGTGAGTA [734 to 750]; GS1R, TTATCTAAAGCTTCCTTGGTGTCT [1074 to 1097]; GAS3F, CATCAATGAGGAAGCTGCAG [1401 to 1420]; GAS4R, GGTTCTCTCATCTGGCCTGG [1462 to 1481]; GAS5F, CTCTAAGAGCCGAGCAAGCT [1697 to 1716]; GAS6R, AAAATAGTCTTACAATCTGG [1771 to 1790]; HPR1977F, GTTAAGTGTTTCAATTGTGG [1957 to 1976]; and GA2274R, TCTTTATTGTGACGAGGGGTCG [2274 to 2295]) using BigDye v3.1 chemistry on a 3730xl genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Sequences were assembled and manually edited using Geneious v5.6.7 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) and then aligned using MEGA 7 software (
