<p>Further validation of our HLA typing method in the context of a Mexican mestizo population was performed, analyzing HLA data from 323 individuals from Mexico City for whom HLA typing had been performed by amplifying exons 1 to 8 for HLA-A and HLA-C and exons 1 to 7 for HLA-B followed by next-generation sequencing (TruSight HLA kit; Illumina), thereby resolving gametic phase and achieving the highest possible typing resolution. In a blinded manner, we extracted the exon 2 and 3 consensus sequences (i.e., without gametic-phase resolution) from these patients and reinterpreted them as described above. Accuracy was 99.89% for HLA subtypes assigned by sequencing all exons with gametic-phase resolution versus exons 2 and 3 without gametic-phase resolution and those at four-digit resolution (only 1 out of 969 HLA loci was inaccurate). The results of this validation are shown in Table S2.</p>
