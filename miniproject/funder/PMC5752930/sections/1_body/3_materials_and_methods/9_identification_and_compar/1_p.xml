<p>HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV subtype B Gag and PR-RT were identified in the Mexico and Canada/United States cohorts separately using a published phylogenetically informed statistical model that corrects for potential host and viral genetic confounders, including HLA linkage disequilibrium, the HIV phylogeny, and HIV codon covariation (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The model identifies two types of associations: adapted (viral amino acids overrepresented in individuals expressing the HLA allele, representing the inferred escape form) and nonadapted (viral amino acids underrepresented in individuals expressing the HLA allele, representing the inferred susceptible form). All associations with a q value of &lt;0.2 were organized into immune escape maps. We also wished to compare the strengths of association of individual HAPs across the two cohorts. To do this, we took the union of all HAPs identified in Mexico and/or Canada/United States that were restricted by HLA class I alleles observed in a minimum of 10 individuals in both cohorts and applied a published phylogenetically corrected logistic regression to test whether their strengths of selection by the restricting HLA allele differed significantly between the cohorts (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Briefly, for each HAP of interest, the model computes a 
 <italic>P</italic> value testing whether HLA-mediated selection is the same in Mexico and Canada/United States (null hypothesis) or whether selection differs between cohorts (alternative hypothesis) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As before, a q value of &lt;0.2 was defined as the significance threshold for the differential escape analysis. Finally, to demonstrate that our HLA imputation/ambiguity resolution method does not significantly affect HAP recovery or association strength in the Mexican cohort, we repeat all analyses excluding all ambiguous and imputed HLA loci for this cohort and verified that all original observations still held (Table S3 and Fig. S1).
