<p>Antiretroviral-naive, chronically HIV-1 subtype B-infected Mexican individuals were enrolled from 2000 to 2014 as part of a national project to assess HIV molecular epidemiology, drug resistance surveillance, and HLA adaptation. Participants were enrolled by convenience sampling in HIV clinics and reference hospitals in Mexico City and the states of Baja California, Campeche, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Colima, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Michoacan, Morelos, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Sonora, State of Mexico, Tabasco, Tlaxcala, Veracruz, and Yucatan. Each participant donated a single blood sample from which plasma and buffy coat/peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cryopreserved. All blood samples were processed at the Center for Research in Infectious Diseases (CIENI) of INER in Mexico City. HIV plasma viral load was determined with the m2000 system (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA). CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell counts were determined by flow cytometry using the TruCount kit in a FACSCanto II instrument (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).
