 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were aligned to the HIV HXB2 reference strain using an in-house alignment algorithm based on HyPhy (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>), and columns where HXB2 was gapped were stripped out. Shannon entropy of amino acid alignments was computed using the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (

Maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred with FastTree (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Phylogenies were colored using Rainbow Tree (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Patristic distances were extracted from cohort-specific phylogenies using PATRISTIC (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence clusters, defined by within-cluster patristic distances of ≤1.5% and bootstrap support values of ≥90%, were identified using Cluster Picker (The University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom) (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). This genetic distance threshold has been used previously for inferring transmission clusters in chronic cohorts (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). HIV genetic compartmentalization between cohorts was assessed using the fixation index (F
 <sub>ST</sub>) score (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) implemented in HyPhy (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>).
