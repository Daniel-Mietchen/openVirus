<p>Identification of HLA-associated footprints is relevant to HIV vaccine design. An effective vaccine will need to elicit sustained immune responses capable of recognizing genetically diverse viral strains from which HIV cannot escape (ideal) or can only escape at substantial fitness cost (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). One promising strategy is to select immunogenic yet mutationally constrained viral regions as vaccine antigens (e.g., see references 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which can be further optimized for natural sequence coverage (e.g., using mosaic designs [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). HLA footprints are vaccine relevant because they identify HIV regions under significant and consistent immune pressure by particular HLA-restricted CTLs (i.e., immunogenic regions) and the common mutational pathways that HIV uses to evade them. As such, evaluation of HLA footprints in concert with information on sequence conservation, mutational fitness costs, and escape mechanisms can be used to identify immunogenic yet constrained viral regions and immune-relevant natural HIV sequence variation within them. For example, conserved epitopes and their common variants that retain intracellular processing and HLA binding ability might be considered immunogens, albeit with some caution (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In particular, comparative analyses of HLA footprints in immunogenetically distinct host populations, wherein the same HIV subtype circulates, can illuminate the extent to which viral immunogenic regions and escape pathways are universal versus host population specific, thus potentially informing the design of universal and geographically tailored vaccine strategies.
