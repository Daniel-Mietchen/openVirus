<p>Toward this goal, we compare HLA-associated HIV footprints in Gag and Pol in two large North American populations: the immunogenetically distinctive Mexican mestizo population, which features a mixture of Caucasian and Amerindian HLA alleles (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and the population of Canada/United States. Our study thus represents a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of host immunogenetics on HLA-associated adaptation in geographically proximal HIV subtype B epidemics. The present study significantly extends a preliminary study of HIV Pol adaptation by our group (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) by increasing cohort size by more than 5-fold, performing all adaptation analyses at HLA subtype-level resolution, and additionally analyzing Gag. As such, it represents the largest comparative study to date of differential HIV adaptation to HLA across human populations. Gag and Pol were studied because these proteins are rich in conserved epitopes where escape can be fitness costly (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and where responses to these epitopes are associated with superior viremia control (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Overall, our results confirm that adaptation of HIV to HLA in Mexico, like in other global populations, occurs along broadly predictable pathways. HLA footprints observed in Mexico include canonical adaptation pathways described in many other populations (e.g., B*57 Gag-T242N [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and B*51 RT-135X [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) as well as novel pathways attributable to the unique HLA distribution of Mesoamerican peoples (e.g., Gag A*02:06-F44Y, B*39:02-E319D, and A*68:03-K436R; PR B*39:06-V15I and B*39:02-K70R; RT B*39:02-E79D, A*68:03-R103K, and B*35:12-P294S/T). Of note, however, HLA-associated HIV footprints in Mexico were fewer overall, and their strengths of selection significantly weaker, than those in Canada/United States, raising the intriguing hypothesis that HLA-restricted immune responses to HIV in Mexico are less potent, and/or HIV mutational escape pathways somewhat less consistent, than those in other populations.
