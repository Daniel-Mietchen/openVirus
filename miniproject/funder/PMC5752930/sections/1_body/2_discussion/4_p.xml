<p>Before proposing possible underlying mechanisms, some limitations and potential confounders merit mention. First, cohort CD4 count distributions suggest more advanced infection in the Canada/United States than in the Mexico cohort; we therefore cannot rule out a longer time for within-host escape mutations to accumulate (and, thus, enhanced ability to detect them) in the former. However, given that the majority of escape occurs in the initial year or two following infection (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), that escape is sufficiently frequent and reproducible to be detected at the population level as early as 6 months postinfection (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), and that both study cohorts are well into chronic infection, this is unlikely to fully account for the weaker HLA footprints on HIV in Mexico. Second, the cohort enrollment period was later for Mexico (2000 to 2014) than for Canada/United States (1996 to 2004) and HIV sequence diversity was higher, raising the possibility that the Mexican epidemic was older at the time of sampling than the Canada/United States one (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and, thus, more preadapted to its host population (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). If so, this could reduce our overall ability to identify HAPs; however, we observed no strong evidence to support widespread preadaptation to all HLA alleles in Mexico (although evidence of HIV adaptation to certain common HLA alleles was indeed noted) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>). Furthermore, despite both epidemics being HIV subtype B, we cannot rule out the possibility that regional differences in viral backbone influence adaptation pathways. However, the phylogenetic intermixing of study HIV sequences and the observation of cohort consensus differences at only 7/934 (0.75%) HIV codons argues against this as a major confounder. It is also important to note that, when designating a particular HAP as shared versus unique to a given cohort, we are referring to HAPs identified at a q value of &lt;0.2 in both versus only one cohort, respectively. HAPs unique to a given cohort may still be present in the other cohort above this significance threshold. Finally, we have not measured HLA-associated immune responses directly in this study; rather, we are using HLA footprint data to make inferences regarding the strength and reproducibility of HLA-restricted antiviral cellular immune responses in given host populations (
