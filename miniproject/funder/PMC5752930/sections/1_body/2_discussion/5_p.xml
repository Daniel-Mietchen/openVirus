<p>We propose some hypotheses as to why HLA-mediated pressures on HIV may be weaker in Mexico. First, it is possible that targeting of specific HLA-restricted CTL epitopes, and/or immunodominance hierarchies, are not as consistent in Mexico as in other populations. Host immunogenetic differences in genes encoding proteins that interact with HLA, in particular the T-cell receptor repertoire, also could explain differential recognition and/or escape within a given HLA-restricted CTL epitope across human populations (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Indeed, our observation of substantial differential selection of HIV polymorphisms by HLA alleles present in both cohorts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) supports host factors beyond HLA in mediating these differences. Marked differences in HLA subtype distributions (e.g., the greater diversity of HLA-B*35 subtypes in Mexico than in Canada/United States) also may play a role, as closely related HLA alleles with similar or identical epitope binding motifs nevertheless may target epitopes at different frequencies with different functional avidities and elicit differential escape pathways (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). The possibility of HLA locus-specific differences is also intriguing. Consistent with a dominant influence of HLA-B in mediating anti-HIV immune responses (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), &gt;50% of HAPs identified in Mexico and Canada/United States were HLA-B restricted; however, whereas an average of 12 HAPs were identified per HLA-B allele in Canada/United States, only 2.8 HAPs were identified per HLA-B allele in Mexico. In contrast, the average number of HAPs per HLA-A and -C allele were only 2-fold lower in Mexico than in Canada/United States (e.g., 5 and 3.4 per HLA-A and HLA-C allele in Mexico and 11 and 7.8 in Canada/United States), raising the intriguing possibility that individual HLA-B alleles do not restrict as broad or potent an anti-HIV immune response in Mexico as elsewhere. Also intriguing was our observation of relatively strong positive relationships between HLA frequency and the number of HLA-restricted adapted HAPs in Canada/United States (Spearman's rho of 0.4098 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003 for Gag and rho of 0.3358 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0062 for PR-RT) but far less so in Mexico (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0954 and rho of 0.2137 for Gag and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0539 and rho of 0.2893 for PR-RT) (data not shown). Notable examples include B*35:01 (that restricts 3 adapted associations in Mexico and 12 in Canada/United States despite being present at comparable allele frequency) and A*02:01 (that restricts 2 adapted HIV associations in Mexico and 8 in Canada/United States despite being present at comparable frequency across cohorts). Converging selection pressures by different HLA alleles on the same HIV codon also may play a role. RT codon 135, for example, harbors diametrically opposed HAPs restricted by different HLA alleles (B*51:01-135T and B*15:03-135I); it is intriguing that the latter HAP is among the few that are significantly stronger in Mexico than in Canada/United States, which could conceivably influence the strength of the B*51:01-135T association in Mexico. Overall, our observations highlight the need for detailed assessments of HLA-restricted CTL responses, possibly supplemented with the characterization of T-cell receptor genetic and functional diversity in the Mexican mestizo population for select HLA-restricted HIV epitopes. Our observations also support extension of our analyses to other immunogenic HIV proteins, such as Nef, which exhibit high HAP densities (
