<p>Furthermore, a much larger fraction of HAPs identified in Mexico constituted associations shared with Canada/United States than vice versa. For example, 36.6% (131/358) of HAPs identified in Mexico were shared with Canada/United States (that is, only 63.4% were specific to Mexico), whereas of the 905 associations identified in Canada/United States, 774 (85.5%) were exclusive to this region and only 131 (14.5%) were shared with Mexico. In other words, the footprints left on HIV by typical Mexican (i.e., mestizo) alleles were fewer than expected given the size of the cohort. Moreover, absolute âˆ’log

 <italic>P</italic> values and lnOR of HAP unique to Mexico were significantly weaker than those shared with Canada/United States. Finally, it is worth noting that the stronger HLA footprint in Canada/United States than in Mexico is not likely to be driven by the lower frequencies of canonical protective alleles in the latter region. Support for this is provided by our analyses comparing the proportion of individuals expressing the restricting HLA and harboring the escape variant of interest, which are agnostic to HLA frequency. For example, Gag-242N was observed in 75% (18/24) of B*57:03-expressing persons in Canada/United States but only 45.5% (5/11) in Mexico and Canada/United States, suggesting weaker selection strength in Mexico independent of B*57:03 prevalence. Together, our observations suggest that population-level HLA pressures on HIV, in particular those attributable to HLAs enriched among mestizos, are inherently weaker in Mexico than in populations to the north.
