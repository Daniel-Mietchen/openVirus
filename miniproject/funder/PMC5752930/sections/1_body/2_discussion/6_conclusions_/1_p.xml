<p>Comparative HLA footprint studies are relevant to HIV vaccine design because they illuminate the extent to which viral immunogenic regions, and their associated escape pathways, are universal versus population specific. Combined with information on sequence conservation, fitness costs, and escape mechanisms, HLA footprints can be used to identify immunogenic yet constrained viral regions, and their common sequence variants, for potential vaccine inclusion. In particular, HLA footprints can guide the discovery of novel epitopes and/or immunogenic regions (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), which may be of particular importance in understudied populations with unique HLA distributions. HLA footprints may similarly prove useful in the context of therapeutic vaccinations for reservoir eradication (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>), for example, by analyzing autologous HIV reservoir sequences to assess the burden of escape therein. Our study extends a growing body of evidence supporting both universal and population-specific HLA-associated footprints on HIV, even among neighboring epidemics where the same HIV subtype circulates. While the identification of shared immunogenic regions in Gag and Pol could support the notion of an HIV subtype B vaccine tailored to North American sequence diversity, the identification of novel HIV adaptation pathways restricted by typical mestizo HLA alleles and, more importantly, the unexpected observation of a significantly scarcer and weaker HLA footprint on HIV in Mexico raises intriguing questions regarding the strength and quality of HLA-restricted antiviral immunity in the Mexican mestizo population and what implications this might have for vaccine-induced immune responses. Thus, detailed characterizations of HLA-restricted CTL responses in this unique population are merited.
