<p>Although HLA-associated polymorphisms in HIV are being elucidated increasingly in global populations (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>), our study is notable because it compares HLA footprints identified in Mexico, which comprises a highly genetically admixed and, thus, immunogenetically unique mestizo population that includes mainly Amerindian and European but also African and East Asian ancestry components (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), to those in HIV subtype B-infected populations to the north (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), allowing us to investigate the impact of host immunogenetics on HIV adaptation in neighboring epidemics. We observed that HLA footprints on HIV in Mexico include well-known associations, such as those restricted by protective HLA class I alleles (e.g., Gag B*57:01-T242N, Gag B*27:05-R264K/L268M [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and RT B*51:01-I135T [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]), as well as novel associations restricted by HLA alleles enriched in mestizo populations (e.g., B*39:02, B*39:05, B*35:12, B*35:14, A*02:06, and A*68:03). Our results strengthen the growing body of evidence supporting both universal and region-specific immune escape pathways attributable to host population immunogenetic composition (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).
