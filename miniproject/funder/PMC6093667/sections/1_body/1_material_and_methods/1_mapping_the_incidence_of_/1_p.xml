<p>To better understand the co-distribution of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus in Brazil we collated data on reported cases (per 100,000 inhabitants) for all three pathogens from 2014 to 2016. Data including the total number of cases per year and per state for each virus were obtained from epidemiological Bulletins from the Brazilian Ministry of Health database, (until Volume 48, representing cumulative data until week 52 of 2016) [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], confirmed by information available at each Brazil Federal Unit’s Secretary of Health. Bulletins from the Brazilian Ministry of Health database are technical-scientific publications edited by the Department of Health Surveillance, are circulated with monthly and weekly frequency, and are used for reporting the monitoring activities and investigation of specific seasonal diseases. Specifically, they report the total number of cases notified by each State Secretary. The data obtained for Zika in 2015 consist of suspected and/or confirmed cases, as most of them were only confirmed in 2016. Confirmation is based on RT-PCR and serology methodologies. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for studies that reported outbreaks of dengue (family Flaviviridae), Zika and chikungunya (family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) from 2010, including cases of co-infections. The search terms used were: “
 <italic>Outbreak”</italic>, 
 <italic>“Zika”</italic>, 
 <italic>“Chikungunya”</italic>,
 <italic>”Dengue”</italic>, 
 <italic>“Brazil”</italic>, and 
 <italic>“Co-infections”</italic>. Maps of arbovirus incidence (per 100,000) per Brazilian Federal Unit were constructed using the package 
 <italic>tmap</italic> in R software [
