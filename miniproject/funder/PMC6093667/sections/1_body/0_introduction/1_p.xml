<p>Zika, dengue and chikungunya are arboviral diseases transmitted by mosquitoes from the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>. The co-circulation of these viruses in Brazil, sharing the same vectors and causing similar symptoms, represents a major public health challenge. Dengue fever is the most important re-emerging mosquito-borne viral disease worldwide. In Brazil, the incidence of dengue has been frequently high, with 1.49 million cases reported in 2016 [
