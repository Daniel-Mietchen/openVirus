<p>The initial epidemic of the Zika virus was also reported in the Northeast region, spreading eventually to other states. Few studies in Brazil have reported the co-circulation and/or co-infection of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya in the Northeast region [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In Bahia, a small study using metagenomic next-generation sequencing approach revealed that 13.3% of patients with confirmed Zika virus infection were actually co-infected with chikungunya virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Other studies worldwide have also reported co-infections with various combinations of chikungunya/dengue and Zika in endemic and epidemic regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It has also been shown that 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes can co-transmit all combinations of these viruses simultaneously without affecting vector competence [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The effect of co-infections in the development of infection and disease outcome is poorly defined, particularly due to the limited clinical information, misdiagnosis and lack of laboratory testing. However, some studies have indicated that previous arboviral infections or co-infections may represent a risk factor for severe clinical manifestations [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Pre-existing anti-dengue immunity can promote substantial enhancement of Zika virus infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as increased morbidity and mortality in mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Also, dengue-specific antibodies enhance the infection of a primary Brazilian Zika isolate in K562 cell line [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Even though our data did not show an association of infection-related microcephaly cases and the distribution of dengue fever, it is important to note that dengue is endemic in the Northeast region, with 573.3 reported cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Dengue transmission is permanent in all regions where Zika and chikungunya infection were reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and there is a high probability of previous or co-infection of dengue with either virus. In relation to the observed outbreaks of chikungunya and Zika, these infections partially overlap by time and space [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], as described in more detail for regions in the Northeast including Pernambuco, Recife [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and Bahia [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], indicating that previous or co-infection of these virus is possible. It is important to note that the overlap in space-time distribution of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya cases is challenging to report, particularly due to the number of asymptomatic cases and the possible presence of non-specific clinical manifestations which are difficult to diagnose.
