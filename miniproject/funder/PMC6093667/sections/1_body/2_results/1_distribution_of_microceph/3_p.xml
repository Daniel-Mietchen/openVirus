<p>Although it is now established that Zika virus is the cause of severe fetal complications in pregnancy, including microcephaly, the distribution of reported Zika cases and infection-related microcephaly do not overlap (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201452.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In fact, there is no correlation between the number of Zika reported cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2015 or 2016 and the distribution of infection-related microcephaly in Brazil (Parts A and D of 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201452.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) (Correlation R
 <sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.25; P ≥ 0.212). During the same period Brazil experienced simultaneous transmission of dengue and chikungunya. During January-September 2016, Brazil recorded 200,465 Zika cases, 236,287 chikungunya cases and 1,438,624 dengue cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is possible that co-infection increases the severity of symptoms, as previously shown [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In Brazil, few studies have reported the co-circulation and/or co-infection of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya [

 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, the number of chikungunya cases reported from 2014 to 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201452.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) is predominant in the Northeast region. By 2016 the incidence of chikungunya virus increased in the whole country but it remained mostly concentrated in the Northeast (407.7/100,000) followed by the North (44/100,000) region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201452.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). All of the 9 Federal Units from the Northeast region recorded chikungunya cases in excess of 80 per 100,000 habitants. In addition, Amapa and Tocantins states in the North, and Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast, also had a very high number of reported cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201452.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). There is a significant overlap in the distribution of infection-related microcephaly cases and of chikungunya infection (Part B and E of 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201452.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) (R
 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.57; P ≤ 0.002). There have been reports that associated chikungunya infection with an increase in neurologic manifestations, including Guillain-Barre syndrome and encephalitis, encephalopathy and microcephaly [

 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. An investigation in the state of Salvador reported the intense chikungunya transmission between June and November 2015 and the co-occurrence with the Guillain-Barre syndrome outbreak in the city [
 <xref rid="pone.0201452.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It has also been suggested that the local health authorities have underestimated chikungunya transmission, as attention was focused on the Zika and microcephaly outbreaks [
