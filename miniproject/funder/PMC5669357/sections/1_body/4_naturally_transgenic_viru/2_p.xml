<p>Integration of viral sequences in a plant genome was first realized in banana carrying fragments of banana streak virus, a pararetrovirus with a double-stranded DNA genome encapsidated in bacilliform particles [

Some of the integrated sequences may be reactivated and cause disease when plants are affected by stress or other exceptional circumstances, such as tissue culture or interspecific crosses. However, pararetroviruses are mostly dormant and the host plants are rather resistant to them; indeed, retroviruses integrated in the plant genome may confer resistance against infecting homologous viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0795" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The most likely mechanism of resistance is RNA silencing induced against the endogenous sequences as a method to control viral expression. Sequences of other DNA and RNA viruses are also found integrated in plant genomes [
