<p>Recently, natural transgenes corresponding to the transfer DNAs (T-DNA) of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> spp. were found integrated in the sweetpotato genome, which raises a question about their possible role in host defense or crop domestication [

 </xref>]. T-DNAs of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> are also found in other plant species [
 <xref rid="bib0775" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], analogous to transgenic plants created by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation. It is more common, however, to find viral sequences integrated in plant genomes, which is comparable to plants transformed by particle bombardment and results in random integration of DNA in the plant genome.
