<p>Taken together, the recently adopted methods for genome editing, such as CRISPR-Cas9, are directly adopted from living organisms and, hence, incompatible with the traditional definitions of genetic engineering and transgenic plants. It is also apparent that RNA silencing against virus-derived sequences occurs naturally in plants on a large scale based on viral sequences integrated into plant genomes. It could be time to reconsider what is ‘transgenic’ and requires regulation. Reassessment of the rules and regulations could conclude that deregulation of virus resistance mediated by homology-based RNA silencing might be reasonable.</p>
