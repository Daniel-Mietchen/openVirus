<p>MSV causes maize streak disease, a major constraint of maize production in Africa [
 <xref rid="bib0750" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Dominant and recessive natural resistance genes are available for protecting crops against MSV. Furthermore, engineered resistance to MSV is available in transgenic maize plants by expression of a defective form of a viral gene involved in viral replication [
 <xref rid="bib0755" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and was the first transgenic crop plant developed in Africa. A better transgene expression system activated only by MSV infection is under preparation [
