<p>Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV, a member of the genus 
 <italic>Sobemovirus</italic>) causes a major disease in rice that is used as an example of the key role of agricultural intensification in plant virus emergence [
 <xref rid="bib0740" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The recessive resistance genes in rice germplasm can be overcome by the virus [
 <xref rid="bib0745" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. As early as 1998, however, highly efficient resistance generated by expression of open reading frame 2 of RYMV was achieved in transgenic lines of African rice varieties. Resistance remained stable over at least three generations and conferred resistance to a wide range of RYMV isolates [
 <xref rid="bib0560" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because rice is seed-propagated, the transgenic resistance trait can be introgressed into local varieties via crossing. However, to our knowledge, these lines never progressed beyond the proof-of-concept stage.
