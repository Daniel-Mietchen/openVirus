<p>Sweetpotato (
 <italic>Ipomoea batatas</italic> Lam.) originates from South and Central America, but has a particularly significant role as a subsistence crop in Africa [
 <xref rid="bib0620" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The importance of the sweetpotato increased during the aforementioned CMD epidemic in 1990s. Sweetpotato is a generally healthy crop, suffering from only a few diseases. Over 30 viruses infect sweetpotatoes, but most of them cause mild or no symptoms and only minor yield losses. The main disease is SPVD, which is characterized by severe symptoms of leaf malformation and stunted plant growth. Diseased plants may fail to produce any tuberous roots for consumption. SPVD develops in sweetpotato plants co-infected with the whitefly-transmitted SPCSV and virtually any other sweetpotato virus [

Targeting SPCSV with pathogen-derived resistance using various genomic regions of SPCSV as transgenes significantly reduces accumulation of SPCSV in transgenic sweetpotato plants, but infection of these plants with other sweetpotato viruses breaks down resistance and induces severe symptoms [
