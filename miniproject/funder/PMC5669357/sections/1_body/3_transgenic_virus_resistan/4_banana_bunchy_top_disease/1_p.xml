<p>Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) is transmitted by aphids and is the most destructive viral pathogen of bananas and plantains worldwide. It originates in Asia, was introduced to Africa probably from the South Pacific [

 <xref rid="bib0725" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and has now reached most areas of sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="bib0710" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. BBTV is currently a major food security concern, because infected bunches are difficult to recognize by smallholder farmers and will yield no usable fruit. Shekhawat 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0730" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] were able to generate high levels of resistance to BBTV by targeting the viral replicase gene with intron-hairpin-RNA transcripts. This approach was also efficient against other virus members of the family
