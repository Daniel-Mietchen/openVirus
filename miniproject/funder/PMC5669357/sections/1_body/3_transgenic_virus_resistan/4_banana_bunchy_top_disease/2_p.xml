<p>The challenge in introducing transgenic resistance to different banana cultivars lies in the sterility of the vegetatively propagated cultivars and the need to transform each cultivar separately, which is not a trivial task. On the other hand, as banana cultivars are essentially sterile, transgene flow to other cultivars or wild 
 <italic>Musa</italic> species is unlikely. Since copy numbers and integration sites of transgenes are difficult to control, application of modern genome-editing technologies could allow targeting of specific host genes [
