<p>Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is caused by two closely related whitefly-transmitted ipomoviruses [
 <xref rid="bib0435" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Both viruses cause similar symptoms, namely severe necrosis in the storage roots making them inedible, but only mild symptoms in leaves. CBSD was reported in the coastal area of East Africa in the 1930s, but a new major epidemic started in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya in the mid-1990s [

Local resistance breeding programs have increased tolerance to symptom formation in new cassava varieties, but resistance to the brown streak viruses has not yet been achieved. However, transformation of the Ugandan farmer-preferred cassava cultivar TME with a virus-derived inverted repeat construct appears effective against both brown streak viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0690" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], but inadvertently resulted in the loss of resistance of CMD by the 
 <italic>CMD2</italic> gene, apparently as an unexpected consequence of the somatic embryogenesis process involved in regenerating transgenic plants [
