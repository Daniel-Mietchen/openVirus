<p>Cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz) is very important as a subsistence crop in Africa. The cassava mosaic epidemic started and spread quickly in East Africa in the mid-1990s, devastating cassava crops entirely in many regions. The disease escalated when African cassava mosaic virus and virulent recombinants with other whitefly-transmitted cassava-infecting begomoviruses co-infected cassava plants, resulting in synergism, very severe symptoms, growth retardation and new virulent recombinants of the viruses [
