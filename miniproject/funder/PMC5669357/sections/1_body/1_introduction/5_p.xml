<p>Considerable efforts have been invested to develop virus resistance to many different viruses affecting crops relevant to agriculture and food production in developing countries. The main target crops, besides those mentioned above, have been potato (

However, all have remained at the proof-of-concept stage, and none has passed the regulatory system to the stage of approval for cultivation in developing countries. In fact, only seven transgenic crop species engineered for virus resistance have been approved for cultivation anywhere in the world (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and only a handful of those have been commercialized. The reasons that these and other virus-resistant transgenic crops have not made it to release in developing countries include a lack of regulatory framework, limited commercial interest and investments, and strong opposition from lobby groups.
