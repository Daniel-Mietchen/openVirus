<p>Viral diseases constitute a major threat to crop production worldwide. The problem is exacerbated in developing countries, particularly in tropical areas where crop-free seasons are rare and plants are under continuous pressure from viruses transmitted by vectors from both cultivated and wild plants [

 <italic>Machlomovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Tombusviridae</italic>) and the potyvirus sugarcane mosaic virus (a member of the family 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic>) [

 <italic>sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus</italic> (SPCSV, a member of the family 
 <italic>Closteroviridae</italic>) and the potyvirus sweet potato feathery mottle virus [
