<p>Natural sources of resistance to many viral diseases of tropical crops are known and deployed in breeding. In many cases, however, resistance sources are lacking, or the genetic complexity and difficulties in introgressing resistance genes to cultivars by crossing hamper the efforts of crop improvement. Therefore, development and transfer of resistance to crops by biotechnological means offers an attractive alternative solution.</p>
