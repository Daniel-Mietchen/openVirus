<p>The studies of Powell Abel 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [

 </xref>] in the 1980s showed that transformation of tobacco plants (
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L.) to express the coat protein of tobacco mosaic virus made the plants resistant to this virus. Similarly, transformation of plants to express non-structural viral proteins [
 <xref rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and truncated, defective viral genes also provided protection against homologous viruses [
 <xref rid="bib0460" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These findings created much excitement and hope for a quick solution to viral disease problems in crop plants. The mechanism of resistance in genetically engineered plants became comprehensible with the discovery of post-transcriptional gene silencing (i.e., RNA silencing or RNAi) [
 <xref rid="bib0465" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which informed further improvements in construct design, such as binary vectors expressing virus-specific inverted-repeat (hairpin) RNA to target the virus to degradation by RNAi [
