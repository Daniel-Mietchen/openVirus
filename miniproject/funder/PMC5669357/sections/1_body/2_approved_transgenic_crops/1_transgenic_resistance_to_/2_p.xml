<p>Potatoes are clonally propagated and thus prone to build up viral infections over generations. In industrial countries, potato viruses are controlled by planting certified virus-free seed potatoes produced under special cultivation schemes. Combined with control of the aphid vectors using pesticides, this has led to a reduction in the prevalence of PLRV over the past 30 years. In low-income countries, however, potato viruses are common and losses are severe, because healthy seed potatoes and pesticides are not commonly available or affordable [

Introgression of virus resistance genes to new potato cultivars is demanding and time-consuming due to the highly heterozygous, outcrossing and polyploid nature of potatoes. This combination of factors makes transgenic approaches to virus resistance especially appropriate for potato, as well as other major clonal crops such as bananas, cassava and yam (
