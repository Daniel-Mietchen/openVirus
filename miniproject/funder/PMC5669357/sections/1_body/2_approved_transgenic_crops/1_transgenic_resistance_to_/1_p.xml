<p>Potato is the third-most-cultivated food crop in the world after rice and wheat. The climate in highland areas is well suited for potato and cultivation has increased quickly in Africa. Furthermore, root crops such as potato and sweetpotato are expected to suffer less from climate change than many other subsistence crops [

 <italic>Potyvirus</italic>; family 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic>), potato leafroll virus (PLRV, a member of the genus 
 <italic>Polerovirus</italic>; family 
 <italic>Luteoviridae</italic>) and potato virus X (PVX, a member of the genus 
 <italic>Potexvirus</italic>; family 
 <italic>Alphaflexiviridae</italic>) are the most common and devastating potato viruses worldwide. The aphid-transmitted PVY and PLRV can cause significant yield losses on their own. The contact-transmitted PVX becomes significant with PVY co-infection, which induces synergistic interactions of the viruses leading to high accumulation of PVX. To solve this problem, virus-derived resistance was engineered to both PVY and PVX in potato cv. Russet Burbank, representing only the second example (after tobacco) of genetically engineered virus resistance in crop plants [
