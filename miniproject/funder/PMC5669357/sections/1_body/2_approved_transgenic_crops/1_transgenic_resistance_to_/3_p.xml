<p>Resistance to PLRV in ‘NewLeaf’ reached commercial production in the USA, but the engineered variety remained on the market only a couple of years before it was withdrawn due to the decision by major potato processing industries to abstain from using transgenic potatoes [
 <xref rid="bib0625" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The demand for ‘NewLeaf’ was not high in the US market, because clean seed can be bought every year and pesticides are affordable, providing alternative means to control viruses. In low-income countries, however, virus-resistant potato varieties would be of major importance in preventing yield losses, because farmers rarely renew their seed potatoes. Resistance against both primary and secondary infection with PLRV has been achieved using efficient inverted repeat hairpin constructs [
