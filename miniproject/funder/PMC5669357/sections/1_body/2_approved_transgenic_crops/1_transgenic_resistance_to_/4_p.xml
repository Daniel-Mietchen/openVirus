<p>The natural dominant PVX resistance gene 
 <italic>Rx</italic>, which confers extreme resistance to a wide spectrum of PVX strains, has been isolated from potato and introduced to PVX-susceptible plants by genetic engineering [

 <italic>Rx</italic> gene has been extended by mutation [

Perhaps the ongoing efforts to obtain approval for transgenic late-blight-resistant potato varieties in Uganda and Bangladesh will pave the way for [transgenic] virus resistance in the future.
