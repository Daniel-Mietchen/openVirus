<p>Common beans (
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L.) and vegetable crops such as tomato, peppers and cucurbits (
 <italic>Cucurbita</italic> spp.) are damaged by whitefly-transmitted begomoviruses worldwide [
 <xref rid="bib0650" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0655" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and particularly in Latin America [
 <xref rid="bib0660" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV) and the related bean yellow golden mosaic virus are among the biggest constraints on bean production in Latin America. After almost two decades of work, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) was able to produce a transgenic line of common bean showing high and stable levels of resistance to BGMV [
 <xref rid="bib0665" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The transgenic line EMBRAPA 5.1 was approved for cultivation in 2011, and field trials for registration of several new cultivars developed from EMBRAPA 5.1 by breeding were initiated in 2012 [
 <xref rid="bib0670" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The resistance generated is expected to enable recovery of bean production in BGMV-affected areas, increase yields and quality, and to reduce the need for pesticide applications for vector control in Brazil. These transgenic lines may not necessarily confer resistance to bean-infecting begomoviruses in other parts of the world due to differences among viruses and virus strains. Nonetheless, the approach using an inverted repeat construct targeting the viral replicase gene and a highly efficient transformation system can be applied to generate bean varieties that are resistant to the main begomoviruses found in other developing countries.
