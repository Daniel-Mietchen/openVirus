<p>Papaya is a crop predominantly produced and widely consumed in the developing world. It is an important and rich source of essential nutrients, such as vitamins A and C. PRSV (a member of the genus 
 <italic>Potyvirus</italic>; family 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic>) is a major pathogen of papaya worldwide. PRSV-resistant papaya was one of the first virus-resistant transgenic plants approved (in 1998), and was for a long time the only transgenic crop developed entirely with public funding. PRSV-resistant papaya effectively saved papaya production Hawaii [

However, PRSV resistance in the transgenic papaya is rather specific to local strains, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to the introduction of new PRSV strains. PRSV-resistant papayas have since been developed using improved transgene construct design and tested against local strains in other countries, including Brazil, China, Jamaica, Venezuela, Taiwan, Thailand and The Philippines. However, the transgenic cultivars have not been approved for cultivation in any of these countries. Davidson [
