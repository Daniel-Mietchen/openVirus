<p>On the other hand, obesity also provokes an aberration in the immune system including the attenuated and prolonged type I IFN response that shows antiviral inefficacy. Obese individuals have a high level of blood leptin, implying a situation of “leptin resistance”. Leptin potentially upregulates the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3). SOCS3 upregulation and altered systemic leptin levels could be responsible for the reduced type I IFN response as well as other immune dysfunction relevant to T cells and B cells in people with obesity [

 <xref rid="B106-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. IFN signaling occurs via the same JAK–STAT pathway and is negatively regulated by SOCS-3, suggesting a potential mechanism by which IFN responses to viral infections may be suppressed in obese individuals [

 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Teran-Cabanillas et al. (2017) have recently evaluated the effect of SOCS expression and type I IFN responses in obese patients, showing that basal SOCS-3 expression was increased in obesity and correlated to the reduction of type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This obesity-associated immune dysfunction, particularly attenuated IFN responses, resulted in potential increase of host susceptibility to viral infections; therefore leading to increased prognoses of associated viruses from secondary infections, co-infections, and even opportunistic infections in obese patients. A collection of data from clinical cases in humans and studies in mouse models showed that obese individuals exhibited higher susceptibility and mortality during seasonal and epidemic flu infections [

 <xref rid="B108-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. More severe lung inflammation and lung damage from viral pneumonia as well as prolonged viral shedding were observed in both obese mice and human cases. It was schematically summarized that multiple immune responses including IFN-α/β production and IFN-signaling of ISG production were impaired in the respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages of obese individuals, along with the increase of inflammatory cytokines and M1 polarization of lung macrophages [

 <xref rid="B108-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Therefore, the deficiency of IFN production and signaling in obese patients might be among the risk factors for severe outcomes in pandemic influenza infection [

 <xref rid="B60-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]; however, evidence from another side suggests that persistent viral infection and perturbation of IFN signaling exacerbate obesity development. Regarding systemic interaction in animal and human bodies, high-fat diet and viral infection (particularly chronic viral infections) may synergistically (or independently sometime) induce dysbiosis of gut microbiota and systemic low-grade inflammation. These systemic changes partially result from attenuated and prolonged IFN production upon persistent viral infections and underlie the systemic inflammation observed in obesity [

(2017) showed that type I IFN–driven activation of CD8+ T cells in the liver correlates with insulin resistance in obesity-linked fat liver (termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) in obese patients [
 <xref rid="B107-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. This study also critically associated gut microbiome with liver IFN signaling and its role in driving inflammation in the livers of obese mice [
 <xref rid="B107-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. It is likely that the dysbiotic microbiome in the obesity and NAFLD patients may harbor persistent infections. In turn, through over-production of long-chain fatty acid (LFA) and leptin by expanding adipocytes, obesity is accompanied with general immune suppression including aberration of antiviral IFN signaling, which leads to high susceptibility to viral infections (

 <xref rid="B109-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Therefore, in most cases of infectobesity, obesity and viral infections may interact dynamically as a reciprocal causality rather than a simple sequential relationship of “chicken or the egg” [
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, IFN (particularly type I IFNs) responses have recently been postulated as a central immunological axis that governs adipocyte differentiation and T cell pathogenicity during obesity-associated metabolic disease [

 <xref rid="B109-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. All these observations collectively indicate that IFNs may directly reprogram cellular lipid synthesis and transport, in addition to its indirect effect through interaction with viral infections.
