<p>Interferons, as a family of key cytokines, exert broad antiviral, anti-tumor, and anti-proliferative activities in vitro and in vivo [

 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The broad activity of IFNs depends on inducing hundreds of ISGs, which not only directly restrict virus infections at different stages of viral life cycle, but also orchestrate cell metabolism to enter into an antiviral state [

 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this manner, IFNs have been found to play a role in reprogramming cell lipid metabolism in addition to their activity in coordinating RNA and protein metabolism [

 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. This underpins a metabolic basis of IFNs in the development of obesity, and particularly, the infectobesity involving viral infections [

 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Effective IFN responses, especially those mediated by type I and type III IFNs, are postulated to be an immunological axis that determines antiviral defense. However, the futile and prolonged IFN response accompanying persistent viral infections actually compromise body function in both antiviral immunity and metabolic normality [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, the cross-talking of leptin and LFA with IFN signaling provides another rationale to associate IFNs with obesity [

 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, more direct evidence such as using IFN-signaling deficient animal models are needed to conclusively determine if and how fundamental IFN signaling plays a role in obesity development. Remarkably, all immune responses are a double-edged sword, as it is for IFN-signaling [

 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Although the intrinsic and properly stimulated IFN responses are favorable for antiviral and anti-obesity effect; on the other hand, there are multiple literatures also suggesting that improper IFN responses may actually impair viral clearance, and promote hepatic and metabolic diseases [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,

 <xref rid="B107-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Thus, for the development of IFN-based therapeutics for anti-obesity purposes, effective IFN regimens need to be selected and tested dynamically to overcome potential side-effects such as those manifested from antiviral IFN therapeutics [
