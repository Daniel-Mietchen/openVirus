 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which included: (1) direct roles of some viruses to reprogram host metabolism toward a more lipogenic and adipogenic status; (2) the probability that humans may exchange microbiota components (emphasizing its viral component, i.e., virome/virobiota) from livestock reservoirs that have been aggressively selected for efficient weight/fat gain; and (3) the adaptation of host immune and metabolic system under persistent viral infections [

 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. With regard to these, we emphasize the sequential immuno-metabolic adaption to persistent viral infections, especially the subverted IFN response, which emerges as a key drive for adipogenesis and obesity-associated immune suppression. This, in turn, underlies reciprocal causality between obesity and higher susceptibility of obese individuals to viral infections [
