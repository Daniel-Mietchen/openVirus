<p>Instead of directly suppressing or killing viruses, IFNs restrict viruses through induction of hundreds IFN-stimulated effector genes (ISGs) and alter cells to limit virus replication and spreading. These cellular alterations include changes in protein synthesis, energy rebalance, lipid metabolism, membrane composition, and cell proliferation [
