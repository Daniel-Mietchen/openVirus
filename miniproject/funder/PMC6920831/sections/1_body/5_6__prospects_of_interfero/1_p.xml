<p>The emerging theme of IFNs as a critical regulator of obesity has been demonstrated by several reports targeting therapeutic development against obesity in both cell and animal models. McGillicuddy et al. (2009) reported that IFN-γ treatment reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in human adipocytes, attenuated insulin sensitivity, and suppressed differentiation of pre-adipocytes to the mature phenotype. The anti-adipogenic effect of IFN-γ is most likely mediated via sustained JAK-STAT1 pathway activation [

Using a mouse model, another study detected the stimulation of type I IFN responses by long chain FA in murine hepatocytes and macrophages. Targeting abrogation of IFN-signaling in adipose tissue, but not hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ifnar1 worsened HFD-induced metabolic syndrome. Conversely, improved metabolic control in laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding patients with obesity was associated with stimulation of type I IFN-regulated genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver [

This study indicated the differential role of IFN-signaling through the regulation of different sets of ISGs (such as IRFs, IFITs, MX1, and OAS1) in different cells (particularly adipocytes/hepatocytes) that are closely relevant to the development of obesity and metabolic disorders [

Again, using hydrodynamic gene transfer to elevate and sustain blood concentration of IFN-β1 in mice suppressed immune cell infiltration and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and blocked adipose tissue expansion and body weight gain, independent of food intake [
 <xref rid="B79-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, such expression may boost a super-physiological and potentially persistent level of IFN-β in the liver. Yet, persistent IFN-β signaling could induce partially immune exhaustion both centrally and locally and would require further study for pharmaceutic safety. Metabolically, IFN-β1, as an intrinsic responder to gut interaction with its microflora (including virome), has been experimentally shown to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in obese mice [

 <xref rid="B79-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. These findings, even though preliminary, suggest that targeting IFN signaling represents a promising strategy to block obesity development and its related pathologies. So, how about other IFN subtypes besides type II IFN-γ and type I IFN-β? Ying et al. (2014) administered IFN-τ, a ruminant IFN subtype acting as a signaling molecule during pregnancy in trophoblasts, into obese mice induced by HFD [
 <xref rid="B112-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. They showed that this livestock IFN subtype not only significantly mitigated obesity-associated systemic insulin resistance and adipose inflammation by controlling macrophage polarization, but also had less cytotoxic effect than typical IFN-β subtype, indicating a therapeutic potential through cross-species screening of IFN molecules [

 <xref rid="B112-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. We know that type I IFNs are eminent for their unconventional subtypes, which are functionally prone to anti-inflammatory and reproductive regulation in livestock species such as pigs and cattle as well as type III IFNs that are restricted to epithelial expression [
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Information from the study of tissue-specific IFN-signaling effect by Wiser et al. (2018) implies that epithelial IFN-signaling has limited regulation on metabolic and hepatic diseases [
 <xref rid="B111-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Based on these insightful studies for IFN-based anti-obesity therapies, a cross-species and family-wide screening of the most effective IFN ligands is needed, and may provide more IFN-based options for therapeutic optimization against current obesity prevalence and reveal IFN subtypes that bear superior activity in anti-obesity or metabolic regulation to IFN-β or IFN-γ [
