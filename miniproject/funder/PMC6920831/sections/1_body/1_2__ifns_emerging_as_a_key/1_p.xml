<p>Interferons (IFN) are vital antiviral cytokines evolved in vertebrates. Host cells secrete three types of IFN peptides (i.e., type I, II and III IFNs) in response to viral infections. Three types of IFNs not only differ in their molecular signatures and bind to distinct cell receptors, but also play distinct tissue/cell-specific roles in control of viral infections. In brief, the innate immune IFNs, which include multiple subtypes of type I and type III IFNs, provide early and local protection during viral entry into animal portals. In contrast, IFN-γ, as the only member of type II IFN, is primarily produced by specific immune cells (including natural killer cells (NK) and activated T cells) to mediate adaptive immunity for eliminating dangerous pathogens that evade innate immunity [

 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Persistent viral infections result from the virus escaping from immune clearance and entering into a co-existing stage within the host cells to avoid excessive damage. The mechanisms to maintain persistent viral infections are incompletely understood, but believably involve both modulation of viral actions and reprograming of the host metabolic and immune responses [

 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Previous studies in mouse models proposed that ineffective adaptive immune responses including lack of effective cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and neutralizing antibodies are needed for viral persistence [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, recent studies indicate that innate immune IFNs are necessary in the regulation of viral infections during both early and persistent phases [

Such as in mice infected by norovirus (MNV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), IFN-α/β played a systemic role in control of the viral replication and clearance; and IFN-λs were effective in clearing enteric persistence of MNV [

 <xref rid="B50-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, innate immune IFNs preside over antiviral immunity to intervene chronic viral infection through mediating at both innate (stimulation of expression of a plethora of ISG expression) and adaptive immune levels (exerting either positive or negative impacts on CTL and B-cell functions) [

 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-09-00726" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Regarding viral pathogenesis, IFN responses during the acute phase of viral infections is immuno-stimulatory and antiviral effective; however, the prolonged IFN production (particularly of type I IFNs) in response to viral persistence is emerging as a double-edge sword actually driving inflammation and immunosuppression [
