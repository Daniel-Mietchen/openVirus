<p>All existing containers on a 100-meter radius around the center of the six quarters with the highest Breteau indexes were monitored. It was considered as a potential breeding place all non-hermetically closed deposits containing any volume of water. All water holding containers were examined, after oral consent for getting into peopleâ€™s house. Immature specimens were collected biweekly during monitoring. The breeding sites were also daily monitored between the collections, to verify the presence of pupae, indicating the adults hatching, which would anticipate the interval between the collections (less than fifteen days), to avoid the proliferation of the vector. The problem of an eventual closed house was minimized by the repeated visits.</p>
