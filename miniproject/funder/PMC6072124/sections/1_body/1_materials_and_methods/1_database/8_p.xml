<p>As previously cited, the objective of this study was to estimate the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae considering all the eleven variables cited above in their various containers. The discrimination potential of the selected parameters is assessed in some studies with linear statistical methods, such as the Linear Discriminant Analysis or Principal Component Analysis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, a non-linear method was applied, based on Mutual Information (MI) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], to select by order of importance the most appropriate variables for distinguishing containers with and without 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae. These variables were then used as inputs for a Neural Network in layers for classification. For comparison with the proposed model, a logistic regression model was used under the same conditions.
