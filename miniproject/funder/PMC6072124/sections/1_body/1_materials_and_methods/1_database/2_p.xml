<p>The Secretary of Health Surveillance of the Ministry of Health carried out a Rapid Survey Index (RSI) of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] between November 22 and 26 of 2004. 
 <italic>Breteau</italic> indexes were calculated from the results of this RSI for all quarters of the sample. The Breteau index is calculated as the number of positive containers per 100 houses inspected. The six quarters which presented the greatest 
 <italic>Breteau</italic> indexes were selected for further monitoring. These quarters were in the following neighborhoods: Centro, Califórnia, Vila Operária, Cerâmica, Nova América and Moquetá. All potential breeding sites in the survey delimited region were monitored in a summer week between the 22
 <sup>sd</sup> and the 29
 <sup>th</sup> December 2004, aiming to identify and collect all immature mosquito specimens. Every container or non-hermetically closed site which contained water (in any volume) found around or inside sample homes during the visits was a potential breeding ground.
