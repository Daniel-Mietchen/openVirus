<p>The basic idea behind a logistic regression model consists of minimizing the number of variables so that the resulting model is numerically more stable and easily generalized, given that the more variables included in the model, the more it becomes dependent on the data. Therefore, in many situations, it becomes necessary to use the stepwise techniques in the logistic regression, the process by which variables are included or excluded from the model, based only on statistical criteria such as G statistics (&lt;0,05) and the Wald test (&lt;0,05).</p>
