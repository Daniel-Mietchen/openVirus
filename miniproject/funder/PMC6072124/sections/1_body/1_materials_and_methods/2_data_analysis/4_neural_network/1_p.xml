<p>The variables selected by the MIFS-U algorithm were used as input for a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN). The type of learning used was supervised, that is, using a set of pairs input and outputâ€”previously known and that represent the reality. According to Haykin [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], "learning" (or "training") is the process by which the free parameters of a Neural Network are adapted, through a mechanism of presentation of stimuli provided by the environment in which the Network is inserted. The type of training is defined by the way in which the parameters are modified.
