<p>The selection of input variables plays an important role in classification systems such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). Such variables can be classified as pertinent, irrelevant or redundant, and, from the point of view of management of a set of data, which may be gigantic, reducing the number of variables, selecting only those pertinent ones, is extremely desirable. This way, better performance with less computational effort is expected [
