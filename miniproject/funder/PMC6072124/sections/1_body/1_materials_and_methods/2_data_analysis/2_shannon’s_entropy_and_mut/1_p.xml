<p>Uncertainty characterizes the gain in information that the occurrence of an event may provoke. It may, however, be translated through the probability of occurrence of the event. When the occurrence of an event is certain this does not add anything to the information, as all the information is already contained in the certainty of its occurrence. In this way, it can be said that the determination of the quantity of information produced by the occurrence of an event is determined by the quantity of “surprise” that this occurrence brings.</p>
