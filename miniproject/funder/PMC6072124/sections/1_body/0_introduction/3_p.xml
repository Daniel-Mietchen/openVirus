<p>The emergence of epidemics of dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus disease is an alert for governments, academia, funders and World Health Organization to improve programs and enhance research in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> proliferates in various domestic containers which are used to store water and for ornamental plants. There are also various habitats that receive rain water and may be potential breeding sites for the mosquito, such as used tires, drinking containers, clogged gutters and buildings under construction. Some artificial containers produce large numbers of adult mosquitoes, while others are less productive. Consequently, efforts to control highly productive containers should be priority, especially when resources are limited. This strategy requires extensive knowledge on the ecology of vectors. The control of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is achieved mainly through the elimination of breeding sites which are sites favorable for oviposition that also enable the development of the aquatic phases of the vector. Besides that, control programs for the vector have also sought a greater involvement from the community and have encouraged intersectoral activities [
