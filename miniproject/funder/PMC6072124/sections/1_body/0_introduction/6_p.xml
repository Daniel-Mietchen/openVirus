<p>In underdeveloped countries, the unorganized urbanization, the increased population density, the precariousness of the waste collection and provision of water, along with the inefficiency of the programs for fighting the vector favor the wide expansion of

In these countries, the absence or intermittent supply of water drives a large part of the population to store water in various tanks to supply their daily needs. These tanks provide a place for the procreation of the vector in urban areas [

Other breeding sites propitious for the multiplication of mosquitoes are disposable containers (bottles, cans, plastics etc.), most often found around the outside of homes, and very often inappropriately disposed of, due to the lack of regular waste collection in various areas [
