<p>Results obtained from research on the pupae are often used as a proxy to produce adult mosquitoes, as the pupae mortality is considered low [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The objective of this study is to investigate the production of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae according to the type of use, volume and manufacturing material of the different containers which may potentially be breeding sites for the mosquito, applying non-linear method, and to demonstrate the improvement in results obtained in comparing with linear methods. The identification of the most productive breeding place of the mosquito allows guiding more efficient dengue control program, since concentrates the efforts in the places of greater infestation of the mosquito.
