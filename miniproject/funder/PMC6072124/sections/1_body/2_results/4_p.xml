 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the performance of the proposed method (Neural Networks) regarding the number of variables used. The data base is made up of information on 5,954 containers, where 5,560 had no pupae and 394 had 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae. Of these 5,954 containers, 70% were used for training the network and the other 30% were used for testing; that is, the network was trained with 3,857 containers with no pupae and 279 containers with pupae, in a total of 4,136 containers. The containers used for testing (apart from the training sample) were made up of 1,703 with no pupae and 115 with pupae. The following results presented refer to the containers not included in the training sample.
