<p>A logistic regression was also carried out in the same way, for the purposes of comparison, the results of which are shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. A percentage of 63.6% of hits was found in the containers that did not have any 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae (specificity) and 71.7% in the containers with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae (sensitivity), with accuracy of 64.1%. Thus, the capacity for predicting the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae of this method was found to be inferior to the method proposed in this study. Considering the prevalence of containers with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae of 6.3%, the negative predictive value of the logistic regression was 97.1% and the positive predictive value was 11.7%.
