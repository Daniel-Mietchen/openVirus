<p>Eight experiments were carried out comparing the first variable on 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> with a varying number of the other variables taking into consideration the order of importance. Comparing the results of these 8 experiments it can be observed, for example, that an increase in the ‘container volume’ (ninth variable in order of importance) effectively introduces a worse result regarding predictability of presence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae. The best prediction of the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae is obtained in experiment 6, comparing variable 1 with the following 8 variables selected by the MIFS-U algorithm. In this experiment percentage of hits in containers that had no 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae was 73.3% (specificity) and 80.9% in containers with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae (sensitivity), with an accuracy of 73.8%. For this experiment, considering the prevalence of containers with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae of 6.3%, the negative predictive value of the Neural Network was 98.3% and the positive predictive value was 17,0%.
