<p>The containers with the largest proportion of immature forms of the vector were denominated by Tun-Lin 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as key containers and according to these authors they should be prioritized in the activities of vector control to make the program more efficient. In this sense, the efforts of an efficient program for controlling 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> should be primarily concentrated on being able to identify the containers which present greater productivity. We have shown here that the use of a Neural Networks model to aid in monitoring various types of containers can significantly help achieve this goal.
