<p>Using the Neural Network model, the variables that better discriminate the containers with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> pupae from the containers without pupae were size—the larger the container volume the greater the proportion of containers positive for pupae–, the presence of another type of pupa other than 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and the location of the container outside the home. Arunachalam et al [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found that the most productive breeding sites for 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> were the containers of water located outdoors, principally those that were uncovered, under trees and not having been used for at least a week. Areas around and inside the homes were much more important to produce pupae than commercial and public areas. While Martins et al [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found no significant association between volume of the breeding place and infestation by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, they did find however that the absence of immature forms of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex spp</italic> in the breeding sites favors its infestation by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>.
