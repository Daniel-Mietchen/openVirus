<p>According to Medronho 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the containers with a greater percentage of pupae are tires, barrels, cisterns, drums and water tanks. In that study, most containers cited (with the exception of tires) are all concerned with the problem of the regionâ€™s supply of water. Romero-Vivas 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found similar results for the containers used for storage of the supply of water, whereas Barrera 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006592.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found a larger proportion of containers related to waste positive for pupae.
