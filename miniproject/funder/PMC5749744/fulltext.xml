During the 2009 influenza pandemic asthma was found to be the commonest comorbid illness of patients admitted to hospital. Unexpectedly, it was also observed that asthmatic patients admitted to hospital with influenza infection were less likely to die or require admission to intensive care compared with non-asthmatics. Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of asthma and influenza infection we demonstrate that prior exposure to <italic>Blomia tropicalis</italic> extract (BTE) leads to an altered immune response to influenza infection, comprised of less severe weight loss and faster recovery following infection. This protection was associated with significant increases in T cell numbers in the lungs of BTE sensitised and infected mice, as well as increased IFN-&#x003b3; production from these cells. In addition, elevated numbers of CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) were found in the lung draining lymph nodes following infection of BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice. These CD11b+ DCs appeared to be better at priming CD8 specific T cells both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>, a function not normally attributed to CD11b+ DCs. We propose that this alteration in cross-presentation and more efficient T cell priming seen in BTE sensitised mice, led to the earlier increase in T cells in the lungs and subsequently faster clearance of the virus and reduced influenza induced pathology. We believe this data provides a novel mechanism that explains why asthmatic patients may present with less severe disease when infected with influenza.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/1262/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient>David M Kemeny</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF370062-HUJ-NUS</award-id><principal-award-recipient>David M Kemeny</principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Medical Research Council of Singapore Grant No. NMRC/1262/2010, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nmrc.gov.sg">http://www.nmrc.gov.sg</ext-link> and the National Research Foundation of Singapore Grant No. NRF370062-HUJ-NUS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg">https://www.nrf.gov.sg</ext-link>.

Globally, influenza epidemics result in approximately 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways which is characterised by increased pulmonary eosinophilia, elevated Th2 cells and mucus hyper secretion [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Based on recent estimates as many as 334 million people currently suffer from asthma worldwide and the number of people diagnosed with asthma is on the rise [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are many triggers that can lead to the exacerbation of asthma, one of the most common being respiratory viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has now been clearly shown that rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are two of the major respiratory viruses that can lead to asthma exacerbations [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, asthma has also been identified as a risk factor for influenza. Epidemiological studies of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 outbreak demonstrated that even though asthma was found to be the most common underlying condition associated with hospitalization during the outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a higher proportion of asthmatic patients were found to survive compared with patients with other underlying conditions [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a separate analysis by McKenna <italic>et al</italic>, the majority of patients hospitalised with asthma and without pneumonia, were found to be less likely to need mechanical ventilation or require admission to the intensive care unit [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In another study conducted in the UK, asthmatics admitted to hospital were half as likely as non-asthmatics to die or require intensive care support, despite presenting with greater respiratory compromise at the time of hospital admission and similar rates of pneumonia [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have now indicated that pre-existing asthma can provide a protective effect against influenza induced disease through the production of either TGF-&#x003b2; or insulin-like growth factor-1 molecules from the epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the role of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells in mediating this protective effect have not been investigated. Dendritic cells in the lung can be broadly divided into three categories, plasmacytoid DCs, CD11b+ DCs and CD103+ DCs [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many studies have now shown that CD11b+ DCs are important for the induction of asthma [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whilst CD103+ DCs have been shown to be important in the priming of CD8 T cells during an influenza infection [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whilst these DC subsets have been shown to be crucial in the development and maintenance of asthma [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the induction of the immune response to influenza [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] it is unknown what happens to these subsets during a comorbidity model of asthma and influenza. Our findings demonstrate that asthma can indeed protect mice <italic>in vivo</italic> from influenza induced disease. We believe this is partially mediated by CD11b+ DCs in the lung draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) which are able to cross-present to CD8 T cells in allergen sensitised mice, leading to the faster appearance of CD8 T cells in the lungs, quicker clearance of the virus and a reduction in virus induced pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice (8&#x02013;10 weeks old) were purchased from National University of Singapore CARE. Mice were age and sex-matched for each experiment. Groups of five mice per cage were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and were transferred to the ABSL2 facility for experiments involving infection with influenza. Mice were randomly assigned to cages and each cage randomly assigned a condition as either a control or experimental group. The total number of mice used ranged from 10&#x02013;20 depending on the experiment. All mice were allowed to acclimatise for 3&#x02013;4 days prior to the start of the study.

Recombinant influenza A/PR/8/34 containing the chicken OVA epitope SIINFEKL (PR/8-OT-1) was a gift from Dr. Paul Thomas (St. Jude Children&#x02019;s Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA). Influenza viruses A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and PR/8-OT-1 virus (with the SIINFEKL epitope) were grown in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Influenza virus was quantified by making serial ten-fold dilutions of virus that were allowed to adsorb onto confluent monolayers of Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34, ATCC, USA) on a 24-well plate for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C.

Sensitisation with BTE prior to infection led to a significant increase in the proliferation of OT-1 CD8 T cells in the MLN compared to infected PBS treated mice, as seen by the increased number of proliferation cycles and by the increased percentage of divided cells, 16% in infected PBS treated mice versus 37% in infected BTE sensitised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>).

Sorted DCs were cultured with na&#x000ef;ve CTV labelled OT-1 CD8 T cells for three days, after which their proliferation was analysed. CD103+ DCs from infected PBS treated mice induced significant proliferation of OT-1 CD8 T cells, as seen by their CTV dilution, compared to CD11b+ DCs from the same mice. In contrast, in BTE sensitised mice significant CD8 T cell proliferation was only seen in the presence of CD11b+ DCs, and not CD103+ DCs, indicating that CD11b+ DCs were the main DC population presenting antigen to OT-1 CD8 T cells and responsible for the enhanced T cell proliferation seen earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has long been thought that individuals with asthma may be more susceptible to respiratory viral infections, and whilst a link between the two has been shown for RSV and RV [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], epidemiological studies involving influenza have yielded conflicting results [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The findings presented here show that prior exposure to low dose allergen can promote a beneficial immune response to subsequent influenza viral infection. Infected allergen exposed mice had augmented innate and adaptive immune responses, seen in the lung draining lymph nodes (MLN), lungs and airways, which led to the earlier recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as influenza specific CD8 T cells into the lungs. The result of this earlier inflammation of the lungs was faster clearance of the virus, reduced viral induced weight loss and reduced lung damage.</p><p>Others have also addressed how the immune response to influenza infection can be altered in an allergic setting. Using an <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> model of asthma Samarasinghe <italic>et al</italic> showed that infection during the acute phase of asthma leads to protection from influenza virus induced weight loss and disease. However, infection during chronic asthma led to the loss of this protective effect and mice were found to develop lung pathology comparable to that of infected PBS treated mice. They believed the protective effect seen in acute asthmatic mice was due to the maintenance of an intact epithelium, reduced interferon responses and increased production of insulin-like growth factor-1 [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In a more recent study Furuya <italic>et al</italic> concluded that influenza induced pathology can be prevented by the transient increase in production of TGF-&#x003b2; during allergic asthma. They show that asthmatic mice infected with influenza displayed a reduced cytokine storm and cytotoxicity in the airways and that by deleting TGF-&#x003b2; receptor II they abrogated the resistance of asthmatic mice to influenza [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. From the data presented here we suggest that CD11b+ DCs play an important role in the protective effects seen in BTE sensitised mice infected with influenza. We show that low dose sensitisation with BTE led to the increase in CD11b+ and CD103+ DCs in the MLN and the lungs. Although both DC populations were found to increase, the magnitude of the increase in CD11b+ DCs was significantly larger. This is perhaps not surprising as CD11b+ DCs have been shown to rapidly translocate to the MLN following allergen exposure. It has also been demonstrated that in the presence of low allergen dose, conventional CD11b+ DCs and not monocyte-derived DCs are the main DCs to migrate to the MLN and present to CD4 T cells priming for a Th2 immune response [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast, during a primary influenza infection both CD11b+ and CD103+ DCs have been shown to capture viral antigen and transport it to the lung draining lymph nodes. However, in this situation only the CD103+ DCs present viral antigen to na&#x000ef;ve CD8 T cells [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We propose that prior exposure to BTE, before influenza infection, leads to lung inflammation, activation and recruitment of DCs and the disruption of the airway epithelium, which exposes lung CD11b+ DCs normally located in the submucosa and lung parenchyma [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to viral antigen, which they capture and then carry to lung draining lymph nodes where they cross-present to CD8 T cells. In support of this we have shown that influenza infection following sensitisation resulted in a significant increase in CD11b+ DCs in the MLN, compared to infected PBS treated mice. In contrast, numbers of CD103+ DCs in the MLN were found to be similar in both infected PBS and BTE treated mice, with both higher than in non-infected BTE treated mice. In addition, we also found that the <italic>in vivo</italic> proliferation of transferred naive OT-1 CD8 T cells within the MLN was greater in infected BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice, suggesting that there was a significant increase in antigen presentation to CD8 T cells in these mice. To identify which DC population was responsible for this increased proliferation we sorted CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs from infected PBS treated or BTE sensitised mice and co-cultured them with na&#x000ef;ve OT-1 CD8 T cells. To our surprise, we found that in infected BTE sensitised mice the enhanced T cell proliferation came from T cells co-cultured with CD11b+ DCs and not CD103+ DCs. The idea that CD11b+ DCs are able to acquire and present influenza antigen is not new. Several groups have shown that CD11b+ DCs are more efficient in viral antigen uptake in the lung, compared to CD103+ DCs they migrate poorly to the lung draining lymph nodes during the early stages of the immune response to primary influenza infection [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, Ballesteros-Tato <italic>et al</italic> have demonstrated that during the peak of the T cell response to influenza infection (day 5&#x02013;10 p.i.), lung CD11b+ DCs are able to capture viral antigen, process the antigen into the MHC class I pathway and migrate to the lung draining lymph nodes where they cross-present to na&#x000ef;ve CD8 T cells [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although both CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs can be infected by influenza, a number of groups have shown that the virus is only able to propagate in the CD103+DCs and this is thought to be due to the inhibition of viral replication by type I interferons in CD11b+ DCs [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Whilst not investigated in these experiments, it is possible that following BTE sensitisation CD11b+ DCs no longer produce type I interferons, allowing them to become permissive to viral replication.</p><p>In addition to altered DC migration and function, a subsequent effect was also seen on the CD8 T cell populations in the lungs. Sensitisation prior to infection led to an earlier increase in CD8 T cells and virus specific CD8 T cells in the lungs, which peaked at day 8 p.i., earlier that the peak seen in the PBS infected mice. Not only was the peak earlier, but the magnitude of this increase was also much greater in infected BTE sensitised mice and these T cells were also found to produce more IFN-&#x003b3;. Interestingly, at later time points after infection (day 14 p.i.) there was a significant decrease in the number of T cells and those producing IFN-&#x003b3; in the lungs of BTE sensitised and infected mice compared to PBS infected mice, indicating there was faster resolution of influenza virus induced disease and reduced lung damage. In supported of this, we also found a reduction in the amount of albumin leakage in the airways of influenza infected BTE sensitised mice compared to PBS infected mice at day 14 p.i. In contrast to the data shown by Furuya <italic>et al</italic>, we find that T cells play a key role in the enhanced protection to influenza in asthmatic mice. These differences could be due to the use of a different asthma model. In their studies the majority of the experiments were performed using an OVA sensitisation and challenge model, and the time between the last challenge and infection was also much longer compared to our study, where infection was given twenty-four hours after the last allergen challenge. Interestingly, even though they saw a reduction in immunopathology in infected asthmatic mice, they did not see a difference in viral clearance [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This again is in contrast to our findings where we show that BTE sensitisation prior to infection had no effect on the replication of the virus in the lung, but did in fact enhance the clearance of the virus, presumably through the increased number and activity of virus specific CD8 T cells.</p><p>As well as increasing the numbers of DCs, T cells and eosinophils, BTE sensitisation also increased NK cell numbers in the MLN. A significant increase was also seen in the airways of BTE sensitised mice following influenza infection, but not in PBS infected mice. NK cells have been shown to be important in both the establishment of allergic disease [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and for the migration of DCs to the MLN following influenza infection [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Whilst we did not investigate the role of NK cells in our model, others have studied the effect of depleting NK cells in models of asthma and influenza, but these studies have yielded conflicting results [<xref rid="pone.0190063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, we also observed an increase in the presence of mucus secreting goblet cells in the lungs of BTE sensitised and infected mice compared to PBS infected mice. Whilst we did not investigate the role of excess mucus production in the protection against influenza infection, it is possible that the presence of more mucus within the airways led to less of the virus being available to infect the epithelium.</p><p>In conclusion, we show for the first time that repeated low dose sensitisation with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>tropicalis</italic>, prior to influenza infection leads to an augmented innate and adaptive immune response in the MLN, lungs and airway. Sensitised and infected mice were found to have increased numbers of CD11b+ DCs in the MLN, which were found to be capable of priming CD8 specific T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>, resulting in the earlier appearance of T cells in the lungs, faster clearance of the virus, and subsequently reduced weight loss and reduced lung damage. Whilst the focused of these studies has been on the role of dendritic cells and T cells, the role other immune cells may play in lessening influenza pathology cannot be ruled out and warrant further investigation. However, we believe these studies provide a novel explanation for the protective effects of asthma that were seen in patients during the 2009 pandemic. Several groups including our own have now reported on the phenomenon of asthma being a protective state against influenza induced pathology. Whilst this does not appear to be true for other respiratory viruses, it is a significant discovery which could help in the future treatment of asthmatics during subsequent influenza outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190063.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>ARRIVE checklist.</title><p>A completed ARRIVE guidelines checklist is included for all animal studies performed.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0190063.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190063.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Flow cytometry gating strategy for DCs.</title><p>Mice were sensitized with either PBS or 0.5&#x003bc;g of BTE 3 times a week, for 2 weeks. 24 hr after the last sensitization mice were culled and cellular infiltrate into the MLN and lungs were measured.
