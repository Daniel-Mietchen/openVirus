<p>Having established an asthmatic phenotype using low dose BTE sensitisation, mice were subsequently infected with 10 PFU of influenza (PR8) twenty-four hours after the last sensitisation and culled at various time points thereafter as shown in the schedule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As a control group mice were treated with PBS instead of BTE and infected twenty-four hours after the last PBS dose. Weight loss was monitored every day for two weeks and those sensitised prior to influenza started to lose weight at the same time and rate as the infected PBS treated mice. However, infected BTE sensitized mice stopped losing weight earlier at day 7 post infection (p.i.) compared to infected PBS treated mice whose weight loss peaked at day 9 p.i. A faster recovery from weight loss was also seen in the infected BTE sensitised mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Having seen less weight loss and faster recovery in infected BTE sensitised mice, viral loads were measured on day 4 and day 8 p.i. Interestingly, viral loads on day 4 p.i. from both the infected BTE sensitised and PBS treated mice were similar and significantly higher than control PBS and BTE sensitised non-infected groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). However, at day 8 p.i. there was a significant decrease in viral load detected in the lungs of infected BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). As an indicator of lung damage the level of albumin leakage into the BAL was also measured. At day 8 p.i. no difference was seen between infected PBS treated or BTE sensitised mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). However, at day 14 p.i. there was a significant decrease in the amount of albumin that was detected in the BAL of infected BTE sensitised mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), suggesting there was less ongoing epithelial lung damage in mice which were BTE sensitised and infected.
