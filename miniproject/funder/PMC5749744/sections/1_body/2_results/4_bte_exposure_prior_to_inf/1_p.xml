<p>To understand which cells were involved in causing the earlier increase in inflammation and possibly in turn, the protection of sensitised mice from subsequent influenza pathology, innate and adaptive infiltrating cells in the airway were analysed at various time points after infection. As expected the majority of changes in the granulocyte population occurred around day 4 p.i. Airway eosinophil levels were highest in the non-infected BTE sensitised mice and were significantly higher than in the infected BTE sensitised mice (

Furthermore, there was a small, but statistically significant increase in the number of NK cells in the airway of infected BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice at day 4 p.i., which was no longer seen by day 8 p.i. (
