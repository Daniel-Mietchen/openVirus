<p>Having seen a greater increase in T cell numbers in the airways (BAL), T cells within the lungs were analysed in more detail at various time points after infection. As seen in the airway, the number of CD8 T cells within the lungs of infected BTE sensitised mice were very low on day 4 p.i., but rose rapidly peaking on day 8 p.i., much earlier and significantly higher than the peak seen in infected PBS mice which occurred at day 11 p.i. (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g004">Fig 4J</xref>) was also seen at day 8 p.i. in infected BTE sensitised compared to infected PBS treated mice. This earlier increase in CD8 T cells in infected BTE sensitised mice was accompanied by a quicker decline in CD8 T cells in the lungs and by day 14 p.i. the number of CD8 T cells was significantly lower compared to infected PBS treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). This was also reflected in the number of CD8 T cells producing IFN-γ at day 14 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g004">Fig 4J</xref>). Concomitant with the early increase in CD8 T cells a similar pattern was observed for CD4 T cells, with significantly higher numbers of CD4 T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g004">Fig 4K</xref>) seen at day 4 and day 8 p.i. in infected BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice. A similar number of CD4 T cells producing IFN-γ were found in both infected BTE sensitised and PBS treated mice between day 4 and 11 p.i. However, at day 14 p.i. a significant increase was seen in infected PBS treated mice compared to infected BTE sensitised mice (
