 <italic>tropicalis</italic> extract (BTE) (0.5Î¼g) intranasally (i.n.) three times a week for two weeks, culled twenty-four hours after the last exposure and the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and lungs assessed for inflammatory cell infiltrate. Following sensitisation with BTE there was a significant increase in the number of eosinophils (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) in the MLN. No difference was found in the number of neutrophils (data not shown). In addition, sensitisation led to a significant increase in two important DC subsets in the MLN, CD11c
 <sup>hi</sup> MHC class II
 <sup>hi</sup> CD11b+ (CD11b+) (

 <sup>hi</sup> MHC class II
 <sup>hi</sup> CD103+ (CD103+) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Whilst both DC populations were found to be increased, there were significantly more CD11b DCs compared to CD103+ DCs. A similar pattern was observed in the lungs of BTE sensitised mice compared to PBS treated mice for eosinophils, CD4 T cells, CD11b+ DCs and CD103+ DCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g001">Fig 1G, 1I, 1K and 1L</xref>). However, unlike the MLN, there was no significant difference in the number of NK cells or CD8 T cells in the lungs of sensitised mice (
