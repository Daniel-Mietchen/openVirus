<p>To assess the level of inflammation in the lungs of infected BTE sensitised mice, lung sections were obtained from non-infected and infected PBS treated or BTE sensitised mice at day 4 and 8 p.i. H&amp;E staining showed there was a significant increase in inflammation at day 4 p.i. in the lungs of infected BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice and non-infected PBS treated and BTE sensitised mice (

In addition to increased inflammation, there was also a significant increase in the number of mucus secreting goblet cells in the lungs of infected BTE sensitised mice compared to infected PBS treated mice or the non-infected groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>). At day 8 p.i., the inflammation score of infected PBS treated or BTE sensitised mice was comparable, with a high inflammation score seen in both groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g003">Fig 3A and 3D</xref>). However, unlike the inflammation level, mucus producing goblet cells were only visible in the lungs of infected BTE sensitised mice (
