<p>To investigate the reason for the earlier increase in T cells seen in the MLN and the lungs of infected BTE sensitised mice, the number of CD11b+ and CD103+ DCs were analysed in the MLN at day 3 p.i. Mice sensitised with BTE and infected with influenza showed a significant increase in the number of CD11b+ DCs compared to infected PBS treated mice and non-infected BTE sensitised mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). There was no difference in the number of CD103+ DCs detected in either infected BTE sensitised or infected PBS treated mice. However, there was a significant increase in the number of CD103+ DCs in both infected groups compared to non-infected BTE sensitised mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190063.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), indicating that influenza infection was responsible for the trafficking of CD103+ DCs to the MLN, as shown previously [
