<p>To further identify if the enhanced proliferation was due to augmented DC presentation by CD103+ DCs from BTE sensitised mice, or if in these mice the CD11b+ DCs were now able to cross-present to CD8 T cells, both DC populations were sorted by flow cytometry from the MLN of PBS treated or BTE sensitised mice that were infected with PR8-OVA, at day 3 p.i. Sorted DCs were cultured with na√Øve CTV labelled OT-1 CD8 T cells for three days, after which their proliferation was analysed. CD103+ DCs from infected PBS treated mice induced significant proliferation of OT-1 CD8 T cells, as seen by their CTV dilution, compared to CD11b+ DCs from the same mice. In contrast, in BTE sensitised mice significant CD8 T cell proliferation was only seen in the presence of CD11b+ DCs, and not CD103+ DCs, indicating that CD11b+ DCs were the main DC population presenting antigen to OT-1 CD8 T cells and responsible for the enhanced T cell proliferation seen earlier (
