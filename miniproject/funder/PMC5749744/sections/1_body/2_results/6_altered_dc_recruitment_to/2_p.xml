<p>To study the T cell response to influenza, CellTrace Violet (CTV) labelled OT-1 CD8 T cells were adoptively transferred into either PBS treated or BTE sensitised mice that were then infected with the recombinant influenza virus PR8-OVA. This virus contains the OVA epitope SIINFEKL that is specifically recognised by OT-1 CD8 T cells. Mice were culled at day 3 p.i. and their MLN analysed for the proliferation of OT-1 CD8 T cells. Sensitisation with BTE prior to infection led to a significant increase in the proliferation of OT-1 CD8 T cells in the MLN compared to infected PBS treated mice, as seen by the increased number of proliferation cycles and by the increased percentage of divided cells, 16% in infected PBS treated mice versus 37% in infected BTE sensitised mice (
