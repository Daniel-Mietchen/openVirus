<p>As the immune response in infected BTE sensitised mice appeared to begin earlier than that of infected PBS treated mice we analysed the initial phase of the influenza infection, in particular which cells were present in the MLN during the early phase of the immune response to the virus. BTE sensitised or PBS treated mice were infected with influenza and at day 3 p.i. their MLN analysed for innate and adaptive immune cells. BTE sensitised and infected mice had a significant increase in a number of innate immune cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils and NK cells, compared to PBS infected mice (
