<p>As well as increasing the numbers of DCs, T cells and eosinophils, BTE sensitisation also increased NK cell numbers in the MLN. A significant increase was also seen in the airways of BTE sensitised mice following influenza infection, but not in PBS infected mice. NK cells have been shown to be important in both the establishment of allergic disease [

 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Whilst we did not investigate the role of NK cells in our model, others have studied the effect of depleting NK cells in models of asthma and influenza, but these studies have yielded conflicting results [

 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, we also observed an increase in the presence of mucus secreting goblet cells in the lungs of BTE sensitised and infected mice compared to PBS infected mice. Whilst we did not investigate the role of excess mucus production in the protection against influenza infection, it is possible that the presence of more mucus within the airways led to less of the virus being available to infect the epithelium.
