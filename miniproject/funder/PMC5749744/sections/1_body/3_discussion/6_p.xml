<p>In conclusion, we show for the first time that repeated low dose sensitisation with 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>tropicalis</italic>, prior to influenza infection leads to an augmented innate and adaptive immune response in the MLN, lungs and airway. Sensitised and infected mice were found to have increased numbers of CD11b+ DCs in the MLN, which were found to be capable of priming CD8 specific T cells 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>, resulting in the earlier appearance of T cells in the lungs, faster clearance of the virus, and subsequently reduced weight loss and reduced lung damage. Whilst the focused of these studies has been on the role of dendritic cells and T cells, the role other immune cells may play in lessening influenza pathology cannot be ruled out and warrant further investigation. However, we believe these studies provide a novel explanation for the protective effects of asthma that were seen in patients during the 2009 pandemic. Several groups including our own have now reported on the phenomenon of asthma being a protective state against influenza induced pathology. Whilst this does not appear to be true for other respiratory viruses, it is a significant discovery which could help in the future treatment of asthmatics during subsequent influenza outbreaks.
