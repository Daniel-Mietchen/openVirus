<p>The findings presented here show that prior exposure to low dose allergen can promote a beneficial immune response to subsequent influenza viral infection. Infected allergen exposed mice had augmented innate and adaptive immune responses, seen in the lung draining lymph nodes (MLN), lungs and airways, which led to the earlier recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as influenza specific CD8 T cells into the lungs. The result of this earlier inflammation of the lungs was faster clearance of the virus, reduced viral induced weight loss and reduced lung damage.</p>
