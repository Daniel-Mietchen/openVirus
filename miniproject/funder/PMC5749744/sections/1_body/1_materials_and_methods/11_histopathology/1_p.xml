<p>For haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining the chest cavity was opened and the lungs exposed. The aortic artery cut to release blood flow. Lungs were then inflated with 3x10ml of PBS through the heart or until the lungs turned white. A cannula was inserted into the trachea and 1ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) injected to fix the lungs. Lungs were then immersed in 4% PFA. Paraffin-embedded sections (4μm) were cut and stained with H&amp;E. A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to grade the size of lung infiltrates as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, a score of 5 signified a large (&gt; 3 cells deep) widespread inflammatory infiltrate around the majority of vessels and bronchioles, and a score of 1 represented a small (≤ 2 cells deep) number of inflammatory foci. For goblet cell hyperplasia analysis, sections were stained with PAS and a semi-quantitative scoring system was used where positively stained cells in the airway epithelium were measured (0 = &lt; 5% goblet cells; 1 = 5–25%; 2 = 25–50%; 3 = 50–75%; 4 = &gt; 75%). The sum of the airway scores from each lung was divided by the number of airways examined (20–40 per mouse), and expressed as mucus score in arbitrary units.
