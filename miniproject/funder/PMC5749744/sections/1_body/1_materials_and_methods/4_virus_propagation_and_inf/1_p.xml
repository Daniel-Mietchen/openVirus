<p>Influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (VR-95) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Recombinant influenza A/PR/8/34 containing the chicken OVA epitope SIINFEKL (PR/8-OT-1) was a gift from Dr. Paul Thomas (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA). Influenza viruses A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and PR/8-OT-1 virus (with the SIINFEKL epitope) were grown in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Influenza virus was quantified by making serial ten-fold dilutions of virus that were allowed to adsorb onto confluent monolayers of Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34, ATCC, USA) on a 24-well plate for 1 hour at 37°C. The supernatant was then removed and replaced with 1% agarose supplemented with serum free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Singapore) and 2μg/ml TPCK (L(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone) treated Trypsin (Pierce, Research instruments, Singapore). Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Agarose overlays were then removed and the plaques were visualized and enumerated after the addition of crystal violet stain. C57BL/6 mice were infected i.n. with 20μl of 10 PFU PR8 influenza virus or 100–500 PFU PR8-OVA virus, whilst under light anaesthesia with a 3% isoflurane oxygen mixture. Following infection weight change was monitored daily. Mice were euthanized prior to the endpoint if they lost more than 25% of their original weight.
