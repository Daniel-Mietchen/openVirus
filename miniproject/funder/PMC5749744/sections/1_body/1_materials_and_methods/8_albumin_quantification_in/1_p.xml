<p>Albumin in BAL supernatants were quantified by ELISA using the Mouse Albumin ELISA Quantitation Set from Bethyl Laboratories, Inc (Montgomery, Texas, USA) according to manufactures instructions. Briefly, Immunosorb ELISA plates (Nunc, Singapore) were coated with purified antibody for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were washed five times and blocking solution added for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed five times and samples or standards were added for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were washed five times and horseradish peroxidase detection antibody added for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were washed five times and tetramethylbenzidine was added. Plates were incubated at room temperature in the dark. The enzymatic colour reaction was stopped using 1M H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and optical densities read at 450nm. The concentration of albumin was determined from the standard curve.
