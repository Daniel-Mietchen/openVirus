<p>Mice were sacrificed using carbon-dioxide asphyxiation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed using three aliquots of 0.4ml PBS into the trachea of cannulated mice. BAL fluid was centrifuged (200xg, 5 min at 4°C) and supernatants were stored at -80°C for cytokine analysis. Cells were resuspended in 0.2ml red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (0.15M ammonium chloride, 1mM potassium hydrogen carbonate, 0.1mM disodium EDTA and 800ml of distilled water, pH 7.2) for 3 min at room temperature. 0.8ml of PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum and 5mM EDTA (flow buffer) was added and cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5ml flow buffer before staining with the appropriate antibodies. To isolate cells from the lungs, lungs were first excised and chopped into smaller pieces and digested in 0.5mg/ml Liberase CI (Roche Diagnostics, Singapore) for 40 min at 37°C, before physical disruption into single cell suspension by filtration through a 70μm cell strainer (Fischer Scientific, Singapore). Single cell suspensions were treated with 3ml of RBC lysis buffer at room temperature for 5 min, topped up with 3ml of flow buffer and centrifuged (600xg, 5 min at 4°C). Cells were resuspended in 0.5ml or 1ml of complete media or flow buffer and filtered through a 70μm cell strainer.</p>
