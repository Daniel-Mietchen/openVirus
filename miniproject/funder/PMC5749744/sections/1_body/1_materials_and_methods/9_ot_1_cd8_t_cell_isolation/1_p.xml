<p>Spleen and lymph nodes were obtained from naïve female OT-1 C57BL/6 mice. Lymph nodes were processed as previously described above. To obtain a single cell suspension, spleens were physically disrupted and filtered through a 70μm cell strainer, topped up with flow buffer and centrifuged (600xg, 5 min at 4°C). Red bloods cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer and CD8+ T cells were isolated using the EasySep Mouse CD8 T cell Isolation Kit according to manufactures instructions (STEMCELL Technologies, Singapore). Isolated CD8+ T cells were labelled with 5μM CellTrace Violet dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions resuspended in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution at 2x10
 <sup>7</sup>/ml. For adoptive transfer 100μl of the cell suspension was injected via the retro-orbital route into mice anesthetised with isoflurane.
