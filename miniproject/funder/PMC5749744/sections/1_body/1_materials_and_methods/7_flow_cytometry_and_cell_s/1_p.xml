<p>Prepared cells were washed with PBS twice and stained with the LIVE/DEAD fixable dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen, Singapore) for 20 min at 4°C in the dark. Cells were then washed in PBS, resuspended in flow buffer and blocked with Fc block (anti- CD16/32; BD Bioscience, Singapore) for 20 min at 4°C in the dark. Cells were washed in flow buffer and stained for surface markers for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. Following staining cells were washed twice in flow buffer and fixed using 1% paraformaldehyde. For intracellular staining, prepared cells were stimulated for 4 hours with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 mg/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml) (Sigma, Singapore) in the presence of 5μg/ml monensin and brefeldin A (BD Bioscience, Singapore) at 37°C. Cells were then surfaced stained as described above and fixed and permeabilized using the eBioscience fixation/permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, Singapore) overnight. The next day cells were permeabilized using the permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, Singapore) and stained for intracellular cytokines for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. Cells were then washed twice in permeabilization buffer and resuspended in flow buffer. The following antibodies were purchased from BD BioScience, Singapore. Anti-CD8 (clone 53–6.7), anti-IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2), anti-Siglec-F (clone E50-2440), anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8) and anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136). The following antibodies were purchased from eBioscience, Singapore. Anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11), anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5), anti-CD11c (clone N418), anti-MHC Class II I-A/I-E (clone M5/114.15.2), anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-CD103 (clone 2E7), anti-F4/80 (clone BM8) and anti-19 (clone eBio 1D3). Pentamer positive cells were stained for after FC blocking for 15 min at 4°C, prior to adding the rest of the antibodies. R-PE labelled Pro5 MHC Pentamer for H-2Db/ASNENMETM binding to NP
 <sub>366</sub> was purchased from ProImmune Ltd (Oxford, UK). Cells were run on a LSR Fortessa or X-20 flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, Singapore). Data were analysed using the Flowjo analysis program, version 10.0.8 (Ashland, Oregon, USA). The gating strategy used to identify eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and DCs is shown by the flow plots in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190063.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. To analyse T cell, B cell and NK cell populations cells were first gated on live cells, followed by doublet cell exclusion. A FSC vs SSC plot was used to identify the lymphocyte gate from which gates for T cells, B cell and NK cells were established (flow plots not shown). Total live cell counts were obtained by trypan blue exclusion and the total number of each cell type was calculated by the following formula using the counts obtained from the Flowjo analysis ((Total live cell count/Gated live cell count) x Count from the gated population of interest). For cell sorting experiments, cells were blocked and stained with antibodies as described above, but without the initial live/dead stain. Cells were sorted using a Sy3200 cell sorter (Sony Biotechnology, San Jose, California, USA). To isolate CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs single live cells were first gated on (Plots A and B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190063.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). A dump channel was then used to remove CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ cells, NK cells, macrophages and B cells. Cells that were negative for these markers were gated around (Plot C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190063.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) and MHC class II+ high and CD11c+ high cells identified (Plot D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190063.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs were then identified and isolated (Plot E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190063.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The purity for both DC populations were between 97–98%.
