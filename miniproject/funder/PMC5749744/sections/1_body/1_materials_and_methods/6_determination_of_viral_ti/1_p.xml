<p>Viral titers in the lungs were determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on viral mRNA as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from the lung using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Singapore) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA was synthesized using the High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Singapore). Real-time qPCR was performed on an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Singapore) using the GoTaq qPCR master mix containing BRYT green (Promega, Singapore). Primers used for qPCR were as follows: Influenza M-protein forward primer 
 <monospace>5’-GGACTGCAGCGTTAGACGCTT-3’</monospace>; Influenza M-protein reverse primer 
 <monospace>5’- CATCCTGTTGTATATGAGGCCCAT-3’</monospace>; beta-actin forward primer 
 <monospace>5’- AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3’</monospace>; beta-actin reverse primer 
 <monospace>5’- CAATAGTGATGACCT GGCCGT-3’</monospace>.
