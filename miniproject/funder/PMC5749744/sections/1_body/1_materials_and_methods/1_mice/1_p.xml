<p>C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks old) were purchased from National University of Singapore CARE. Mice were age and sex-matched for each experiment. Groups of five mice per cage were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and were transferred to the ABSL2 facility for experiments involving infection with influenza. Mice were randomly assigned to cages and each cage randomly assigned a condition as either a control or experimental group. The total number of mice used ranged from 10–20 depending on the experiment. All mice were allowed to acclimatise for 3–4 days prior to the start of the study. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages and given access to food and water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Prior to and during the experiments animals were monitored twice daily for health status. Mice were euthanized by flooding the chamber with 100% carbon dioxide gas at a flow rate 20–30% of chamber volume per minute. Flow rate was increased once the animals had lost consciousness. No adverse events were observed. All experiments were performed in strict accordance with the guidelines of the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research (NACLAR), Singapore. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the National University of Singapore approved the protocols (Protocol numbers: 087/10 and 015/12). A completed ARRIVE guidelines checklist is included (
