<p>OT-1 CD8+ T cells were isolated and labelled with CellTrace Violet as described above. CD11b+ and CD103+ DC’s were isolated from the MLN of PBS treated or BTE sensitised mice that were infected with PR8-OVA. Single cell suspensions were obtained by passing the MLNs through a 75μm nylon mesh filter. Cells were blocked with Fc block (anti- CD16/32; BD Bioscience, Singapore) for 20 min at 4°C in the dark and then stained with the appropriate antibodies for 30 mins at 4°C in the dark. DC populations were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting using the gating strategy displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190063.s003">S3 Fig</xref> as described above. Isolated CD11b+ DC’s and CD103+ DCs were co-cultured with labelled OT-1 CD8 T cells in a round bottom 96-well plate at a ratio of 1:10 (DC: T cell) for 3 days at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. On the third day cells were harvested and stained for CD8 T cells and CellTrace violet dilution was measured by flow cytometry.
