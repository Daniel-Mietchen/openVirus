<p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways which is characterised by increased pulmonary eosinophilia, elevated Th2 cells and mucus hyper secretion [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Based on recent estimates as many as 334 million people currently suffer from asthma worldwide and the number of people diagnosed with asthma is on the rise [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are many triggers that can lead to the exacerbation of asthma, one of the most common being respiratory viral infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has now been clearly shown that rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are two of the major respiratory viruses that can lead to asthma exacerbations [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, asthma has also been identified as a risk factor for influenza. Epidemiological studies of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 outbreak demonstrated that even though asthma was found to be the most common underlying condition associated with hospitalization during the outbreak [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a higher proportion of asthmatic patients were found to survive compared with patients with other underlying conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a separate analysis by McKenna 
 <italic>et al</italic>, the majority of patients hospitalised with asthma and without pneumonia, were found to be less likely to need mechanical ventilation or require admission to the intensive care unit [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In another study conducted in the UK, asthmatics admitted to hospital were half as likely as non-asthmatics to die or require intensive care support, despite presenting with greater respiratory compromise at the time of hospital admission and similar rates of pneumonia [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have now indicated that pre-existing asthma can provide a protective effect against influenza induced disease through the production of either TGF-β or insulin-like growth factor-1 molecules from the epithelium [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the role of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells in mediating this protective effect have not been investigated. Dendritic cells in the lung can be broadly divided into three categories, plasmacytoid DCs, CD11b+ DCs and CD103+ DCs [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many studies have now shown that CD11b+ DCs are important for the induction of asthma [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whilst CD103+ DCs have been shown to be important in the priming of CD8 T cells during an influenza infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whilst these DC subsets have been shown to be crucial in the development and maintenance of asthma [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the induction of the immune response to influenza [
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0190063.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] it is unknown what happens to these subsets during a comorbidity model of asthma and influenza. Our findings demonstrate that asthma can indeed protect mice 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> from influenza induced disease. We believe this is partially mediated by CD11b+ DCs in the lung draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) which are able to cross-present to CD8 T cells in allergen sensitised mice, leading to the faster appearance of CD8 T cells in the lungs, quicker clearance of the virus and a reduction in virus induced pathology.
