  <title>Gating strategy for DCs isolated by FACS.</title>
  <p>Mice were sensitized with either PBS or 0.5Î¼g of BTE 3 times a week, for 2 weeks. 24 hr after the last sensitization mice were infected with 500 PFU of influenza PR8-OVA virus. Mice were culled at day 3 p.i. and the MLN isolated. Representative flow plots are shown for the gating strategy used to sort CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs. (A) and (B) Single live cells were first identified. (C) A FITC dump channel was then used to exclude CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, NK and B cells. (D) MHC class II+ high and CD11c+ high cells were then gated, from which (E) CD103+ and CD11b+ DCs were identified and collected.</p>
