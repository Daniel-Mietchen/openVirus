  <title>Augmented innate immune and adaptive immune response in the MLN of asthmatic influenza infected mice.</title>
  <p>MLN from PBS and BTE exposed and infected mice were analysed at day 3 p.i. The total number of (A) eosinophils, (B) neutrophils, (C) NK cells, (D) B cells, (E) CD4 T cells and (F) CD8 T cells are shown. Graphs represent means ± SEM of pooled data from at least two independent experiments with n≥5 mice in each group. Significant differences between BTE/Flu and PBS/Flu treated mice are shown as *p&lt;0.05 and ***p&lt;0.001.</p>
