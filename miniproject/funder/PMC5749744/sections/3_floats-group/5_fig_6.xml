  <title>Altered recruitment of DCs and earlier T cell proliferation in the MLN of asthmatic mice infected with influenza.</title>
  <p>Mice were sensitized with either PBS or BTE 3 times a week, for 2 weeks. 24 hr after the last sensitization mice were infected with either influenza PR8 or influenza PR8-OVA virus. Mice were culled at day 3 p.i. and the total numbers of (A) CD11b+ and (B) CD103+ DCs were enumerated in the MLN. (C) and (D) Representative histogram and graph showing proliferation of adoptively transferred OT-1 CD8 T cells labelled with CTV, measured 3 days after infection with PR8-OVA. (E) and (F) Representative histograms and graph comparing CTV MFI of labelled OT-1 CD8 T cells cultured with sorted CD103+ DCs or CD11b+ DCs from PBS or BTE infected mice at 3 p.i. Symbols and bars represent individual animals with the mean ± SEM. Graphs represent pooled data from two independent experiments with n≥5 mice in each group. Significant differences are shown as *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 and ***p&lt;0.001, n.s; not significant.</p>
