  <title>Prior sensitization to influenza leads to enhanced NK and T cell recruitment to the airways and lungs.</title>
  <p>The total number of (A) eosinophils, (B) neutrophils, (C) macrophages, (D) NK cells, (E) CD4 and (F) CD8 T cells in the BAL is shown at days 4, 8, 11 and 14 p.i. Lung cells were stimulated ex vivo for 4 hr with PMA and ionomycin and surface and intracellular cytokine staining was performed. Total number of (G) CD8 T cells, (I) CD8+NP-specific cells, (J) CD8+IFN-γ+ cells, (K) CD4 T cells and (L) CD4+IFN-γ+ cells in the lungs are shown at days 4, 8, 11 and 14 p.i. (H) Representative flow plots indicating the frequencies of NP-specific CD8 T cells are shown at days 8, 11 and 14 p.i. Graphs represent means ± SEM of pooled data from at least two independent experiments with n≥5 mice in each group per time point. Significant differences between BTE/Flu and BTE/PBS treated mice are shown as +++p&lt;0.001 and between BTE/Flu and PBS/Flu treated mice are shown as *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 and ***p&lt;0.001.</p>
