  <title>Low dose BTE exposure leads to the induction of the asthmatic phenotype.</title>
  <p>Mice were sensitized with either PBS or 0.5μg of BTE 3 times a week, for 2 weeks. 24 hr after the last sensitization mice were culled and cellular infiltrate into the MLN and lungs were measured. The total number of (A) eosinophils, (B) NK cells, (C) CD4 T cells, (D) CD8 T cells, (E) CD11b+ DCs and (F) CD103+ DCs in the MLN are shown. The total number of (G) eosinophils, (H) NK cells, (I) CD4 T cells, (J) CD8 T cells, (K) CD11b+ DCs and (L) CD103+ DCs in the lungs are shown. Graphs represent mean ± SEM representing pooled date from two independent experiments with n≥5 mice in each group. Significant differences between PBS and BTE treated mice are shown as *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 and ***p&lt;0.001.</p>
