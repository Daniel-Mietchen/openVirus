  <title>Prior sensitization to BTE reduces influenza induced weight loss.</title>
  <p>(A) Protocol for sensitization with BTE and influenza infection. Mice were sensitized with either PBS or 0.5μg of BTE 3 times a week, for 2 weeks. 24 hr after the last sensitization mice were infected with 10 PFU of influenza virus. Mice were culled at days 4, 8, 11 and 14 p.i. (B) Weight loss following influenza virus infection. Levels of mRNA for the matrix protein are shown at (C) day 4 and (D) day 8 p.i. Albumin leakage into the BAL was assessed by ELISA at (E) day 8 and (F) day 14 p.i. Symbols and bars represent individual animals or the mean ± SEM. Graphs represent data from one of two independent experiments with n≥5 mice in each group per time point. Significant differences between infected and non-infected groups and between BTE/Flu and PBS/Flu treated mice are shown as *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 and ***p&lt;0.001.</p>
