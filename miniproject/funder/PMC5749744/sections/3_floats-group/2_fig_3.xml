  <title>Earlier increase in lung inflammation and sustained mucus production in the lungs of infected BTE treated mice.</title>
  <p>Mice were sensitized and infected as described previously. Lungs were harvested on day 4 and 8 p.i., sectioned and stained with H&amp;E and PAS. (A) Representative images of airways stained for H&amp;E and PAS are shown for day 4 and day 8 p.i. Semi-quantitative scoring was performed for H&amp;E stained sections at (B) day 4 and (D) day 8 p.i. and for PAS stained sections at (C) day 4 p.i. and (E) 8 p.i. Original magnification X40. Scale bar = 50μm. Graphs represent means ± SEM from one of two independent experiments with n≥5 mice in each group per time point. Significant differences between groups are shown as *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01 and ***p&lt;0.001.</p>
