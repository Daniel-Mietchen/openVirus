<p> Regarding the dose comparison: full dose; 1/5 dose; 1.000 IU; 500 IU; 250 IU. There is a very few virological difference among 1.000; 500 and 250 IU. My suggestion is to use: full dose; 1/5 dose; 1.000 IU; 250 IU and 50 IU. With these dosages you will have a chance to get the end-point of dosage.</p>
