<p> Eligibility: The sub-studies in children include ages from 9 months to 5 years. Considering the difference in YFV immunogenicity in children vaccinated before 2 years of age, which is demonstrated in several studies, and the WHO recommendation not to use the fractional dosing in children under 2 years of age, we suggest to the authors to justify why choose the 5 year age upper limit and if the stratified analysis is planned to both groups: 9 months - 2 years and &gt;2 years 5 years.</p>
