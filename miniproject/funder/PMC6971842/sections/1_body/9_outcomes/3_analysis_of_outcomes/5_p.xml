<p>Relationships between seroconversion and vaccine immunogenicity (PRNT 
 <sub>50</sub> GMT and GMFI) will be related to frequencies of specific T and B cell subsets measured by flow cytometry, chemokine and cytokine levels in sera and neutralising antibody levels to other flaviviruses. Correlations between vaccine viremia and immunogenicity will be assessed across the different vaccine dose strata. Comparisons of these immune and viremia kinetics will be made between the adult and children trial participants, whilst accounting for the administered vaccine dose.
