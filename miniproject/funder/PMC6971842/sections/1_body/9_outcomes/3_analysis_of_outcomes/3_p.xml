<p>Secondary analyses will include assessment of seroconversion in the ITT population as a whole, on the subset of the ITT population with baseline seropositivity to YF, and in the subset of the PP population with no reported history of flavivirus infection. Geometric mean PRNT 
 <sub>50</sub> titre (GMT) and GMT fold increase (GMFI) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) on day 0 and 28 will be calculated. A test of non-inferiority will be performed for the difference in GMT and GMFI between the full dose and each lower dose group. Titres will be graphically represented by reverse cumulative distributions obtained by plotting, for each possible value of the titre (abscissa), the proportion of subjects with a titre greater than this value.
