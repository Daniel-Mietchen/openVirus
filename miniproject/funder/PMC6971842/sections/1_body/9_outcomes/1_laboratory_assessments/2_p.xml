 </sup>, raising the question whether presence of antibodies to other flaviviruses at the time of immunization has an impact of YF vaccine immunogenicity. Baseline samples in the NIFTY study will therefore be evaluated for presence of antibodies to other flaviviruses (including dengue, West Nile and Zika virus) and their association with YF vaccine immunogenicity assessed.
