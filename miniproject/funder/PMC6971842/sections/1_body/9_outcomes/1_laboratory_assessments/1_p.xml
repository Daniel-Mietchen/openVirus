<p>Blood samples will be processed to serum (YEFE and NIFTY) and PBMCs (NIFTY) within 8 hours of collection. Serum isolated will be used for PRNT 
 <sub>50</sub> assay, considered the most sensitive and specific test for quantification of neutralizing antibodies and is the reference method for assessing immune response after vaccination

 </sup>. Viral RNA will be isolated from serum for detection YF vaccine virus by qRT-PCR on days 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 (see

 </sup>. In this study we will also characterise the cellular (T and B cell) immune responses to YF vaccination in both adults and children. Whilst these responses have been previously characterised, there is very little data from populations in Africa, including knowledge gaps on how the cellular immune kinetics change with vaccine dose (full vs. lower doses) and age

 </sup>. We will therefore isolate PBMCs from the blood samples collected at baseline, day 10 and day 28 post-vaccination and use these for assessment of cellular immune responses by flow cytometry. To complement the cellular immune assessments by flow cytometry, we will measure the chemokine and cytokine response to vaccination in serum samples collected at baseline and on days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 using a multiplex immunoassay system.
