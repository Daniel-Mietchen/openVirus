<p>The YEFE adult participants (n=960) will be randomized to receive one of the four vaccines (see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and one of the two doses (full standard dose or a 1/5 
 <sup>th</sup> of the full standard dose). The allocation ratio used will be 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 to one of the eight treatment arms per a computer-generated randomisation schedule. Results for the primary outcome and safety will be reviewed by the DSMB and one manufacturer selected for the sub-studies on children (n=420) and HIV-positive adults (n=250). The allocation ratio for the sub-studies will be 1:1 to standard and fractional dose.
