<p>WHO recommends that the final vaccine vial/ampoule should contain a minimum of 1000 IU/dose. However, there is no recommendation of a maximum specification and the final dose usually exceeds the minimum specification substantially to account for potential potency losses during manufacture and the three years shelf-life

 </sup>. The minimum potency recommendation was established in the 1930s and 1940s based on experience with lots that varied in titre and non-standardized measurements. The first international standard between different laboratories was introduced in 2003, where potency results are expressed in IU per dose
