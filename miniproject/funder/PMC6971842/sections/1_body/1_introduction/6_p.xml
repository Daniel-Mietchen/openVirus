<p>With the aim of ensuring an appropriate and coordinated allocation of limited vaccine stocks during epidemics, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on vaccine provision for YF reserves a stockpile for epidemic response. A stockpile of 2 million doses was established in 2000 and was increased to 6 million in 2014. However, in June 2016, and in response to a large epidemic occurring in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 18 million people were vaccinated depleting the stockpile twice

The fractional doses were used in a pre-emptive campaign to vaccinate 7.6 million persons living in the city of Kinshasa. An immunogenicity study was performed as part of that vaccination campaign, but the lack of a control group in that study precludes firm conclusions regarding vaccine efficacy
