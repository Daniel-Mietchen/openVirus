<p>It is estimated that YF causes 200,000 symptomatic cases and 30,000 deaths globally every year

 </sup>. However, the incidence of YF is believed to be much higher due to underreporting of asymptomatic or mild disease cases that are not identified during epidemics

 </sup>. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for YF, a highly effective and safe vaccine that provides lifelong protective immunity against all seven known genotypes of wild-type YF virus is available 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>– 
  <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
 </sup>. Reactions to YF vaccine are generally mild and include headache, myalgia, malaise and asthenia in around 10–30% of vaccinees during the first few days after vaccination. Serious reactions are rare and include hypersensitivity reactions to components of the vaccine, YF vaccine-associated neurologic disease and viscerotropic disease
