 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Yellow fever vaccines should contain a minimum of 1,000 international units (IU) of viral particles per dose</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The use of 587 IU/dose of the Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz vaccine administered sub-cutaneously to adults in Brazil was non-inferior to a standard dose of 27,476 IU/dose and protection was sustained for at least eight years.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>WHO recommends the use of fractional dose yellow fever vaccination as an off-label use in response to emergency situations where current vaccine supply is insufficient. The dose fractioning (e.g. 1/5th) should be decided considering the potency of the vaccine batch, the stock available and the suitability of injection devices. The minimal vaccine dose should have a potency of 3,000 IU/dose, but not less than 1,000 IU/dose
