<p>Participants recruited in YEFE will be followed up for 1 year while in NIFTY, adult vaccinees will be followed up for 2 years, and children for 1 year. Blood samples will be collected at different visits. In the YEFE trial, 4 ml of blood will be collected at screening (baseline), and on days 10, 28 and 365 post-vaccination. For the NIFTY trial, 10 ml and 6ml of blood will be collected for adults and children, respectively, at screening (baseline), and on days 10, 28, and 365 post-vaccination, with an additional sampling of adult participants at 2-years post-vaccination. Further, to monitor post-vaccination viraemia, participants will be randomized for an additional blood collection (4 ml) on either day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 after vaccination. The study procedures will be similar across both sites and these are summarized in
