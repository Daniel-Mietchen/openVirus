<p>The DMCs will be appointed by the sponsor and be composed of three independent members with expertise in clinical trials and vaccinology. The trials’ DMCs will be independent and will meet to review the safety data and reports submitted. After the first phase of each study, the DMCs will meet to review the data and make a decision on the fractional dose to be used in the second phase. The DMCs may also have ad hoc meetings convened by the chair and/or the sponsor. The DMCs will be empowered to recommend pausing or stopping the trial to the sponsor, and to request any additional information pertaining to participant safety that is considered necessary. The remit and functions of the DMCs are described in the DMC’s Charter (available as
