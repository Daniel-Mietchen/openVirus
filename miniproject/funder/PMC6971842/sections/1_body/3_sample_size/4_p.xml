<p>In the YEFE study, assumptions made for the HIV-positive adult sub-study were 83% prevalence of seroconversion, 90% power, 2.5% significance (one-sided test) and a delta of -0.17 (i.e. 17%)

 </sup>. The 17% non-inferiority margin was determined based on the HIV-positive population being a minority within a larger population and therefore having a smaller overall impact on herd immunity in the population if there is any reduction in immunogenicity, and pragmatism based on the numbers of participants that could likely be recruited. We increased the sample size by 20% to account for loss to follow-up and baseline seropositivity, giving an overall sample size of 250 for the sub-study in HIV-positive adults (see
