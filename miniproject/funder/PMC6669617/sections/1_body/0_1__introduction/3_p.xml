<p>Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) can be broadly categorised into two groups based on a combination of their pathogenicity in chickens and molecular markers in their HA protein. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) display high pathogenicity in chickens (when tested using an intra-venous pathogenicity index; IVPI) and contain polybasic cleavage sites in HA, resulting in the protein being cleaved by endogenous cellular furin-like proteases, allowing the virus to replicate systemically in birds. Only the H5 and H7 subtypes have ever shown this phenotype in the field with examples of HPAIV including goose/Guangdong-lineage H5Nx viruses, sporadic H7Nx outbreaks, and recent H7N9 viruses. Low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) are characterised by low pathogenicity in chickens (as measured by IVPI) and mono- di- or occasionally tri-basic cleavage sites in haemagglutinin, these only allow cleavage of HA by extracellular trypsin-like proteases restricting the virus largely to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, where such proteases are abundantly expressed.</p>
