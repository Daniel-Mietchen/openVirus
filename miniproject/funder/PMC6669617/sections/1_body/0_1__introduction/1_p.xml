<p>Influenza A viruses are members of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and contain a segmented, negative-sense RNA genome encoding 10 core proteins and a variable number of accessory proteins. Influenza A viruses are commonly characterised by their combinations of surface proteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), giving rise to a multitude of different subtypes designated, for example, as H1N1, H5N6, or H9N2.
