<p>The natural host of influenza viruses are wild waterfowl and sea birds which contain almost every known subtype of influenza (with the exceptions of H17N10 and H18N11 which have only been found in bats) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Viruses sporadically and periodically spill over from wild bird hosts to infect domestic poultry. Generally, these viruses circulate briefly before dying out (either naturally or by human interventions such as biosecurity and vaccination), for example the repeated incursions of H7Nx viruses into Europe and North America during the 1990s and 2000s [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Occasionally, however, a lineage of avian influenza will become well-adapted to poultry and continue circulating endemically, for example, the panzootic goose/Guangdong lineage H5Nx viruses, the recent Chinese H7N9 viruses, and multiple Eurasian H9N2 lineages [
