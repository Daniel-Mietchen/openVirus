<p>H9N2 viruses, the topic of this review, are an LPAIV subtype found worldwide in wild birds and are endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa. Compared to H5 and H7 viruses they are somewhat neglected, however, recent evidence, summarised in this review, suggests they could potentially have a major role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus.</p>
