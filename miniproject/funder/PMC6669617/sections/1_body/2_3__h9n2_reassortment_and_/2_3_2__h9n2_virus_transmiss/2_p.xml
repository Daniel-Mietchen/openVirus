<p>Many studies have implicated direct contact as an important transmission route for H9N2 viruses in chickens, although indirect routes such as aerosol and faecal-oral have been shown to be important for some strains and many viruses show primarily a respiratory tropism. However, some H9N2 strains have been shown to have an extended tropism for the kidneys or oviducts [

 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. However, many of these routes appear to be environmentally contextual, for example, at LBMs communal water sources have been implicated as the major route of transmission of endemic H5N1 and H9N2 viruses [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Together these studies indicate that for H9N2 and other enzootic poultry adapted H9N2 viruses, respiratory and contact transmission are likely the primary routes of transmission and that respiratory transmission may partly arise initially as an adaptation to poultry which clearly has implication for zoonotic transmission.
