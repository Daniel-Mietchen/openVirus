<p>Furthermore, when an HPAIV-like polybasic cleavage site was engineered into an H9 virus, an HPAIV phenotype was not observed in an H9N2 virus background. However, when the polybasic H9 HA was combined with the remaining genes from an HPAIV strain the reassortant virus did develop an HPAIV phenotype [
