<p>As described earlier ferrets are a commonly used model for influenza virus infection and transmission due to their permissiveness to many different strains of influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B169-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Mink, along with ferrets are members of the family 
 <italic>Mustelidae,</italic> and are widely farmed for their fur. Like ferrets, farmed mink is susceptible to human and avian influenza viruses including H9N2 and there are several reports of H9N2 being isolated from farmed mink in China [

 <xref rid="B196-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. All isolates were of the BJ94 lineage prevalent throughout China. Interestingly two of the mink H9N2 isolates contained the mammalian adaptation in PB2, E627K, which is commonly seen during experimental adaptation of AIVs to ferrets [

 <xref rid="B196-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. Furthermore, several serosurveys have been performed on mink to look for the prevalence of anti-H9N2 antibodies, all three studies have shown a high seropositivity in farmed minks in China of between 20% and 45% [

 <italic>Mustelidae,</italic> a single serosurvey has found antibodies against H9 HA, however, this is perhaps unsurprising considering the presence of H9 viruses in seabirds and the relatively long lifespans of the otters [
