<p>Swine are often said to represent a potential ‘mixing vessel’ for human and avian viruses, a fact supported by semi-regular establishment of human and avian virus lineages in these hosts. There have been many recorded outbreaks of H9N2 virus in farmed pigs, mostly in Hong Kong and China [

 <xref rid="B184-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. As swine carry viruses closely related to human seasonal influenza viruses, it has been hypothesised a swine influenza/H9N2 reassortant could emerge with high pandemic potential [
 <xref rid="B181-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Un-adapted, H9N2 viruses do not transmit efficiently between pigs, and swine H9N2 isolates show little evidence of mammalian adaption suggesting repeated reintroduction from avian hosts rather than continuous within-species circulation [

 <xref rid="B185-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Repeated serial passage through pigs can lead to partial adaptation allowing for modest replication and transmission [
 <xref rid="B185-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Although H9N2 viruses do not appear to actively circulate in pigs, there remains a possibility that these viruses could spill over into swine due to the proximity between poultry and pigs in many smallholding farms leading to the potential for reassortment with currently circulating swine influenza viruses.
