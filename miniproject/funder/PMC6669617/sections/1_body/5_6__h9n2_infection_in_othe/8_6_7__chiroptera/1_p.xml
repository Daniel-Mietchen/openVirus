<p>Recently there has been a single report of an H9N2-like virus isolated from bats in Egypt [
 <xref rid="B202-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Unlike other bat influenza subtypes H17 and H18, the H9N2-like bat virus was able to be isolated in eggs and binds sialic acid as its receptor [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It does still appear though that, although the virus is highly divergent from all known avian H9N2 viruses, it was likely a recent (compared to H17 or H18) cross-species jump from birds followed by stable circulation in bats as the virus has several markers of mammalian adaptation such as PB2-D701N.
