<p>Horses are hosts for several strains of equine influenza virus (EIV), most notably the currently circulating H3N8, and now extinct H7N7 strains. There is an isolated report of an H9N2 virus being isolated from a horse in Guanxi, China [
 <xref rid="B193-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. The virus was of the BJ94 lineage, the most common virus in poultry in the area, and most likely constituted a transmission event directly from poultry as no further, or follow up, cases were reported. However, as cases of equine influenza are rarely subtyped it is possible H9N2 viruses may be more common in these animals.
