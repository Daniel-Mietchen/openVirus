<p>Dogs are susceptible to several lineages of canine influenza viruses (CIV), the most common being equine-origin H3N8 and avian-origin H3N2 [

 <xref rid="B187-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. H9N2 viruses of the BJ94 lineage have been isolated in China several times from dogs with CIV-like illness [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>], furthermore, a pair of studies have shown high seropositivity against H9 HA in stray dogs at LBMs in China, potentially due to feeding upon infected birds [

 <xref rid="B190-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. In 2016, a single avian-origin H3N2 CIV isolate was found that contained a PA gene closely related to that of circulating avian H9N2 viruses suggesting the possibility of active reassortment between AIV and CIV viruses in canine hosts [
 <xref rid="B191-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. Furthermore, there is serological evidence for H9N2 infection of foxes and racoon dogs in China, further indicating canids may be a potential host for these viruses [
