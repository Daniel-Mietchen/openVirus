<p>Due to the co-circulation G1 ‘Eastern’ sub-lineage and G57/H7N9 viruses, we hypothesise that a potential reassortment event between a naturally α2,6-binding G1 ‘Eastern’ virus and the naturally mammalian pre-adapted internal gene cassette of a G57-lineage virus could result in a virus with higher pandemic and zoonotic potential than either parental virus, therefore, continuous full genome surveillance of viruses, particularly in minor poultry, is vital in this region of Southern China.</p>
