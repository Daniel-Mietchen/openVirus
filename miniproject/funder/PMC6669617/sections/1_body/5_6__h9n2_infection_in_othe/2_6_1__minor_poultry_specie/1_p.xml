<p>Although chickens appear to be the primary host for most poultry adapted H9N2 lineages, the virus is also endemic in minor poultry in many regions and appears to have evolved and adapted separately to members of these species, for example: quail, guinea fowl, partridge and pheasants [

 <xref rid="B176-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. The G1 ‘Eastern’ sub-lineage, in particular, appears to occupy a niche within these species [

 <xref rid="B176-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Quail have been shown to possess a more ‘human-like’ receptor repertoire than chickens, containing a higher amount of α2,6-linked sialic acids [

 <xref rid="B178-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>], indicating that viruses adapted to these species may have a greater zoonotic potential than viruses circulating in chickens. This hypothesis is supported by the higher relative binding of viruses from this lineage to α2,6-linked receptor analogues, the higher replicative ability of these viruses in human primary tissues, and also by the higher than expected rate of zoonotic infections caused by these viruses, relative to their limited prevalence and geographical distribution [

 <xref rid="B179-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. Further, it has been shown that passage of a duck-origin H9N2 virus in quail leads to an expanded host range, with a virus that can more readily infect mice compared to the parental duck virus [
 <xref rid="B180-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Poultry are also included in this host range expansion, which may explain the initial detection of an H9N2 virus in Japanese quail which preceded H9N2 establishment in poultry in endemic regions [
