<p>Pikas are small rodent-like mammals of the order lagomorpha (which also includes rabbits.) There is evidence from serosurveys and from direct virus isolation that H9N2 viruses naturally infect pikas in China [

 <xref rid="B200-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. As pikas are known to be able to be experimentally infected with avian influenza viruses, and due to the lack of any signature of mammalian adaptation (i.e., PB2 E627K), it appears more likely these infections are due to direct contact with infected birds or virus contaminated water sources rather than continuously circulating, mammalian adapted viruses (as may be the case with the H9N2 infected minks described in
