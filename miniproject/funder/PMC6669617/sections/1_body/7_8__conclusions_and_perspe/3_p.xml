<p>Endemic countries across Asia and the Middle East, as well as, more recently, Africa, are most under threat from zoonotic H9N2 infections. We have discussed how reassortants between H9N2 viruses and human seasonal influenza viruses are able to efficiently transmit between ferrets and there is, therefore, a real danger eventually such a reassortant could emerge in the field. Several H9N2 viruses have human receptor binding, pH stable HA proteins that could potentially allow efficient transmission between humans whilst other H9N2 viruses contain internal gene cassettes that allow extremely efficient replication in humans (i.e., genotype 57). Overall there is a clear risk of both intersubtypic H9N2/human influenza virus reassortant emergence as well as an intrasubtyptic human binding HA/efficient mammalian polymerase reassortant emergence, either of which could pose a high zoonotic and pandemic threat. </p>
