<p>In recent years, outbreaks of H9N2 viruses have been found in an increasing number of countries, including for the first time, sub-Saharan Africa, far South-East Asia and Russia. Because of its expansive geographical range, it is speculated that H9N2 viruses may currently be causing greater economic damage to poultry production worldwide compared to highly pathogenic H5 or H7 subtypes which are generally more localised. Moreover, the last four years have seen as many human H9N2 infections as the two decades before. These facts indicate a growing threat from H9N2 viruses to both animal and human health. Although the virus mostly causes mild disease and low mortality, as compared to highly pathogenic viruses, there is clear potential for the virus to continue to adapt and become more pathogenic in chickens and better adapted to humans. Additionally, there remains a clear threat, as highlighted by the repeated novel zoonotic AIV viruses that have emerged in recent years such as H7N9, H10N8 and H5N6, posed by reassortant H9N2-origin viruses.</p>
