<p>Global surveillance of LPAIV, such as H9N2, has a problem when compared to HPAIV viruses in that LPAIV H9N2 is not a notifiable pathogen and causes relatively few overt human infections. In many resource-limited regions surveillance is performed sporadically, or not at all. It is likely that H9N2 viruses are present or even endemic in more countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia, than is outlined below. For example, poultry adapted strains of the virus usually spread short distances (rather than by long distance flyways), therefore the isolation of the virus in Uganda in West Africa, most related (though not very closely related) to viruses from the Arabian Peninsula, ~2000km away, suggests that it is likely countries in-between also contain intermediately related H9N2 viruses which are yet to be isolated [
