<p>There is currently little evidence of endemic H9N2 in poultry in Europe, despite rigorous sampling (especially within the European Union). There is, however, good evidence for the virus in wild birds in Europe, mostly of the Y439 lineage, which occasionally spills over into farmed poultry (generally turkeys), for example in the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, Italy and Ireland [

Germany appears to suffer from recurrent introduction of H9N2 viruses into its poultry from wild birds and there is even a single report of a G1 lineage H9N2 virus. Due to this continuous spillover autologous vaccines have been deployed in some regions [
