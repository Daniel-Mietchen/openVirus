G1 ‘Western’ viruses constitute the majority of viruses found in poultry in South Asia, with a few Y439 viruses occasionally spilling over into poultry from wild birds (but apparently not maintaining sustained transmission). The predominant G1 ‘Western’ sub-lineage of viruses in this region (as well as in Iran) appears to have arisen from a reassortment event between co-circulating HPAIV H7N3 and LPAIV H9N2 viruses, which replaced other local clades [
