G1 ‘Eastern’ viruses are also found in South China, Vietnam and Cambodia, mostly infecting minor poultry species such as quail. Y439 lineage viruses have been found in wild birds (and sporadically in poultry) throughout Eurasia but a distinct poultry-adapted subset circulates endemically in poultry in South Korea. Vaccination of poultry has been used in recent years to try to control endemic diseases in large areas of China and South Korea [
