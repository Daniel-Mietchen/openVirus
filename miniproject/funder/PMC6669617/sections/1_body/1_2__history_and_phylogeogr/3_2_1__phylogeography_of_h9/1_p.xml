<p>Phylogenetically, the HA gene of H9N2 viruses can be broadly split into two major branches, a Eurasian branch and an American branch. American H9N2 viruses are mostly found in wild birds but have been described to infect farmed turkeys without stably circulating in poultry. Eurasian H9N2 viruses, conversely, have established at least three stable poultry lineages, named after their prototypic viruses, A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997, A/chicken/Beijing/1/94 and A/chicken/Hong Kong/Y439/1997, known consequently as the G1, BJ94 (also known variously as the Y280 or G9 lineage) and Y439 (also sometimes known as the Korean lineage) lineages [

The G1 lineage can further be split into two phylogenetic and geographical sub-lineages referred to as the ‘Western’ and ‘Eastern’ sub-lineages. H9N2 lineage and sub-lineages can be, and routinely are, further subdivided based on relatedness and geographical distribution [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], however for this review the previously described lineages/sub-lineages will be used throughout.
