<p>Whenever H9N2 virus prevalence has been investigated in lower- and middle-income countries, either by poultry sero-surveys or by passive sampling (i.e., random sampling of apparently healthy birds), the virus has been found to be present at extremely high rates, particularly in live bird markets (LBMs). LBMs act as hubs for poultry traders and their birds and are a major component of the disease transmission pathway, shown to maintain AIV dissemination among poultry as well as facilitate zoonotic infection [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Several separate studies have shown that the prevalence in Bangladesh and Pakistan of H9 viruses in chickens at LBMs and farms was almost 10% [

 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Another recent study has shown prevalence of upwards of 10% at LBMs in Egypt. Overall, these studies imply a degree of hyper-endemicity not seen for other influenza virus subtypes, potentially due to the LPAIV phenotype of the virus allowing repeated re-infections of the same birds (in the case of longer-lived layers and breeders) and silent spread between farms and smallholdings.
