<p>Other than vaccination and stamping out, several other interventions have been successfully used in the field to halt or reduce avian influenza virus spread in poultry and subsequent zoonotic infection. As discussed above LBMs are a hotspot for influenza infection due to the convergence of a high density of different poultry species from across a wide geographic range. LBMs were identified early on as the main sources of AIV outbreaks in the late 1990s in China and Hong Kong and several interventions were utilised such as temporary closures, periodic rest days, and overnight market depopulation, as well as basic increases in biosecurity and hygiene practises. A detailed review of the effectiveness of these practises has previously been performed by Offeddu and colleagues, who concluded that these practises, particularly LBM closure, were effective at both halting the spread of AIV between birds, as well as having a knock-on effect at reducing zoonotic AIV cases [

A second detailed review by Fourni√© and colleagues indicated that individual as well as community-wide habits which expose humans to AIVs and risk of zoonotic infection are highly heterogeneous and may require control strategies tailored to individual communities [
