<p>Stamping out, which involves culling of potentially infected birds and birds presenting influenza-related morbidity has occasionally been used as a first line of defence against H9N2 in countries without a history of the virus. This was the case during early outbreaks in Korea and the recent outbreaks in Russia and Ghana [

 <xref rid="B203-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. However, once the virus becomes endemic in a country, stamping out becomes uneconomical and unfeasible, therefore vaccination is commonly used beyond this point. Stamping out is more often used during HPAIV outbreaks due to their status as notifiable diseases, regardless of a countries history with outbreaks/endemicity.
