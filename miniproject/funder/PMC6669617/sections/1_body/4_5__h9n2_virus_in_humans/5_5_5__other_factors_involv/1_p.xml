<p>Other than HA receptor binding several other factors have been well described as potentially giving H9N2 AIVs an intrinsic pandemic potential. HA pH stability is well described as being vital for adaptation of avian or swine influenza viruses to stable airborne transmission between ferrets or humans [

 <xref rid="B174-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. H9N2 viruses appear to have intrinsically more stable HAs compared to AIVs of the H5 and H7 subtype, in a similar range to early H1N1pdm09 viruses [

Furthermore, several adaptive mutations have been identified in field viruses that allow them to transmit by an airborne route between chickens, it is thought these would probably have the added effect of allowing more efficient transmission between humans as well [
