<p>Receptor binding preference of HA protein is a well-established determinant of zoonotic and pandemic potential [

 <xref rid="B158-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Multiple studies have therefore attempted to evaluate this property of H9N2 AIVs. Initial studies showed that some H9N2 virus lineages, particularly the G1 and BJ94 lineages, appeared to possess a preference towards human-like α2,6-linked sialic acid over avian-like α2,3-linked SA. Subsequent studies utilised synthetic receptor analogues, including sulphated and fucosylated variants of the classically avian-like 3SLN receptor analogue. These studies showed that H9N2 viruses, particularly those of the G1 ‘Eastern’ sub-lineage and BJ94 lineage viruses, displayed high binding towards analogues sulphated on the antepenultimate sugar, though a few viruses of the G1 ‘Eastern’ sub-lineage also displayed moderate ‘human-like’ 6SLN binding [

 <xref rid="B160-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. A further study, utilising purified recombinant H9 HA and glycan arrays, found binding to α2,3-linked sialosides, as well as some binding to α2,6-, and α2,8- or α2,9- linked receptors [

Furthermore, several studies have looked at the receptor binding of BJ94 lineage viruses using ELISA based methods, these have unanimously showed that contemporary H9N2 viruses show a preference for the ‘human-like’ receptor analogue 6SLN over ‘avian-like’ 3SLN [
