<p>Several studies have investigated the molecular basis of H9N2 receptor binding. In separate studies, it has been found that the HA receptor binding site residues 155, 190, 193, 226 and 227 (H3 numbering) are all involved in the receptor binding avidity of H9N2 viruses [

 <xref rid="B168-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. As with many other influenza subtypes, the substitution Q226L, appears to significantly shift the receptor binding of H9 HA towards a human-like preference in certain viral backgrounds [
