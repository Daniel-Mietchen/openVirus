<p>The increase in H9N2 isolation rates due to greater screening of patients with influenza-like illness indicates that mild, or even symptomatic, human H9N2 cases may be relatively common. This possibility is supported by an extensive body of serological evidence showing particularly high seropositivity rates amongst poultry workers in many enzootic countries including India, Cambodia, China, Vietnam, Egypt, Hong Kong, Iran, Thailand and Pakistan (reviewed in [

Serological assays looking at H9 exposure suffer several limitations such as H9-antigenic cross-reactivity with other HA subtypes, however, in recent studies this limitation has been overcome through a number of approaches such as concurrent sero-typing against multiple human and avian HA subtypes, meta-analysis, and longitudinal studies of poultry workers [
