<p>The 1997 HPAIV H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong (the so-called clade zero viruses) has retrospectively been shown to have received its internal gene cassette (all genes except HA and NA) from co-circulating G1 lineage H9N2 viruses [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genotype 57 (G57, also known as genotype S) viruses in China have recently become the predominant genotype circulating in poultry due to their enhanced fitness in poultry [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. From 2013 onwards, reassortment between these G57 H9N2 viruses and other circulating subtypes resulted in the generation of multiple zoonotic AIVs with a high propensity to cause disease and death in humans as well as poultry such as: H7N9 [

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] and, most recently, H5N6 all of which contain the six genes of the G57 internal gene cassette. Furthermore, several circulating HPAIV H5Nx viruses contain single or multiple genes from H9N2 [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>], including the predominant genotype of H5 HPAIVs circulating in West Africa which contain a PB2 gene most likely donated from an H9N2 virus [
