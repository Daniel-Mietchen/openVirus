<p>Overall, considering the large overlap and frequent co-infections between different influenza subtypes in chickens, intersubtypic reassortments remain rare. When intersubtypic reassortants are found, or experimentally generated, they rarely outcompete the currently circulating parental viruses to become the predominant genotypes (with the rare exceptions of the examples in the previous paragraphs) [

 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. However, phylogenetic analysis suggests intrasubtypic reassortment (between different H9N2 viruses) occurs at a very high rate and has been shown to greatly contribute to the increasing fitness seen in these viruses in recent years [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-11-00620" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This is likely due to the more similar host ranges, tropisms, and geographic spreads found between H9N2 viruses, as well as the fundamentally greater compatibility between gene segments that are more closely related to each other.
