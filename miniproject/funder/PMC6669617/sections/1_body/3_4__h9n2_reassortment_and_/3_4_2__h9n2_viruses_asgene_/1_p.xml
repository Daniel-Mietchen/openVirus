<p>As well as donating its entire internal gene cassette there have been multiple instances of H9N2 viruses receiving individual or multiple combinations of genes from other AIVs. For example, the predominant H9N2 lineage circulating Pakistan and Bangladesh is known to have received several genes from HPAIV H7N3 and H5N1 viruses [
