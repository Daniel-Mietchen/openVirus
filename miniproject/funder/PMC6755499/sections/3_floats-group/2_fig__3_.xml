 <caption>
  <p>Visualization of the pan-genomic gene-by-gene approach to analyse virulence factors across invasive and carrier ST-192 and ST-10217. Each gene in the full complement is organized in a radial concentric fashion. The six inner rings correspond to presence (dark colour) or absence (light colour) of a particular gene. The outer ring designates whether the gene is a known virulence factor (dark red). On the right is a phylogenetic tree of all six genomes. Groups A through G are annotated outside the outer ring. Also shown is the pathogenicity of each strain (carrier/invasive/epidemic) and the country of origin (E, Ethiopia; B, Burkinaâ€‰Faso; N, Nigeria; S, South Africa).</p>
