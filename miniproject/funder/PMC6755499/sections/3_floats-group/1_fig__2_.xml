 <caption>
  <p>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of all ST-192 sequenced in this study, with a Burkina Faso ST-192 genome (OL24904 – BIGS ID no. 56376) used as an outgroup. Recombinations across a whole-genome alignment of all genomes are visualized as vertical bars in red (multiple strains) and blue (single strain). In the middle of the figure, a kernel density plot of recombination fragment sizes for ST-192 and the full dataset is pictured. The size of the MDA Φ phage and of a full capsule operon is also shown on the horizontal (size) axis. The crop does not block any recombinations, but the vertical line visible on the top and bottom of it goes through all isolates.</p>
