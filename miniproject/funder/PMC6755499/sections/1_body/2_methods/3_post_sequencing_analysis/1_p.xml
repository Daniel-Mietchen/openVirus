 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in careful mode, using k-mer sizes 77, 99 and 127. Kraken 0.10.5-beta [
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used to assign taxonomic labels. Fourteen isolates were excluded due to indicated contamination at this stage, leaving the total number of isolates included in the study as 478. Contigs shorter than 500 bp and contigs with a mean k-mer-coverage ≤5 were additionally filtered out using an in-house script. The final assembly files consisted of a median number of 109 contigs/sample (range: 43 to 654 contigs) with a mean length of 18 878 bp, covering the ∼ 2.2 Mb of the
