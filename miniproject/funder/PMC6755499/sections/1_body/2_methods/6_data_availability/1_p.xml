<p>Contigs and metadata used in this study are freely available at PubMLST under the BIGS accession numbers listed in Table S1. Table S1 also lists the accession numbers for the Illumina whole-genome sequencing data at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). All Illumina sequencing data are available at ENA under the project accession number PRJEB29233. The sequence data from the South African ST-192 samples are available at PubMLST under the BIGS identifiers 41 961 and 41 860. Nanopore sequencing data of the strains Nig8/13, BL16188, AR00441 and AR06000 are available from ENA under run accession numbers ERR2259086, ERR2259087, ERR3336386 and ERR3336387, respectively. The two former sequences are part of study accession number ERP106106, the two latter of PRJEB29233.</p>
