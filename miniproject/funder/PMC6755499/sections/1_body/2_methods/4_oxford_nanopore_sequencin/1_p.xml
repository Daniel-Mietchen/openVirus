<p>Long-read sequencing was performed on two ST-192 isolates from Ethiopia, AR00441 and AR06000 (collected in 2014), and additionally on the following three capsulated strains collected as part of a 2010 carriage study in Burkina Faso: DL13591 (serogroup Y), DL20404 (serogroup W) and KL11168 (serogroup X). High-molecular-mass DNA was extracted from cultured bacteria using the genomic-tip 20/G kit and buffer set (Qiagen). Sequencing libraries were prepared employing the Oxford Nanopore rapid barcoding kit and 1D reads generated on the MinION platform using the R9.4 (FLO-MIN106) flow cell. The reads were demultiplexed and basecalled with Albacore version 2.3.4 (

Hybrid assembly employing both Oxford Nanopore and Illumina reads was carried out with Unicycler version 0.4.6 [

This resulted in the following completely resolved circular genome sizes: 2 063 454 base pairs (bp) (ST-192 strain AR00441), 2 056 963 bp (ST-192 strain AR06000), 2 185 934 bp (serogroup Y strain DL13591), 2 168 128 bp (serogroup W strain DL20404) and 2 188 654 bp (serogroup X strain KL11168). These genomes were compared with two complete genomes of ST-10217 isolates published previously, a non-groupable carrier strain BL16188 and a serogroup C invasive strain Nig8/13 [
