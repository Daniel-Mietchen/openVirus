<p>For the analysis of gene content among closed and circularized genomes, we created a custom pan-genome MLST scheme by including all loci that were present in at least one strain. The full gene list on PubMLST at the time of writing included 3048 loci, and 2453 loci were found in at least one of the closed genomes. The scheme was used in the genome comparator function of PubMLST [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The allelic calls were then used as external gene calls in the visualization software suite Anviâ€™o version 5.2 [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
