<p>Isolates were grown overnight on blood agar plates at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Genomic DNA was extracted using an automated MagNAPure isolation station and MagNAPure 96 DNA and Viral NA small volume kit (Roche), according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentration was measured using a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing libraries were generated using a KAPA HyperPlus kit (KAPA Biosystems, Roche) and NEXTflex DNA Barcodes (Bioo Scientific), as previously described [
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Clean-up and size selection were performed using magnetic AMPureXP beads (Beckman Coulter). DNA was then quantified using a Qubit fluorometer and the size of fragments was measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). Library samples were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform with MiSeq reagent kits v2 500-cycles (Illumina).
