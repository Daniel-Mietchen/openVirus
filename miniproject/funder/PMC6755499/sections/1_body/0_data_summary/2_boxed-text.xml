 <p>Meningococcal meningitis causes hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. However, the majority of those infected carry the bacterium in the nasopharynx without ever developing symptoms. Transmission occurs largely through these asymptomatic carriers. Whether an infection leads to clinical meningitis is thought to be determined almost exclusively by specific genetic properties harboured by certain lineages of meningococci. With a massive vaccination campaign targeting the major capsulated forms of the bacterium about to be rolled out, concern has been raised as to whether currently non-pathogenic strains can develop epidemic potential through genetic recombination. The current study evaluates the epidemic potential of sequence type (ST)-192, the most common non-pathogenic lineage in the meningitis belt of Africa. We conclude that it is unlikely that ST-192 will evolve into an epidemic clone. Our findings are of particular importance for surveillance and preparedness against meningitis, vaccine development and eradication campaigns.</p>
