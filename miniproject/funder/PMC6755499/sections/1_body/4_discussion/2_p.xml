<p>The relationship between carrier strains of ST-192 and a hypothetical epidemic type B strain is similar to the relationship between carrier and invasive strains of ST-10217. The ST-10217 carrier strain represented by BL16188 is thought to have become hypervirulent after acquiring a type C capsule and the MDAΦ phage. We know from the present work and that of Ganesh 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that ST-192 can become invasive through the acquisition of this phage, so the major unknowns are if such a strain could also (1) acquire an intact type B capsule operon, and (2) that this would increase the survivability of the strain enough to induce hypervirulence. Horizontal transfer of intact whole capsule operons is rare. ST-10217 did not completely lack capsule genes: it harboured intact alleles of the 
 <italic>ctrEF</italic> genes, which are responsible for capsule translocation. Comparatively, ST-192 completely lacks all capsule genes and would have to acquire a fragment of around 20 kb to be able to synthetize a capsule on its surface (region A, 
 <italic>cssABC</italic>, 
 <italic>csb</italic>, 
 <italic>ctrG</italic>; region B, 
 <italic>ctrEF</italic>; region C, 
 <italic>ctrABCD</italic>). Furthermore, a capsule operon would have the highest probability of being functional if acquired through a single recombination event (as opposed to multiple, partly overlapping events). We have analysed the length of fragments acquired through homologous recombination within carrier strains in our collection from Ethiopia, as well as specifically within the ST-192 carrier strains. From these analyses, we conclude that the acquisition of a type B capsule operon by an ST-192 member is unlikely, as this will require the incorporation of a sequence tract exceeding the size of fragments typically horizontally acquired by this group (shown in this paper), or in
