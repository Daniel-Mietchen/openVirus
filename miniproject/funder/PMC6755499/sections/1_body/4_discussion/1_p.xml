<p>Sub-Saharan Africa has suffered epidemic outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis every few years for at least a century [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Until now, only capsulated strains of serogroup A, B, C, W, X or Y have been capable of producing epidemics. This is likely due to the increased survivability of capsulated strains, mainly manifested through capsular protection against phagocytosis and antimicrobial peptides from the host immune system [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18, 41</xref>]. Traditionally, serogroup A meningococci have dominated the meningitis belt. However, the prevalence of serogroup A disease has been drastically reduced following large-scale vaccination with the conjugate serogroup A vaccine MenAfriVac since 2010. New cc types with non-A capsule types have since emerged, notably serogroup C, which had only rarely been seen in Africa in past decades, but which has recently re-emerged and caused massive yearly outbreaks since 2013. Now, as mass vaccination with a pentavalent ACWXY conjugate vaccine is being considered [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the major question is whether non-targeted capsule types are set to take the stage. Assuming that the ACWXY vaccine is efficient against all incorporated capsule types, the only major capsule type left to acquire is B, which is commonly found in Europe and North America, but comparatively rare in Africa. Capsule homologues have also recently been identified in several species of non-pathogenic
