<p>The extremely successful ST-192 could theoretically evolve into an epidemic clone through the acquisition of a type B capsule, 
 <italic>fetA</italic>, and infection with the MDAÎ¦ phage, although this would require a series of highly unlikely events. We, therefore, propose that despite its ubiquity, ST-192 is not particularly poised to take over as a dominant invasive clone in the wake of mass vaccination with a polyvalent ACWXY vaccine.
