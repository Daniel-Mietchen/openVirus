<p>Two virulence factors were uniquely found in the hyperinvasive/epidemic ST-10217 (the group B comparison): an intact capsule (genes 
 <italic>ctrABCDG</italic> and 
 <italic>csc</italic>) and the NEIS0527 (
 <italic>frpC</italic>) gene. The 
 <italic>frpC</italic> gene encodes an RTX family cytotoxin involved in adhesion, and is secreted by bacteria under iron-deprived conditions through a type I secretion system [
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The capsule is involved in anti-phagocytosis and intracellular survival, but actually impedes colonization and mucosal adherence [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18, 36</xref>]. Although not necessary for standalone invasive infections [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4, 13</xref>], it is possible that the capsule is a necessary factor for a strain to become epidemic. The presence of a capsule seems to be uniformly present in all strains causing outbreaks and epidemics, whereas the opposite is not true; many strains have intact capsule operons without leading to outbreaks.
