<p>Genes found in this group are potentially important for the invasiveness phenotype. Rather strikingly, the most obvious difference between the invasive and carrier isolates was that all the invasive isolates in this study had an intact MDAΦ phage, whereas the carrier isolates did not. Although the importance of this phage in ST-10217 has been previously described, it is noteworthy that the same change appears to play a major role in ST-192. In this case, the MDAΦ phage is the only relevant component that is present in the invasive and lacking in non-invasive strains. All other differences between invasive and carriage ST-192 isolates are either minor allelic changes in presumably unimportant genes, largely in genes encoding hypothetical proteins. It appears as if infection with the MDAΦ phage alone was sufficient to induce invasiveness in the South African ST-192. Notably, the presence of a capsule is not necessary for non-epidemic infections. However, the two ST-192 from South Africa were recovered 8 months apart from a single patient with a C6 complement deficiency. It is possible that a capsule just is not necessary for invasiveness in such patients.</p>
