<p>The carrier ST-192 (AR00441 and AR06000) did not contain any virulence factors that were absent in other groups. It is possible that they contain other genetic elements that suppress an invasive phenotype, such as for example phage defence systems, but we did not find any evidence for this in our presence/absence comparison (Table S3).</p>
