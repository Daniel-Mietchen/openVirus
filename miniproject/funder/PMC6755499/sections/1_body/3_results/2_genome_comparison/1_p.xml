<p>With the advent of hybrid Illumina/nanopore sequencing, completely resolving genome assembly graphs (i.e. ‘closing’ genomes) has become much easier. Comparing closed genomes allows us to inspect the entire set of genetic elements shared and unique between invasive and non-invasive isolates. Armed with this technology, we set out to determine exactly how far off the carriage clone ST-192 is from evolving into a pathogen. Two previously closed genomes can contribute key information to this puzzle: Nig8/13 (invasive, serogroup C) (BIGS ID no. 56 602) and BL16188 (non-invasive and capsule null) (BIGS ID no. 56 603) [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. BL16188 represents the closest known non-pathogenic relative to the Niger/Nigeria ST-10217 epidemic strain (represented by Nig8/13) and is, therefore, of great interest with respect to the minimum evolution needed to go from a carriage strain to invasiveness. It was previously demonstrated that conversion from a carriage to an epidemic phenotype was brought about in these two strains simply by the horizontal transfer of an intact capsule locus and the MDAΦ phage [
