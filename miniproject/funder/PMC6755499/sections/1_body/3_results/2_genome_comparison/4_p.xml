<p>We restrict our presentation here to known virulence factors across groups Aâ€“G, but a full complement is presented in the supplementary material (Table S3). Virulence factors that were absent in all isolates (e.g. 
 <italic>nadA</italic>) are not included. Note that although we only include the two closed ST-192 genomes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, the genome content of all 278 ST-192 isolates sequenced in this study are considered for the purposes of
