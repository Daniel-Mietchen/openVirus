<p>In this analysis, we also included the genomes of two South African ST-192 isolates [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that were highly unusual in that they caused invasive disease. These two genomes have not been closed, but they have been whole-genome sequenced with Illumina technology, which is indicative of resolution of the most important parts of the genome but incomplete contig ordering and with contig breaks in highly repetitive regions or at copy number variations.
