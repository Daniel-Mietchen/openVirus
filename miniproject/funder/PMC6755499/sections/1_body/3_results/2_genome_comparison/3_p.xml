<p>In order to identify gene elements potentially important for invasiveness, we performed a pan-genome allelic all-versus-all comparison between the two invasive South African ST-192 isolates mentioned above [36718 (BIGS ID no. 41 869) and 34526 (BIGS ID no. 41 961)], the ST-10217 carrier BL16188 and its closely related hyperinvasive strain Nig8/13, as well as two non-invasive, capsule null (
 <italic>cnl</italic>) closed ST-192 genomes (AR00441 and AR06000). We binned the genome contents into seven groups based on presence/absence patterns. (A) Genes found in all invasive isolates, but not in any non-invasive isolates. (B) Genes that are exclusively found in the hyperinvasive/epidemic isolate Nig8/13. (C) Genes that are found in all ST-10217, but not in any ST-192 isolates. Although BL16188 displayed a carrier phenotype, it is possible that it was ‘primed’ with genetic elements that could more quickly turn it into a hyperinvasive pathogen. (D) Genes that are found in all ST-192 isolates, but not in any ST-10217 isolates. (E) Genes that are found in both the carrier ST-192 isolates, and not in any other isolates. (F) Genes that are found in all isolates except for the two South African ST-192. Finally, (G) core genes; genes present in all six isolates and, therefore, irrelevant to the virulence differences (
