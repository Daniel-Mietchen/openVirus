<p>Most ST-192 (251/278) had a 98 % rMLST score, dispelling the notion that they differ wildly from more typical meningococci. We found the lowest ribosomal score within ST-53 (94–98 %), as well as in the closely related atypical capsule null STs that cluster with ST-192 cc isolates (ST-11587, ST-11593, ST-11595, ST-11597, ST-11617 and ST-11638.) These were clearly atypical in that their ribosomal score varied between 90–96 % and they differed a lot in MLST types despite relatively low genomic differences. In contrast to ST-192 cc isolates, all the above mentioned harboured both 
 <italic>porA</italic> and 
 <italic>fetA</italic> genes. Finally, capsule C and W strains exhibited highly variable rMLST scores ranging from 94–100 %.
