<p>Next, we profiled the samples by means of rMLST, which assays 53 genes encoding ribosomal protein subunits [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This method has been shown to robustly characterize deeper evolutionary relationships as ribosomal genes are essential and under stabilizing selection. The rMLST score denotes the percentage of loci that were identical to that of the type strain. For example, an rMLST score of 98 % would mean that 52/53 loci from the

A total of 8/8 ST-207 had 98 % identity, and the final capsule X ST, ST-181, was the most variable with 95–97 % identity across the 7 isolates. As for capsule Y, 16/18 had 100 % identity, with the remaining 2 having a single ribosomal mutation, bringing them down to 98 %.
