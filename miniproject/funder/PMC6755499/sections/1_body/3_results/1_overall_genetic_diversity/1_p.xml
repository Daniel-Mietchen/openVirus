<p>Among the 478 Ethiopian isolates included in the study, 346 (72.3 %) were capsule null (
 <italic>cnl</italic>), i.e. completely missing the capsule operon, and 8 (1.7 %) were non-groupable, i.e. missing various parts of the capsule operon. Genogroup X dominated among the remaining isolates (70; 14.6 %), although a handful of these displayed indels in some of the capsule genes. (Two isolates had a truncated 
 <italic>csxA</italic> gene, one isolate lacked a 
 <italic>csxA</italic> gene, one had a truncated 
 <italic>csxC</italic> gene and one isolate lacked the 
 <italic>ctrABCD</italic> genes.) Other genogroups, in descending order, were W (28; 5.9 %), Y (18; 3.8 %), C (6; 1.3 %) and B (2; 0.4 %). Among the 354 isolates lacking a complete set of capsule genes (including non-groupable isolates), a clear majority, 278 (78.5 %) belonged to ST-192, and 280 belonged to the ST-192 cc, which included ST-11598 and ST-11642. Remaining isolates with a 
 <italic>cnl</italic> genotype belonged to ST-53 (36/10.2 %, 46/13.0 % in cc53, which included ST-2075, ST-7389 and ST-11594), ST-198 (4/1.1 %, 7/2.0 % in cc198, which included ST-11741), or to a series of closely related STs not assigned to a cc (STs 11587, 11593, 11595, 11597, 11 617 and 11638, together 13/3.7 %). The eight non-groupable capsule genotypes (missing or truncated in one or several genes of the operon) were ST-175 (4; 1.1 %), ST-35 (3; 0.8 %) and ST-178 (1; 0.3 %).
