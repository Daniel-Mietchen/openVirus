<p>There were some geographical patterns of ST distribution. For example, ST-11372 (49 isolates in total) was less frequent in Genta Mechie than expected (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;1.0×10
 <sup>−4</sup>, chi-square test) and ST-192 less frequent in Kolla Shelle than would be expected from the overall distribution pattern (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;1.0×10
 <sup>−3</sup>, chi-square test). However, after correcting for testing of multiple hypotheses, all significant patterns disappear. Thus, we assign no importance to this village-to-village difference in ST distribution, and consider all demographic variables to be uncorrelated to the genetic variation in our study population.
