<p>ST-192 formed a very distinct clone within the full phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), with an intra-ST average nucleotide identity (ANI) of 99.9 %, versus a 97.3 % ANI of ST-192 to other STs. The ST-192 cc clustered first with the six closely related genotypes of the 13 
 <italic>cnl</italic> isolates not assigned to a cc described above. We could only find evidence of 23 recombination events within ST-192, with a median size of 2803 nucleotides (range: 17–10 213), versus a median fragment size of 834 nucleotides (range: 4–37 541) in the full dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) (Table S2). At least three of these recombination events were found in all Ethiopian ST-192 and involved known virulence factor systems. (Lipopolysaccharide synthesis through 
 <italic>lptA</italic>, iron uptake through 
 <italic>tbpA</italic> and type IV pili through 
 <italic>pilDFG</italic>.) The phylogenetic tree topology makes it clear that the capsule locus must have been independently acquired (and lost) through horizontal transfer multiple times throughout the history of these meningococci, since both capsule X, C and non-capsule-expressing strains form polyphyletic groups in the tree.
