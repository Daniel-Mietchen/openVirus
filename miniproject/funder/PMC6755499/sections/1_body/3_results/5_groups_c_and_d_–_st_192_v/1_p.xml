<p>Some further differences between ST-192 and ST-10217 (comparisons C and D) were that ST-192 contains 
 <italic>pglB</italic> and ST-10217 
 <italic>pglB2</italic>, which means that their O-linked glycosylation pathways differ and that the two STs produce functionally different lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) [
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, ST10217 has the ferric enterobactin receptor 
 <italic>fetA</italic>, whereas it is lacking in ST-192. ST-192 does, however, have NEIS2529/NMB1449, which encodes a TonB-dependent receptor. It is not known whether 
 <italic>fetA</italic> and NEIS2529 perform equivalent functions, although both are involved in iron acquisition. Also unique in ST-10217 was the capsule translocation system encoded by the genes 
 <italic>ctrEF</italic>. Note that these genes were also found in the apathogenic BL16188, despite this isolate lacking a capsule. The 
 <italic>ctrEF</italic> genes were located next to where the horizontally acquired capsule would be inserted, just upstream and on the opposite strand to 
 <italic>ctrG</italic>. The fact that the apathogenic BL16188 had this system in place probably helped make the transformation to the capsule-expressing phenotype possible.
