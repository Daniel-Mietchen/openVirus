<p>We have previously shown how a benign meningococcal strain could evolve into a hypervirulent lineage through the acquisition of a few virulence genes, illustrating that minor genetic changes in a microbe can have major public-health consequences [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With the ongoing development of multivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccines to be implemented through large-scale campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it is essential to estimate the potential of 
 <italic>cnl</italic> isolates to evolve into virulent and epidemic clones. To that purpose, we performed comparative genomic analyses on the isolates collected in the Ethiopian carriage study. We show that ST-192 isolates from healthy individuals lack several well-known virulence factors, including the full capsule operon, iron-acquisition machinery (including the deletion of 
 <italic>fetA</italic>, encoding an enterobactin receptor) and the meningococcal disease-associated phage Φ (MDAΦ). These operons are only functional if acquired through homologous recombination of a complete and intact operon, rather than piecemeal horizontal transfer of smaller units. Based on the size of the capsule gene cluster missing from the Ethiopian ST-192 genomes, which exceeds the size of fragments typically acquired by this group, it seems unlikely that ST-192 could quickly evolve into an epidemic clone.
