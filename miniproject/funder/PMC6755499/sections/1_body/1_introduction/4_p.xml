<p>While 
 <italic>cnl</italic> carrier isolates occur in various genetic lineages of meningococci [
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the few 
 <italic>cnl</italic> isolates described as a cause of invasive disease belong to sequence types (STs) ST-198 [clonal complex (cc) 198], ST-845 (cc 845) and ST-192 (cc 192) [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4, 13, 14</xref>]. The ST-192 cc is commonly identified in meningococcal carriage studies in Africa [
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>], but rarely elsewhere in the world. In a carriage study performed in Ethiopia in 2014, we identified ST-192 isolates in nearly 60â€Š% of the healthy carriers [
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Factors that could explain the success of ST-192 include more efficient adhesion and consequently entry, due to no masking of adhesins by a bacterial capsule [
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the deletion of the 
 <italic>fetA</italic> gene, which encodes an immunogenic surface protein that is a potential target for the host complement system [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
