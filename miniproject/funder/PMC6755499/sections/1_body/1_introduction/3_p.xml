<p>Except for very rare cases [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>], disease-causing meningococci are encapsulated and 12 known serogroups are defined based on the structure of the capsular polysaccharide [
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Six of these serogroups, A, B, C, W, X and Y, are responsible for nearly all cases of disease worldwide [
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, meningococci isolated from the oropharynx of healthy individuals are often unencapsulated [
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Either down-regulation of capsule gene expression, phase variation in the capsule synthesis genes or inactivation of genes in the capsule gene cluster (
 <italic>cps</italic>) [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] might cause this. Finally, in some instances, the genetic inability of strains to produce a capsule is a consequence of a lack of regions of the capsule gene cluster. In these ‘capsule null’ strains, the 
 <italic>cps</italic> operon is replaced by a noncoding region (
 <italic>cnl</italic> region), resembling genetic regions seen in other neisserial species, such as
