  <italic>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</italic> (CLCuMuV) is a serious and economically important viral disease agent in cotton and ornamental plants like Hibiscus in many regions of the world, especially in South Asia. CLCuMuV is transmitted exclusively by 
  <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> cryptic species complex. This virus was recently recorded in southern China, presumably an invasion from South Asia. This study was performed to estimate the efficiency of three species of the
  <italic> B. tabaci</italic> whitefly complex (tentatively named as MEAM1, MED and Asia II 7, respectively) to transmit CLCuMuV and Cotton leaf curl multan virus betasatelite (CLCuMuB). Transmission assays and real-time quantitative PCR were conducted using three cultivars of cotton, 
  <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>, including 112-2, Xinhai-21 and Zhongmian-40. The results indicated that Asia II 7 was able to transmit the virus to two of the cotton cultivars, i.e. 112-2 and Xinhai-21, with the highest transmission efficiencies of 40% and 30%, respectively, but was unable to transmit the virus to the cotton cultivar Zhongmian-40. MEAM1 and MED failed to transmit CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB to any of the three cotton cultivars. After the three cryptic species of whiteflies had fed on virus-infected cotton plants for 48 h, the relative quantity of CLCuMuV in Asia II 7 was detected to be significantly higher than that in both MEAM1 and MED (
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that among the three species of whiteflies Asia II 7 is likely the most efficient vector for CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB in 
  <italic>Malvaceae</italic> crops in China. Our findings provide valuable information to the control of viral diseases caused by CLCuMuV in the field.
