<p>Three species of whiteflies MEAM1, MED and Asia II 7 were compared for their efficiency of CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB transmission. Adult MEAM1 and MED whiteflies did not transmit CLCuMuV to 112-2, Xinhai-21 and Zhongmian-40, the transmission efficiency were 0 based on symptom inspection and PCR detection of viral DNA as well. Asia II 7 was able to transmit the virus, the average transmission efficiencies were 40.0%, 30.0% and 0 shown by both methods (
