<p>The DNA of the 10 whitefly adults was extracted with an Easy Pure Genomic DNA Kit (Trans Gen Biotech, Beijing, China). The DNA samples were stored at −20 °C. The primer sequences used for real-time PCR analysis are shown in 
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The β-actin gene was used in each sample as a normalization gene to verify equal quantity of whitefly genomic DNA. Amplifications were performed using SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara, Liaoning, China) and a CFX 96™ real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with SYBR green detection (Takara, Liaoning, China). The relative quantity of viral DNA was calculated using the 2−ΔCt method (
