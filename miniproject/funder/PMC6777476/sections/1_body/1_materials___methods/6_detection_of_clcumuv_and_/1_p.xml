<p>Quantification of CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB in whitefly individuals was performed after various feeding durations on CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB -infected cotton plants. Five hundred nonviruliferous 7 to 8-day-old adults of each species were transferred to feed on CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB -infected cotton plants to acquire the virus. Two detection experiments were conducted on the whiteflies. In the first experiment, 10 female and 10 male adults were collected after a 48 h AAP. In the second experiment, 10 adults without the discrimination of sex were randomly collected from each plant at the end of a 6, 12, 24 and 48 h AAP, respectively. Each experiment was replicated three times. The collected whitefly samples were stored at −20 °C.</p>
