<p>Nucleic acids from cotton plants were extracted using the method of 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Kidwell &amp; Osborn (1992)</xref> with slight modifications (primer sequences used for PCR analysis are shown in 
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). PCR was conducted with 25 micro liter volumes containing 12.5 µL PCR Mixer (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), two µL template DNA lysate (∼20 ng), one µM of each primer, 0.25 µM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 8.5 µL sterile water. Amplifications were performed in a DNA Engine PTC-200 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR was set to an amplification cycle consisting of an initial denaturing at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s and 52 °C for 60 s and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products of a volume of 10 micro liters were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarosgel in a 1 × TAE buffer and visualized by a Universal Hood II system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
