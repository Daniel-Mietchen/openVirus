<p>An infectious clone of CLCuMuV was used to inoculate cotton plants (
 <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> cv. 112-2), CLCuMuV (accession number KP762786) and CLCuMuB (KP762787) was isolated from diseased cotton in the Guangdong province of China. The plants were agroinoculated with CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB infectious clone pGreenII049-1.6A and pGreenII049-2.0β at the 2-3-true-leaf stage (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). At 20 days post-inoculation, the success of virus infection of source cotton plants was assessed by the appearance of leaf curling and vein thickening. The diseased plants were maintained in an insect-free room at 26 ± 1 ° C with a 16 h and 8 h of light and dark period respectively, for transmission tests.
