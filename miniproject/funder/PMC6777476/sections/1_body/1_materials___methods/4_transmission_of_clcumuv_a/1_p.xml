<p>For each of three whitefly species, approximately 7-8 days old, 500 whitefly adults were collected and placed on the CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB infected-cotton plants for 48 h of acquisition access period (AAP) to acquire the virus. 10 viruliferous adults were collected on the infested plants and caged on test plants to feed for another 48 h of inoculation access period (IAP). Plastic gauze cages (12 cm  ×12 cm) (homemade for insect-proof) were used to enclose the whiteflies on the top leaves of test plants. Inoculated plants were sprayed with imidacloprid (60 mg/L) to kill all the adults and eggs and kept for symptom development in insect-proof cages. Each treatment had three replicates with each consisting of 20 plants. The plants in each treatment were observed daily for the development of disease symptoms. After 90 days, the cotton plants in each of the treatments were determined by inspection for symptoms and PCR.</p>
