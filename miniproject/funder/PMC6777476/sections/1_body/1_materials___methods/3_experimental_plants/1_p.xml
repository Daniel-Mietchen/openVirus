<p>The cotton plants 
 <italic>G. hirsutum</italic> cv. 112-2, Xinhai-21, and Zhongmian-40 were planted in plastic pots (15 × 15 cm). The plants were grown and maintained in separate cages following standard procedures for growing cotton crops. All plants were grown in an insect-free greenhouse with a controlled temperature of 24–28 °C and 16 h and 8 h of light and dark period respectively. Cotton plants were raised to the 3–5-true-leaf stage in pots for transmission tests.
