<p>In the present study, the transmission efficiency varied with the cotton variety. Asia II 7 was able to transmit CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB to the cotton varieties 112-2 and Xinhai-21, but not to Zhongmian-40. Furthermore, Asia II 7 transmitted the virus to variety 112-2 more efficiently than they did to Xinhai-21. Differences in transmission efficiency were assumed to be caused by cotton cultivars with different levels of resistance. Twenty-two cotton varieties were screened for resistance to CLCuD by graft inoculation in the laboratory and whitefly-vectored transmission assays in the field cages in Pakistan (

Similar results were obtained when these cotton species were tested using whitefly-vectored transmission. Experimental inoculation of CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB infectious clones in 46 Chinese cotton varieties indicated that 4 varieties were highly susceptible to CLCuMuV (

In our study, the three varieties come from different cotton cultivation research institute in China, which were differences in genetic backgrounds, so they were different in resistance to CLCuMuV. Host-plant resistance in cotton cultivars is the best long-term strategy to protect the crop against CLCuD (
