<p>We have showed that all MEAM1, MED and Asia II 7 of 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> tested in this study were able to acquire CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB, but only Asia II 7 was able to transmit CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB. The lower transmission capacity of MEAM1and MED is consistent with the results of 
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al. (2018)</xref>. It has been recognized that there are differences in transmission rates of begomoviruses owing to various whiteflies (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bedford et al., 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Jiu, Zhou &amp; Liu, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). Evidence suggests that the distribution of CLCuD in South Asia is governed predominantly by a specific vector population, not by a host plant or geographic origin (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Seal, Van Den Bosch &amp; Jeger, 2006</xref>). Asia II 1 provided had the higher capacity than other species in the transmission of CLCuMuV among host plants of 
 <italic>Malvaceae</italic> in China (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Even though Asia II 7 is not the predominant species in Pakistan and India (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Ellango et al., 2015</xref>), while the cryptic species (Asia II 7) is found in China to be involved in CLCuMuV transmission. Based on Bayesian analysis of mtCO I haplotypes, Asia II 7 and Asia II 1 belong to the same Asia II genetic group (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">De Barro et al., 2010</xref>). It’s reasoned possibly that they have similarity in genomics and then share the capacity to transmit beogomovirus.
