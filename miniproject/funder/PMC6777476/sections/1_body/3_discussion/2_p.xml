<p>Begomoviruses are transmitted by whiteflies in a persistent and circulative way. Viruses acquisition, retention and transmission in host plants belonging to different families are associated with the successful spread of the viruses. The whitefly-mediated transmission of cotton leaf curl virus to cotton plants showed that the least amount of time required to acquire the virus by whiteflies was 15 min to 4 h, while the least amount of time required to inoculate the plant was from 5 min to 1 h (

 <italic>B. tabaci</italic>-complex species acquired CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB after a 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h AAP. Whereas transmission experiments revealed that Asia II 7 could transmit the virus efficiently, but MEAM1 and MED were unable to transmit CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB, which might be due to a transmission barrier present in non-vector whiteflies. According to a previous report that employed immunofluorescence assays, CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB had a poorer capacity to cross the midguts of MEAM1 and MED than the midgut of Asia II 1 (

 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Ohnishi et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that the greenhouse whitefly 
 <italic>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</italic> could ingest and maintain 
 <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> after acquisition feeding on an infected plant; however, 
 <italic>T. vaporariorum</italic> is a non-vector because of the presence of a selective transmission barrier at the luminal membrane surface of the epithelial cells of the midgut. The physiological differences in CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB transmission between Asia II 7 and the two invasive species need further study. Complete genomic information of Asia II 1 is studied (
