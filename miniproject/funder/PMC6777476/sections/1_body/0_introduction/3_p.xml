<p>Much more attention has been paid to the whitefly species associated with the CLCuMuV in recent years. Previous studies in the laboratory showed that CLCuMuV and CLCuMuB was transmissible through indigenous Asia II 7 and Asia II 1 species and caused CLCuD symptoms in kenaf and okra plants (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016b</xref>). Lately, tobacco plant was used as a virus source; and the indigenous Asia II 1 species was able to transmit disease-causing CLCuMuV to cotton and tobacco (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Field surveys conducted on 
 <italic>Malvaceae</italic> hosts showed that Asia II 7 was the dominant indigenous cryptic species of whitefly in South China. 
 <italic>Hibiscus</italic> serves as an ornamental flower and is transported from southern China to flower markets in other provinces in China. Perhaps via international trade in ornamental plants, this plant serves as a continuous source of begomoviruses. Therefore, an evaluation of the potential of whitefly species to cotton plants will help prevent the spread of the virus.
