<p>The sweet potato whitefly, 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), causes significant damage in different agricultural regions, not only by direct feeding as a pest but also by its ability to efficiently transmit several 
 <italic>Geminiviruses</italic>, and is responsible for a number of epidemics worldwide (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Gilbertson et al., 2015</xref>). The whitefly taxonomic group is believed to be a complex of over 39 cryptic species (

 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Alemandri et al., 2015</xref>). Different cryptic whitefly species may transmit specific begomoviruses with various levels of efficiency, and each of the whitefly species may only be able to transmit certain viruses (

Field survey of whitefly vectors have been conducted in the area of CLCuD-epidemic field. Asia II 1 is the dominant cryptic species of the whiteflies in Pakistan (

 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2018</xref>). Asia I, Asia II 5, Asia II 7 and Asia II 8 are identified in the field of cotton in India (
