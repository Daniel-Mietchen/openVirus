  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 Romanian PWID sequences.</title>
  <p>Circular tree: Maximum likelihood tree generated as described under Methods section. The sequences corresponding to PWID are colored in red and in black the control sequences. Rectangular trees: The transmission networks identified in PWID were further confirmed with Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Molecular clock analyses were performed separately for F1 subtype and CRF14_BG sequences. In F1 subtype tree, in red are marked the PWID sequences, in blue are represented sequences of sexually infected patients from Romania and in black are marked F1 sequences from Angola. In CRF14_BG tree, the PWID sequences in red are marked and in green the sequences from Spain and Portugal (PWID). Different clusters were highlighted on the trees and tMRCA was specifically marked for each cluster. The posterior probability support for each transmission cluster is represented at the internal nodes. The scale is in years.</p>
