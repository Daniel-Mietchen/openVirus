  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of HCV sequences in Romanian HIV co-infected PWID.</title>
  <p>Circular tree: Maximum likelihood tree generated as described under Methods section. The sequences corresponding to PWID are colored in red and in black the control sequences. Rectangular trees: The transmission networks identified in PWID were further confirmed with Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. Molecular clock analyses were performed separately for HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 3a, 4a and 4d. Different clusters were specifically indicated on the trees. The posterior probability support and tMRCA for each transmission cluster are represented at the internal nodes. The scale is in years.</p>
