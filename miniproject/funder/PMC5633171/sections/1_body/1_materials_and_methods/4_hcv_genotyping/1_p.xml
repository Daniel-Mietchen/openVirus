<p>Following RNA extraction as reported above, the NS5b and NS3 regions were sequenced for HCV genotyping. Ten microliters of extracted viral RNA were used for reverse transcription with Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) and random primers (Roche). For amplifying the NS5b region (374 nucleotides, H77: 8256–8630), 1,1X Platinum PCR SuperMix (Life Technologies) and previously published primers were used [
