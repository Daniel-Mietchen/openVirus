<p>Total viral RNA was extracted from 1 ml of plasma using the automated NucliSens EasyMAG nucleic acid extraction system (BioMerieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France), according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted in 25μl of water. Ten microliters of RNA were used for HIV genotyping. Reverse transcription and amplification of the HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (1301 nucleotides, HXB2: 2253–3554) were performed using the Viroseq HIV-1 Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostics, Alameda, CA) and sequenced with the ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primary data were analysed using Sequencing Analysis Software Version 3.7 (Life Technologies) and the generated sequences were assembled with ViroSeq 2.8 HIV-1 Genotyping System Software (Celera Diagnostics, Alameda, CA). REGA HIV-1&amp;2 automated subtyping tool version 3.0 was used to assign the HIV-1 subtype [

Unclassified samples were further analysed in order to identify possible recombination breakpoints using Simplot v3.5.1 software and the Los Alamos HIV-1 subtype reference dataset (sliding window: 400-nt, T:t ratio = 2.0, model of evolution: Kimura two-parameter, bootstrap: 1000 replicates). All sequences were screened for hypermutation using the Hypermut 2.0 algorithm [
