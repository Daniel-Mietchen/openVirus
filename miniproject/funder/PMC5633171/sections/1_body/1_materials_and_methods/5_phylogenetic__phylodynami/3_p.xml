<p>Phylogenetic analyses were performed using both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches, after selecting the best-fit nucleotide substitution model using JModelTest (GTR+4Î“+I for HIV-1 and TN93 for HCV). Datasets for each HIV-1 subtype and HCV genotype identified among Romanian PWID were constructed and analyzed separately. ML trees were inferred using FastTree software [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed with BEAST version 1.8.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] using a Bayesian Skyline coalescent tree prior [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Two Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs were computed separately for 10
 <sup>7</sup> generations with a burn-in of 10%. The output of the MCMC analysis was tested for convergence by means of effective sampling size (ESS&gt;100) using the program Tracer v1.6 [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was summarized with TreeAnnotator program [
