 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The temporal signal of both datasets was evaluated with TempEst [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Data were statistically evaluated and plotted using GraphPad Prism v6.0. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to identify differences between groups and the Chi-square or Fisher exact test were used to evaluate the distribution in particular subgroups; p-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.
