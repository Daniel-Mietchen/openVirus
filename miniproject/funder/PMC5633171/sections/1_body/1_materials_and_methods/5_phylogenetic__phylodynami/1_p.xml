<p>Reference sequences were selected from public databases [

 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] taking into account genotype / subtype, genomic region and geographic origin. To retrieve control sequences for transmission cluster reconstruction, the most similar HIV sequences were retrieved from our and Los Alamos database using BLAST. Duplicates and clones were discarded. Of 421 selected control sequences, those representative to geographical and time dispersion of the patients sample, were subsequently used for each analysis. Controls for all the HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs identified among Romanian PWID were selected as follows: CRF14_BG (Spain, Portugal, Romania), subtype F1 (Angola, Romania), subtype B (European countries), CRF35_AD (Afghanistan, Iran). CRF14BG epidemics from Spain-Portugal [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Greece [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were previously linked to the Romanian HIV epidemic among PWID. Subtype F1 strains from Romanian PWID were previously shown [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to originate from strains already circulating in Romania and formerly described as related with strains from Angola [
