<p>We have included in this study a number of 117 injecting drug users who were diagnosed with HIV infection between 2011 and 2014 in the National Institute for Infectious Diseases ‘Matei Bals’, the reference center for HIV genotyping. All patients were HCV co-infected and naive to antiretroviral treatment. A number of 35 non-PWID, HCV mono-infected patients, were also included in the study.</p>
