<p>Nevertheless, we identified 23 cases of possible co-transmission (19.65%), corresponding to patients with Î”tMRCA&lt;1 and clustering in partly overlapping transmission chains. Interestingly, these transmission events were associated with particular clusters of genotype 1a and 4a. Further investigation lead us to the finding that 22 of these 23 patients were in detention in the same penitentiary. While largely overlapping transmission chains would be expected, given the fact that this population forcely shares the same contact network while in detention, a higher likelihood of simultaneous transmission of the infections is not necessarily expected in this context. Therefore, our findings call for further investigation about what type of behavioral patterns explain the high rate of co-transmission of HIV and HCV in this penitentiary when compared to the rest of the PWID population. One potential bias in our analysis could be the subevaluation of possible super-infections and co-transmissions: phylogenetic analysis based on population sequencing considers only the predominant viral infective strain. Coincidental transmissions could be underestimated in our analysis if the transmitted strains did not become visible within the viral population.</p>
