<p>The HIV epidemic among Romanian PWID continues to represent a major problem and HCV co-infection contributes to the worse prognostic within this specific risk population. This study clarifies and compares the patterns of spread and transmission of these two viruses in Romanian PWID, suggesting that a higher rate of transmission of HIV rather than HCV is associated with behavioral changes mainly following the availability of new types of injected drugs (‘legal highs’). While overlapping of HIV and HCV transmission chains is common, the estimated transmission of both viruses within a short time span is less common, with a rate of only 19.65% in this population, and largely associated with drug injection within the same penitentiary. Our results illustrate the need for better prevention policies in the PWID population, in particular and more urgently in the prison population, where an outbreak of simultaneous HIV and HCV transmissions seems to be occurring.</p>
