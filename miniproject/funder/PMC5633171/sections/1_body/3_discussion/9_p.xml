<p>When comparing the transmission chains of HIV and HCV, we evaluated both the congruence between HIV and HCV transmission chains, as well as the likelihood of simultaneous transmission of both infections. We found that most patients (68.4%) were present both in HIV and HCV transmission clusters and that for the majority of the patientsâ€™ transmission of HIV and HCV occurred through (at least partly) overlapping transmission chains (
