<p>Previous studies have shown the genotype 1b to be mainly acquired through blood transfusion, while genotypes 1a and 3a are associated with intravenous drug use [

However, only HCV genotype 1b was found in the HCV mono-infected group, indicating a higher complexity of the HCV epidemic among co-infected PWID.
