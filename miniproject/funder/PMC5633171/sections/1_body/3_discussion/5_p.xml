<p>On the other hand, regardless of the HIV infecting strain, HCV viral loads were significantly higher in co-infected PWID than in HCV mono-infected patients. This difference does not seem to be related to the HCV genotype. Moreover, when comparing HCV mono-infected patients with co-infected PWID carrying HCV genotype 1b, the difference in viral load continued to be statistically significant (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185866.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Several studies have shown an accelerated disease progression in HIV-HCV co-infected patients, HIV infection increasing the HCV replication, hepatic inflammation and impairing HCV-specific immune response [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since CRF14_BG induced a massive depletion of CD4 T cells it was expected to be associated with impaired HCV immune control and thus higher replication and hepatic fibrosis. However, no significant difference in HCV VL was observed between CRF14_BG and subtype F1 infected patients or between HCV VL and CD4 count. Possibly, longer infection periods could be needed to impair the established HCV-specific immune response, since in most of the cases, HCV infection preceded HIV infection.
