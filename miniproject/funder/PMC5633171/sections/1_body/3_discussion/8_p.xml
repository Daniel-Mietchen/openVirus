<p>The differences in transmission clustering between HCV and HIV might be explained in part by their estimated acquisition time. Previous observations based on classical epidemiological data indicated that HCV was introduced in PWID much earlier, being associated with heroin use while HIV infection is linked with new psychoactive drugs [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Phylodynamic analysis presented in this study sustains this observation, showing that HIV strains were introduced in PWID in recent years whereas HCV genotypes 1a and 1b had been circulating several decades before. However, HCV transmission networks of genotypes 3 and 4 apparently started later, as they were dated as very recent (2010â€“2011), thus indicating a potential linkage of these genotypes with new psychoactive drugs.
