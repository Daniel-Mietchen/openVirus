<p>The clinical and epidemiological impact of HIV-HCV co-infections in PWID has been described by several studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but only one analysed in parallel the evolutionary history of these two viruses within this particular risk population [

Viral genetic information expressed as nucleotide sequences and analysed with phylogenetic and population genetics has been shown to be very useful in identifying and characterizing transmission clusters of rapidly evolving viruses such as HIV and HCV [
