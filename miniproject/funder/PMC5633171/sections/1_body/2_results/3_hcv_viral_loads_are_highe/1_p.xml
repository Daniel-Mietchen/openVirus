<p>All 117 patients were tested to assess the HCV genotype by analysing NS5b and/or NS3 regions of HCV. Both NS5b and NS3 sequences were available for 110 patients, while for the remaining patients only the NS5b region was available. The genotype assessment indicated that the majority of PWID were infected with genotype 1a (n = 47, 40%) and 1b (n = 40, 34%), but genotypes 3a and 4 (a, d) were also identified (

HCV subtype assignment was concordant in the two genomic regions in the majority of cases (n = 108, 98.2%), with only two exceptions of genotype 1 sequences (2749bh2013 and 2727bh2013) assigned as 1a in NS3 and 1b in NS5b. Unlike HIV-HCV co-infected PWID, the individuals in the HCV mono-infected group were exclusively infected with genotype 1b strains. Significant differences (
