<p>HIV-1 subtype analysis showed that 67.5% (n = 79) of the patients were infected with subtype F1 viruses; recombinant forms present in a significant proportion (26%; n = 30) were CRF14_BG (n = 19, 16.24%) and unique recombinant forms (URF) of CRF_14BG and F1 (n = 11, 9.4%). The PWID infected with these recombinant forms had significantly lower CD4 counts at baseline than patients infected with subtype F1 strains. It is true, though, that an estimation of the time to the infecting event was not possible in either case. No significant differences between these two groups were observed when HIV viral load (VL) or CDC stages were analysed (

However, a higher percentage of patients infected with CRF14_BG were diagnosed at stages B and C than the group infected with F1 (47% vs. 34%). Few patients (n = 8, 6.8%) were infected with other types of HIV: subtype B, CRF35_AD and URFs between subtype A1 or B and F1 (
