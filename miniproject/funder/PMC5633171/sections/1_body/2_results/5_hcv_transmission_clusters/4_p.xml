<p>Genotype 1b was found to be the first introduced in the studied population: the oldest cluster was estimated to be 30 years old in PWID and more than 50 years in non-PWID. Genotypes 3 and 4 are the most recently introduced in this risk group population, dating back 2â€“3 years before sampling. The divergence times for all important PWID networks, HIV and HCV, are presented in
