<p>Phylogenetic reconstructions uncovered several HCV transmission clusters presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185866.g003">Fig 3</xref>. As opposed to HIV where the virus has spread in only three large clusters, HCV dispersion occurred through multiple transmission networks. In total, 97 HCV sequences (82.9%) clustered in 13 transmission clusters. In comparison, within the HCV mono-infected control group only 8 out of 33 (24.2%) HCV sequences were found to form phylogenetic clusters (Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> = 42.18, p&lt;0.001).
