<p>Molecular clock analysis of HCV transmission clusters revealed important differences in origin and starting time points. The differences in divergence time were observed within as well as among genotypes. Based on relaxed clock and constant size population model implemented in a Bayesian MCMC framework, the oldest PWID network belongs to genotype 1b and originated around 1983 (95%HPD: 1968–1994), followed by the larger HCV genotype 1a cluster, dated back to 1987 (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185866.g004">4</xref>). However, the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) estimated for a sub-group of this 1a cluster consisting in 22 out of 23 sequences was more recent (2004, 95%HPD 1999–2006).
