<p>For the majority of the patients this analysis suggested that HCV was introduced first, followed by HIV. However, for 5 patients, HIV was introduced first; all of them were infected with subtype F1 and genotype 3a or 4 HCV strains. Twenty three patients had Î”tMRCA between HIV and HCV lineages of less than one year, suggesting potential co-transmission of HIV and HCV. These 23 patients (19.65%) were present in the same HIV and HCV cluster with at least one other patient, suggesting a potential simultaneous transmission (co-transmission) of both infections. We also found that such transmission events are largely associated with particular HCV transmission clusters, specifically clusters c and l (

Going back to the records of these patients, we found that twenty-two of those 23 patients were in detention at the moment of study enrolment. This population has a statistically significant higher probability of coincidental transmission (p&lt;0.0001) when compared to the rest of the patients. Five of these patients were infected with CRF14_BG and the rest with subtype F1; the infective HCV genotypes were 1 or 4 (
