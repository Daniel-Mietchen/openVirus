<p>Phylogenetic analysis and, in particular, measuring the difference in divergence times between viral lineages within a co-infected individual has been proven useful in assessing the frequency of viral coincidental transmission in PWID in the absence of seroconversion data [
 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have used the calculated difference of mean divergence times (ΔtMRCA) between HIV and HCV lineages within a patient to estimate the time period lapsed between the acquisition of the two viruses. Low ΔtMRCA indicates a higher likelihood that the two viruses might have been co-transmitted to a susceptible individual, while higher values of ΔtMRCA suggest that the viruses were transmitted at different and distinct time points.
