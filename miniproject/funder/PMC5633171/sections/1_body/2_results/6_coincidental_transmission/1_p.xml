<p>We have comparatively analysed the patterns of patients distribution in HIV and HCV transmission clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185866.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Eighty patients were present both in HCV and in HIV transmission clusters (68.4% of all co-infected patients; 82.5% and 88.9% of all HCV and HIV patients present in clusters, respectively). Furthermore, 70 patients (59.8%) were present in the same HIV and HCV cluster with at least one other patient, indicating transmission of HIV and HCV through (at least partly) overlapping transmission chains.
