<p>Phylogenetic analysis of Romanian PWID using control sequences from Romania and other parts of the world showed that 90 HIV sequences (76.9%) were part of well-supported phylogenetic clusters, suggesting high levels of transmission networking. Three major HIV local transmission networks were identified by phylogenetic analysis, two within subtype F1 and one with CRF14_BG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185866.g002">Fig 2</xref>). One of the subtype F1 clusters included 29 PWID patients, 24 men and 5 women; 17 men (58%) were diagnosed in the same penitentiary. The other subtype F1 cluster identified in PWID is larger and consists of 44 sequences corresponding to 34 men and 10 women living in the same geographical area. The lineages of both F1 clusters seem to originate from strains previously identified in Romanian people living with HIV (PLWH). The transmission network identified in PWID infected with CRF14_BG involved 17 subjects, diagnosed with low CD4 counts (mean 138 cells/mm). The CD4 counts were significantly lower than in patients from the two F1 transmission networks (mean CD4 count of cluster 1–430 cells/mm, cluster 2–510 cells/mm, p&lt;0.001).
