<p>Previous studies established the role of phylogenetic analysis in assessing and characterizing transmission networks within particular populations, but these were mainly performed in specific populations of HIV patients. However, few studies have been performed that reconstruct simultaneously the transmission history of HIV and HCV viruses in the same population of HIV-HCV co-infected patients [

 <xref rid="pone.0185866.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and none analysed the overlap between HIV and HCV transmission networks. Our objective was to reconstruct the history and the transmission patterns of HIV and HCV, to assess the likelihood of simultaneous transmission of these two viruses in a population of co-infected PWID and to analyse the congruence between HIV and HCV transmission networks.
