  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of partial hexon genes of human adenovirus of species B (A, 767 bases analysed) and species C (B, 800 bases). The maximum likelihood trees were constructed using the general time reversible model with proportion of invariant sites, and inferred following bootstrap analyses using 1000 replicates. Strain names are in the format: accession number_adenovirus type_strain name_country of isolation_year of isolation. The Malaysian sequences from this study are coloured red (with respiratory complications) or blue (without respiratory complications).</p>
