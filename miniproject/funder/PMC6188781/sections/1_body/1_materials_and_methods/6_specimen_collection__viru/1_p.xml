<p>Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) are collected routinely in all children with LRTIs. Tracheal aspirates were only obtained from intubated children. All respiratory specimens were tested by direct immunofluorescence (IF) for 8 respiratory viruses: HAdV, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2 and 3 (D
 <sup>3</sup> Ultra 8 DFA Respiratory Virus Screening &amp; Identification Kit (Diagnostic Hybrids, USA). Viral isolation was performed by inoculating the NPAs into Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK; ATCC number CCL-34), Vero (ATCC number CCL-81), A549 (ATCC number CCL-185), and HEp-2 (ATCC number CCL-23) cells. Cultures were incubated at 37Â°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Infected cells showing cytopathic effect within 10 days were harvested for IF.
