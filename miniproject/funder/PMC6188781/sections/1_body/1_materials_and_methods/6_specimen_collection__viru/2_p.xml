<p>HAdV isolates underwent further molecular typing. Viral DNA was extracted from adenovirus cultures with the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The hypervariable regions 1â€“6 of the hexon gene were amplified and sequenced as previously described[
 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with M13 universal priming tails added to the primers to facilitate sequencing.[
 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Sequencing was carried out by First BASE Laboratories (Selangor, Malaysia). Sequences were edited using Geneious R7 (Biomatters, New Zealand) and aligned with relevant sequences from GenBank. MEGA7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was used to construct phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood with 1000 bootstrap reiterations, using the general time reversible model with gamma distribution of evolutionary rates and invariant sites. Separate trees were constructed for sequences of HAdV-B and HAdV-C. The sequences reported in this study were deposited into GenBank with accession numbers KU145006-KU145113.
