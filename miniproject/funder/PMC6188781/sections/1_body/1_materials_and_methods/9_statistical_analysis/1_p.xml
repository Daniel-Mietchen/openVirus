<p>Data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 16.0 (IBM, USA). Continuous data was expressed as mean (standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) if not normally distributed. Chi-square test was used for comparing categorical variables between two groups and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported, where appropriate. Mann-Whitney U test was used when comparing continuous (numerical) variables without normal distribution between the two groups. Logistic regression was used to determine significant factors associated with severe disease and respiratory sequelae. All tests were calculated in a two-tailed manner and significance was defined by a p value of less than 0.05.</p>
