<p>In univariate analysis, duration of hospitalisation, seizures, disseminated disease (shock, ARDS, pulmonary haemorrhage), tachypnoea, hepatomegaly, neutrophil (%) count, albumin, low platelet count and HAdV type 7 (compared to the other types) were significantly associated with development of severe disease. However, in the final model, only prolonged hospitalisation was associated with severe illness (p = 0.003, OR 1.54 [95%CI 1.16, 2.06]).</p>
