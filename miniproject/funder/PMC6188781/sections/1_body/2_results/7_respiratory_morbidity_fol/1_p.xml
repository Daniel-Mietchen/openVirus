<p>Respiratory complications were seen in 21.7% of patients (n = 20) with an overall mortality rate of 5.4% (n = 5). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205795.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the respiratory morbidity in children following HAdV pneumonia. All children who died had disseminated disease. Only three patients (15.8%) in the severe group made a complete recovery. PIBO (n = 10, 52.6%) was the commonest respiratory complication in the severe group. Five patients in the severe group needed non-invasive home respiratory support (26.5%). However, even in the non-severe group, four (5.5%) developed PIBO, one (1.4%) pulmonary fibrosis and another four (5.5%) had recurrent wheeze.
