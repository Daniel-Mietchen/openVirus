<p>We followed up with 18 of these patients, for a median (IQR) duration of 2.5 (2.3,3.1) years, in the Paediatric Respiratory clinic; 14 had severe and 4 had non-severe HAdV pneumonia. Seven (38.9%) of these patients were below the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> centile for weight. More than half (55.6%) of these patients still reported chronic cough. Five patients (27.8%) reported significant chronic cough of three or more days in a week. Three (16.7%) patients had chronic cough severe enough to affect sleep. Almost half (44.4%) reported reduced effort tolerance. Eleven (61.1%) patients still required inhaled corticosteroids. Ten patients (55.6%) remained on oral azithromycin for its immunomodulatory benefits. Of the 13 patients (72.2%) who had hospital re-admissions for LRTIs following HAdV pneumonia, eleven (84.6%) were re-admitted three times or less while two patients (15.4%) reported hospital re-admission on more than three separate occasions.
