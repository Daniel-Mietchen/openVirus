However, after multivariate analysis, the final model showed that family history of asthma (p = 0.006, OR 14.96 [95% CI 2.15–104.05]), need for either invasive or non-invasive ventilatory support (p&lt; 0.001, OR 153.77 [95% CI 10.07–2.32E]) and HAdV type 7 (compared to the other types) (p = 0.025, OR 9.00, [95% CI 1.34–60.34]) were independent factors associated with the development of respiratory complications.
