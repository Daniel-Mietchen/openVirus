 <xref rid="pone.0205795.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the laboratory investigation findings in children with severe and non-severe HAdV disease. Review of laboratory investigations showed that in children with severe disease, albumin (p = 0.01, z = -2.33) was significantly lower and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.03, z = -2.18) was significantly higher. Viral co-infection was found in 4 patients, all in the non-severe group (RSV = 3, metapneumovirus = 1). One patient had
