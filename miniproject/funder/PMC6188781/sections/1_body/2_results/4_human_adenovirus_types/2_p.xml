<p>Of the 92 patients analysed in this study, typing was possible for 79 isolates with one patient having two isolates. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205795.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the phylogenetic analyses of the HAdV isolated in this study. These comprised type 7 (n = 43, 54.4%), type 1 (n = 14, 17.7%), type 3 (n = 10, 12.7%), type 2 (n = 7, 8.9%), type 4 (n = 3, 3.8%) and type 5 (n = 2, 2.5%). The Malaysian sequences within each type were highly similar and clustered together, with no distinct intra-typic clustering associated with the presence of respiratory complications. Type 7 was the commonest identified and in univariate analysis, was significantly associated with severe infection in children (p = 0.02, OR 4.12, [95% CI 1.30,16.29]) when compared to the other types, as shown in
