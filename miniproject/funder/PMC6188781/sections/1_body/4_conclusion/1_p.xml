<p>In conclusion, during the sharp increase of HAdV infection in Malaysia between 2011 and 2013, the majority of children admitted for HAdV pneumonia were less than 2 years old. One in five children had severe disease and the case fatality rate was 5.4%. HAdV 7 was the most frequently detected type isolated amongst children with severe pneumonia and those with persistent respiratory sequelae. Severe disease was associated with prolonged hospitalisation. Twenty-two percent developed respiratory complications, commonest being bronchiolitis obliterans (15.2%) and recurrent wheeze (5.4%). Presence of severe respiratory compromise, isolation of HAdV type 7 and family history of asthma, were independent risk factors associated with respiratory sequelae. Children with respiratory complications reported significant reduction in quality of life. There is a lack of good and adequately powered studies to determine the best treatment for this disease which has a high mortality and significant morbidity.</p>
