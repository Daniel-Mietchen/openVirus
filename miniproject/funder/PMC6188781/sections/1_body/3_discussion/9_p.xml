<p>Limitations of our study are recognised including the small number of patients, not using polymerase chain reaction to detect HAdV which would increase the sensitivity of virus detection, the inability to contact all patients who had HAdV pneumonia and the inability to type all the 92 detected HAdV virus. However, the strength of this study is that it has comprehensive data including clinical and laboratory parameters, HAdV type, respiratory outcomes, and a follow-up of up to 2 years, for a fairly large number of children.</p>
