<p>Treatment and outcome were the main concerns in this study. Twenty percent of children with HAdV pneumonia had a severe infection, which we defined as requiring NIV or IV or PICU admission or death. The case fatality was 5.4%. Our severity and case fatality are much higher than that previously mentioned in the study from Seremban, Malaysia, which were 11% and 2.6% respectively. [

While there were many factors associated with severe infection in univariate analysis, only hospital duration was an independent association. Rajkumar et al identified age &lt; 2 years old and presence of significant comorbidities as independent risk factors for severe disease. We did not find this association with age and in this study, we excluded those with serious comorbidities. In the outbreak in Taiwan, authors found an association between severe disease and presence of pleural effusion. Pleural effusion was seen in only 2 children in this study (one in a severe HAdV and one in a non-severe HAdV) and none required tube thoracostomy drainage. Immunocompromised children and children with comorbidities have also been reported to be at increased risk of severe HAdV infections[
