<p>In this study, we used IVIG and IV MTP, but not in a randomised fashion. While we did not see any effect on subsequent respiratory complications, 4 out of the 5 who died from HAdV did not receive these medications. Takahashi et al. reported that use of pulse methylprednisolone (25mg/kg/day) for 3 days, in a case of severe HAdV pneumonia (type 3) with hypercytokinemia i.e raised lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, interferon-gamma and interleukin-6, resulted in relief of respiratory distress.

Cidofivir is occasionally used in immunocompromised children with severe HAdV. It has been shown to clear the virus from blood, however mortality despite its use stands at 10â€“70% and it is nephrotoxic.[
