<p>In this study, 22% of children developed respiratory complications. Even in the non-severe group, 12.3% (9 out of 73) children developed respiratory complications. This is much higher than what has been previously reported locally, where only one child developed PIBO.[

Most of our patients who had respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure would have received NIV. Therefore, children with severe respiratory compromise from HAdV have an increased risk of respiratory complications. As for family history of asthma, a severe infection could trigger asthma, especially if there is a genetic predisposition. Castro-Rodriquez from Chile, who followed up 45 children with HAdV pneumonia for 5 years also found that significant respiratory compromise (intensive care admission, need for mechanical ventilation and for oxygen therapy, and systemic corticosteroid and beta agonist use) was associated with risk for PIBO.[
