 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], type 7 was the main type reported in China, Taiwan and Singapore between 2011 and 2013. Among 632 HAdV cases reported during the Taiwan outbreak in 2011, HAdV3 was predominantly seen in children with upper respiratory tract infections while HAdV7 was seen in cases that required PICU care or died.[
 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] As seen in our study, neighbouring Singapore also saw the emergence of HAdV type 7 as the predominant type between 2011 and 2013. [
