<p>This is the first study looking at the quality of life in children with post-HAdV lung disease. We found that more than half of the children under follow-up had chronic cough, more than a third were underweight, nearly half still had reduced effort tolerance and as many as 72% required unscheduled healthcare visits. Most parents were still concerned about their childâ€™s cough. More work is needed to address the long-term consequences of this viral infection, which may lead to reduced lung function that is not fully reversible.[
