<p>This comprehensive report on HAdV pneumonia in Malaysian children summarises their clinical presentation, identified HAdV types, treatment, risk factors for severe disease and both short- and medium-term respiratory complications. We found that one in five children admitted with HAdV pneumonia had severe disease and 22% developed respiratory complications of which PIBO was the commonest problem. Type 7 was the commonest type detected. Family history of asthma, need for ventilation(invasive and non-invasive) and type 7 were independent factors associated with respiratory complications.[
