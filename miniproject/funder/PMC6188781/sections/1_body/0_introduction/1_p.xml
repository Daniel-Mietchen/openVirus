<p>Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are a common cause of disease including respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis, particularly in children below 5 years of age[
 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and HAdV accounts for about 5â€“10% of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs). [
 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Over 85 genotypes of HAdVs have been recognized by the Human Addenovirus Working Group based on bioinformatics analysis of complete genomic sequences.[

 <xref rid="pone.0205795.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. HAdV respiratory infections are predominantly caused by species B (including types 3, 7, 11, 14, 21 and 55), C (types 1, 2, 5, and 6) and E (type 4).
