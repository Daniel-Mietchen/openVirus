  <p>mRNA levels of 84 cytokine in EBOV-fatal compared to EBOV-survivor patients during the acute and late phases of infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>b</bold>) Heat-maps of the fold change in mRNA levels of a panel of cytokines in 23 EBOV-fatal samples as compared to 19 EBOV-survivor samples during the acute phase (
   <bold>a</bold>); and 15 EBOV-fatal samples as compared to 18 EBOV-survivor samples during the late phase (
   <bold>b</bold>) of infection. Fold changes ≥2 (upregulation, red) or &lt;−2 (downregulation, green) are shown. (
   <bold>c</bold>,
   <bold>d</bold>) Up- or down-regulation of cytokines mRNA levels in fatal versus survivor EVD patients during the acute (
   <bold>c</bold>) and late (
   <bold>d</bold>) phases of infection. The data are reported as positive (up-regulation) or negative (down-regulation) mean fold changes observed during the acute (black bars) and late phase of infection (white bars). Only cytokines for which the fold change was more than 2 (up-regulation) or less than −2 (down-regulation) were considered. Significant statistical differences in mRNA levels (∆Ct) between the two groups are reported (*
