<p>In the present study, IgG titres reached high values as early as 6 DSO in individuals who survived the infection, and this clearly concurred with the dropping of viremia. This highlights that IgG levels during the first week of symptoms may predict an effective control of the infection by the host immune system and thus could represent a marker for a positive progression and outcome of the disease [

The longitudinal analysis represents an important value to the description of the immune response established during natural EBOV infection and, to our knowledge, the present report is one of the largest studies investigating the antibody response during the course of EBOV infection [
