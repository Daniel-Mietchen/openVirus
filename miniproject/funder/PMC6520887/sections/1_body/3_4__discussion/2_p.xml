<p>Previous reports indicated that the early and vigorous cytokine storm was linked to an unfavorable prognosis of EVD patients [

In fact, results from the gene expression profiling showed a higher dysregulation, consisting mainly in up-regulation, of the inflammatory mediators in EVD fatal cases as compared to the survivor group during the acute phase of the disease, although no significant differences were found for any of the chemokines and cytokine genes analyzed. Notably, the analysis in the late phase of infection highlighted that this dysregulation seemed to persist and intensify in fatal patients versus survivors, with statistically significant differences in a number of genes between the two groups. In addition, we observed that the levels of gene expression of inflammatory chemokines directly correlated with the viremia load, thus suggesting an association between high levels of virus replication, excessive and persistent status of inflammation and fatal outcome of EVD [
