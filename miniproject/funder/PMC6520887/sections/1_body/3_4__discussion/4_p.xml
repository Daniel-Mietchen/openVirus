<p>In comparison to other studies, no significant differences in the expression of other key inflammatory cytokines 
 <italic>TNF</italic> or 
 <italic>IL1β</italic> and interferon (

 <italic>γ</italic>) genes were found between fatal versus survivors both in the acute and late phases of illness [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This discrepancy may reflect differences in sampling time, although other factors may be involved. Nevertheless, our findings suggest the idea that failure of the immune system to restore “normal” expression levels after the cytokine storm caused by virus replication/dissemination is the hallmark of progression towards fatal outcome of EVD.
