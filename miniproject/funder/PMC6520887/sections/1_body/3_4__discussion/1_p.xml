<p>In this paper, we described the gene expression profile of a panel of key chemokines and cytokines and the levels of specific anti-EBOV IgM and IgG in a cohort of fatal and survivor EVD patients infected during the recent EBOV outbreak that occurred in Sierra Leone in 2014 to 2016. We tested a precious collection of plasma samples from a large number of patients, obtained at the time of admission at the Emergency ETC in Goderich (Freetown, Sierra Leone) and longitudinally until their discharge or death.</p>
