<p>This study has some limitations. Firstly, the type of biological samples chosen for mRNAs extraction in the gene expression analysis, as plasma samples are not the ideal ones. However, a recent study evaluated the transcriptome profile in samples collected in Guinea [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and experimental evidences demonstrating the presence of extracellular RNAs in plasma [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, all specimens used in the present study were screened for quality, tested for the human 
 <italic>RNaseP</italic> gene, providing similar Ct values in all samples (average Ct value: 29.5 ± 2.5). In addition, the internal control present in the RT2 Profiler PCR Array Kit was always positive and the kit house-keeping gene (
 <italic>β-actin</italic>) had an average Ct value of 29.3 ± 2.47 in all samples. Secondly, the study lacked a healthy control group and no replicate testing could be performed on collected samples. This bias could not be avoided, samples were collected within an emergency context, and testing was performed in a field resources-limited setting, thus narrowing the experimental options that could be undertaken. However, there are very few papers performed in the field reaching the sample numerosity achieved in the present study; we believe that the data retrieved from this field experience can contribute to providing important insight into EVD progression and pathogenesis of the disease.
