<p>In agreement with previous studies, the dysregulation observed in the fatal group during the late phase of the infection mainly consisted in the upregulation of secreted inflammatory mediators, such as 
 <italic>CCL2</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL3</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL13</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL1</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL11</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL12</italic>, 
 <italic>IL6</italic>, 
 <italic>MIF</italic>, 
 <italic>SPP1</italic>, which are produced by myeloid cells and normally play a role in the defense mechanisms with the regulation of the adaptive immune response, specifically the migration of immune system cells associated with the trafficking of leukocytes in immune surveillance and inflammatory cell recruitment [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, the dysregulation of these cytokines is normally involved in other inflammatory diseases, thus suggesting a direct role of the mediators and the immune cells in the pathogenesis. These mechanisms may also be reflected in EVD, representing an important source of inflammatory mediators [

Interestingly, we observed a persistent trend in the down-regulation of PPBP, which is a potent neutrophils chemoattractant and activator involved in platelet activation, but also a protein involved in the host defense against bacterial and fungal infections [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; it is possible that there is a negative role in the progression of EBOV infection, to our knowledge never reported so far, which is corroborated also by the fact that we found its expression inversely correlated with viremia levels in fatal cases during the late phase of infection.
