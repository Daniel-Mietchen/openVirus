<p>The prolonged and significant excessive alteration of inflammatory cytokines levels in the fatal group may contribute to the EVD-typical severe multiple organ failure as a result of immune-mediated cell damage and may be linked to an ineffective adaptive immune response. In fact, the analysis of the humoral response showed that patients who survived the EBOV infection presented an early and robust antibody response against the virus with respect to patients who died. In line with previously reported evidence [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we found that patients with fatal outcome presented lower, or often absent, levels of both EBOV-specific IgM and IgG, which, when detected, appeared later than in survivors. Our findings suggest that the classic kinetics of antibody response does not always occur during EBOV infection, independently from the clinical outcome. In fact, in our cohort of EVD cases IgG was detected before IgM, and in a large number of patients, the IgM response was not evidenced before 16 DSO. These data are consistent with previous published [
