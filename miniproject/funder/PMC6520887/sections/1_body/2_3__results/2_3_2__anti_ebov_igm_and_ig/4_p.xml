<p>The overall analysis of anti-EBOV IgM and IgG levels in relation to the onset of symptoms revealed that most of the patients included in this study developed a humoral response from DSO 7, with increasing antibodies titre at the end of the second week of illness, which corresponded to the progressive reduction of EBOV viremia, especially when survivors were considered (

This result was more pronounced when the two groups were separately analyzed. In survivors, IgG was detected earlier than IgM, and started since DSO 5 in most of the cases; IgM levels remained moderate until DSO 11 (
