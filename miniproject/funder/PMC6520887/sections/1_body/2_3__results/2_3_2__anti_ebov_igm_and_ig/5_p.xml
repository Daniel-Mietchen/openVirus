<p>Moreover, the levels of both antibody classes were remarkably different between the two groups: Anti-EBOV IgM titre remained low in fatal cases until the end of the second week after the onset of the diseases, with maximum values of 1:40–1:160, with respect to 1:320–1:640 detected in the survivors group in the same timeframe. In addition, almost 50% of fatal EVD patients did not develop IgM (&lt;1:20) within DSO 16. Similar results were obtained for IgG: Anti-EBOV IgG titre did not exceed 1:320 within 16 DSO in the fatal group with a steady increase in viremia (
