<p>On the contrary, in the late phase of disease, an increased dysregulation in inflammatory response was observed in the fatal group as compared to survivors. In particular, a higher number of genes (36%) showed a â‰¥2-fold increase in gene expression in fatal versus survivor patients (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00373-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). Among these cytokines, we found a statistically significant up-regulation in late fatal as compared to late survivors for the following mediators: The chemokines 
 <italic>CCL13</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL2</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL3</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL1</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL11</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL12</italic>; the pro-inflammatory factor IL6; the pro-inflammatory lymphokine MIF and the growth factor 
 <italic>SPP1</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00373-f001">Figure 1</xref>d). In addition, also the extent of gene expression variation was increased at this stage of infection (i.e., up to &gt;8-fold change seen for the inflammatory chemokines 
 <italic>CCL2</italic> and 
 <italic>CCL3</italic>) as compared to the acute phase, where a maximum of 3-fold variation was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00373-f001">Figure 1</xref>c). The only mediator showing a significant down-regulation in fatal versus survivor patients during both phases (more intense in the latter) was the chemokine 
 <italic>PPBP</italic>.
