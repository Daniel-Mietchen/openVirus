<p>The correlation between the level of each cytokine mRNA with the corresponding EBOV viremia levels was evaluated. A statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) correlation was observed only in the fatal group during the late phase of infection (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00373-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In particular, a strong (
 <italic>r</italic> ≥ ± 0.6) positive correlation with EBOV viremia was observed in those genes which were mainly involved in leukocytes recruitment and activation. Among these, the chemokines 
 <italic>CCL2</italic> and 
 <italic>CXCL12</italic> resulted in high correlation values (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.859 and = 0.8206 respectively; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), suggesting a link between the prolonged viral replication and the sustained signaling of chemotaxis for lymphocytes and macrophages and prolonged status of inflammation. Finally, 
 <italic>PBPP</italic> was again the only gene shown to be negatively correlated to viral RNA levels (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.621; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0103).
