<p>Total RNA extraction was performed using QIAamp
 <sup>®</sup> Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions and part of the extracted RNA was tested for EBOV RNA and the residual was stored at −20 °C. Viral genome amplification was performed using a qPCR assay (RealStar Filovirus Screen RT-PCR 1.0 kit, Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germania) as described elsewhere [

The DNAse treatment step for genomic DNA elimination was included in the protocol. The RNA quality of all the samples was checked through amplification of a house-keeping gene (RNaseP) in qRT-PCR. Gene expression profiling was done with qRT-PCR, using the RT
 <sup>2</sup> Profiler™ PCR Array Human Cytokines &amp; Chemokines (SuperArray PAHS-150 Kit; Bioscience Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA) in 96-wells plate format. The system was pathway-focused, profiling the expression of 84 key secreted proteins involved in the immune response (detailed in the legend of
