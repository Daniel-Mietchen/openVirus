<p>For each sample, ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (SDS) software plotted an amplification curve by relating the fluorescence signal intensity (∆Rn) to the cycle number. The PCR results were analyzed using the PCR Array Data Analysis Web Portal (Bioscience Corporation). We performed a relative quantitative analysis, using the 2^(−∆∆
 <italic>C
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>) value, where ∆
 <italic>C
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> = 
 <italic>C
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> (target) − 
 <italic>C
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> (endogenous control) and ∆∆
 <italic>C
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> = ∆

  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> (sample) − ∆

 <italic>β-actin</italic> was used as a housekeeping gene. At the end, in the absence of a healthy control group, the fold change (2^(−ΔΔ
 <italic>C
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic>)) of the fatal group versus the survivor group was calculated with default software option. Upregulation or downregulation of gene expression was considered reliable and relevant when the fold change was ≥2 or &lt;−2, respectively, as recommended in the PCR Array Data Analysis Web Portal. Descriptive statistics were performed as described below.
