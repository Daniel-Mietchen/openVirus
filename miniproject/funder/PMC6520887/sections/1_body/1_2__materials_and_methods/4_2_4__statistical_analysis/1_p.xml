<p>The Mannâ€“Whitney test was used to evaluate the differences in the cytokines mRNA levels between the fatal and survivors groups in the acute and late phase of infection. The Spearman correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation between cytokine mRNA levels and between EBOV viremia and anti-EBOV IgM/IgG. The LogRank test was used for the evaluation of the Kaplan-Meier curves of anti-EBOV specific IgM/IgG in survivor and fatal groups. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism and STATA 13.1 statistical packages.</p>
