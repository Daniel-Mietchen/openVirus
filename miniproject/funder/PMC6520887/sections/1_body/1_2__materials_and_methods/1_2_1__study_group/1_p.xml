<p>Leftover diagnostic plasma samples from 44 patients who tested EVD-positive at the Italian Laboratory at the Emergency ETC in Goderich (Freetown, Sierra Leone) during the 2014 to 2016 outbreak, were included in the study [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Of the 44 EVD-positive patients, 25 (56.8%) were female and the median age was 30 years (interquartile range, 39.7–17 years); 23 had a fatal outcome (fatal group, 14 female) and 21 a positive outcome (survivor group, 11 female) (

All samples were collected during the hospitalization in a range of 3–15 (median: 7.5) DSO and stored (anonymized and identified as fatal or survivor) at −20 °C until the beginning of research activities carried out at the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH) in Freetown and at the Emergency Surgical and Pediatric Hospital in Goderich. All 44 patients were included in the cytokine gene expression study and for 32 of them, two consecutive samples were analyzed (mean ± Standard Deviation [SD] interval between the two longitudinal sampling was 5 ± 2.5 days), accounting for a total of 75 samples tested. Samples collected &lt;7 DSO were considered “acute phase samples” (

The cut off for early versus late was set to 7 DSO based on previous evidence that this showed that the viral load turning point between patients who survived or succumbed, with a decline for patients who survived and a steady increase for patients who succumbed [
