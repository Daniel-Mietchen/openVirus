<p>Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed to evaluate the anti-EBOV specific antibodies. The in-house slides were prepared at the INMI BSL-4 laboratory in Rome, using Vero E6 infected with EBOV isolate (Ebola Zaire H. sapiens tc/gin/2014/Gueckedou-C05, kindly provided by S. Gunther); 24 hours (h) post infection cells were trypsinized and mixed with uninfected Vero E6 in 1:1 proportion, washed twice in Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline 1× (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and fixed for 30 min in acetone at −20 °C. We preliminarily tested the EBOV home-made slides with three negative and three positive control samples at different 2-fold dilutions (from 1:2 to 1:40): the 1:20 dilution resulted in the best condition to eliminate the background signal and obtain a clear positive fluorescence with a good sensitivity. The slides were then shipped to Freetown (Sierra Leone) under controlled temperature.</p>
