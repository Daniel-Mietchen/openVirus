<p>To detect anti-EBOV-IgM, plasma samples were pre-treated with Eurosorb (Euroimmun, Lubecca, Germany) for 30 min at room temperature (RT), centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min and diluted (screening dilution: 1:20) in normal saline (NS, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany) solution. For anti-EBOV-IgG tests, plasma samples were directly diluted 1:20 in NS. Each plasma sample was serially diluted from 1:20 down to 1:1280 to estimate the antibodies titre and incubated for 1 h at RT. The slides were washed with NS and incubated for 1 h RT with anti-human IgM and IgG rabbit antibodies conjugated with FITC and counterstained with Evans Blue (Euroimmun, Lubecca Germany). The slides were finally inactivated in 2% paraformaldehyde solution. For biosafety reasons, all the aforementioned procedures were performed in a class III biosafety cabinet. PBS-glycerol 1% was used as mounting media (Euroimmun, Lubecca, Germany). The results were analyzed with the fluorescence microscope Nikon Eclipse E200. In each experiment, anti-EBOV IgM- and -IgG positive controls and a negative control were included. As a quality check, the slides were tested both in Italy and in Sierra Leone before they were shipped with anti-EBOV IgM- and IgG -positive control samples and stored at −20 °C.</p>
