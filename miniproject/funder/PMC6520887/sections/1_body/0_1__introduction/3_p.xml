<p>The failure of the immune response in controlling viral replication involves both the innate and adaptive immune system [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The innate immune reaction to EBOV is characterized by a “cytokine storm”, with the secretion of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, which induce a huge number of immune mediators and may contribute to the impairment of the vascular system, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and massive loss of innate and adaptive immune cells [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This scenario was observed in the plasma of humans following EBOV infection, even if the majority of information about the human immune response concerns past epidemics with limited sample sizes and rare longitudinal sample collection [

Indeed, studies are constrained by the requirements of maximum bio-containment measures and difficulty in obtaining samples at multiple time points throughout the course of the disease in an outbreak scenario. To our knowledge, only one recent study described the kinetics of the expression of soluble inflammatory mediators, in a longitudinal blood samples collection from 180 hospitalized patients with EVD treated in Guinea, concluding that the control of endothelial and gastric integrity, as well as T-cell immunity, correlated with EVD survival [

Previous studies report that the natural serologic response consisted of EBOV-specific IgM detected as early as two days since symptom onset (DSO), but occurring 10–29 DSO in most patients; and specific IgG detected as early as 6 DSO, but occurring 6–18 DSO in most individuals, suggesting classic kinetics of an IgM response before the IgG response [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, the humoral response to EBOV infection was reported as absent or diminished in fatal cases, while survivors demonstrated the presence of significant levels of virus-specific IgM and IgG followed by the activation of cytotoxic cells at the time of antigen clearance from the blood [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00373" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; therefore, defining a comprehensive profile of the immune response is essential for the effective management of patients and countermeasure development.
