<p>We investigated the gene expression profile of lymphokines/interleukins and chemokines and the levels of specific anti-EBOV IgM and IgG in fatal and survivor patients admitted during the 2014 to 2016 EBOV outbreak at the Emergency Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Goderich (Freetown, Sierra Leone) and sampled at the time of admission and longitudinally until discharge or death. The study lacked a healthy control group due to the constraints of the field settings. The comparison was made within the EVD-positive patients thus narrowing the inferences of our observations.</p>
