<p>Descriptive analysis of the cohort included school children and their siblings aged 0 to 15 years. Participants were stratified in three age groups (0 to 5, 6 to 8 and 9 to 15 years old). Dengue IgM and IgG results above &gt;11 Panbio units were considered positive for dengue and were included as the dependent variable in the analysis. The logistic regression analysis was adjusted by age and sex and was used to identify risk factors for dengue infection. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated and statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were included in the final model. The analysis was done with STATA 14.2.</p>
