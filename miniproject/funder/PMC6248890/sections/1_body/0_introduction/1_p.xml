<p>Dengue is a major public health problem in Latin America due to the increasing trend of cases, the vast urban areas affected, and the complexity of controlling a vector that has adapted to human dwellings in tropical and subtropical urban contexts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Accurate estimates of the burden of dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] are difficult because of the high proportion of asymptomatic infections, the syndromic nature of the clinical spectrum that allows for misdiagnosis with other viral infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the limited capacities of the surveillance systems, and the low demand for health services by affected populations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006748.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Transmission of the four dengue serotypes in endemic countries is heterogeneous with respect to the age groups affected, the seasonality, and the intensity and severity of epidemics[
