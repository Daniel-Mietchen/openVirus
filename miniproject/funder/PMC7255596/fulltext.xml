Here we show that the length of time between DENV/ZIKV infections has a qualitative impact on controlling early ZIKV replication. Depletion of DENV2-specific Abs in sera confirmed that those type-specific Abs do not contribute to ZIKV control. We show that the magnitude and durability of the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) induced by a secondary ZIKV infection is modest compared to the response induced after a secondary heterologous DENV infection. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> results are showing a complex interplay between the cellular and innate immune responses characterized by a high frequency of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) correlating with an increase in the frequency of DENV antigen specific T cells and a significant control of ZIKV replication which is time dependent. Taken together, our results suggest that early after ZIKV infection other mechanisms such as the innate and cellular immune responses may play a predominant role in controlling ZIKV replication. Regardless of the time elapsed between infections there was no evidence of <italic>in vivo</italic> antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV by DENV immunity. These findings have pivotal implications while interpreting ZIKV pathogenesis in flavivirus-experimented populations, diagnostic results interpretation and vaccine designs and schedules among others.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>From our previous work in non-human primates and others using humans, we believe that previous DENV immunity confers some degree of protection against ZIKV infection. However, at least two highly relevant questions remain unanswered. One is precisely if the time between primary DENV and a subsequent ZIKV infections may play a role in the degree of protection conferred by DENV immunity. The second question is related to the mechanisms of cross-protection. In this work we provide evidences that a period of 12 months between DENV and ZIKV infections has a significant impact controlling ZIKV replication compared to a shorter period of 3 months. We also provide evidences that the pre-existing DENV Abs play no role controlling early ZIKV replication. Our results strongly suggest that the mechanisms controlling ZIKV replication are related to the complex interaction between the innate and the cellular immune responses. Our results have significant implications for vaccine design and schedules.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2 P40 OD012217</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mart&#x000ed;nez</surname><given-names>Melween I.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2U42OD021458-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7535-4303</contrib-id><name><surname>Sariol</surname><given-names>Carlos A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25GM061838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrano-Collazo</surname><given-names>Crisanta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P51 OD011133</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Luis D Giavedoni</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K22AI104794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brien</surname><given-names>James D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work received support by Grants 2 P40 OD012217 and 2U42OD021458-15 to MIM and CAS (ORIP, OD, NIH), and R25GM061838 to C.S.-C.

Prior exposure to a single DENV serotype predisposes individuals to severe disease upon a secondary heterologous DENV infection, and the time interval between infections has been considered as a risk factor [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A short interval of time between homologous or heterologous DENV infections usually results in protection from disease, while an extended period of time is associated with the potential for severe dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], due to either cross-reactive non-neutralizing antibodies (Abs) [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and cross-reacting T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the association of previous flavivirus exposure at any time before ZIKV infection with the severe adverse outcomes of the infection is still unclear.</p><p>Previously, we showed that a primary DENV infection (&#x0003e;2 years) does not result in an increase in ZIKV viremia or pathogenesis in a non-human primate model (NHP) [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, DENV-immune animals showed a shorter viremic period compared to DENV-naive macaques. Our previous results further suggested that the cellular immune response in DENV-experimented individuals may play a key role limiting ZIKV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our results on the potential protective role of pre-existing DENV-immunity against ZIKV infection were validated by subsequent NHP works [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and more recently with results from human cohorts [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, little is known about the molecular and immune mechanisms behind DENV and ZIKV interactions. It has been shown that primary DENV infections do not induce durable ZIKV cross-neutralizing Abs [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] but the contribution of previous DENV cross-reacting Abs to controlling early ZIKV replication <italic>in vivo</italic> and their impact in ZIKV pathogenesis remains unclear. One of the advantages of NHP models in contrast to human cohorts is that they allow the control of external factors, such as the exact moment of infection and the amount of the administered viral inoculum [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the similarity of their competent immune system with humans is critical for understanding the mechanisms behind disease pathogenesis.</p><p>By using rhesus macaques with primary DENV infections at two different points of time, followed by a secondary ZIKV infection, we found that the length of time separating the infections has a qualitative impact on controlling ZIKV replication. It is known that ZIKV-specific Abs appear in circulation a few days after symptom onset [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and are responsible for most of the neutralizing ZIKV activity [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the extent of the contribution of DENV-Abs early after ZIKV infection <italic>in vivo</italic> remains uncertain. For this reason, we looked at the contribution of the humoral immune response during early ZIKV replication. Although cross-binding Abs were detected, previous exposure to DENV has no impact on ZIKV neutralization. That fact was confirmed by depleting DENV2-specific Abs in sera. Lastly, no evidence of ZIKV enhancement associated with prior DENV exposure was observed in this study.</p><p>In addition, we demonstrate that a period of time of at least 12 months between DENV and ZIKV infections results in a significant increase in the frequency of the dendritic plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) in the first days after ZIKV infection and with a trend to higher frequency of interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;) or CD107a+ CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that early after ZIKV infection the cellular immune response, and not Abs, may play a predominant role in controlling ZIKV replication. This study furthers our understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis in flavivirus-experimented populations and is a major contribution to the field of virus-virus interactions and future vaccine designs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Rhesus macaque cohorts and sample collection</title><p>Six rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were infected with 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> pfu s.c. of DENV-2 New Guinea 44 in 2016 (cohort 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

The animals exposed to DENV 12 months earlier had the least viremia days in comparison with the na&#x000ef;ve group, and the difference was statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Likewise, we observed a significant difference when comparing animals from cohort 1 and control based on comparison of the area under the curve (AUC) (P = 0.039) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that a previous infection with DENV contributes to an earlier and significant control of ZIKV viremia in a subsequent infection, but only if at least 12 months (a middle convalescence period) have passed between infections.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Serological profile is modified by the time between the two infections</title><p>To assess the impact of previous exposure to DENV at different times in a humoral response against a subsequent ZIKV infection, all sixteen animals were tested for binding Abs against ZIKV and DENV serotypes following ZIKV infection. All three groups had levels of anti-DENV IgM below the cutoff value during the three collection periods, suggesting ZIKV infection did not induce DENV-specific IgM response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). As expected, all DENV immune animals had detectable IgG levels against DENV at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Anti-DENV IgG levels were confirmed in both DENV-pre-exposed groups and by day 30 experimented a significant expansion compared to their basal levels (P&#x0003c;0.05; mean diff: -0.27, CI95% -0.5145 to -0.02546 P&#x0003c; 0.005; mean diff: -0.3, CI95% -0.4997 to -0.1003 for the DENV 3M and DENV 12M groups respectively). Those cross-reacting Abs were also significantly higher compared to the na&#x000ef;ve animals on day 30 (P&#x0003c;0.0001; mean diff.: 0.96, CI95%: 0.61 to 1.30 for DENV 12M vs na&#x000ef;ve at 30 days p.i,; P&#x0003c;0.0001; mean diff.: 0.75, CI95%: 0.37 to 1.14 for DENV 3M vs na&#x000ef;ve at 30 days p.i.; P&#x0003c;0.0001; mean diff.: 0.88, CI95%: 0.54 to 1.23 for DENV 12M vs na&#x000ef;ve at 60 days p.i.; P&#x0003c;0.001; mean diff.: 0.68, CI95%: 0.29 to 1.07 for DENV 3M vs na&#x000ef;ve at 60 days p.i.), slowly decreasing by day 60 p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). After a limited increase of the anti-DENV IgG levels on day 30 p.i. the levels rapidly decrease by day 60 in the na&#x000ef;ve group. Moreover, by day 30 p.i., DENV-middle convalescent animals showed a strong trend of having higher levels of anti-DENV IgG compared to the DENV-early convalescent animals, although no statistical significance was reached.</p><p>As expected, all ZIKV-infected animals developed anti-ZIKV IgM 30 days after the infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). However, those Abs were early detected only in three animals from the DENV 12M group with two subjects showing a peak on that day (5O8, 1O1). All DENV-immune animals had detectable levels of anti-ZIKV IgG at baseline compared to the na&#x000ef;ve animals, suggesting a strong cross-reactivity between previously generated anti-DENV IgG to ZIKV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). DENV-early convalescent animals had significantly higher levels of anti-ZIKV IgG than the other DENV-immune animals (DENV 12M) at baseline (P&#x0003c;0.05; mean diff.: -0.59, CI95%: -1.15 to -0.05). By day 7 p.i., DENV-immune animals had higher levels of anti-ZIKV IgG that increase throughout days 30 and 60 p.i. A similar but slower increase was detected in the na&#x000ef;ve group. Nonetheless, all three groups showed a boost in anti-ZIKV IgG levels by day 30 p.i. with a significant expansion at day 60 p.i. for DENV-immune groups (P&#x0003c;0.0001; mean diff.: -1.187, CI95%: -1.848 to -0.525 and P&#x0003c;0.0001; mean diff.: -1.176, CI95%: -1.716 to -0.636 for DENV 3M and DENV 12M groups respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). The same scenario can be observed with the na&#x000ef;ve group, which experiments a significant expansion in their level of anti-ZIKV IgG by day 60 p.i. compared to day 30 p.i. (P&#x0003c;0.0001; mean diff.: -1.231, CI95%: -1.771 to -0.691).</p><p>Only one animal from the DENV-early convalescent group (MA062) had very low but detectable anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG levels at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). All ZIKV-infected animals showed a boost in anti-NS1 levels by day 30 p.i., with DENV-middle convalescent group having significantly higher levels compared to early convalescent and na&#x000ef;ve animals (P&#x0003c;0.01; mean diff.: 1.05, CI95%: 0.2608 to 1.836 for DENV 12M vs. DENV 3M; P&#x0003c;0.0001; mean diff.: 2.15, CI95%: 1.45 to 2.859 for DENV 12M vs na&#x000ef;ve). These levels decreased by day 60 p.i., and the drop is more dramatic in the pre-immune animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). Abs against ZIKV EDIII were also measured in order to determine their contribution to humoral immunity and for their known specific contribution to ZIKV neutralization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4F Fig</xref>). Only one animal from the DENV-middle convalescent group showed detectable levels of anti-ZIKV EDIII before ZIKV infection. Anti-ZIKV EDIII levels for all groups slowly increased throughout 30 and 60 days p.i., and the increase at day 60 p.i. was significant for DENV-immune animals with respect to their basal levels (P&#x0003c;0.05; mean diff.: -0.85, CI95%: -1.68 to -0.03 for DENV 12M animals, and P&#x0003c;0.001; mean diff.: -1.26, CI95%: -2.27 to -0.25 for DENV 3M animals). No significant differences were observed among the groups, suggesting that previous exposure to DENV does not have an impact on the generation of cross-reactive Abs against ZIKV EDIII epitopes and that these Abs may have limited contribution to ZIKV neutralization.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>The time between DENV/ZIKV infections modifies the neutralizing profile</title><p>To determine the contribution of binding Abs to the neutralization and the impact of a previous DENV infection in a subsequent ZIKV infection in terms of neutralization potential, all three groups were tested using PRNT and FRNT assays against ZIKV and the four DENV serotypes respectively. Neutralization assays were completed for baseline, days 30 and 60 for DENV and ZIKV. To better understand if the previous DENV immunity plays a role in the neutralization of ZIKV early after the infection, we also ran PRNT assays for days 3, 5, 6 and 7.

As early as 6 days after the infection an increase in the neutralizing activity against ZIKV is detected in all groups with a slight non-significant trend to be higher in the DENV 12M group. This increase continues on day 7 with the trend to be higher in both preimmunized groups. By day 30 p.i., neutralizing titers had boosted in the three groups, with DENV-middle convalescent animals showing a slight trend towards higher levels of dilution effective for half-maximum neutralization compared to DENV 3M and na&#x000ef;ve groups.

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, we identified significant differences, at the highest serum concentrations in the magnitude of the neutralization against ZIKV (only dilutions showing more than 60% of neutralization were considered) on day 6 (P&#x0003c;0.001 and P&#x0003c;0.029 for DENV 12M and DENV 3M vs. na&#x000ef;ve respectively at 1:20 dilution and P = 0.0005 and P&#x0003c;0.0001 for DENV 12M vs. DENV 3M and na&#x000ef;ve respectively at 1:40 dilution) and day 7 (P&#x0003c;0.0039 and P&#x0003c;0.0001 for DENV 12M vs. na&#x000ef;ve at 1:20 and 1:40 dilutions respectively) p.i. However, the role of those early nAbs limiting viral replication is debatable when the relationship between RNAemia and end point neutralizing titers are analyzed together (<xref rid="pntd.0008285.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, both DENV immune groups had high levels of nAbs against DENV2 at baseline, which boosted significantly for DENV 12M animals at day 30 p.i. compared to the na&#x000ef;ve group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). By day 60 p.i., these nAbs did not decline in neither of the DENV immune groups, and a significant difference was still present for DENV-middle convalescent animals, which suggests that ZIKV infection induced a boost in cross-neutralizing Abs to DENV and the magnitude of the boost depend on the time elapse between DENV and ZIKV infection (P = 0.0006 for day 30 p.i. and P = 0.02 for day 60 p.i.). Only one na&#x000ef;ve animal produced low level of nAbs against DENV2 by day 30 p.i. that declined by day 60 p.i.

The hierarchy of neutralizing Abs generated 30 days p.i. was the same for both DENV immune groups (D2&#x0003e;ZIKV&#x0003e;D4&#x0003e;D3&#x0003e;D1), and for the na&#x000ef;ve group it was ZIKV&#x0003e;D4&#x0003e;D2&#x0003e;D3&#x0003e;D1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s006">S6B Fig</xref>).

Using the macaque model allows among other factors, to normalize the quantity of viral inoculum, the age and sex of the animals exposed, and the timing of the infection. Controlling the timing of exposure between heterologous flavivirus infections allows for the measurement of the impact of time on the immune response to the second infecting agent. These studies are important not only for understanding the impact of the duration of exposure between natural heterologous flavivirus infections in endemic areas but also provide a model to evaluate possible pan-flavivirus protective windows for vaccine candidates.</p><p>Previously we have shown that a DENV infection 2.8 years (late convalescence period) prior to ZIKV exposure did not lead to an enhanced ZIKV infection. Moreover, that period of convalescence results in an immune status that trends toward the control of ZIKV viremia and the decrease of liver enzymes after infection. Differences were also observed in B-cell and T-cell activation and cytokine and chemokine profiles [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Our previous results have been validated by other groups including a metanalysis using most of the NHP available data [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and more relevant, in two studies presenting real settings of humans living in DENV-endemic areas [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this work, we aimed to establish the impact of different DENV convalescent periods (3 months or early convalescent period, and 12 months or middle convalescent period) on the immune response after ZIKV infection.</p><p>For the DENV 12M group, we identified a significant decline in the viremia set-point on day 4 and 5 p.i., in the average viremia days from days 1 to 7 p.i. and in AUC analysis for viremia, suggesting that the length of time after DENV infection significantly impacts ZIKV replication and most likely its pathogenic effects. Two recent works from human cohorts pointed out the potential role of the length of time elapsed between two infections in the probability to have symptomatic ZIKV infections. Results from a Nicaraguan pediatric cohort showed that when adjusted for age, sex, and recent DENV infection (defined as 1&#x02013;2 years before ZIKV infection, similar to our DENV-middle convalescence immune group) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection. In addition, the same work showed that prior or recent DENV infection did not affect the rate of total ZIKV infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, another work carried out at Pau da Lima community in the city of Salvador, Brazil, showed that the pre-outbreak IgG3 titers against DENV NS1 were positively associated with risk of ZIKV infection but at the same time the presence of IgG1 against same antigen was associated to a decrease in the probability of ZIKV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is highly relevant to our results because IgG3 subclass have been associated to recent DENV infection and are detectable only up to 4 to 6 months after infection, which comprises the period of 3 months of our early-convalescent group showing a trend to control ZIKV replication but not as effective as the DENV-middle convalescent group. However, no specific correlate of protection has been identified for these DENV and ZIKV interactions in those human cohorts. Taking advantage of our model we completed a detailed analysis between the nAbs and the ZIKV RNAemia within the first week of ZIKV infection that otherwise would be difficult to conduct in human cohorts. From days 5 to 7 after ZIKV infection we identified a limited increase in the magnitude of ZIKV neutralization activity in the DENV-middle convalescent group characterized by the presence of low-to-intermediate levels of nAbs. This early expansion of the ZIKV nAbs findings are in agreement with previous works with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) confirming an early expansion of the plasmablast response 6 days after secondary DENV [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and primary ZIKV infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While no correlation can be made with the viremia on days 5 and 6 p.i., by day 7 a consistent increase in the ZIKV nAbs correlating with the absence of RNAemia was observed only in the animals of DENV 12M group. In order to determine if pre-existing DENV Abs mediate a correlate of protection by controlling early ZIKV replication, we performed depletion of DENV2 specific Abs from day 7 p.i. samples. Our results show that the neutralization against DENV in both DENV-immune groups was abrogated while ZIKV neutralization remains unchanged. This result strongly suggests that pre-existing DENV Abs play no role controlling ZIKV replication during the first week after infection and a contribution in limiting ZIKV pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, as confirmed in NHPs and humans [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], is unlikely.</p><p>Interestingly, our results on the role of previous DENV Abs on ZIKV replication contrast the findings from our group in a reverse infection scenario, suggesting that low-to-intermediary levels of cross-neutralizing Abs against DENV induced by a previous ZIKV infection may play a role in controlling early DENV RNAemia set point [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, we confirmed the pre-existence of cross-reacting but non-neutralizing Abs to ZIKV in the DENV-immune groups [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, those Abs were significantly higher only in the DENV-early convalescent group compared to the middle convalescent group. This confirms the high frequency of ZIKV cross-reacting Abs during the early DENV convalescence that wane during the middle and late convalescent periods [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Cumulatively from our previous results [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and this current work, we can conclude that the neutralization against ZIKV is very limited or absent in DENV-immune samples, regardless of the convalescence status.</p><p>It is known that NS1, along with structural protein E, is one of the main immunodominant targets for B cell response [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Here we show that after ZIKV infection, the levels of binding Abs to ZIKV NS1 protein were significantly higher in the group with a middle convalescent period to DENV compared to the other two groups which is in agreement with a trend to higher magnitude of DENV2-neutralizing Abs in that group. Also, in same group we found a significant early expansion in the magnitude of ZIKV neutralization by days 6 and 7 after the infection. These results suggest the presence of more mature memory B cells in that group. Previous studies carried out in human cohorts have suggested that prior DENV exposure could modulate the humoral response to ZIKV [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] while others have inferred that the effect is only modest [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is known that memory B cells are implicated during a secondary infection in a DENV-ZIKV scenario, still it is unknown how or when their maturation takes place in order to modify the response during ZIKV infection. Lastly, earlier works suggested that the magnitude of the humoral response driven by memory B cells may depend on the length of time passed between infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here, using an accurate depiction of time elapsed in a NHP model, we show that the length of time between infections does impact the quality of this memory recall.</p><p>It is well documented that secondary flavivirus infections, including ZIKV, lead to an increase in cross-reactive Abs and nAbs [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Consistent with that, we found a transient but significant expansion in the magnitude of DENV2 cross-reactive Abs in the pre-immune groups 30 days after ZIKV infection with a rapid decline similar to baseline levels by day 60 p.i. DENV cross-neutralizing Abs also show a slight but not significant expansion by day 30 p.i. compared to their baseline values. These results confirm that ZIKV infection contributes to a transient expansion of DENV neutralization which may play a role modifying the course of a subsequent DENV infection in a DENV endemic region. Interestingly, the magnitude of the neutralization against the others 3 DENV serotypes was also boosted but without significant differences among serotypes, regardless of the time between infections. This result is in contrast with our previous work showing that time between ZIKV and DENV infection significantly modify the magnitude of neutralization to the other DENV serotypes suggesting that different immune mechanisms are triggered when the sequence of infections are different [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>By depleting DENV2 specific Abs from day 7 p.i. samples we confirmed previous results showing that during the convalescence period those Abs do not contribute to ZIKV neutralization [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Here we build on existing literature and are adding evidences showing that that scenario is the same regardless of the time elapsed between the two infections (being 3 or 12 months).</p><p>In addition our results show that the expansion and durability of the DENV nAbs induced by a secondary ZIKV infection is modest compared to the reported response induced after a secondary heterologous DENV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>From our work, we can infer a role of the cellular immune response in facilitating the initial significant decrease of ZIKV replication between days 4 to 7 p.i. is very likely. The cytotoxic profile of the CD4+ T cells present 12 months after DENV infection and during heterologous ZIKV challenge correlates with better performance relative to the early (3 months) or late (2.8 years) [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] convalescence periods after primary DENV infection. The role of CD4+T cells in flavivirus infection has been extensively documented [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Importantly, Weiskopf et al. and others have shown that DENV CD4+ T cells are readily detectable early following DENV infection, and the frequency of DENV-specific CD107a+ CD4+ T correlate with enhanced protection against DENV disease [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and play a key role in controlling secondary flavivirus infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our work builds on these observations and demonstrates that DENV specific CD4+ T cells isolated one year after DENV infection were highly responsive to the whole DENV virus prior to ZIKV infection (characterized by a significantly higher frequency of IFN-&#x003b3; production or CD107a expression). Additionally, this group showed a strong trend to higher frequency of CD107a expressing CD4+ T cells in response to the whole ZIKV and of IFN-&#x003b3; CD4+ T cells after the other stimuli including the whole ZIKV, ZIKV and DENV envelope and ZIKV nonstructural proteins compared to the other two groups. In fact, after 30 days of infection the focus of CD4+ T cells reactivity was ZIKV envelope and non-structural antigens. That switch was a trend, but not significant in animals with an early period of convalescence to DENV compared to the DENV-na&#x000ef;ve group. Interestingly, it has been shown that a higher frequency of DENV-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T cells are associated with subclinical manifestations in children suffering from secondary DENV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Notably, the data for CD8+T cells did not recapitulate the observations of the CD4+ T cells. We noted relatively similar responses between CD8+T cells isolated from the 12M DENV immune animals compared to the 3M DENV immune animals. Our finding on CD4+ T cells is consistent with a previous report confirming that pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells (and not CD8+ T cells or Abs) are responsible also for limiting the severity of illness caused by influenza [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This suggests that the CD4+ T cell response changed over time, leading to potential differences in disease outcome.</p><p>The significant role of T cells in controlling ZIKV replication in animals with a DENV-middle convalescence period before ZIKV infection is reinforced by the significant increase of circulating cytolytic protein perforin at day 7 p.i. We hypothesize that this likely represents T cells acquisition of cytotoxic function [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] in that group compared to the other two groups and correlates with the higher expression of CD107a on the CD4+ T cells isolated from these animals. Previously we confirmed a peak in perforin levels in serum 6 days after ZIKV infection in animals with 2.8 years of previous immunity to DENV [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Others have shown that Granzyme B levels in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells peaked between 7 and 10 days post-ZIKV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>The protective role of the cellular immune response controlling the viral burden of ZIKV in mice has been reported [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. More recently, mouse models have shown that prior DENV immunity can protect against ZIKV infection during pregnancy, and CD8+ T cells are sufficient for this cross-protection [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. An isolated but highly relevant finding was that on days 1 and 2 p.i. animals from the DENV 12M group had significant higher levels of pDC frequency in comparison with animals from DENV 3M and na&#x000ef;ve groups and with its own baseline levels. It has been shown that pDC levels correlate with DENV severity, with various studies reporting a decrease in pDCs in patients with more serious forms of DENV disease such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in comparison with normal DENV or healthy patients [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. More importantly, De Carvalho and colleagues reported that higher levels of pDCs correlate with lower DENV viremia levels [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Other viral infections, like HIV-1 and HCV, lead to an increase in pDCs frequency in long-term survivors, while a decrease has been documented in chronic patients, accompanied by impairment of cytokine-secreting and T cell-activating capacities of pDCs. In addition, during influenza infection pDCs are capable of priming primary and secondary CD4 and CD8 T cell responses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This is in agreement with the fact that out of the three cohorts in our work, the animals exposed to DENV 12 months before had the most efficient ZIKV viremia clearance.</p><p>pDC-mediated mechanisms have been described as key in antiviral responses against DENV [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It has been documented that mature pDCs produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN &#x003b1; and IFN &#x003b2;, activating innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Virus-stimulated pDCs are responsible for a wider and faster response, and additionally contribute to expand antigen-specific memory CD4 and CD8 T cells [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus, their recruitment to lymphoid and some peripheral tissues leads to an ongoing inflammatory response and the activation of lymphocytes by expressing co-stimulatory molecules and in turn, modulate T cell effector functions. Our results are in agreement with this, showing a significant increase of circulating perforin by day 7 p.i. correlating with a higher expression of CD107a and higher frequency of IFN-&#x003b3; production on CD4+ T cells in animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection.</p><p>Altogether, our data reinforces that the activation of the adaptive response against DENV and ZIKV infections involves signals and interactions from pDCs and T cells. This finding on the frequency of pDCs correlating with the reported increase in the frequency of DENV antigen specific T cells and a significant control of ZIKV replication observed only in the DENV 12M group denotes that the complex interplay between the cellular and innate immune responses could be time-dependent.</p><p>The uniqueness of our report is that we provide evidence that the magnitude and breadth of flavivirus immunity depends not only on pre-infection immune status but time between exposures, with significantly different protection outcomes. Also, taking advantage of the NHP model, we are providing a dissection of the early events of the protective immune response. We present evidences supporting a limited role, if any, of the pre-existing DENV humoral immune response controlling ZIKV replication. Furthermore, our work indicates an early role of the innate and cellular immunities in such control, allowing a window of transition to the eventual contribution of the humoral immune response.</p><p>We acknowledge that to establish the precise role of the T cells immune response controlling ZIKV viremia and pathogenesis, depletion of the specific T cells subsets is advised, and our group is already working on that direction. From our results we cannot anticipate if the effect of previous DENV immunity or the time between DENV and ZIKV infections may have any implications during pregnancy. However, studies addressing the role of DENV Abs in pregnant women infected with ZIKV, one from Italy and one from Brazil, concluded that pre-existence of DENV Abs are not related to an increase of fetal damage [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Moreover, the Brazilian study concluded that multitypic DENV infections may protect, rather than enhance, from development of CZS. Despite this, a more recent report from Carvalho et al., published after our work was available as a preprint, concluded that the time elapsed between the more recent DENV epidemics in Brazil and the microcephaly epidemic observed after the introduction of ZIKV was in fact relevant to either provide protection or to increase the risk [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>More complex studies using a larger number of NHPs and well controlled prospective studies in human populations are needed to elucidate such a relationship [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Based on other results from our group, it is possible to argue that the sequence of ZIKV-DENV infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] induces a different immunological response&#x02014;in terms of the neutralization magnitude, cytokine profile and functionality of the cellular immune response&#x02014;compared to the DENV-ZIKV scenario shown here. However, in both scenarios, the time interval between infections seems to play a critical role in the quality and quantity of the immune response.</p><p>Our findings have enormous impact for the epidemiological models anticipating the magnitude of new ZIKV epidemics in DENV endemic areas and are essential for the planning and evaluation of ZIKV and DENV vaccine schedules, design and monitoring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Viral stock</title><p>ZIKV PRVABC59 strain was obtained from ATCC, BEI Resources (Manassas, VA), was used in order to compare results to our previously published data.
