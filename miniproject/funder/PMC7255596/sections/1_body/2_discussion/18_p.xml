<p>More complex studies using a larger number of NHPs and well controlled prospective studies in human populations are needed to elucidate such a relationship [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Based on other results from our group, it is possible to argue that the sequence of ZIKV-DENV infections [

However, in both scenarios, the time interval between infections seems to play a critical role in the quality and quantity of the immune response.
