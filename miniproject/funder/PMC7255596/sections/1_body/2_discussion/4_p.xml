<p>For the DENV 12M group, we identified a significant decline in the viremia set-point on day 4 and 5 p.i., in the average viremia days from days 1 to 7 p.i. and in AUC analysis for viremia, suggesting that the length of time after DENV infection significantly impacts ZIKV replication and most likely its pathogenic effects. Two recent works from human cohorts pointed out the potential role of the length of time elapsed between two infections in the probability to have symptomatic ZIKV infections. Results from a Nicaraguan pediatric cohort showed that when adjusted for age, sex, and recent DENV infection (defined as 1–2 years before ZIKV infection, similar to our DENV-middle convalescence immune group) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection. In addition, the same work showed that prior or recent DENV infection did not affect the rate of total ZIKV infections [

Additionally, another work carried out at Pau da Lima community in the city of Salvador, Brazil, showed that the pre-outbreak IgG3 titers against DENV NS1 were positively associated with risk of ZIKV infection but at the same time the presence of IgG1 against same antigen was associated to a decrease in the probability of ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is highly relevant to our results because IgG3 subclass have been associated to recent DENV infection and are detectable only up to 4 to 6 months after infection, which comprises the period of 3 months of our early-convalescent group showing a trend to control ZIKV replication but not as effective as the DENV-middle convalescent group. However, no specific correlate of protection has been identified for these DENV and ZIKV interactions in those human cohorts. Taking advantage of our model we completed a detailed analysis between the nAbs and the ZIKV RNAemia within the first week of ZIKV infection that otherwise would be difficult to conduct in human cohorts. From days 5 to 7 after ZIKV infection we identified a limited increase in the magnitude of ZIKV neutralization activity in the DENV-middle convalescent group characterized by the presence of low-to-intermediate levels of nAbs. This early expansion of the ZIKV nAbs findings are in agreement with previous works with human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) confirming an early expansion of the plasmablast response 6 days after secondary DENV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. While no correlation can be made with the viremia on days 5 and 6 p.i., by day 7 a consistent increase in the ZIKV nAbs correlating with the absence of RNAemia was observed only in the animals of DENV 12M group. In order to determine if pre-existing DENV Abs mediate a correlate of protection by controlling early ZIKV replication, we performed depletion of DENV2 specific Abs from day 7 p.i. samples. Our results show that the neutralization against DENV in both DENV-immune groups was abrogated while ZIKV neutralization remains unchanged. This result strongly suggests that pre-existing DENV Abs play no role controlling ZIKV replication during the first week after infection and a contribution in limiting ZIKV pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, as confirmed in NHPs and humans [
