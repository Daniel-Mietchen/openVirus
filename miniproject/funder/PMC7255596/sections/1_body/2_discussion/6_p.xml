<p>Additionally, we confirmed the pre-existence of cross-reacting but non-neutralizing Abs to ZIKV in the DENV-immune groups [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, those Abs were significantly higher only in the DENV-early convalescent group compared to the middle convalescent group. This confirms the high frequency of ZIKV cross-reacting Abs during the early DENV convalescence that wane during the middle and late convalescent periods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Cumulatively from our previous results [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and this current work, we can conclude that the neutralization against ZIKV is very limited or absent in DENV-immune samples, regardless of the convalescence status.
