<p>We acknowledge that to establish the precise role of the T cells immune response controlling ZIKV viremia and pathogenesis, depletion of the specific T cells subsets is advised, and our group is already working on that direction. From our results we cannot anticipate if the effect of previous DENV immunity or the time between DENV and ZIKV infections may have any implications during pregnancy. However, studies addressing the role of DENV Abs in pregnant women infected with ZIKV, one from Italy and one from Brazil, concluded that pre-existence of DENV Abs are not related to an increase of fetal damage [

Despite this, a more recent report from Carvalho et al., published after our work was available as a preprint, concluded that the time elapsed between the more recent DENV epidemics in Brazil and the microcephaly epidemic observed after the introduction of ZIKV was in fact relevant to either provide protection or to increase the risk [
