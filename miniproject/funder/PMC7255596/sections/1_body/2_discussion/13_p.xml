<p>The protective role of the cellular immune response controlling the viral burden of ZIKV in mice has been reported [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. More recently, mouse models have shown that prior DENV immunity can protect against ZIKV infection during pregnancy, and CD8+ T cells are sufficient for this cross-protection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. An isolated but highly relevant finding was that on days 1 and 2 p.i. animals from the DENV 12M group had significant higher levels of pDC frequency in comparison with animals from DENV 3M and na√Øve groups and with its own baseline levels. It has been shown that pDC levels correlate with DENV severity, with various studies reporting a decrease in pDCs in patients with more serious forms of DENV disease such as Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in comparison with normal DENV or healthy patients [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. More importantly, De Carvalho and colleagues reported that higher levels of pDCs correlate with lower DENV viremia levels [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Other viral infections, like HIV-1 and HCV, lead to an increase in pDCs frequency in long-term survivors, while a decrease has been documented in chronic patients, accompanied by impairment of cytokine-secreting and T cell-activating capacities of pDCs. In addition, during influenza infection pDCs are capable of priming primary and secondary CD4 and CD8 T cell responses
