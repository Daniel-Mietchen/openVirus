<p>It is well established that exposure to DENV prior to a ZIKV infection results in a qualitative modification of the humoral and cellular immune response to ZIKV in mice, macaques and humans [

However, we know from sequential DENV infections in humans that the timing between flavivirus exposure can alter the balance between heterologous immune pathogenesis and protection. While there are well structured ongoing studies in human populations living in flavivirus endemic areas [
