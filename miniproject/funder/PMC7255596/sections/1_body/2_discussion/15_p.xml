<p>Altogether, our data reinforces that the activation of the adaptive response against DENV and ZIKV infections involves signals and interactions from pDCs and T cells. This finding on the frequency of pDCs correlating with the reported increase in the frequency of DENV antigen specific T cells and a significant control of ZIKV replication observed only in the DENV 12M group denotes that the complex interplay between the cellular and innate immune responses could be time-dependent.</p>
