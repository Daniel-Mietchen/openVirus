<p>The uniqueness of our report is that we provide evidence that the magnitude and breadth of flavivirus immunity depends not only on pre-infection immune status but time between exposures, with significantly different protection outcomes. Also, taking advantage of the NHP model, we are providing a dissection of the early events of the protective immune response. We present evidences supporting a limited role, if any, of the pre-existing DENV humoral immune response controlling ZIKV replication. Furthermore, our work indicates an early role of the innate and cellular immunities in such control, allowing a window of transition to the eventual contribution of the humoral immune response.</p>
