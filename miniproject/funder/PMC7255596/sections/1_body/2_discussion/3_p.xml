<p>Previously we have shown that a DENV infection 2.8 years (late convalescence period) prior to ZIKV exposure did not lead to an enhanced ZIKV infection. Moreover, that period of convalescence results in an immune status that trends toward the control of ZIKV viremia and the decrease of liver enzymes after infection. Differences were also observed in B-cell and T-cell activation and cytokine and chemokine profiles [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this work, we aimed to establish the impact of different DENV convalescent periods (3 months or early convalescent period, and 12 months or middle convalescent period) on the immune response after ZIKV infection.
