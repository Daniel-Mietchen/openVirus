<p>The significant role of T cells in controlling ZIKV replication in animals with a DENV-middle convalescence period before ZIKV infection is reinforced by the significant increase of circulating cytolytic protein perforin at day 7 p.i. We hypothesize that this likely represents T cells acquisition of cytotoxic function [

Previously we confirmed a peak in perforin levels in serum 6 days after ZIKV infection in animals with 2.8 years of previous immunity to DENV [
