<p>For virus titration, Vero81 cells (ATCC CCL-81) at approx. 8.5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in 24 well plates with growth medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium, Thermo Fisher Scientific, with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1% HEPES (Gibco), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco) and 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco)). At around 85% confluency (approx. 24 hours later), ten-fold dilutions of virus were prepared in diluent medium (Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 2% FBS (Gibco) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (HyClone) and added to the wells after removing growth medium. Each virus dilution was added in 100 mL triplicates, and plates were incubated 1 hour at 37C/5%CO2/rocking. After incubation, 1 mL of overlay (Opti-MEM with 1% Carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma), 2% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (HyClone)) was added to the plates containing viral dilutions, followed by an incubation period at 37C/5%CO2. After 3 to 5 days of incubation (depending of the virus), overlay was washed away with phosphate buffered saline (PBS 1X) and fixed with 80% methanol. For ZIKV, cells were stained with crystal violet after fixing. For DENV, plates were fixed then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS and incubated for 1hr/37C/5%CO2/rocking with anti-E mAb 4G2 and anti-prM mAb 2H2 (provided by Dr. Aravinda de Silva), both diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer. Plates were washed twice and incubated 1hr/37C/5%CO2/rocking with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma), diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer. Foci were developed with TrueBlue HRP substrate (KPL) and counted. For the Focus/Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (FRNT/PRNT), sera were diluted two-fold and mixed with approx. 35 foci per plaque-forming units (FFU per p.f.u. per mL) of virus and then incubated for 1hr/37C/5%CO2/rocking. Virus-serum dilutions were added to 24 well-plates containing Vero81 cells as mentioned above, and incubation was continued for 1hr/37C/5%CO2/rocking. After incubation, overlay was added, and the aforementioned procedure was repeated. Mean focus diameter was calculated from approx. 20 foci per clone measured at X5 magnification. Results were reported as the FRNT or PRNT with 60% or greater reduction in DENV or ZIKV foci or plaques (FRNT60 or PRNT60). A positive neutralization titer was designated as 1:20 or greater, while &lt;1:20 was considered a negative neutralization titer.
