<p>Viral RNA for real-time PCR assay was extracted from 140 ul of virus isolate (previously tittered as described above) and serum samples using Invitrogen PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Real-time RT-PCR (TaqMan) assay-specific primers and probes for ZIKV were designed by Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO) following the protocol developed by the Molecular Diagnostics and Research Laboratory Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dengue Branch at San Juan, PR. RNA from other flaviviruses were included as negative control. For the reaction mixture, 5 ml of RNA was combined with 100 mM primers and 25 mM probe in a 25 ml total volume using Life Technologies SuperScriptIII Platinum assay kit (Life Sciences). Assays were performed in an iCycler iQ Real Time Detection System (Bio Rad, CA). For quantification, a standard curve was generated from ten-fold dilutions of RNA from a known amount of virus.</p>
