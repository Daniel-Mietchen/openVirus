<p>All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institute’s Animal Care and Use Committee at Medical Sciences Campus, University of Puerto Rico (IACUC-UPR-MSC) and performed in a facility accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) (Animal Welfare Assurance number A3421; protocol number, 7890116). Procedures involving all study animals were approved by the Medical Sciences Campus, UPR IACUC and were conducted in accordance with USDA Animal Welfare Regulations, the Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals and institutional policies. In addition, steps were taken to lighten sufferings, including use of anesthesia and method of sacrifice if appropriate, in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition), Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall report, “The use of non-human primates in research:

Macaques were continuously monitored by trained veterinarians at the Animal Research Center and evaluated twice daily for evidence of disease or injury. Feeding and drinking continued normally during this period. All procedures were conducted under anesthesia by intramuscular injection of ketamine at 10–20 mg/kg-1 of body weight, as approved by the IACUC. Anesthesia was delivered in the caudal thigh using a 23-Gauge sterile syringe needle. During the period of the entire study, the macaques were under the environmental-enrichment program of the facility, also approved by the IACUC.
