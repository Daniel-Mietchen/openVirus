<p>Phenotypic characterization of rhesus macaque cellular immune response was performed by multicolor flow cytometry using direct immunofluorescence. Aliquots of 150 ul of heparinized whole blood were directly incubated with a mix of Abs for 30 min. at room temperature. After incubation, red blood cells were fixed and lysed with ACK, and cells were washed three times with PBS. Samples were analyzed using a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 flow cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, CA). The following Abs were used in this study: CD123-APC (7G3), CD20-FITC (2H7), CD20-PacBlue (2H7), CD69-PE (FN50), KI67-FITC (B56) and CD3-FITC (SP34) from BD-Biosciences; HLA-DR VioGreen (G46.6), CD3-PE-Vio770 (10D12), CD3-APC (10D12) from Miltenyi; CD11c-PE/Cy7 (3.9), CD8-FITC (SK1) and CD8-BV421 (SK1) from Biolegend. For analyses, LYM were gated based on their characteristic forward and side scatter pattern. B cells were defined as CD20
 <sup>+</sup>CD3
 <sup>-</sup>CD14
 <sup>-</sup>. Activation marker CD69 was determined in each different lymphoid cell population. Dendritic cells (DCs) were separated into two populations by the expression of CD123 (pDCs) or CD11c (mDCs) in the HLA
