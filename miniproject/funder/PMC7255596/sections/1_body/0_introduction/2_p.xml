<p>While ZIKV exists as a single serotype, DENV has four related but antigenically different serotypes. Prior exposure to a single DENV serotype predisposes individuals to severe disease upon a secondary heterologous DENV infection, and the time interval between infections has been considered as a risk factor [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008285.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A short interval of time between homologous or heterologous DENV infections usually results in protection from disease, while an extended period of time is associated with the potential for severe dengue [
