<p>To establish how previous immunity to DENV shapes the cellular response against a subsequent ZIKV infection, an analysis of the involved cells was performed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Animals exposed to DENV 3 months earlier had significantly higher frequency of B cells (CD20+) 24 hours before ZIKV infection compared to the other groups (P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: -12.33, CI95%: -22.69 to -1.979 for DENV 3M versus DENV 12M, and P&lt;0.01; mean diff.: 14.77, CI95%: 4.41 to 25.12 for DENV 3M versus na√Øve group). No other differences between groups were detected, although the trend observed in day 0 is maintained through day 3 (
