<p>To assess if a previous DENV infection has an impact on the T cell response to a ZIKV infection, their effector responses were measured. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ or TNFα or expressing CD107a in response to various stimuli were assayed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The IFNγ response in the CD4+ T cells from the DENV 12M group before ZIKV infection is remarkable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008285.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, upper panel, left). The frequency of these cells in this group was significantly higher in response to the whole inactivated DENV in comparison with the naïve animals (P&lt;0.05) and although not significant, showed a strong trend to have a higher frequency in response to peptides derived from the DENV and ZIKV envelopes and ZIKV non-structural proteins as well compared to the 3M and naïve groups.
