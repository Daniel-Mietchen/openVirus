<p>We defined average RNAemia days as the days with detectable viremia out of all possible days with detectable viremia, taking into account the number of animals per group, during the collection period. The animals exposed to DENV 12 months earlier had the least viremia days in comparison with the na√Øve group, and the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) (

These results suggest that a previous infection with DENV contributes to an earlier and significant control of ZIKV viremia in a subsequent infection, but only if at least 12 months (a middle convalescence period) have passed between infections.
