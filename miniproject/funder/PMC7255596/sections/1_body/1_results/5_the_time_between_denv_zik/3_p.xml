<p>In order to expand our analysis of the contribution of the humoral immune response to the early viral replication we further looked at the dilution:neutralization capacity relation in samples from days 6 and 7 p.i. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, we identified significant differences, at the highest serum concentrations in the magnitude of the neutralization against ZIKV (only dilutions showing more than 60% of neutralization were considered) on day 6 (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.029 for DENV 12M and DENV 3M vs. naïve respectively at 1:20 dilution and P = 0.0005 and P&lt;0.0001 for DENV 12M vs. DENV 3M and naïve respectively at 1:40 dilution) and day 7 (P&lt;0.0039 and P&lt;0.0001 for DENV 12M vs. naïve at 1:20 and 1:40 dilutions respectively) p.i. However, the role of those early nAbs limiting viral replication is debatable when the relationship between RNAemia and end point neutralizing titers are analyzed together (
