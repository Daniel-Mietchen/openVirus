<p>On the other hand, both DENV immune groups had high levels of nAbs against DENV2 at baseline, which boosted significantly for DENV 12M animals at day 30 p.i. compared to the naïve group (

By day 60 p.i., these nAbs did not decline in neither of the DENV immune groups, and a significant difference was still present for DENV-middle convalescent animals, which suggests that ZIKV infection induced a boost in cross-neutralizing Abs to DENV and the magnitude of the boost depend on the time elapse between DENV and ZIKV infection (P = 0.0006 for day 30 p.i. and P = 0.02 for day 60 p.i.). Only one naïve animal produced low level of nAbs against DENV2 by day 30 p.i. that declined by day 60 p.i. (
