<p>Only one animal from the DENV-early convalescent group (MA062) had very low but detectable anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG levels at baseline (

All ZIKV-infected animals showed a boost in anti-NS1 levels by day 30 p.i., with DENV-middle convalescent group having significantly higher levels compared to early convalescent and naïve animals (P&lt;0.01; mean diff.: 1.05, CI95%: 0.2608 to 1.836 for DENV 12M vs. DENV 3M; P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: 2.15, CI95%: 1.45 to 2.859 for DENV 12M vs naïve). These levels decreased by day 60 p.i., and the drop is more dramatic in the pre-immune animals (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4F Fig</xref>). Only one animal from the DENV-middle convalescent group showed detectable levels of anti-ZIKV EDIII before ZIKV infection. Anti-ZIKV EDIII levels for all groups slowly increased throughout 30 and 60 days p.i., and the increase at day 60 p.i. was significant for DENV-immune animals with respect to their basal levels (P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: -0.85, CI95%: -1.68 to -0.03 for DENV 12M animals, and P&lt;0.001; mean diff.: -1.26, CI95%: -2.27 to -0.25 for DENV 3M animals). No significant differences were observed among the groups, suggesting that previous exposure to DENV does not have an impact on the generation of cross-reactive Abs against ZIKV EDIII epitopes and that these Abs may have limited contribution to ZIKV neutralization.
