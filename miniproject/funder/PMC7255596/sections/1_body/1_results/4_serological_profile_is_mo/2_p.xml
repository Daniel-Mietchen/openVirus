<p>As expected, all ZIKV-infected animals developed anti-ZIKV IgM 30 days after the infection (

However, those Abs were early detected only in three animals from the DENV 12M group with two subjects showing a peak on that day (5O8, 1O1). All DENV-immune animals had detectable levels of anti-ZIKV IgG at baseline compared to the naïve animals, suggesting a strong cross-reactivity between previously generated anti-DENV IgG to ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). DENV-early convalescent animals had significantly higher levels of anti-ZIKV IgG than the other DENV-immune animals (DENV 12M) at baseline (P&lt;0.05; mean diff.: -0.59, CI95%: -1.15 to -0.05). By day 7 p.i., DENV-immune animals had higher levels of anti-ZIKV IgG that increase throughout days 30 and 60 p.i. A similar but slower increase was detected in the naïve group. Nonetheless, all three groups showed a boost in anti-ZIKV IgG levels by day 30 p.i. with a significant expansion at day 60 p.i. for DENV-immune groups (P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: -1.187, CI95%: -1.848 to -0.525 and P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: -1.176, CI95%: -1.716 to -0.636 for DENV 3M and DENV 12M groups respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008285.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). The same scenario can be observed with the naïve group, which experiments a significant expansion in their level of anti-ZIKV IgG by day 60 p.i. compared to day 30 p.i. (P&lt;0.0001; mean diff.: -1.231, CI95%: -1.771 to -0.691).
