  <title>Kinetics of hematology and laboratory results.</title>
  <p>Cell subsets obtained from complete blood count (CBC) tests at baseline, 6 and 30 days p.i. In all panels, animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection are in blue, while animals exposed to DENV 3 months before are in orange. Naïve animals are in black. (A) White blood cells (WBC) total depicted in thou/uL. (B) Platelet (PLT) levels total depicted in thou/uL. (C) Monocyte (MON) kinetics expressed as absolute numbers (x10^6 cells/mL). Statistically significant differences among and within groups were calculated by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*P&lt;0.05).</p>
