  <title>Antigen-specific CD4
   <sup>+</sup> and CD8
   <sup>+</sup> responses prior and after ZIKV infection.
  </title>
  <p>The frequency of the specific response to DENV and ZIKV antigens differs among cohorts. In all panels, animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection are in blue, while animals exposed to DENV 3 months before are in orange. Naïve animals are in black. All percentages shown are subtracted from the unstimulated background. (A) Analysis of CD4 T cell response to different stimuli before (upper panel) and 30 days after ZIKV infection (lower panel). (B) Analysis of CD8 T cell response to different stimuli before (upper panel) and 30 days after ZIKV infection (lower panel). Statistically significant differences among groups were calculated by two-way ANOVA using Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (*P&lt;0.05 and ****P&lt;0.0001). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to.</p>
