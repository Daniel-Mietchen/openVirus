  <title>Zika RNA kinetics in serum and RNAemia days per cohort.</title>
  <p>RNAemia is affected by the period of time between exposures. In all panels, animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection are in blue, while animals exposed to DENV 3 months before are in orange. Naïve animals are in black. (A) ZIKV genome copies/mL in serum. ZIKV replication was detected in serum during the first 7 days after infection, and then on days 30 and 60 p.i. Statistically significant differences were observed using unpaired multiple t tests (*P&lt;0.05). Genome copies per mL are shown logarithmically. (B) Average RNAemia days were calculated using the following formula: total viremia days divided by total possible viremia days and are expressed as percentage. The obtained values were placed in a contingency table. (C) Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for individual values. Statistically significant differences of viremia days were calculated using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test and multiple t tests (*P&lt;0.05). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to.</p>
