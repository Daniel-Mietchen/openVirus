  <title>B cells profile before and after ZIKV infection.</title>
  <p>Frequency of B cells was assessed. In all panels, animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection are in blue, while animals exposed to DENV 3 months before are in orange. Naïve animals are in black. (A) Percentage of total B cells (CD20+) during baseline and days 1 through 3 p.i. (B) Frequency of activated B cells (CD20+ CD69+) during baseline and days 1 through 3 p.i. Comparisons between cohorts were performed by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*P&lt;0.05 and **P&lt;0.01). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to.</p>
