  <title>Previous exposure to DENV modulates the cytokine and chemokine profiles after ZIKV infection.</title>
  <p>(A-G) Significant cytokine and chemokine profiles of are depicted in pg per ml
   <sup>-1</sup>. In all panels, animals exposed to DENV 12 months before ZIKV infection are in blue, while animals exposed to DENV 3 months before are in orange. Naïve animals are in black. Statistically significant differences among groups were calculated by two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s, Sidak’s and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons tests (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.001 and ***P≤0.0001). Colored stars represent a significantly different group, while colored lines represent the group that it is compared to. Same colored lines and stars represent a significant difference compared to their baseline.
