  <title>Experimental design of ZIKV infection in DENV-immune and naïve macaques.</title>
  <p>Two cohorts of rhesus macaques (
   <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were exposed to DENV-2 (5 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> pfu s.c.) at different timepoints. Both cohorts were exposed to ZIKV strain PRABCV59 (1 x 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu s.c.) on September 12
   <sup>th</sup>, 2017, along with a third cohort composed of ZIKV and DENV naïve animals (n = 6). ZIKV infection was performed 12 months after DENV infection for cohort 1 (n = 6), and 3 months after DENV infection for cohort 2 (n = 4). Serum was collected at baseline and days 1 through 7 post ZIKV infection (p.i.). Sample collection was interrupted by Hurricane María’s impact, and resumed on day 30 p.i. PBMCs could only be obtained on baseline, day 30 and 60 p.i., while heparinized whole blood was collected on baseline and days 1 through 3 p.i. Additionally, urine was collected on baseline and days 2, 4 and 6 p.i.
