  <title>Pre-existing DENV-2 antibodies have no effect on early ZIKV neutralization.</title>
  <p>Depletion of DENV-2 specific antibodies and its effect on neutralization against DENV-2 and ZIKV is shown. Animals from cohort 1 are shown in blue, animals from cohort 2 are shown in orange and naïve animals from cohort 3 are shown in black in all panels. Dotted line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. Open and closed symbols represent control (undepleted) and depleted samples respectively. (A) Confirmation of DENV-2 antibody depletion by ELISA measuring DENV-IgG binding. (B) Depletion percentage of tested sera shown as optical density (OD) reduction difference between control and depleted samples. (C) DENV neutralization titers of depleted and control sera from day 7 after ZIKV infection are shown. (D) ZIKV neutralization titers of depleted and control sera from day 7 after infection are shown. Due to limited amount of serum, only 4 animals from the DENV-12M group and 2 animals from the naïve group were chosen for serum depletions.</p>
