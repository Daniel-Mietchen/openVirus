<p>We find that within-serotype antigenic evolution helps explain observed patterns of cross-neutralization among dengue genotypes. We also find that serotype-level population immunity is a strong determinant of viral clade dynamics across Southeast Asia. As richer datasets become available, future studies that similarly combine viral genomics, functional antigenic characterization, and population modeling have great potential to improve our understanding of how DENV evolves antigenically and moves through populations.</p>
