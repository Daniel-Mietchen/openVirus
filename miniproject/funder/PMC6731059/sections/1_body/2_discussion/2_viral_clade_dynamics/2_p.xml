<p>We find that antigenic fitness is able to explain much of the observed variation in serotype growth and decline (

This demonstrates that although intrinsic fitness plays an important role in dictating long-term dynamics, wherein particular serotypes tend to circulate at low frequency (e.g. DENV4) and others at high frequency (e.g. DENV1 and DENV2), antigenic fitness plays out on shorter-term time scales, dictating circulation over several subsequent years.
