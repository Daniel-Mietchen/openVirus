<p>Alternatively, this lack of signal could be methodologically explained if either (A) genotype-level frequency trajectories estimated from public data are overly noisy for this application or (B) our model of antigenic fitness based on PRNT assay data does not match reality, due to either PRNT assay data not well reflecting human immunity or due to our particular model formulation that parameterizes immunity from titer distances (
