<p>We use these inferred antigenic relationships to directly quantify the impact of antigenic fitness on DENV population composition. To do so, we measure serotype frequencies across Southeast Asia over time and construct a model to estimate how they will fluctuate (Materials and methods, 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6 equ7 equ8 equ9 equ10 equ11 equ12 equ13 equ15 equ16 equ17">Equation 6-16</xref>). This model places a fitness value on each serotype that derives from a constant intrinsic component alongside a time-dependent antigenic component. Antigenic fitness declines with population immunity, which is accumulated via the recent circulation of antigenically similar viruses. Our primary model parameterization assumes that both heterotypic and homotypic immunity wane linearly over time at the same rate, with homotypic immunity starting from a higher baseline of protection based on closer antigenic distances. We compared this to a secondary model parameterization with only heterotypic waning (see Materials and methods), under which we observe similar model performance (
