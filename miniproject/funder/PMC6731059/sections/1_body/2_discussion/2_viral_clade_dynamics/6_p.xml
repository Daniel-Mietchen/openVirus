<p>These observations are also subject to caveats imposed by the available data and model assumptions. Our estimates of antigenic fitness are informed by the antigenic distances inferred by the substitution model; thus, as above, we are unable to account for nuanced antigenic differences between sub-genotype clades of DENV due to limited titer data. We estimate DENV population composition over time based on available sequence data, pooled across all of Southeast Asia (Materials and methods, 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>). As the vast majority of cases of DENV are asymptomatic, sequenced viruses likely represent a biased sample of more severe cases from urban centers where patients are more likely to seek and access care. We also assume that Southeast Asia represents a closed viral population with homogeneous mixing. However, increasing globalization likely results in some amount of viral importation that is not accounted for in this model (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Salje et al., 2017</xref>), and viral populations across this broad region may not mix homogeneously each season. Thus, it is possible that these sub-serotype antigenic differences impact finer-scale population dynamics, but we lack the requisite data to examine this hypothesis.
