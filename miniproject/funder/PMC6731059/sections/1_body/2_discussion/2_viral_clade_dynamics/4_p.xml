<p>First, it may be that although genotypes are antigenically diverse, these differences do not influence large-scale regional dynamics over time. We may then hypothesize that within-serotype antigenic heterogeneity mediates disease severity, but does not influence infection or onward transmission. This hypothesis is consistent with the findings of 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Nagao and Koelle (2008)</xref>, who demonstrated that dengue epidemiological dynamics are compatible with a model wherein immunity confers protection against severe symptoms, but not asymptomatic infection. This is also consistent with 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Ten Bosch et al. (2018)</xref>â€™s findings that asymptomatic dengue infections contribute to onward transmission.
