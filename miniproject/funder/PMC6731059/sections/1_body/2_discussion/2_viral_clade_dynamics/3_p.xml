<p>We similarly use this model to quantify the effect of within-serotype antigenic variation on the success and decline of canonical DENV genotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As above, genotype antigenic fitness declines with population immunity. Here, we estimate population immunity based on antigenic distance from recently circulating genotypes, using distances that are either genotype-specific or based only on the serotype that each genotype belongs to. We then directly compare how strongly these coarser serotype-level versus specific genotype-level antigenic relationships impact DENV population dynamics. Overall, we find that antigenic fitness explains a moderate portion of the observed variation in genotype growth and decline. Surprisingly, however, we find that incorporating within-serotype antigenic differences does not improve our predictions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Câ€“D</xref>). We suggest two possible explanations for this observation.
