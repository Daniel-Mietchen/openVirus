<p>Consistent with the relatively long timescale of dengue evolution, we observe many sites in the dengue phylogeny to have mutated multiple times. These represent instances of parallelism, reversion and homoplasy. For example, we observe that site 390 is consistently S in DENV1, N in DENV3 and H in DENV4, while DENV2 genotypes show a mixture of D, N and S (

Our model predicts that the parallel N390S mutations in DENV1 and DENV2 Cosmopolitan makes these viruses slightly more antigenically similar rather than more antigenically distinct. Along these lines, we compared the ‘substitution’ model to a similar model formulation (termed the ‘tree’ model) which assigns
