<p>Overall, we expect that these antigenic phenotypes represent a lowerÂ bound on the extent, magnitude, and nature of antigenic heterogeneity with DENV. Our current titer dataset spans the breadth of DENV diversity, but due to small sample size, it lacks the resolution to detect most sub-genotype antigenic variation. The appearance of the deep antigenic divergence of the four serotypes, and the more recent antigenic divergences within each serotype, suggest that DENV antigenic evolution is likely an ongoing, although gradual, process. We therefore expect that future studies with richer datasets will find additional antigenic variation within each genotype. This dataset also contains many left-censored titer values, where we know two viruses are at least
