<p>Finally, antibody neutralization and escape (as measured by PRNT titers) is only one component of the immune response to DENV. Although analysis of a longitudinal cohort study shows that these neutralization titers correlate with protection from severe secondary infection, it is unclear how PRNT titers correspond to antibody-dependent enhancement (

Overall, while richer datasets and the development of more holistic assays will be required in order to fully characterize the extent of DENV antigenic diversity, it is clear that the four-serotype model is insufficient to explain DENV antigenic evolution.
