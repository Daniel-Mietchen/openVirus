<p>To investigate the impact of this observed variation, we examine patterns of neutralization in response to vaccination with each monovalent component of the NIH vaccine candidateÂ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Here, we see that each monovalent component elicits broad homotypic protection, but levels of heterotypic cross protection vary widely between heterotypic genotypes. This is consistent with previous reports of genotype-specific interactions between standing population immunity and subsequent heterotypic epidemics as modulating epidemic severity (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">OhAinle et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Kochel et al., 2002</xref>). We hypothesize that this observed within-serotype variation primarily effects heterotypic secondary infection outcomes, rather than modulating homotypic immunity. Although we note that 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Juraska et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrate that vaccine efficacy decreases with increasing amino acid divergence of breakthrough infections from the vaccine insert.
