<p>We show that mapping antigenic change to specific mutations and interpolating across the DENV alignment is able to explain a large majority of the observed variation in antigenic phenotypes, as measured by neutralization titers. We identify 49 specific mutations and 4 colinear mutation clusters that contribute to antigenic variation, of which 27 mutations or mutation clusters have an antigenic impact of 0.20 log

We use these mutations to infer unmeasured antigenic relationships between viruses, revealing substantial within-serotype antigenic variation. For comparison, we reconstructed the ancestral sequence of each serotype and constrained the model to only permit antigenic change to be attributed to these serotype-level differences. While this interserotype-only model predicts titers to a reasonable degree, we find that it has higher error (RMSE = 0.86) than the full model which accounts for within-serotype heterogeneity (RMSE = 0.79;
