 </inline-formula>. Titers represent the lowest serum concentration able to neutralize 50% of virus, and are reported as the inverse dilution. We used two publicly available plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT50) datasets generated by 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Katzelnick et al. (2015)</xref>. The primary dataset was generated by infecting each of 36 non-human primates with a unique strain of DENV. NHP sera was drawn after 12 weeks and titered against the panel of DENV viruses. The secondary dataset was generated by vaccinating 31 human trial participants with a monovalent component of the NIH DENV vaccine. Sera was drawn after 6 weeks and titered against the same panel of DENV viruses. As discussed in Katzelnick et al., these two datasets show similar patterns of antigenic relationships between DENV viruses. In total, our dataset includes 1182 measurements across 48 virus strains: 36 of these were used to generate serum, and 47 were used as test viruses.
