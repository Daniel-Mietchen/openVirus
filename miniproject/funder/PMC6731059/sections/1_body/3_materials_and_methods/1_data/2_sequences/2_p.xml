<p>For the clade frequencies analysis, we downloaded all dengue genome sequences available from the Los Alamos National Lab Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Database as of March 7, 2018, that contained at least the full coding sequence of 
 <italic>E</italic> (envelope) (total N = 12,645) (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kuiken et al., 2012</xref>). We discarded sequences which were putative recombinants, duplicates, lab strains, or which lacked an annotated sampling location and/or sampling date. We selected all remaining virus strains that were annotated as a Southeast Asian isolate (total N = 8,644).
