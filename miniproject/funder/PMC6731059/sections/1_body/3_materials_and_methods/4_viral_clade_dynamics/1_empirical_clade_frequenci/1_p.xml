<p>As discussed in 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Neher et al. (2016)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2018)</xref>, we estimate empirical clade frequencies from 1970 to 2015 based on observed relative abundances of each clade in the ‘slice’ of the phylogeny corresponding to each quarterly timepoint.
