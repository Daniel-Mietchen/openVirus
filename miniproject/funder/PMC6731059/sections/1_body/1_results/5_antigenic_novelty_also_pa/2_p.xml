<p>We find that antigenic fitness contributes to genotype turnover, although it explains less of the observed variation than for serotypes. As for serotypes, intrinsic fitness alone was unable to predict genotype turnover (
 <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). When antigenic distance is estimated from the ‘interserotype model’, we find that our model of antigenic fitness explains approximately 28.6% of the observed variation in genotype growth rates, and correctly predicts genotype growth vs. decline 66.6% of the time (
