<p>We also observe antigenic heterogeneity at the genotype level. On average, heterotypic genotypes are separated by 6.9 antigenic mutations (or colinear mutation clusters) and 2.18 log

Notably, the titer dataset spans the breadth of canonical DENV genotypes, but in most cases lacks the resolution to detect within-genotype antigenic diversity. We thus expect that these results represent a lowerÂ bound on the true extent of DENV intraserotype antigenic diversity.
