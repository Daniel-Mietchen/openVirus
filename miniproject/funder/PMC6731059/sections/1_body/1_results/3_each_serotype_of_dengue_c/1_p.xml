<p>By linking antigenic change to specific mutations, we are able to estimate unmeasured antigenic distances between any pair of viruses in the dataset based on their genetic differences. As an example, we estimated the antigenic distance between serum raised against each monovalent component of the NIH vaccine candidate and all other viruses in the dataset. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, vaccine-elicited antibodies result in strong homotypic neutralization, but heterotypic cross-neutralization varies widely between specific strains. This has important ramifications for vaccine design and trial evaluation.
