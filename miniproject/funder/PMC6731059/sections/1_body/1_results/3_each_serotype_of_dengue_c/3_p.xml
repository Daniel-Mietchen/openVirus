<p>In summary, we have identified a small number of antigenically relevant mutations that explain most of the observed antigenic heterogeneity in dengue, as indicated by neutralization titers. These mutations occur both between and within serotypes, suggesting that dengue antigenic evolution is an ongoing, although gradual, process. This results in strain-specific and genotype-level antigenic variation, although the scale of this variation is small compared to serotype-level differences. From this, we conclude that there is antigenic variation within each serotype of DENV, and that this is driven by underlying genetic divergence.</p>
