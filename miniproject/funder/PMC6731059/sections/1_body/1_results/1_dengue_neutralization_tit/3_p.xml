<p>The full dataset of standardized titer values is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Here, we see that homotypic virus-serum pairs are more closely related antigenically than heterotypic pairs. However, we also observe large variance around this trend, both within and between serotypes. This suggests that treating each serotype as antigenically uniform potentially overlooks important antigenic heterogeneity across viruses within each serotype.
