 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Katzelnick et al. (2015)</xref> infected naive non-human primates (NHP) with each virus, drew sera at 3 months post-infection, and then titered this sera against a panel of test viruses. To compare patterns of cross-protection in NHP and humans, they also drew sera from 31 study participants 6 weeks after inoculation with a monovalent component of the NIH dengue vaccine candidate. This sera was also titered against a broad panel of DENV viruses. As originally reported, we find generally consistent patterns of neutralization between the NHP and human sera data; see 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Katzelnick et al. (2015)</xref> for a detailed comparison. In total, our dataset consists of 454 NHP sera titers spanning the breadth of DENV diversity, and 728 human sera titers providing deep coverage of a small subset of viruses.
