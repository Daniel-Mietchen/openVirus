<p>Titer measurements are prone to noise, and there is a limited amount of available titer data. If the antigenic heterogeneity observed in the raw data is truly the result of an underlying evolutionary process, we expect that differences in antigenic phenotype correspond to underlying mutations in surface proteins. Dengue has two surface proteins, prM (membrane) and E (envelope). While previous studies have identified epitopes on both prM and E, it is believed that antibodies involved in ADE primarily target prM, while neutralizing antibodies primarily target E (
