<p>This model formulation is an effective tool for estimating antigenic relationships between viruses based on their genetic sequences. On average across cross-validation replicates, this model yields a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.75 when predicting titers relative to their true value (95% CI 0.74–0.77, RMSE), and explains 78% of the observed variation in neutralization titers overall (95% CI 0.77–0.79, Pearson
