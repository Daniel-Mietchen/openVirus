<p>In meaningfully antigenically diverse viral populations, antigenic novelty (relative to standing population immunity) contributes to viral fitness: as a given virus 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="inf42">
   <mi>i</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> circulates in a population, the proportion of the population that is susceptible to infection with 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="inf43">
   <mi>i</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>–and other viruses antigenically similar to 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="inf44">
   <mi>i</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>–decreases over time as more people acquire immunity (

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Wearing and Rohani, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Lourenço and Recker, 2013</xref>). Thus, if antigenic novelty constitutes a fitness advantage for DENV, then we would expect greater antigenic distance from recently circulating viruses to correlate with higher growth rates.
