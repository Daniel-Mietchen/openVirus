<p>From the titer model, we find evidence that homotypic genotypes of DENV vary in their ability to escape antibody neutralization. However, antibody neutralization is only one of many factors that shape epidemic patterns. We investigate whether the observed antigenic diversity influences dengue population dynamics in the real world.</p>
