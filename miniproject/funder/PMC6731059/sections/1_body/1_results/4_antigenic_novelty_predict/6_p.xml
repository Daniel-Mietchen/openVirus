<p>This simple model explains 54.7% of the observed variation in serotype growth rates, and predicts serotype growth vs. decline correctly for 66.0% of predictions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that antigenic fitness is a major driver of serotype population dynamics. This also demonstrates that this model captures key components of dengue population dynamics; examining the formulation of this model in more detail can yield insights into how antigenic relationships influence DENV population composition. The fitness model includes six free parameters that are optimized such that the model most accurately reproduces the observed fluctuations in DENV population composition (minimizing the RMSE of frequency predictions, see Materials and methods). We find that serotype fluctuations are consistent with a model wherein population immunity wanes linearly over time, with the probability of protection dropping by about 63% per year for the first 2 years after primary infection. This model assumes no fundamental difference between homotypic and heterotypic reinfection; rather, homotypic immunity is assumed to wane at the same rate as heterotypic immunity, but starts from a higher baseline of protection based on closer antigenic distances. We also find that these dynamics are best explained by intrinsic fitness that moderately varies by serotype (

 <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and relative strength of antigenic fitness and intrinsic fitness are approximately matched in determining overall serotype fitness.
