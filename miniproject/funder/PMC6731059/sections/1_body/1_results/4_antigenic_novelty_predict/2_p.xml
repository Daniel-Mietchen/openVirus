<p>The size of the viral population (i.e. prevalence, commonly analyzed using SIR models as reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lourenço et al., 2018</xref>) is determined by many complex factors, and reliable values for population prevalence are largely unavailable. Contrastingly, the composition of the viral population (i.e. the relative frequency of each viral clade currently circulating) can be estimated over time by examining historical sequence data (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Neher et al., 2016</xref>), and is primarily driven by viral fitness (
