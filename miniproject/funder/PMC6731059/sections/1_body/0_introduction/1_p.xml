<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which consists of four genetically distinct clades, canonically thought of as serotypes (DENV1 – DENV4) (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al., 1997</xref>). DENV circulates primarily in South America and Southeast Asia, infecting 400 million people annually. Primary DENV infection is more often mild and is thought to generate lifelong homotypic immunity and temporary heterotypic immunity, which typically wanes over 6 months to 2 years (

Thus, the antigenic relationships between dengue viruses — describing whether the immune response generated after primary infection results in protection or enhancement of secondary infection — are key drivers of DENV case outcomes and epidemic patterns.
