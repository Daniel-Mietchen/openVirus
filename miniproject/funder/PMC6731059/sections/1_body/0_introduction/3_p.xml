<p>One explanation for these and similar observations is that overlooked intraserotype antigenic variation contributes to these genotype-specific case outcomes and epidemic patterns. Recent efforts to antigenically characterize diverse DENV viruses suggests that each serotype may contain antigenic heterogeneity, but the source and impact of this heterogeneity is not clear (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Katzelnick et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we characterize the evolutionary basis for observed antigenic heterogeneity among DENV clades. We also quantify the impact of within- and between-serotype antigenic variation on real-world DENV population dynamics.
