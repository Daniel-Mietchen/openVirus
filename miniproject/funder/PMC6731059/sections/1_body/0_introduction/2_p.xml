<p>While each serotype is clearly genetically and antigenically distinct, it is not clear how subserotype clades of DENV interact antigenically. Each DENV serotype consists of broad genetic diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), including canonical clades termed ‘genotypes’ (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Twiddy et al., 2003</xref>). Specific genotypes have been associated with characteristically mild or severe disease, and heterogeneous neutralization titers suggest that the immune response to some genotypes is more cross-protective than others (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Russell and Nisalak, 1967</xref>). Until recently, it has been assumed that these intraserotype differences are minimally important compared to interserotype differences. However, empirical evidence has demonstrated that these genotype-specific differences can drive case outcomes and epidemic severity (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Holmes and Twiddy, 2003</xref>). For example, analysis of a longitudinal cohort study demonstrated that specific combinations of primary infection serotype and secondary infection genotype can mediate individual case outcomes (
