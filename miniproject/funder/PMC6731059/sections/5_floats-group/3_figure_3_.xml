  <title>Antigenic distance from NIH vaccine strains.</title>
  <p>By assigning a discrete increment of antigenic change to each mutation, we can estimate the asymmetrical antigenic distance between any serum strain and test virus strain based on their genetic differences. Here, we show the estimated antigenic distance between serum raised against each monovalent component of the NIH vaccine candidate (indicated as ‘X’) and each test virus in the tree.</p>
