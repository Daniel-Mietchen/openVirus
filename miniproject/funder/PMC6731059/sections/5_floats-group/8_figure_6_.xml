   <bold>A</bold>) Relative frequencies of each canonical dengue genotype across Southeast Asia, estimated from available sequence data. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Antigenic fitness is calculated for each genotype as its frequency-weighted antigenic distance from recently circulating genotypes. We then add this to a time-invariant, serotype-specific intrinsic fitness value to calculate total fitness (shown here, arbitrary units). We assess antigenic distance at either the ‘intergenotype’ or the ‘interserotype’ resolution. In this panel, we show total fitness over time, incorporating estimates of antigenic fitness derived from the ‘intergenotype’ model. (
   <bold>C, D</bold>) Fitness estimates were used to predict clade growth rates over 2 years, compounding immunity every 3 months based on predicted frequency changes (Materials and methods

Here, we compare observed vs. predicted growth rates for both formulations of the fitness model (using fitness derived from either ‘interserotype’ or ‘intergenotype’ antigenic distances). Growth versus decline was accurate (predicted and actual growth rates both
