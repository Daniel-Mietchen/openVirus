<p>At the end of the first paragraph of the Discussion section, authors make reference to DENV4-specific and genotype dependent CYD-TDV efficacies. It isn't clear why only this example is given. E.g. it is important for the reader to know if CYD-TDV efficacies presented no differences between other genotypes, or if these were simply not measured in the trials.</p>
