<p>We wonder if there might be a third hypothesis C. Perhaps the variable cross-reactivity that they see below the serotype level impacts disease severity (as suggested in the case they built up in the introduction) but does not impair infection and subsequent transmission (which are what really have to do with viral fitness that should have been picked up on in the clade dynamics analysis). Recent work by ten Bosch et al. (PloS Pathogens, 2018) estimated that asymptomatic and mild infections are still relatively transmissible compared to more severe infections, which is consistent with this possibility.</p>
