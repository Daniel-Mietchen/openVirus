<p>The first sentence of the Conclusions is an overstatement (an exception compared to the rest of the text, generally fair on the results presented). 'We find that within-sero antigenic evolution is necessary to explain observed patterns of cross-immunity and susceptibility…'- given the results presented, it is not true that it is 'necessary'. Perhaps a fairer statement is that '… evolution helps explain observed patterns of cross-neutralization among genotypes'. Note that cross-immunity and susceptibility are never attempted to be explained.</p>
