<p>Intrinsic fitness differences (estimated values): estimations in Table S1 present significant differences between serotypes. This is not discussed in the main text and it feels like a result that should be supported by previous work. For example, are there in vitro, in vivo or population-based measures suggesting that intrinsic fitness follows the general rule DENV1 &gt;= DENV2 &gt;&gt; DENV3 &gt;&gt; DENV4?</p>
