<p>NHP versus human data: Figure 2 presents the data for 3-month post infection of NHPs. Just before the figure, this NHP data set is explained (linked to Figure 1A), but human data is also mentioned. As far as I understand the human data set is not included in this study? This is only clear when checking Figure 1A.</p>
