<p>The research in this manuscript describes and tries to understand immunity to / of genetic variants (genotypes) of dengue serotypes. Critically, I believe that the main questions addressed in this study could be the answer to puzzles yet to be solved on the population biology and epidemiology of dengue viruses. The results presented could not fully measure / discern the population-level impact of the newly identified 12 antigenic phenotypes versus the canonical 4, but it should motivate the community to pursue this important line of research. I found the article well written, with clear presentation of results and method explanation. I am generally happy with the results and inclined to agree with what has been demonstrated. Although I feel the results are of general interest to 
 <italic>eLife</italic> readers, a wider discussion should take place on whether the manuscript is, methodologically and / or relating to data, offering enough to fit the remit of the journal. I have some specific comments, mainly related to waning, intrinsic fitness, and data / method details that I ask to be addressed by the authors.
