<p>From the methods it seems that empirical clade frequencies were estimated from the phylogeny in Figure 1 (although not explicit), which is from a subsample (N=2563) of the entire database (N=12649). Should the frequencies be estimated from the largest set? This is important in the context of conclusion / discussion that (future) 'richer datasets' may help fill in the gaps of this study. Please clarify if only the smallest set was used and why using the largest would not have changed results of Figure 6A and Figure 7A.</p>
