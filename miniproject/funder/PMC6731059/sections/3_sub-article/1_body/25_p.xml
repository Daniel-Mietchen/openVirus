<p>First, it should be noted that the basis for this analysis was a reconstruction of serotype and genotype dynamics estimated through an approach that made use of the number of lineages of a given type at each time point in the time series. Although clever, a major limitation of such an approach is that the estimated dynamics of the different types could be extremely sensitive to which samples were used to estimate the phylogeny; e.g., more samples of a given type at different times could lead to different results, and there is no guarantee that the samples were collected in some sort of representative fashion. Sampling issues such as these are major issues for many phylogenetic analyses, and I see no reason why this analysis would be exempt from that type of concern. Although there are precious few data sets that can be used to inform historical patterns of dengue serotypes, there are some based on clinical incidence that could at least be used as an independent comparison against the historical dynamics reconstructed here. Were there to be some level of agreement between these estimates of historical patterns of dengue serotypes, that could help assuage some of these concerns about sampling issues to at least some extent. One possibility is a data set from Thailand described in Reich et al.,(2013).</p>
