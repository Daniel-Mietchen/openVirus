<p>In this manuscript, Bell and colleagues analyze titer measurements from a non-human primate study and a monovalent vaccine study in humans to determine (a) whether and to what extent antigenic variation is present within dengue's 4 serotypes, DENV 1-4; and (b) whether the within-serotype antigenic variation that they find contributes to/is informative of dengue virus population dynamics. The presented work uses a number of different approaches that have been previously developed elsewhere and applied mostly to influenza viruses. By applying these approaches to dengue, Bell and colleagues find evidence for within-serotype antigenic differences. These intra-serotypic antigenic differences, however, do not appear to provide better predictive power in terms of dengue's population dynamics.</p>
