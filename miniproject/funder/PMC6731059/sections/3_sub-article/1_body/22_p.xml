<p>The manuscript by Bell et al., performs analyses that seek to describe the structure of antigenic variation in dengue virus and to demonstrate its significance for epidemiological dynamics. The analysis of epidemiological dynamics is performed on data from Southeast Asia and considers antigenic groupings at the level of conventional serotype designations for dengue virus and also at one level below that, which are the same as conventional dengue virus genotype groupings and come out to three antigenically distinct groups below the level of each serotype. The latter set of groupings is supported by analyses presented here. One pair of these groupings below the level of serotype are consistent with a limited set of findings from dengue vaccine trials about differential efficacy by DENV-4 genotype. In terms of the influence of the antigenic groupings identified here on epidemiological dynamics, the authors found support for conventional serotype groupings being associated with patterns of serotype turnover across years. Below the level of conventional serotypes, results about the influence of antigenic groupings on epidemiological dynamics were more equivocal.</p>
