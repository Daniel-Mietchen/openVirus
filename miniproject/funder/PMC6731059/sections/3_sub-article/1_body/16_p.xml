<p>1) I think the authors do a good job at convincing the reader that there is antigenic variation present within dengue serotypes. However, is there already evidence for this finding based on Katzelnick's previous work using antigenic maps? If so, why is this finding novel here? I understand that a different (phylogeny-based) approach is used here, and that, for several reasons, this phylogenetic approach might be preferable over an antigenic map approach. Are the key biological results the same across these studies, though? More text on this is necessary to convince the reader that this work constitutes a major, novel result.</p>
