<p>Second, there are two sets of results that derive from this analysis. The first is at the level of serotype, and it shows that antigenic novelty is associated with short-term changes in relative frequencies of serotypes. The second is at the level of the twelve antigenic groupings identified in the first portion of this manuscript, and it shows that resolution in antigenic variation below the level of conventional serotypes does not provide any additional power to explain short-term changes in relative frequencies of these sub-serotype groupings. In terms of the significance and implications of these two results, the first seems consistent with existing knowledge of dengue virus serotype dynamics, and the second leaves the hypothesis that sub-serotype antigenic variation affects epidemiological dynamics either unresolved (if you assume there was too much noise for this approach to work) or perhaps even refuted (if you assume that this was a fair test of that hypothesis). In light of the issues raised in my first comment about this analysis (among others), my interpretation is that there was simply not enough of a signal in the sub-serotype data to come to any firm conclusion one way or another. Truthfully, I would prefer for an analysis such as this to not even be attempted without greater confidence going into it that a valid result could be obtained (which could be demonstrated through simulation studies, for example).</p>
