<p>5) Subsection “Antigenic evolution occurs within serotypes: inference of db/lasso regression. Instead of showing Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1, could you just show the phylogeny again (e.g. Figure 1A), with all non-zero db values that were inferred labeled on the tree? This would be a nicer, more clear visualization, I think. Along with this, could you add a table that contains, for every branch that carries a non-zero db value, the list of amino acid changes that were inferred on that branch? This should be easily do-able using Nextstrain, and it would be informative. If many of the branches with inferred non-zero db values havs no amino acid changes in env, this would also indicate possible issues with the results.</p>
