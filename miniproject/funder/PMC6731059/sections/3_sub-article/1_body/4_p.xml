<p>In this manuscript, Bell and colleagues analyse antibody titer measurements from a non-human primate study and a monovalent vaccine study in humans to determine (a) whether and to what extent antigenic variation is present within dengue's 4 serotypes, DENV 1-4; and (b) whether the within-serotype antigenic variation that they find contributes to/is informative of dengue virus population dynamics.</p>
