<p>Waning immunity: In the context of Figure 6, with genetic resolution and antigenic resolution at serotype and interserotype (respectively, Table S1), waning immunity (γ) can be interpreted as serotype-associated temporary transcending immunity. This is, I assume, why the estimation of fast waning makes biological sense. But in that case, I ask the authors to clarify what the interpretation of γ should be when the genetic resolution is genotype (and antigenic resolution is either interserotype or full tree; note that Table S1 has γ fixed across all models). From the definition of expression 7, does it imply that between genotype waning is as fast as between serotype waning? If so, waning exists at all (data) resolutions and is generally both transcending and temporary? This feels like a major result, but it is not discussed.</p>
