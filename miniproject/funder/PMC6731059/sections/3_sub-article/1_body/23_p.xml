<p>The approach used to define antigenic groupings has a direct correspondence to genetic groupings obtained through phylogenetic analysis. The estimation of how antigenic profile evolved along this phylogeny was then performed secondarily, with rates of antigenic evolution on different branches allowed to vary such that antigenic distances between available sample pairs could then be explained by summing rates of antigenic evolution across the lineages separating a given pair. This approach yielded the strongest results of the manuscript, which show that the inferred patterns of antigenic evolution along the dengue virus phylogeny explain a considerable amount of variation in antigenic distances among sample pairs (Pearson correlation = 0.86). Interestingly, this result compares favorably to a related analysis that limited antigenic evolution up to the point of the most recent common ancestor of each serotype (Pearson correlation = 0.79). As the authors acknowledge, most antigenic variation is still explained by conventional serotype groupings, but that is to be expected. And there is still a considerable amount of variation explained below the level of serotype. The use of 10-fold cross-validation is a notable strength of this analysis.</p>
