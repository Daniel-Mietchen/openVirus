<p>“Our primary model parameterization assumes that both heterotypic and homotypic immunity wane linearly over time at the same rate, with homotypic immunity starting from a higher baseline of protection based on closer antigenic distances. We compared this to a secondary model parameterization with only heterotypic waning (see Materials and methods), under which we observe similar model performance (Table 2).”</p>
