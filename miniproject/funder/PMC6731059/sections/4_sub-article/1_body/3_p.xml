<p>As described in the cover letter, this suggestion was particularly fruitful; thank you! We now map antigenic change to substitutions, instead of branches in the phylogeny. We identify 49 specific substitutions and four colinear substitution clusters that are antigenically relevant. We report these substitutions and the magnitude of their contributions to antigenic change in Table S1 and visualize these mutations and their magnitude in new Figure 2. As described in the cover letter, properly addressing mutations lead us to switch to a “substitution” model rather than a “tree” model as primary model to estimate antigenic distances from titer data. Switching to the substitution model improved model fit over tree model (Table S2).</p>
