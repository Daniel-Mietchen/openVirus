 <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
 <p>In this manuscript, Bell and colleagues analyze titer measurements from a non-human primate study and a monovalent vaccine study in humans to determine (a) whether and to what extent antigenic variation is present within dengue's 4 serotypes, DENV 1-4; and (b) whether the within-serotype antigenic variation that they find contributes to/is informative of dengue virus population dynamics. The presented work uses a number of different approaches that have been previously developed elsewhere and applied mostly to influenza viruses. By applying these approaches to dengue, Bell and colleagues find evidence for within-serotype antigenic differences. These intra-serotypic antigenic differences, however, do not appear to provide better predictive power in terms of dengue's population dynamics.</p>
 <p>Specific comments:</p>
 <p>1) I think the authors do a good job at convincing the reader that there is antigenic variation present within dengue serotypes. However, is there already evidence for this finding based on Katzelnick's previous work using antigenic maps? If so, why is this finding novel here? I understand that a different (phylogeny-based) approach is used here, and that, for several reasons, this phylogenetic approach might be preferable over an antigenic map approach. Are the key biological results the same across these studies, though? More text on this is necessary to convince the reader that this work constitutes a major, novel result.</p>
