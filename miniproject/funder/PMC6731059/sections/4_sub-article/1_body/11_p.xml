<p>This was a very helpful suggestion. We seeded a simulation with two years of empirical serotype frequencies and then simulated forward to generate frequency values over the remainder of the time course. We then fit parameters to this simulated data as described in the Materials and methods section and were able to recover the true input parameters (Table 2, Figure 5â€”figure supplement 1).</p>
