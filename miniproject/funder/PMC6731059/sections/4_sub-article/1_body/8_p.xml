<p>As evident in the time series plots, we see generally good concordance between the two measures, although there are some time periods where our estimated frequencies do not capture all of the dengue diversity circulating (e.g., this metric ‘misses’ the early 1990s Bangkok outbreak of dengue 4 that is suggested by the case counts). We believe this is primarily due to the mismatch in sampling frame, where some of the hyperlocal transmission within Bangkok is not captured by the country-level comparison dataset.</p>
