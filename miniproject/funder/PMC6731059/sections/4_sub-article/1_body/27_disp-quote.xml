 <p>3) The authors conclude that between-serotype antigenic differences are important for accurately predicting dengue dynamics, but that incorporating within-serotype antigenic variation does not provide greater prediction accuracy. Since the differences in the intrinsic fitness values of the 4 serotypes are very large (Table S1 and Figure 6), to demonstrate convincingly that antigenic differences at the between-serotype level matter, I think what must be shown is the prediction accuracy under the assumption of no antigenic variation at all. From Figure 6, it seems that intrinsic fitness differences between the 4 serotypes might account for the overwhelming majority of prediction accuracy. The authors provide a null model with no intrinsic fitness differences in the supplemental section (equations 16-19), but never report on the findings of this null model, as far as I can see. Including it in Table S1, and in text in the main manuscript, I think is important.</p>
