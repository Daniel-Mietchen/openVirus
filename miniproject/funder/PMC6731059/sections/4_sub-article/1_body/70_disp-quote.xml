 <p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p>
 <p>Title</p>
 <p>The title must be revised. It focuses on the portion of your analysis having to do with viral clade dynamics, and the content of the statement made in this title is only supported at the serotype level. By focusing on this portion of their results – which in our opinion is secondary in its significance compared to the rest about the genetics underlying antigenic differences etc. – and not including words such as "at the serotype level". This title has great potential to be very misleading and widely misunderstood.</p>
