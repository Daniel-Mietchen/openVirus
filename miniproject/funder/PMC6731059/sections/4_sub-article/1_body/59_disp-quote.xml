 <p>Intrinsic fitness differences (necessity of): the authors include the possibility of (model) intrinsic fitness differences between the serotypes. This is a reasonable assumption given the clear differences observed in empirical clade frequencies (Figure 6A), which generally follow the rule of 'success' in order DENV1 &gt;= DENV2 &gt;&gt; DENV3 &gt;&gt; DENV4 (in fact, I believe this is an ubiquitous world trend). I would like to suggest to the authors an alternative / complementary factor that arises from the results presented (Figure 5, Figure 5â€”figure supplement 1). It seems that antigenic phenotypes of DENV4 are the most closely related, followed by DENV3, and DENV1-2 (visually, from branch distances between them). Could this be hinting on the fact that the higher success (empirical clade frequencies) of DENV1-2 is related to the fact that clades can more easily co-circulate given that herd-immunity escape is 'easier'? (in other words, reinfection with DENV1-2 genotypes is more common). In contrast, DENV4 would be less successful, because any clade will find high resistance to transmission (herd-immunity from other clades / antigenic phenotypes). I think it is important for the authors to consider this possibility, since the current assumption / estimation of very high differences in intrinsic fitness between serotypes may not be supported by the literature (see my other comment on Intrinsic fitness differences).</p>
