 <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
 <p>The manuscript by Bell et al., performs analyses that seek to describe the structure of antigenic variation in dengue virus and to demonstrate its significance for epidemiological dynamics. The analysis of epidemiological dynamics is performed on data from Southeast Asia and considers antigenic groupings at the level of conventional serotype designations for dengue virus and also at one level below that, which are the same as conventional dengue virus genotype groupings and come out to three antigenically distinct groups below the level of each serotype. The latter set of groupings is supported by analyses presented here. One pair of these groupings below the level of serotype are consistent with a limited set of findings from dengue vaccine trials about differential efficacy by DENV-4 genotype. In terms of the influence of the antigenic groupings identified here on epidemiological dynamics, the authors found support for conventional serotype groupings being associated with patterns of serotype turnover across years. Below the level of conventional serotypes, results about the influence of antigenic groupings on epidemiological dynamics were more equivocal.</p>
 <p>The approach used to define antigenic groupings has a direct correspondence to genetic groupings obtained through phylogenetic analysis. The estimation of how antigenic profile evolved along this phylogeny was then performed secondarily, with rates of antigenic evolution on different branches allowed to vary such that antigenic distances between available sample pairs could then be explained by summing rates of antigenic evolution across the lineages separating a given pair. This approach yielded the strongest results of the manuscript, which show that the inferred patterns of antigenic evolution along the dengue virus phylogeny explain a considerable amount of variation in antigenic distances among sample pairs (Pearson correlation = 0.86). Interestingly, this result compares favorably to a related analysis that limited antigenic evolution up to the point of the most recent common ancestor of each serotype (Pearson correlation = 0.79). As the authors acknowledge, most antigenic variation is still explained by conventional serotype groupings, but that is to be expected. And there is still a considerable amount of variation explained below the level of serotype. The use of 10-fold cross-validation is a notable strength of this analysis.</p>
 <p>The other major component of the results pertained to the influence of antigenic evolution on epidemiological dynamics.</p>
 <p>First, it should be noted that the basis for this analysis was a reconstruction of serotype and genotype dynamics estimated through an approach that made use of the number of lineages of a given type at each time point in the time series. Although clever, a major limitation of such an approach is that the estimated dynamics of the different types could be extremely sensitive to which samples were used to estimate the phylogeny; e.g., more samples of a given type at different times could lead to different results, and there is no guarantee that the samples were collected in some sort of representative fashion. Sampling issues such as these are major issues for many phylogenetic analyses, and I see no reason why this analysis would be exempt from that type of concern. Although there are precious few data sets that can be used to inform historical patterns of dengue serotypes, there are some based on clinical incidence that could at least be used as an independent comparison against the historical dynamics reconstructed here. Were there to be some level of agreement between these estimates of historical patterns of dengue serotypes, that could help assuage some of these concerns about sampling issues to at least some extent. One possibility is a data set from Thailand described in Reich et al., (2013).</p>
