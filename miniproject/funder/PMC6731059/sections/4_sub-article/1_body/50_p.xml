<p>The reviewer is correct that our primary model assumes no fundamental difference between homotypic reinfection and heterotypic reinfection; everything is based on PRNT titer, wherein homotypic infections tend to be more antigenically similar than heterotypic infections according to PRNT. Our model of waning would indeed imply that homotypic waning is as fast as heterotypic waning but starts from a higher baseline of immunity. This is consistent with dynamics reported in (Katzelnick ​et al.​, ​2018, Figure 1C).</p>
