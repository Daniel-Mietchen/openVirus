<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s contribution of suggested wording and their preservation of sentence structure. However, we thought it was unclear whether “serotype-level” modified “antigenic fitness” or “clade frequencies,” and have slightly modified the suggested wording throughout. We appreciate and welcome any further suggestions.</p>
