 <p>Summary:</p>
 <p>In this manuscript, Bell and colleagues analyse antibody titer measurements from a non-human primate study and a monovalent vaccine study in humans to determine (a) whether and to what extent antigenic variation is present within dengue's 4 serotypes, DENV 1-4; and (b) whether the within-serotype antigenic variation that they find contributes to/is informative of dengue virus population dynamics.</p>
 <p>Essential revisions:</p>
 <p>First half of manuscript:</p>
 <p>1) Demonstrate more effectively that the within-serotype antigenic differences are robust by: a) performing the analysis on each of the two datasets separately, indicating whether and to what extent the antigenic differences found by each of the two datasets are consistent with one another;</p>
