<p>No, these are separate parameters. Virus avidity and serum potency are parameters modulating antigenic similarity between strains, separate from intrinsic fitness which affects clade success outside of antigenicity. Additionally, the ‘row and column’ effects from the first half of the paper correspond to the overall viral avidity and serum potency of specific ​

 <italic>serotypes</italic>​. We apologize for the lack of clarity, and have updated the text accordingly.
