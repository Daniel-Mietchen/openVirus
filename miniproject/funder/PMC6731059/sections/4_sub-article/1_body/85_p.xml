<p>First, it may be that although genotypes are antigenically diverse, these differences do not influence large-scale regional dynamics over time. We may then hypothesize that within-serotype antigenic heterogeneity mediates disease severity, but does not influence infection or onward transmission. This hypothesis is consistent with the findings of \citet{nagao2008decreases}, who demonstrated that dengue epidemiological dynamics are compatible with a model wherein immunity confers protection against severe symptoms, but not asymptomatic infection. This is also consistent with \citet{tenBosch2018contributions}'s findings that asymptomatic dengue infections contribute to onward transmission.‚Äù</p>
