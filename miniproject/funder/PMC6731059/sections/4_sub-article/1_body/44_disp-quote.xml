 <p>The authors refer to using sequences with 'full coding sequence of E'. It is not clear to me if this means that phylogenies are based solely on ENV? (not full genome?). If so, authors should defend this decision and potentially discuss implications.</p>
 <p>It’s important that credit is given to studies that have previously suggested that 'the null hypothesis of antigenically uniform serotypes is inconsistent with observed patterns of cross-protection and susceptibility…' (in Discussion). The authors refer to previous study Katzelnick et al., 2015 only, but others exist, e.g. Forshey et al., 2016; Waggoner et al., 2016.</p>
