<p>For both serotypes and genotypes, we now also report model performance under two null formulations. In the ‘equal fitness null’ model, all clades are assigned equal total fitness. In the ‘intrinsic fitness null’, clade fitness is determined only by intrinsic fitness. As shown in Table S3, these null models all have higher prediction error than the antigenically-informed model for both serotypes and genotypes. These null models are particularly poor at predicting clade growth rates, with R
 <sup>2</sup>​ ​ ≤ 0.04. From this, it is clear that intrinsic fitness alone is a poor predictor of serotype and genotype population dynamics.
