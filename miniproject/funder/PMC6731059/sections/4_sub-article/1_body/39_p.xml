<p>We’ve tried to be as ​
 <italic>honest</italic>​ as possible with our attempt to tackle within-serotype dengue heterogeneity. We believe that there are real PRNT differences between genotypes within a serotype, where we have extended Katzelnick et al., (2015) results in showing an agreement between titers and genetic relations among viruses. We did our best to construct a model of clade dynamics that incorporates antigenic relationships. We believe presenting the null result here (caveated as it is) is the most honest thing we can do in this situation. But we agree there’s ample opportunity to improve a fitness model of clade dynamics. We’ve provided all source code in effort to encourage other groups to attempt this.
