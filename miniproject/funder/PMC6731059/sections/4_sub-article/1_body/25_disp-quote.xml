 <p>2) The authors infer antigenic distances based on two very different datasets: a non-human primate dataset and a human dataset. The NHP dataset uses experimental challenges with DENV, with sera being drawn 3 months post-infection. The human dataset uses sera from a monovalent vaccine study, with sera drawn after 6 weeks. Due to the difference in host species, time at which sera are drawn, and the identity of the virus (vaccine strain vs. unattenuated strain), it would be interesting to infer the antigenic relationships for each dataset separately and compare across the datasets using the phylogeny-based approach. Consistent findings across the two datasets would substantiate the results. I recognize that Katzelnick et al., 2015 compared these datasets, but they did not use the phylogeny-based approach.</p>
