<p>“Overall, we find that antigenic fitness explains a moderate portion of the observed variation in genotype growth and decline. Surprisingly, however, we find that incorporating within-serotype antigenic differences does not improve our predictions (Figure 6C-D). This suggests that although genotypes are antigenically diverse, these differences do not appear to influence large-scale regional dynamics over time. This lack of signal could be explained by either (A) genotype- level frequency trajectories estimated from public data are overly noisy for this application or (B) our model of antigenic fitness based on PRNT assay data does not match reality, due to either PRNT assay data not well reflecting human immunity or due to our particular model formulation that parameterizes immunity from titer distances (Eq. 6–9). In the present analysis, we are not able to firmly resolve these disparate possibilities.”</p>
