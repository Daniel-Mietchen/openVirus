<p>This is an interesting hypothesis! We noticed the same trend in empirical clade frequencies. We believe this hypothesis makes intuitive sense, given what we observe in new Figure 4, where DENV2 has the most within serotype diversity. Although weâ€™d note that DENV1 and DENV3 appear similar to have similar amount of within serotype antigenic diversity as DENV4 according to PRNT titers. More importantly, the fitness model provides exactly this possibility. Differences in antigenic phenotype among DENV2 genotypes should promote coexistence. This can be seen in new Figure 5 where the spike in DENV2 Asian I frequency in 1994 does not uniformly crash DENV2 fitness across genotypes. But despite this, we still observe improved model performance when including a serotype-specific fitness effect.</p>
