<p>The reviewer is correct that the original publication of this dataset also reported some degree of within-serotype antigenic heterogeneity. However, the models presented here add additional evidence that this observed antigenic heterogeneity is the result of an underlying evolutionary process, rather than technical noise, and that these antigenic dynamics have a significant impact on dengue evolution and population turnover. We also report a parsimonious list of substitutions that measurably impact dengue antigenic phenotypes.</p>
