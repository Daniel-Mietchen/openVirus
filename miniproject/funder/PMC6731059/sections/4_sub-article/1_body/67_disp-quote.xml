 <p>In Figure 5, the antigenic phenotypes of sequences in Figure 1 are presented. It seems that some of the genotypes in Figure 1 are missing in the legend of Figure 5. For instance, DENV2 ASIANI, ASIANII, DENV1 II, DENV1 IV, DENV4III, etc. I understand that antigenically uniform clades have been collapsed, but the legend should include all original genotypes. Also, DENV4 sylvatic is stated, but its use and / or results associated with it have not been mentioned elsewhere in the text?</p>
