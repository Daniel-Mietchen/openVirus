<p>We thank reviewer #2 for helpfully pointing us to the case count dataset from Reich ​et al.,2013, which consists of serotype-specific biweekly case counts for a children’s hospital in Bangkok from 1973–2010. We binned these counts into quarterly timepoints to estimate the proportion of reported cases per serotype, per quarter from 1975–2010.</p>
