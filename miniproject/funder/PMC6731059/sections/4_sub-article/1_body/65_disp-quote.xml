 <p>NHP dataset: the original data set in Katzelnick et al., 2015 (Table S4) appears to contain a larger number of sera and virus entries than presented in Figure 2 (I believe S4 is the correct dataset?). These are the discrepancies I found for virus (rows): DENV2 13 versus 16 (Figure 2, Table S4, respectively), DENV3 8 verus 9, DENV 4 9 versus 11. For sera (columns): DENV1 6 versus 8 (Figure 2, Table S4, respectively), DENV2 9 versus 12, DENV4 7 versus 8. Please clarify if I got this wrong, or if some of the data was not used in the current study.</p>
