<p>This raises a key question of whether the identified antigenic differences between dengue viruses are relevant only for infection of non-human primates. While we agree it would be interesting to do a head-to-head comparison between the results from each dataset independently, the human dataset consists of only four serum strains. This does not provide sufficient resolution to map antigenic change to specific substitutions or branches based on the human data alone. To address the underlying question of whether these antigenic differences are species-specific, we instead examine the error distribution of out-of-sample titer predictions, stratified by serum species (Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1). If these inferred antigenic differences were driven by one host species, we would expect to see systematic differences in predictive power between serum isolated from each species. We observe comparable prediction error for both species, suggesting that these differences in viral antigenic phenotype are independent of host species and serum from both human and NHP fit equally well into a joint model.</p>
