<p>Capturing data to inform all Cascade indicators is challenging and involves aggregation of clinical data up to the national level. This requires a mechanism for centralization of data and consistency between data collection methods across multiple programs. Two supply-side intervention models to improve HIV testing uptake, diagnosis, and enrollment in care, specifically through increasing numbers of PWID reached and tested, were presented from Vietnam. In urban areas, the “Fansipan Challenge” model recruited opiate substitution therapy clients, most of whom inject, to bring friends or sexual partners for HIV testing, and those testing positive to be enrolled in care and treatment. This model rewards clients for each referral completing testing and subsequent referrals with points and phone credit, structured as a contest to climb Fansipan, Vietnam’s highest mountain [

For rural areas, a direct referral model was tested in mountainous provinces near the Lao border, where drug trafficking and injecting use are common and care and treatment commensurately low. This model offers hamlet health worker incentives for successful referral for mobile and facility-based HIV counseling and testing, identification of HIV-positive individuals, and re-engaging known HIV patients who were lost to care. In both models, unique identifiers were used to track individuals across the HIV Cascade, and questionnaires included more questions (picture-based) on high-risk behaviors to provide meaningful SI contributions.
