<p>One way to ensure collaboration is to improve the capacity of community-based, constituency-led organizations to: engage in survey data collection, analysis, and dissemination; documentation; and monitoring and evaluation. A successful example of this principle in practice is the 
 <italic>Persaudaraan Korban Napza Indonesia</italic> (PKNI)/Indonesian Drug User Network. Beginning in 2007, PKNI, in collaboration with Oxford University, initiated 
 <italic>Perempuan Bersuara</italic>/“Women Speak Out,” a cross-sectional study among approximately 700 females who inject drugs to investigate factors associated with HIV risk among this subgroup. PKNI established a community advisory group comprising females who inject drugs to inform questionnaire design and guide ethical and operational study aspects. The community-led team received ongoing capacity building in research methods and data interpretation from researchers, allowing them to develop marketable skills and knowledge while playing a significant role in the study’s implementation. This collaborative approach resulted in a strong sense of community ownership of the research and active participation from female respondents in the project.
