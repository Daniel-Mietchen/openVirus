<p>To reach 90-90-90 goals, SI systems for PWID need to move to a “treatment-oriented” approach, increasing the value of case-based reporting and following cases through the HIV Cascade. Case-based reporting raises confidentiality concerns as reporting requires following individuals “through the system” and necessitates the use of unique identifiers. Another option for obtaining data for monitoring the HIV Cascade is to use programmatic harm reduction data. However, program data does not perfectly overlap with HIV Cascade indicators; for example, HIV testing may occur within harm reduction programs, but care and treatment services are provided at separate sites with no formal data linkage to allow follow-up through the Cascade. Double counting is also an issue, which could be overcome by using unique identifiers and recall of last testing site and date, with attendant confidentiality concerns.</p>
