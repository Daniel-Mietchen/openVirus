<p>Injecting drug use is the most efficient mode of transmitting HIV and viral hepatitis, and people who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately affected by HIV because of behaviors influenced by individual, network, and structural factors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, stigma and criminalization of drug use and the attendant difficulty measuring these factors confound efforts to compile much-needed HIV epidemiologic data among PWID, including prevalence, testing frequency, and, for PWID diagnosed with HIV, transition into care and treatment retention [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This lack of strategic information (SI)—defined as the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of information to optimize programming—hinders our ability to design effective programming interventions for, and address the needs of, PWID. Deficiencies in SI and attendant weaker programming will likely impede progress toward the UNAIDS “90-90-90” targets by 2020, which are that 90 % of all people living with HIV (PLHIV) will know their HIV status, 90 % of all PLHIV will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90 % of those receiving ART will have achieved viral suppression [
