<p>This meeting also included four small group discussions on gaps related to and recommendations for SI collection for four content areas. TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes key gaps and recommendations. Topics assigned to each group did not allow for frequent overlap in recommendations, but several key themes were present from all groups. These themes included the following: (1) the need for integration of Cascade indicators into PWID programming, potentially with merged harm reduction and HIV management services; (2) expanding the role of peers within the PWID community to improve testing coverage; (3) linkages to and retention in care; and (4) respectful SI collection and interpretation.
