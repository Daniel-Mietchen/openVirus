    <td rowspan="5">Identifying, reaching, and testing people who inject drugs (PWID)</td>
    <td>● Populations of females who inject drugs are underrepresented</td>
    <td>● Programs should also be able to identify emerging risk behaviors; they could gather information in both formal and informal ways</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Population size estimates are not accurate</td>
    <td>● Separate Cascades would allow data collectors to capture subgroups within the larger PWID groups</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Delays in estimating population size within surveys are slowing testing and uptake because services are not provided where PWID are located</td>
    <td>● Use programs more strategically for data collection along the Cascade</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">● Reach of programs depends on political and legal environments. There is limited information from closed settings, such as prisons</td>
    <td>● Use peer educators and PWID drop-in centers for care and support</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Link with hospitals and other treatment sites for referrals</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td rowspan="5">2</td>
    <td rowspan="5">Testing PWID and enrolling them in care and treatment</td>
    <td>● Limited data on how many PWID living with HIV are actually in care and treatment</td>
    <td>● Community-based testing should be scaled up</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Lack of linkages between PWID-focused programming and HIV care and treatment programming</td>
    <td>● Scale up the use of HIV rapid tests using oral fluid samples, which are more convenient and preferable to most people</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Stigma and discrimination prevent members of key populations from seeking testing services</td>
    <td>● Periodically test MMT clients for HIV when they receive their methadone</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Challenges in ensuring anonymity when tracking people along the Cascade</td>
    <td>● Use a mix of different approaches, different entry points into the Cascade in SI collection</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● The testing service delivery model could be more targeted</td>
    <td>● Mix program and surveillance, community support, and case management</td>

    <td rowspan="5">3</td>
    <td rowspan="5">Gaps in strategic information; challenges and solutions for retention of PWIDs in care and treatment</td>
    <td>● Uneven coverage of drug dependence treatment and OST</td>
    <td>● Integrated MMT and ART services</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Uneven coverage of peer/family/social support</td>
    <td>● Establish models of peer-administered ART delivery or limited peer-peer interventions to improve adherence</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Difficult to disaggregate data by risk behavior or key population group</td>
    <td>● Ask clinicians to collect risk group/behavior status</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● Information by risk group is not used to inform the Cascade</td>
    <td rowspan="2">● In IBBS/surveys, include biomarkers for ART use in testing and data collection to inform ART uptake and viral suppression pillars within the Cascade</td>
   </tr>

    <td>● Lack of data on reasons for loss to follow-up and on mortality</td>

    <td rowspan="5">4</td>
    <td rowspan="5">Respectful approaches to data collection</td>
    <td>● “Respectful” can mean different things to different people</td>
    <td>● Protect PWID identities through encryption and unique identifier codes</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● There are different clearance requirements for different countries</td>
    <td>● Adopt the human rights framework for SI activities</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● The meaning of community can vary, and this can challenge how PWID communities are integrated in data collection</td>
    <td>● Consider the community-based participatory research framework</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>● It can be difficult to guarantee anonymity</td>
    <td>● Ensure that services are available for the kinds of problems that are being investigated. For example, needle distribution and MMT programming should be identified before initiating a study that intends to refer participants to these services upon request</td>
