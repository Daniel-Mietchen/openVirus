<p>In our trial, local vector control staff deployed and maintained PPF DSs, with the research team providing initial training and nearly continuous supervisionâ€”in which we monitored, but did not interfere with, PPF dissemination or DS maintenance. This led to some operational problems, including failure to maintain or deploy some DSs as scheduled (mainly due to lack of fuel for reaching the more distant northwestern city sector) and suboptimal PPF grinding (see

This suggests that operational problems had little impact on overall intervention effects, and hence that the strategy may work under the constraints of real-life vector control efforts. In practical terms, the most relevant obstacle was that the PPF we used is formulated as coarse sand-like granules that had to be manually ground to talc-like powder; this was time-consuming and yielded dust particles of variable, unknown size. In preparation for larger-scale trials, we are using mechanical micronizers to get PPF dust of standardized particle size.
