<p>In this study we have shown that a sharp citywide decrease in mosquito vector populations followed the application of a low-technology tactic based on mosquito-disseminated PPF in a tropical town. Population declines were observed for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., two foremost vectors of human disease, and for 
 <italic>Limatus</italic> spp. The 95%â€“96% reduction in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> female emergence we report has the potential of blocking arbovirus transmission under scenarios ranging from somewhat optimistic to overtly adverse. The control of urban 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. could have similar effects on the spread of important pathogens ranging from West Nile virus to lymphatic filariae; 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. might in addition transmit Zika virus [

 <italic>Limatus</italic> populations has less clear public health implications, but several bunyaviruses capable of infecting mammals have been isolated from mosquitoes of this day-biting genus in Amazonia [
