<p>Our findings suggest that mosquito-disseminated PPF could be particularly relevant for the control of epidemic outbreaks such as those seen when Zika, dengue, or chikungunya virus sweeps through immunologically naïve populations. Given partial herd immunity, the more stable endemic-epidemic transmission of, for example, dengue in many countries [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] would be even easier to interrupt. We note, in addition, that some of the parameter values used in our calculations (
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) probably exceed typical real values; in fact, our baseline 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimates are higher than those reported for dengue epidemics in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Daily death rates of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> females, for example, have been estimated as 
 <italic>μ</italic> ≈ 0.2–0.4 in Brazil and Puerto Rico [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. If, moreover, PPF reduces the lifespan of female

 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], this would further increase 
 <italic>μ</italic>. Using 
 <italic>μ</italic> = 0.3 instead of 0.1, our models suggest that

 <sub>0</sub> would be brought to &lt;1.0 for 9 mo under the worst-case scenario—and for 6 mo even assuming three times as many emerging females as observed (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002213.s004">S3</xref>). Further, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> infectivity (parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> in 
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) is probably lower, on average, than we assumed in our calculations (see, e.g., [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] for Zika virus). Thus, in general, our models likely underestimate the potential intervention effects on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. This suggests that mosquito-disseminated PPF might block arbovirus transmission citywide even under very adverse circumstances—an entirely susceptible population, long-lasting viremias, frequent mosquito biting, short extrinsic incubation periods, and high probabilities of virus transmission from vector to human and vice versa (
