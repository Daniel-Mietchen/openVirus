<p>Here we have shown, in summary, that mosquito-disseminated PPF has the potential to become a major tool for urban mosquito control and, consequently, for the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases. These findings might be equally relevant for rapidly spreading emerging arboviral infections, including Zika and chikungunya, and for better-established endemic pathogens, including dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Cluster-randomized, multi-site controlled trials are now necessary to provide stronger evidence for (or against) these hypotheses [
