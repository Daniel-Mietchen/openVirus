<p>Each month, we set four sentinel breeding sites (SBSs; two per survey) in each surveillance dwelling. SBSs were 580-ml dark-brown plastic cups containing 400 ml of tap water; they were retrieved after 5–6 d of operation, and their contents kept in the laboratory as previously described [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We then recorded (a) the number of juvenile mosquitoes developing or dying in each SBS and (b) the number of adult mosquitoes emerging from each SBS. These data allowed us to assess monthly, for four mosquito taxa (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Limatus</italic> spp.), the following metrics: (a) house infestation, measured as the percent of surveillance dwellings with at least one juvenile mosquito; (b) juvenile mosquito catch, or the number of larvae in each SBS; (c) juvenile mosquito mortality, or the proportion of mosquito juveniles that died before reaching the adult stage in each SBS; and (d) adult mosquito emergence, or the number of adults emerging from each SBS. Here, we focus on our results on juvenile mosquito catch and adult mosquito emergence—and particularly on the epidemiologically most relevant quantity, female mosquito emergence.
