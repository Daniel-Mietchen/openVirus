<p>From August through October 2015, PPF dissemination was scheduled to be “focal”—i.e., limited to dwellings with evidence of infestation by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. based on the SBS surveillance. Again, logistic constraints did not allow for full coverage, with focal dissemination not taking place in eight of the 37 dwellings found to be infested at least once over this 3-mo period; in addition, our field team noted that PPF used in focal dissemination in October 2015 (26 dwellings) was not ground to sufficiently fine powder (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002213.s001">S1 Data</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002213.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Final PPF dissemination occurred in October 2015, with SBS-based monitoring maintained until January 2016. Thus, the trial spanned 12 mo before PPF dissemination, 5 mo of citywide PPF dissemination, 3 mo of focal PPF dissemination, and 3 mo after PPF dissemination stopped. Importantly, conventional 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> control measures (active breeding-site searches and breeding-site elimination by municipal vector control staff) were in place over the first 12 and last 6 mo of the trial—i.e., over the periods with no citywide PPF dissemination.
