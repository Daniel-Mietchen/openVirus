<p>We used GLMMs to quantify changes in (a) juvenile mosquito catch (number of larvae caught in SBSs) and (b) adult 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> emergence (number of adults emerging from SBSs) following PPF dissemination. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] unambiguously selected the negative binomial error structure (versus Poisson) as the best fit for our count data (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002213.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Our GLMMs accounted for unequal sampling effort due to missing SBS surveillance data by including the (log)number of operational SBSs in each dwelling each month as an offset. Since repeated observations were made over time in each dwelling, we specified dwelling ID as a random factor. Six dwelling-months produced no data (closed dwellings) and were excluded from the analyses, for a total of 2,294 SBS surveillance data points clustered in 100 dwellings. We specified intervention as a factor, indexing four consecutive periods: (1) before the intervention, or baseline; (2) citywide PPF dissemination (with some operational failures as noted above); (3) focal PPF dissemination (also with some operational failures); and (4) after PPF dissemination. We also tested alternative models excluding intervention effects (“null” models) or specifying, for each dwelling and month, (a) whether PPF dissemination (including DS maintenance) had/had not taken place at least once in the previous month (coded 1/0) or (b) the intensity/quality of dissemination, with 0 = no dissemination, 1 = unsupervised dissemination with possible operational failures, and 2 = supervised dissemination. For the second variable, for each month we summed the scores of the two fortnightly dissemination/maintenance events of the previous month, so this variable could take on integer values from 0 (no events) to 4 (two supervised events) (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002213.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Dissemination/maintenance was recorded at the city sector level during citywide PPF dissemination and at the dwelling level during focal PPF dissemination. All these alternative GLMMs had, however, much larger AIC and BIC scores (consistently &gt;50 units; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002213.s006">S1 Table</xref>) than the basic four-period models, on which we therefore base inference [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our models controlled for the effects of rainfall (monthly total) and temperature (monthly average of maximum daily values); since these covariates were correlated (Pearson’s ρ = −0.704), we fit separate GLMMs adjusting for (standardized) rainfall and temperature. The Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), which operates a meteorological station at the study locality, provided daily weather data (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002213.s001">S1 Data</xref>). GLMMs were fit using package lme4 1.1–10 in R 3.1.2 [
