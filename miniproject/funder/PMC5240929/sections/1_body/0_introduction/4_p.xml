<p>An attractive way to increase breeding-site coverage is to use adult mosquitoes to disseminate tiny particles of juvenile-killing insecticides (larvicides or pupicides) to breeding sites [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. One such insecticide is pyriproxyfen (PPF), an insect juvenile hormone analogue that kills mosquito juveniles at minute doses and can safely be used even in drinking water [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Mosquito-disseminated PPF has been shown to yield high breeding-site coverage and large reductions of adult mosquito emergence across a tropical neighborhood [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One crucial open question is whether mosquito-disseminated PPF can effectively reduce mosquito populations at the spatial scale relevant for vector control and disease preventionâ€”the scale of cities and towns. To address this question, we conducted a 2-y trial in a Brazilian Amazon city. First, we asked whether and to what extent some key demographic parameters of local mosquito populations (with a focus on

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) would change following citywide deployment of mosquito-disseminated PPF. We then used simple deterministic models to explore the possible impact of observed changes in female
