<p>Mean reductions in adult 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> emergence relative to baseline, as estimated by a GLMM (
 <xref rid="pmed.1002213.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), were 96.0% (95% CI 95.2%–96.8%) during citywide and 96.8% (95% CI 95.8%–97.6%) during focal PPF dissemination, with emergence rising back to baseline values after dissemination ended (17.3% mean reduction relative to baseline but with a 95% CI ranging from a 31.6% decrease to a 2.0% increase). For 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> females, GLMM estimates suggest emergence reductions of 95.6% (95% CI 94.6%–96.5%) during citywide and 95.1% (95% CI 93.4%–96.3%) during focal dissemination, with emergence still 22.1% (95% CI 5.8%–34.9%) lower in the post-intervention period than at baseline (

 <italic>Aedes</italic> males, with a maximum estimated reduction in emergence of 98.0% (95% CI 97.1%–98.7%) in the focal dissemination period (
