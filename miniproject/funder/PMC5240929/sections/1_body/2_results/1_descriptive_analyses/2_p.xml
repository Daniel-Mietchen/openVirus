<p>Juvenile 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> catch fell from a median value of 3.20 individuals per SBS per month before the intervention (range 1.94–4.82, mean 3.28) to less than one juvenile per SBS per month during citywide (median 0.77, range 0.17–1.36, mean 0.78) and focal (median 0.17, range 0.14–0.46, mean 0.26) PPF dissemination. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> catch rose back to a mean of more than three larvae per SBS over the last 3 mo of the trial (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002213.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). At the dwelling level, these figures translate into typical mean catches of about 7–17 juvenile 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> per month before PPF dissemination, falling to a minimum of 0.52 (52 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> juveniles in 100 dwellings) in the first month of focal dissemination. Mean monthly catch per dwelling was 1.01 for 
 <italic>Limatus</italic> spp. and 0.04 for 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. before dissemination; except for seven 
 <italic>Culex</italic> larvae caught in the second month of focal dissemination, neither genus appeared in samples taken during or after the intervention.
