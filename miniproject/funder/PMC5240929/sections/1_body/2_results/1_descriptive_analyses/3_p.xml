<p>Before PPF dissemination, most 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> juveniles survived to adulthood in our SBSs. Mean baseline monthly mortality was 1.9% (median 2.4%, range 0.0%–3.8%) for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 6.6% (median 5.5%, range 0.0%–17.8%) for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Monthly 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mortality soared to 79.7% on average (range 61.2%–92.7%) during citywide PPF dissemination and reached a peak value of 96.2% (95% CI 87.0%–98.9%) in the first month of focal dissemination (

 <italic>Limatus</italic> mortality (mean at baseline 3.95%) because no larvae were caught after dissemination started. All 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. juveniles caught before, but just three of seven caught during, PPF dissemination survived to adulthood.
