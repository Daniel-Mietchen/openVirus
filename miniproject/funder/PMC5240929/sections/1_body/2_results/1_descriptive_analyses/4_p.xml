<p>The combined effects of much lower juvenile mosquito catches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002213.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and much higher juvenile mortality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002213.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) yielded a striking citywide decrease of adult mosquito emergence during PPF dissemination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002213.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Mean monthly 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> adult emergence from SBSs was 1,077 (median 1,034, range 653–1,635) at baseline, for a mean of 3.2 adults per SBS per month (median 3.1, range 1.9–4.8) and 10.8 adults per dwelling per month (median 10.3, range 6.7–16.5). During citywide PPF dissemination, monthly emergence fell about 40-fold to just 56 adults on average (median 26, range 21–117), or 0.14 adults per SBS (median 0.07, range 0.06–0.30) and 0.56 adults per dwelling (median 0.26, range 0.21–1.17). Comparing extreme values (1,635 adults in January 2015 versus 21 adults in May 2015), adult 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> emergence fell about 80-fold during citywide PPF dissemination. Further decreases were recorded during focal dissemination, down to a minimum of just two adult 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> in total (a male and a female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) emerging from SBSs, each in a different dwelling, in August 2015—an 800-fold reduction relative to January 2015. As with other metrics, adult 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> emergence rose back to baseline values after PPF dissemination stopped (
