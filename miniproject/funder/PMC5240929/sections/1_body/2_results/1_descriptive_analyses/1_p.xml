 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was the dominant mosquito species at the study site; overall, we caught 12,817 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 5,346 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> juveniles in our SBSs. House infestation by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. fell from monthly values consistently about 70%–90% at baseline (mean 84.5%, median 87%, range 67%–97%) to a mean of 33% during citywide PPF dissemination (median 24%, range 15%–61%) and to a lowest value of 9% in the first month of focal dissemination (mean 16%, median 13%, range 9%–26%); afterwards, infestation gradually recovered to baseline values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002213.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We also collected 58 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. (
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> and a few 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>nigripalpus</italic>) and 1,213 
 <italic>Limatus</italic> spp. (mainly 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>durhami</italic>) larvae during the trial. House infestation by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. was consistently low before dissemination (median 1%, range 0%–6%); afterwards, just four dwellings were positive in just one month (April 2015). Dwelling infestation by 
 <italic>Limatus</italic> spp. was recorded only before PPF dissemination (median 17.6%, range 0%–83%).
