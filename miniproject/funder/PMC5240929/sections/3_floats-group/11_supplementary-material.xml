  <title>Pyriproxyfen dissemination in the vicinity of each surveillance dwelling.</title>
  <p>Each circle is centered on a surveillance dwelling, with circle size proportional to dissemination intensity/quality: two rounds of supervised dissemination (largest circles, value 4); one round of supervised dissemination and one round of unsupervised dissemination (value 3); one round of supervised dissemination (value 2); one round of unsupervised dissemination (value 1); or no dissemination (smallest circles, value 0). Dissemination was scheduled to be citywide in March–July 2015 and focal in August–October 2015. Note that dissemination failures mainly affected the northwestern sector of the town (the most distant from vector control headquarters), where three consecutive dissemination cycles (in May–June 2015) were not completed.</p>
