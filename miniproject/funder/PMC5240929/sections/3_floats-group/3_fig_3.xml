  <title>Monthly female 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> emergence in each of the 100 surveillance dwellings.
  </title>
  <p>The distribution of dwellings (black dots) and pyriproxyfen dissemination stations (green dots) is shown in the first panel, where dots are overlaid on a schematic of Manacapuru. In the remaining panels, bubble size is proportional to the number of emerging 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic> females; the scale is shown as a grey bubble in the second panel. For each month, the total number of emerging 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic> females is shown in the upper right corner of the panel. Color coding: brown, pre-intervention (baseline) period, with yellow indicating a single-survey month; dark green, citywide PPF dissemination; light green, focal PPF dissemination; blue, post-intervention period, with light blue indicating a single-survey month. Temporal boundaries between periods are highlighted by colored vertical bars.
