  <title>Changes in mosquito population metrics following deployment of mosquito-disseminated pyriproxyfen: descriptive graphs.</title>
  <p>(A) Monthly dwelling infestation by 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. (percent of dwellings in which at least one 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic> or 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> juvenile was present in sentinel breeding sites [SBSs]); error bars are score 95% confidence intervals. (B) Mean monthly numbers of 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> juveniles per SBS. (C) Monthly 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> juvenile mortality (overall percent of juveniles that died before reaching adulthood); error bars are score 95% confidence intervals. (D) Mean monthly adult 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> emergence (number of juvenile 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> that developed into adults in each SBS); error bars are two standard errors. In all panels, the periods of citywide (dark grey) and focal (light grey) pyriproxyfen (PPF) dissemination are highlighted on the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axes. Color coding in (Aâ€“C): red, pre-intervention (baseline) period, with orange indicating that just one survey was conducted in February 2015; dark green, citywide PPF dissemination; light green, focal PPF dissemination; blue, post-intervention period, with light blue indicating that just one survey was conducted in January 2016. Color coding in (D): red, females; blue, males; shaded area, total adult emergence; lighter red/blue, single-survey months (February 2015 and January 2016).
