    <p>Urban mosquitoes are global public health threats. They transmit dengue, Zika, and many other diseases for which vaccines or drugs are not available.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Mosquito control is the key to preventing these diseases, yet conventional control tactics seldom yield satisfactory results. One key drawback is that many mosquitoes (especially 
     <italic>Aedes</italic>) use small, hidden, or inaccessible breeding sites (aquatic larval habitats) that often remain untreated during control campaigns.
    </p>

   <list-item>
    <p>One way of increasing the fraction of breeding sites that are treated is to use the mosquitoes themselves to transfer pyriproxyfen (PPF), a potent juvenile-killing insecticide, from resting sites to untreated breeding sites; there, PPF impedes juvenile mosquito development.</p>

    <p>Working with municipal vector control staff, we tested mosquito-disseminated PPF in a 60,000-inhabitant town of central Amazonia, in Brazil. We sampled juvenile mosquitoes monthly in 100 dwellings over 12 baseline months, eight months of PPF dissemination (five months citywide and three months focal), and three months post-dissemination.</p>

    <p>We caught 12,817 
     <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 5,346 
     <italic>Ae</italic>. 
     <italic>aegypti</italic> juveniles, and kept them in the laboratory to measure juvenile mortality and adult emergence.
    </p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Following PPF dissemination, we observed an 80%–90% decrease in 
     <italic>Aedes</italic> juvenile catch, while 
     <italic>Aedes</italic> juvenile mortality increased from 2%–7% to 80%–90%. Adult 
     <italic>Aedes</italic> emergence dropped by 96%–98%, such that the number of females emerging per person decreased to 0.002–0.129 females per person-month.

    <p>Mathematical models predict that this reduction would effectively block transmission of mosquito-borne viruses like dengue, Zika, or chikungunya.</p>

    <p>Our findings suggest that mosquito-disseminated PPF has the potential to become an important public health tool; larger, carefully designed trials are now necessary to determine the impact of this tactic on disease transmission.</p>
