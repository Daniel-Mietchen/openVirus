<p id="Par24">Prior to starting the survey, we conducted community information and mobilization activities through several channels: information on radio spots, meetings with community leaders and health facilities workers, information in schools, leaflets and posters. In order to reach a maximum of eligible individuals in their houses the survey teams visited the houses from Tuesday to Sunday. Time slots from early morning to late evening were covered in different days of the week in order to maximize the possibilities of finding the eligible participants at home. Due to the importance that blood has in the Zulu culture, the survey teams made a particular effort in explaining the purpose of collecting and storing blood and the use of it. The survey teams used face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaires to collect information at the participant’s home on socio-demographics and history of HIV testing and care (see Additional files

Certified lay counsellors performed rapid HIV testing on site and provided pre and post-test counselling to the participants willing to test at home. Counsellors used Determine Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody test kit for screening, and if positive, Unigold Rapid HIV test kit for confirmation according to the South African National guidelines for HIV Counselling and Testing. The tests were standardised and validated for this use. In addition, HIV-positivity was confirmed by ELISA at the laboratory. Survey nurses collected venous blood specimens from HIV-positive participants for antiretroviral (ARV) drug presence test, CD4 count and viral load. Venous blood samples were transported every evening to Global Clinical and Viral Laboratory in Durban. CD4 count was performed using a FACSCalibur™ device from Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) according to standard manufacturer’s instructions on samples reported as HIV positive. Two dry blood spots (DBS) samples were prepared using the venous blood samples from each participant and transported in batches to the Department of Pharmacology laboratory at Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town, for ARV drug levels. Qualitative testing for ARV drug levels was performed for the presence of nevirapine, efavirenz and lopinavir which covered all ARV regimens in use in the public sector in the area. A liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay with a limit of quantification of 0.04 μg/mL was used for all drugs. The assay was developed and validated at the Division of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Cape Town. Viral load was performed for participants on ART for more than 6 months (determined by questionnaire) at Global Clinical and Viral Laboratory in Durban using a NucliSens EasyQ HIV-1v2.0 assay from Biomerieux according to manufacturer’s instructions. The test could quantify HIV-1 RNA over the range of 20 copies to 20 million copies for 0.5 mL sample.
