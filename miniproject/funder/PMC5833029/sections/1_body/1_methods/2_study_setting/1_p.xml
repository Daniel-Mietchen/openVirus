 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Decentralization of ART care to the peripheral level was implemented gradually in this area. In 2011, the KZN province embraced the notion of nurse-initiated and managed ART (NIM-ART). MSF support to the KZN Department of Health (DOH) included prevention activities such as condom distribution, voluntary medical male circumcision, community mobilisation, large-scale community-based HIV counselling and testing, implementation of point of care CD4 testing, linkage to care, and training and mentoring of health staff in facilities in support of NIM-ART. In 2013, two district hospitals and their linked 10 primary healthcare facilities were ART-initiating centres. The survey was conducted 8 years after the initiation of the HIV program in the area. At the time of the survey the CD4 threshold for ART initiation was 350 cells/μL.
