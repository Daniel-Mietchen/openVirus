<p id="Par25">We calculated progression towards the 90–90-90 UNAIDS targets by estimating three proportions: HIV positive individuals who knew their status (first 90), those diagnosed who were on ART (second 90), and those on ART who were virally suppressed (third 90). Viral suppression was defined as having less than 1000 copies/mL. In addition, we calculated five steps of the HIV cascade of care using the total number of HIV positive individuals as a common denominator. ‘Diagnosed’ were the individuals who knew their HIV positive status prior to the survey; ‘Linked to care’ were those who declared having sought care for their HIV infection; ‘In care’ were those who were still receiving HIV care at the time of the survey; ‘On ART’ were those who had ARV detected in blood; ‘Virally suppressed’ were those with viral load less below 1000 copies/mL. All statistical analyses were adjusted for clustering at the level of Ward and household. Descriptive analyses are presented here with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Categorical variables were compared using proportional test. Analyses were primarily performed using Stata 13 (™StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).</p>
