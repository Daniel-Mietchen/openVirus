<p id="Par21">A two-stage stratified cluster probability sampling strategy was used for the selection of households according to the 2011 Census [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In total, 125 clusters of 25 households each were selected from 14 administrative units called Wards. Google Earth maps from 2011 with exhaustive identification of the households were used to sample the households to be visited by choosing randomly the first household and then sequentially the closest to the first/previous one. Field staff used Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to find the geographic coordinates of each household.
