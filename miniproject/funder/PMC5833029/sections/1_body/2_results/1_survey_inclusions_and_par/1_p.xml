<p id="Par27">We visited 2377 households and we included 5649 (84.5%) participants among 6688 eligible individuals. Inclusion rate was: 3518/4008 (87.8%) among women and 2131/2680 (79.5%) among men. The remaining individuals were not included due to: refusal (8.7%), not being at home (4.9%), being incapacitated (1.0%) and other reasons (0.9%). The median age of the participants was 26 years (IQR: 19–40), 62.3% were women, 83.4% lived in rural areas, 78.8% were not living with a partner, 49.7% had completed at least secondary school, 36.3% declared no occupation and 16.6% had moved their residence in the 10 years prior to the survey or were visitors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thirty-two per cent of the men were under 19 years, compared to 22% of the women, possibly reflecting out-migration of adult men to seek work.
