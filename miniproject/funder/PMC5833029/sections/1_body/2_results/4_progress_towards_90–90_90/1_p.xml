<p id="Par30">UNAIDS targets were partially achieved with 76.4% (95% CI: 74.1–78.6) of all HIV-positive who knew their status, 69.9% (95% CI: 67.0–72.7) of them being on ART, and 93.1% (95% CI: 91.0–94.8) of the people treated being virally suppressed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Progress towards the first target differed by sex and age. HIV diagnosis was: 79.0% (95% CI: 76.4–81.4) in women versus 68.3% (95% CI: 63.1–73.1) in men (
