<p id="Par31">We also looked at other components of the cascade of care and the proportions of ART and viral suppression among all HIV-positive individuals. Of the 1384 HIV-positive participants with complete information on HIV diagnosis, ARV presence in blood and viral load, 71.0% (95% CI: 68.6–73.4) were linked to care, 62.7% (95% CI: 59.8–65.6) were in care, 53.5% (95% CI: 50.6–56.3) were on ART, 57.4% (95% CI: 54.6–60.1) were virally suppressed. The largest gaps in the cascade of care occurred in men and people aged 15–29 years (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Regarding viral suppression, 60.3% (95% CI: 57.4–63.1) of all HIV-positive women were virally suppressed compared to 47.9% (95% CI: 41.7–54.1) of the HIV-positive men and 66.2% (95% CI: 63.0–69.2) of the HIV-positive individuals aged 30–59 years were virally suppressed compared to 41.3% (95% CI: 36.9–45.9) of those aged 15–29 years. Of the 590 HIV-positive participants virally unsuppressed, 279 (47.3%) were undiagnosed and 260 (44.1%) were diagnosed but not on ART. A breakdown by age and sex is given in Fig.
