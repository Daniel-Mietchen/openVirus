<p id="Par29">In total, 1423 participants were HIV positive. The overall prevalence was 25.2% (95% CI: 23.6–26.9). Prevalence in women was higher than in men: 30.9% (95% CI: 29.0–32.9) vs 15.9% (95% CI: 14.0–18.0). Peak prevalence was 56.5% (95% CI: 50.9–62.0) in women at age 30–34 years and 45.5% (95% CI 37.3–54.0) in men at age 35–39 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Prevalence for age 15–29 years crudely averaged 22.3% (95% CI: 20.5–24.3) in women and 6.2% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6) in men, increasing dramatically from age 15 to 29 (3.9% to 55.0% in women and 1.5% to 26.7% in men). HIV positive mothers who had delivered in the 5 years prior to the study had a higher proportion of children who had died than HIV negative mothers: 5.3% vs 2.5% (

Of the 1400 HIV-positive participants with a CD4 count, 130 (9.3%) had a CD4 count below 200 cells/μL, 255 (18.2%) between 200 and 349 cells/μL, 363 (25.9%) between 350 and 499 cells/μL and 652 (46.6%) over or equal to 500 cells/μL. Median CD4 count was 483 cells/μL (IQR: 332–665). Among the 655 individuals not on ART, 78 (11.9%) had a CD4 count below 200 cells/μL and 138 (21.1%) between 200 and 349 cells/μL. Among the 741 individuals on ART, 52 (7.0%) had a CD4 count below 200 cells/μL and 115 (15.5%) between 200 and 349 cells/μL. Of the participants with viral load below 1000 copies/mL, 5.7% (95% CI: 4.2–7.5) had a CD4 below 200 cells/μL and 19.7% (95% CI: 17.2–22.6) a CD4 below 350 cells/μL (Table
