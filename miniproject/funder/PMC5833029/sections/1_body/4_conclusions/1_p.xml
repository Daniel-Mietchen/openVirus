<p id="Par36">Significant progress has been achieved in this area with regards to reaching the UNAIDS 90–90-90 targets. The third 90, viral suppression in people on ART, was achieved among women and men. However, further efforts on diagnosis and ART initiation are needed in order to reach the first and second targets particularly in men and individuals younger than 30 years. Indeed, almost half of the people virally unsuppressed were undiagnosed. Achieving 90–90-90 is feasible but requires significant additional investment.</p>
