<p id="Par35">Our study has some limitations. Some information, such as HIV status awareness used in the cascade of care for the identification of individuals already diagnosed and linked to care, was self-reported, which may have led to misclassifications. Otherwise, most of the results, crucially including ART coverage, are based on laboratory data.</p>
