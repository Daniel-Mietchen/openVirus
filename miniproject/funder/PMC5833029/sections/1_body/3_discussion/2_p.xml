<p id="Par33">These findings suggest that achieving the UNAIDS 2020 targets of 90–90-90 is feasible in South Africa, but will require additional community-based investments in testing and ART initiation especially among young people and men. Investments to reach men may need to include strategies to improve HIV knowledge [

A household-based survey conducted in the 2 years following ours in Botswana has reported a high coverage: 83.3% of individuals knew their status, 87.4% of those were on ART, and 96.5% of those on ART had a viral load of 400 copies/mL or less (70.2% of all people with HIV) in a context of high HIV prevalence, 29% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The early initiation and strong political leadership of the ART programme in Botswana might partially explain the relatively high ART coverage achieved at a time when both South African and Botswana guidelines recommended a CD4 threshold for ART initiation of 350 cells/μL. However, a household-based survey conducted the year following ours in another area of KwaZulu-Natal, found lower rates of HIV-positivity awareness (65% of the HIV-positive women and 52% of the men), similar rates of ART among those who knew their status (70% in women and 69% in men) and lower rates of viral suppression (90% in women and 85% in men) compared to our findings [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], in the area surveyed the largest losses in the HIV cascade of care occurred on diagnosis and on linkage from diagnosis into ART care. In addition, the cascade in men and people 15–29 years of age showed greater falls at each step [
