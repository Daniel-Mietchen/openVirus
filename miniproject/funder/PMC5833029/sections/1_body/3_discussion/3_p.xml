 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and other factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] may explain the current picture of a very high prevalence. Prevalence in women increased dramatically from 15 years with a peak at 30–34 years. A rapid increase (though lower) was also observed in men but with a lag of around 5 years of age. Similar prevalence in women and men after 45 years of age could be a reflection of a differential mortality by age groups in the pre-ART era, a higher HIV incidence at older ages in men compared to women, or other competing risks such as maternal mortality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The 2012 national survey found similar age/gender trends at national level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Regarding the immunological status of the people living with HIV, although the proportion in an advanced stage of HIV disease with CD4 below 200 cells/μL was relatively low, the fact that more than half were not on ART highlights that a non-negligible proportion of people with HIV don’t access care or access it very late, with significant risk of morbidity and mortality. These findings support current recommendations that HIV programmes retain the capacity to perform CD4 cell count at baseline and in case of treatment failure, as this remains one of the best predictors of general patient wellness, disease progression and mortality risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. They also support the need for innovative strategies to reach individuals with high barriers to HIV testing before they develop advanced disease, such as self-testing and home-based testing.
