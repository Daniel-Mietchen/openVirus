<p id="Par32">In this area of KwaZulu-Natal, eight years into the public ART program, of which two with MSF support, we found that significant but insufficient progress towards the 90–90-90 UNAIDS targets was achieved. Progress towards the first and second targets was moderate and was particularly poor in men and individuals aged 15–29 years. The third target was achieved (or very close to achievement) in all sex and age categories. This progress has been made in a context of high HIV prevalence where one quarter of the overall population is HIV positive.</p>
