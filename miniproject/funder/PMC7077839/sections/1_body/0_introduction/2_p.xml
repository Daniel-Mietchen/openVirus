<p>In general, EV-A71 is a major cause of HFMD and neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis and encephalomyelitis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, it could lead to central nervous system (CNS) infection without HFMD manifestation. EV-A71 might occasionally cause herpangina although the major causative agent of herpangina is coxsackieviruses [

Enterovirus remains prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region where large populations were infected every year with EV-A71 particularly as a major cause of neurological complications and mortality. Since 1997, cyclical EV-A71 outbreaks have occurred in Asian countries including Brunei, Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Philippines, the HFMD surveillance demonstrated the positive rate of EV-A71 is between 2.0–5.4% with genotype C2 circulating from 2000 to 2016 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Genotype/subgenotype B4, C1, C2, C4b, and C5 were found in Thailand in 2000–2009, and the predominant genotype shifted to B5 and C4a in 2011–2017 [

To harmonize the enterovirus surveillance in the Asia-Pacific region, the Asia-Pacific Network for Enterovirus Surveillance (APNES) was established in 2017. In 2018, APNES has reported that EV-A71 continued circulating in the Asia-Pacific region where genotype B5 (Sarawak, Malaysia) and C4 (Thailand) have been detected [
