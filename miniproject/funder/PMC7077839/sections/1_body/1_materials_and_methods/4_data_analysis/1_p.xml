<p>Comparisons of seroprevalences across several Asian countries have been conducted. The median ages of infection are assumed as 50% seroprevalence and estimated using the Reed-Muench method. The geometric mean titers (GMT) of antibody titers and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for comparing cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers because we measured the serum neutralizing antibody titers against the three EV-A71 viruses (A/BrCr/1970, B5/HCMC-E452/2013 and C4a/HCM82/VNM/11) for each child.</p>
