<p>CH1 is a pediatric hospital providing health care for children up to 16 years old in HCMC and southern provinces of Vietnam. Residual sera were collected from inpatients who were admitted to CH1 due to illnesses not related to HFMD and herpangina from April 2012 to October 2013. Non-HFMD/herpangina inpatients admitted to CH1 during this period were invited to participate in this study, and those who or whose parents/guardians had signed the informed consent form were recruited. After obtaining the informed consent from the guardians, residual sera were collected from the participating inpatients. A total of 562 subjects were enrolled in the study, and 9 (1.6%) subjects were excluded due to missing data. Thus, 553 subjects with complete data were analyzed.</p>
