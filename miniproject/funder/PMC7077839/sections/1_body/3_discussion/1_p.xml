<p>Multiple EV-A71-related fatal epidemics have occurred in southern Vietnam. In this study, we found high seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing antibody in children living in southern Vietnam after the 2011 epidemic, which indicates the necessity of introducing EV-A71 vaccines in southern Vietnam. Moreover, about 17% of children in southern Vietnam were infected at 6â€“12 months of age during the 2011 epidemic and this age group has the highest risk of developing EV-A71-related neurological complications [
