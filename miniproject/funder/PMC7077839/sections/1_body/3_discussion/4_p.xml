<p>One limitation of this study should be noted. Our study was a hospital-based study instead of a community-based random survey. A community study with random sampling is the most valid method to have a representative sample for a seroprevalence study. However, the cost of conducting a community survey in a city without comprehensive house-hold registration system may be too high to be feasible. Alternatively, a hospital-based study by using residual serum is relatively cost-effective to estimate the seroprevalence in a population (

Our study site, Childrenâ€™s Hospital 1, is the largest public hospital providing healthcare to children in HCMC and other southern provinces of Vietnam, which could eliminate financial barriers to healthcare access and may have good representativeness to the population. We further compared the geographical distribution of study participants and all non-HFMD/herpangina inpatients of CH1 during the study period. Among the study participants, 65% (n = 359) were from provinces other than HCMC, which was comparable with that of the non-HFMD/herpangina inpatients (58.3%). In addition, the population in provinces other than HCMC accounted for 69% of total population in southern Vietnam [
