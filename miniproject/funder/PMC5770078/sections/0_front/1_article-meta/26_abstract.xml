 <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus are mosquito-borne alphaviruses that cause epidemics of human arthritic disease that usually last from weeks to months. Arthropathy predominantly manifests in the joints of limbs and the joints at the extremities (e.g. hand and feet). Herein we show a surprisingly large reduction in viral loads and foot arthropathy in mice when animals were housed at 30°C rather than the conventional 22°C, with the feet of the former mice being ≈3–4°C warmer. Using RNA-Seq analyses of mice feet, we illustrate that this small increase in temperature results in a significant increase in both the unfolded protein response and anti-viral type I interferon responses. Taken together these results suggest that the predominantly peripheral alphaviral arthropathy is due to the usually slightly lower temperature of limbs and extremities, which results in less effective type I interferon responses and a subsequent increase in viral loads and ensuing arthritic disease.</p>
