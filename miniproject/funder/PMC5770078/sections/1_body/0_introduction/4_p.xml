<p>Herein we provide evidence that the reason for the largely peripheral alphaviral arthropathy seen in humans is that joints in the limbs and the extremities are a few degrees cooler than the core temperature of ≈37°C, with slightly cooler temperatures associated with suboptimal anti-viral type I IFN responses. Increasing the mouse housing temperature from 22°C to 30°C increased foot temperatures; this led to increased activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and improved anti-viral type I IFN responses in the feet. CHIKV replication was subsequently reduced and peripheral arthropathy was substantially ameliorated.</p>
