<p>Studying the role of temperature in regulating viral infections and viral pathologies has an eclectic history. The Australian nurse, Elizabeth Kenny (1880–1952), pioneered the treatment of polio with application of heat packs to affected limbs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], although the mechanistic basis for this treatment has not been identified [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A number of reasons for the increase in respiratory tract infections during the winter months have been proposed, with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in cell lines suggesting a role for improved type I interferon (IFN) responses at 37°C compared with lower temperatures [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A range of other factors have also been implicated including cold stress, respiratory tract vasoconstriction, humidity, transmission, and host behavior [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Fever has also been viewed as potentially beneficial in fighting viral infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], although effects may be quite marginal [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Mice housed at 30°C have been shown to have increased CD8 T cell activity compared with mice held at 20–26°C, although this study was concerned with anti-cancer responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Elevated ambient temperatures have been shown to increase expression of type I IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), TNF and IL-1, and protect Japanese flounders against Hirame rhabdovirus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Olive flounders infected with hemorrhagic septicemia virus if held at 20°C rather than 15°C also showed improved survival, increased virus-induced apoptosis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and increased levels of Toll-like receptor 7 and Interferon Response Factor 7 (IRF7) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In mosquitoes, maintenance at lower temperatures favors replication of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and yellow fever virus by suppressing the efficiency of the insect’s anti-viral ‘RNA-induced silencing complex’ [
