<p>A number of mosquito-borne viruses in the genus alphavirus (family Togaviridae) cause outbreaks of human rheumatic disease around the world; these include CHIKV, the primarily Australian Ross River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus, the African o’nyong-nyong virus, the Sindbis group of viruses and the South American Mayaro virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alphaviral arthritic disease is generally symmetrical with joints in limbs and at the extremities most commonly affected (e.g. feet, hands, ankles, wrists, knees, elbows) [
