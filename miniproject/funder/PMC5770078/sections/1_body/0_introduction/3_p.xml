<p>A number of mouse models for alphavirus infection and disease have been developed [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The adult wild-type C57BL/6 mouse model of CHIKV infection and disease used herein involves injection of CHIKV s.c. into feet, and recapitulates the viremia and arthropathy seen in humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. RNA-Seq analyses also revealed a good concordance in inflammatory gene induction between the mouse model and CHIKV patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The latter analyses also illustrated the dominance of the type I IFN response, with ISGs representing ≈50% of CHIKV-induced genes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A key role for the type I IFN response in controlling alphaviral infection is well established [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], with type I interferon receptor deficient (IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup>) mice rapidly succumbing to CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The transcription factors, Interferon Response Factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 are critical for innate protection, with CHIKV-infected IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> (double knockout) mice unable to produce detectable type I IFNs, resulting in high viremias, fever, hemorrhagic shock and mortality within a few days (a disease outcome only occasionally seen in humans) [
