<p>Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were seeded into 96 well plates and cultured for 24 hrs at the indicated temperatures and treated with human IFNα (Sigma I 2396; a mixture of 10 IFNα species) for 4 hrs. CHIKV was added (MOI = 0.05) and incubation continued at the same temperature. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was assessed by crystal violet staining after 3 days. For virus replication Vero cells after seeding at the indicated temperatures in triplicate in 24 well plates were infected with CHIKV for 6 hrs, were washed and then incubated at the same temperatures. Viral titers in the supernatants were assessed at the indicated times after washing.</p>
