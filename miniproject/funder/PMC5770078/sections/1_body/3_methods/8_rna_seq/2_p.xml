<p>The read counts were used to determine gene expression and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using R packages (R version 3.2.0) ‘edgeR’ (v3.10.5) and ‘limma’ (3.24.15). (

The default TMM normalization method of edgeR was used to normalize the counts. The GLM model was used to perform differential expression comparison between the groups. Genes that had &gt;1 CPM in at least 3 samples are retained for the further analysis. Differentially gene expression was considered significant if the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value (i.e. FDR or q value) was &lt;0.01. DEGs were analyzed by Ingenuity as described [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] by uploading the RNA-Seq fastq files, identifying the replicates (allowing averaging, n = 3) and undertaking pair-wise comparisons (30C vs 22C and 30T vs 22T).
