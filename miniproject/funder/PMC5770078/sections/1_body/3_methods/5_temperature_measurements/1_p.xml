<p>Temperature measurements were taken using a pediatric infra-red ear thermometer (Welch Allyn Pro 4000, Braun Kronberg Type 6021 Hechingen, Germany). The thermometer probe was gently pressed into the pit of the back leg of a restrained mouse for 10 seconds (gently folding and holding the leg over the end of the probe) before a temperature measurement was taken. This was repeated on the other leg, and the procedure repeated to obtain a mean of four measurements. Temperature readings were also taken from the feet by placing the thermometer probe onto the largely hairless (walking-pad free) regions of the hind foot; this was repeated on the other leg, repeated, and a mean of four measurements obtained. Four measurements (two on the right, two on the left) were thus taken to produce a mean for each mouse for both leg pits and feet. The mean SD across the data set for quadruplicates was 1.04Â°C.</p>
