<p>We show herein that the augmented type I IFN response for mice housed at 30°C correlated with an increase in UPR-associated transcriptional signatures. That the UPR can augment (or improve priming of) the type I IFN response has been reported by several groups in a variety of settings [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Network analyses also support the view that the UPR and anti-viral pathways intersect at several nodes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6A, 6B and 6C</xref>) has also been associated with improved type I IFN response in several settings [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], potentially contributing to UPR activation. Unfortunately, measuring the thermostability of cellular proteins in eukaryotic cells
