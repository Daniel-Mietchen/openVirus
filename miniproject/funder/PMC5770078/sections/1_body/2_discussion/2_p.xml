<p>The results suggest that limb temperatures can have profound effects on alphaviral infection and disease. The implications might be that the Elizabeth Kenny limb warming therapy [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] might find utility for treating alphaviral arthritides. However, such treatment might need to start very early post onset of viremia, before the virus has had a chance to seed and substantially replicate in joint tissues. Applying “heat therapy” 4 days post infection in mice was already too late to change the course of arthritic disease (
