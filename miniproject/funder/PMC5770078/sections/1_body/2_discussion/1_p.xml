<p>At room temperature (22Â°C) limbs and extremities in humans are usually cooler than core temperatures [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s008">S8 Fig</xref>. The data presented herein argues that a major reason why alphaviral arthropathy primarily affects these joints is that these tissues are often cooler, resulting in reduced type I IFN anti-viral responses, increased alphaviral replication and thus exacerbated arthropathy. A number of other viral arthropathies have similarly been shown to predominantly affect the extremities, including dengue [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], parvovirus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and hepatitis B [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], suggesting this affect is not restricted to alphaviruses.
