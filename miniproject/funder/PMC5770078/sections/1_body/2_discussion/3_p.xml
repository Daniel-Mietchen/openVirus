<p>The data might argue that alphaviral arthropathies should be overtly less severe in people living in tropical climates; however, establishing such an association would likely be confounded by a number of factors including (i) air conditioning [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], (ii) lack of application of validated instruments for defining disease severity and lack of accounting for co-morbidities [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], (iii) different levels of co-morbidities (often associated with severe disease) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], (iv) different age structures with the elderly prone to more severe disease, (v) suboptimal diagnosis (e.g. differentiation from 
 <italic>inter alia</italic> dengue and rheumatoid arthritis) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], (vi) different access to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or paracetamol (acetaminophen), (vii) viral genotypes with different pathogenicities and geographical distributions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and (viii) different mosquito vectors and vector competencies [
