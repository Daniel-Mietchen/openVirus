<p>Exactly how the UPR and/or XBP1 might promote type I IFN responses remains unclear, with XBP1 binding to the IFNβ promoter [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] perhaps unlikely in the current setting (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s006">S6C Fig</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). A role for GADD34 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] is also not supported by the above and GADD34 expression data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). We (like others [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]) have also been unable to find a significant correlation between XBP1 splicing [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] and elevated type I IFN responses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s006">S6A Fig</xref>), although this might require examination of certain cell types [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] and/or sampling over a specific time period. The UPR may promote and/or prime type I IFN responses via the IRE1-RIDD-RIG-I pathway [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], a pathway for which XBP1 splicing is dispensable [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]; (RIDD stands for IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA). The UPR sensor IRE1α (as well as splicing XBP1) degrades RNA, with the products detected by RIG-I [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], a RNA sensor that also binds CHIKV RNA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. IRE1α may also be ancestrally related to the anti-viral effector RNase L [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. However, until a mechanism can be elucidated in the current setting, the UPR and promotion of the type I IFN response remains a correlation, with other mechanisms potentially involved [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].
