<p>Arbovirus disease models have generally been optimized with respect to route and dose, and the RRV mouse model of arthropathy involves inoculation of virus s.c. into the pectoral area of young mice, with infection showing tropism for tissues in the hind limb [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This model might thus be viewed as being an intermediate between the foot s.c. and i.p. routes of inoculation described above. After viral inoculation the viremia in RRV infected mice was ≈0.5–1 log lower on days 3–6 for mice housed at 30°C, although this was significant only when a repeat measures ANOVA was applied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Foot titers started to show slight differences days 3 and 7, but differences only reached significance on day 10 post RRV infection when titers were ≈2 logs lower in mice housed at 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The disease severity was significantly lower for mice held at 30°C, with differences in disease scores increasing after day 8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The disease severity scoring in this model is primarily derived from assessing hind limb weakness [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus in a model where viral tropism results in hind limbs becoming a major site of viral replication and disease, a clearly significant reduction in foot titers and disease was again evident for mice housed at 30°C. One might of course now argue that viral tropism in this model is due (at least in part) to the lower limb temperatures and the resulting reduction in type I IFN activity [
