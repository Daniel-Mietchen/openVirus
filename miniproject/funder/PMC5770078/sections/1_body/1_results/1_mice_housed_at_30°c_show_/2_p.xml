<p>Foot swelling, which is a measure of acute arthritis and peaks on day 6/7 in this model [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] prodigious mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in feet of CHIKV-infected mice housed at 22°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, 22°C). In contrast, mice housed at 30°C showed substantially lower numbers of infiltrating cells (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) confirmed this difference was highly significant (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] showed less CHIKV antigen in foot tissues of mice kept at 30°C (
