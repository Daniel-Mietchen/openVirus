<p>Using the adult wild-type mouse model of CHIKV viremia and arthritis described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], C57BL/6J female mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) into the feet with CHIKV (Reunion Island isolate). Mice were housed at an ambient temperature of 22 ± 1°C (as per standard animal house temperature) or 30 ± 1°C five days before viral inoculation and were kept at these temperatures until the end of the experiment. (Mice housed at the higher temperature did not show any overt changes in appearance or behavior). As described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], high viral loads are reached in the feet within 2 days post inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Thereafter, the feet of mice housed at 30°C showed 1–2 log lower viral loads than feet of mice housed at 22°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), with qRT PCR also showing lower CHIKV RNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). In addition, CHIKV RNA levels in feet on day 30 post-infection were ≈20 fold lower in feet of mice kept at 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In this model for mice housed at 22°C, CHIKV RNA persists in feet for up to 100 days post infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], with persistent viral RNA associated with chronic arthritic disease [
