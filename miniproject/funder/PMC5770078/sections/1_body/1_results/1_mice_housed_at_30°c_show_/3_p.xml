<p>Given (i) that CHIKV infections are effectively controlled by type I interferon (IFN) responses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], these results suggest that for mice housed at 30°C, type I IFN responses in feet are improved, leading to reduced CHIKV replication and a subsequent decrease in viral arthropathy. Mice housed at 30°C also showed a substantially (≈2–4 log) and significantly lower viremia on days 2 and 3 post infection (
