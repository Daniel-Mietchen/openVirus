<p>The potential benefits of fever for fighting infections have been suggested in various contexts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. C57BL/6 mice housed at 22°C and infected with CHIKV do not develop a detectable fever [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], whereas most humans develop a fever after CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. To determine whether housing mice at 30°C promotes detectable fever development, estimates of core temperatures were obtained using a pediatric infra-red thermometer gently pressed into the pit of the back leg of a restrained mouse for 10 seconds, with the leg folded over the end of the probe. No significant fever was detected in mice kept at 30°C or 22°C (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which would be day 1–2 post infection in mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As might be expected for a homeotherm, the core temperature measurements were only marginally higher at 30°C (
