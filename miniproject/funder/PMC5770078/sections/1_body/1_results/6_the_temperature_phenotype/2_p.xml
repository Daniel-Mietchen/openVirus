<p>Temperature readings were also taken from feet by placing the thermometer onto the hairless skin regions of the hind foot, with mice housed at 30°C showing ≈3–4°C higher foot skin temperatures than mice housed at 22°C (

After day 4, foot skin temperatures for mice housed at 30°C did show a ≈1°C increase relative to day 0 (from ≈34°C to ≈35°C), presumably as a consequence of the CHIKV-induced arthritic inflammation (calor).
