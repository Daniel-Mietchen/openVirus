<p>The mice in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref> were inoculated with CHIKV s.c. into the feet, with feet ≈3–4°C cooler in mice housed at 22°C when compared with mice housed at 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). As feet represent a major site of virus replication after s.c. CHIKV inoculation into the feet (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], mice were injected with CHIKV via the intra-peritoneal (i.p.) route, to ascertain whether the temperature phenotype was dependent on the route of inoculation. Although the viremia showed a hint of reduced viral load at 30°C, no significant differences in viremia (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) for mice housed at the two temperatures was seen after i.p. inoculation. This contrasts with s.c. inoculation; viremia (
