<p>Thus the temperature phenotype (described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref>) seen after inoculation of CHIKV into cooler feet (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) is lost when virus is inoculated via the i.p. route. After i.p. inoculation, initially virus replication likely occurs at core temperatures, which were similar for mice housed at 30°C or 22°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In the absence of a temperature difference, type I IFN production would not be different and systemic anti-viral activity remains largely unaffected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). Although viral inoculation via the i.p. route is unlikely to occur naturally, the experiment illustrates that the increased CHIKV replication seen in mice housed at 22°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref>) requires that initial viral replication occurs in tissues that are slightly cooler than the core temperature.
