<p>Type I IFN protein levels rise rapidly and fall in CHIKV-infected C57BL/6 mice within 4 days [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The reduced arthritic disease seen at 30°C was therefore due to effects mediated within the first 4 days post infection, the period of significant IFNα/β production and peak viral replication. These experiments (i) support the view that the ambient temperature mediates its effects during the time of IFNα/β production, and (ii) argue that any warming treatment attempting to reduce arthritic disease [
