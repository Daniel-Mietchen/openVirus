<p>To determine whether type I IFN responses are required for the reductions in viral loads seen for mice kept at 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1A, 1B, 1H and 1I</xref>), IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> were housed at 30°C or 22°C and were infected with CHIKV s.c. in the feet. IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice do not generate detectable serum IFNα/β levels following CHIKV infection and usually die within 5–6 days [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast to wild-type mice, neither the viremia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), nor the foot swelling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) was reduced in IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice housed at 30°C relative to IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice housed at 22°C. Foot swelling was actually slightly higher at 30°C (reaching significance on day 2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In addition, survival of CHIKV-infected IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice was also marginally less for mice held at 30°C, although the difference only approached significance (p = 0.071). Thus IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, in contrast to C57BL/6 mice, did not show reduced viral replication and disease when housed at 30°C; if anything disease was slightly increased at this temperature in IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice.
