<p>The above experiments were repeated in IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice; these mice are unable to respond to IFNα/β due to the lack of a functional IFNα/β receptor and die rapidly after CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In contrast to wild-type mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) (but similar to IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), there was no difference in viremia between IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice housed at 22°C and 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Foot swelling in IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice was significantly higher at 30°C (as in IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2B</xref>); opposite to the reduced swelling seen in C57BL/6 mice housed at 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The reduced viremia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) and foot swelling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) seen at 30°C in wild-type mice was thus not recapitulated in either IRF3/7
 <sup>-/-</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) or IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). One should note that CHIKV-induced foot swelling in the latter two type I IFN response-deficient mice is quite distinct from that seen in C57BL/6 mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), and is largely due to hemorrhage and shock-associated edema [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Lower temperatures are known to reduce edema [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. There was no significant difference in the survival of CHIKV-infected IFNAR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice housed at 22°C or 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).
