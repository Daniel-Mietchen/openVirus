<p>An identical RNA-Seq and IPA USR analysis to that described above was conducted using feet from naïve untreated mice held at 30°C or 22°C for 5 days (30C vs 22C) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). XBP1 and ATF6 (UPR-associated USRs) were again identified with high Activation Z scores. A number of other USRs associated with promotion of the type I IFN response were also more active at 30°C, whereas IRF3, IRF7 (and IRF5) were not identified (
