<p>Quality control analyses for the RNA-Seq are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s003">S3 Fig</xref>. DEGs (FDR q&lt;0.01 and CPM&gt;1 in at least 3 samples) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s011">S1 Table</xref>. Global analyses of DEGs illustrated, for instance, that genes regulated by poly(I:C)/jetPEI were qualitatively, if not quantitatively, similar at the two temperatures, with 22C vs 22T and 30C vs 30T showing considerable overlap (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). As might be expected (i) most of the up-regulated genes were ISGs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and (ii) the Molecular and Cellular Functions feature of IPA clearly illustrated that genes associated with cell growth, survival, movement, morphology and development were up-regulated in feet of mice housed at 30Â°C in the presence or absence of poly(I:C)/jetPEI treatment (
