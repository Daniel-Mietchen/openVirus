<p>The results so far suggest that for wild-type mice housed at 30°C and infected in the feet, alphaviral replication in limbs and extremities is more effectively controlled by type I IFN responses. As a consequence, viral replication and arthritic disease is significantly reduced. To investigate the role of ambient temperature on type I IFN responses in the periphery, RNA-Seq was undertaken on mRNA from four samples (i) feet from naive control mice held at 30°C (30C), (ii) feet from mice held at 30°C treated with poly(I:C)/jetPEI for 12 h (30T), (iii) feet from naive control mice held at 22°C (22C), and (iv) feet from mice held at 22°C treated with poly(I:C)/jetPEI for 12 h (22T). As described above, injecting poly(I:C)/jetPEI into feet represents a model of dsRNA-induced arthritis [
