<p>Comparing 30T vs 22T (using both up and down regulated genes) and the upstream regulator (USR) function of IPA (direct only), a series of USRs were identified. Prominent among those more active at 30°C were USRs associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR), specifically XBP1, ATF6, and ATF4 (
