<p>Importantly, two transcription factors central to the type I IFN response to CHIKV, IRF3 and IRF7 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], were more active at 30°C, with USRs showing high activation Z scores (&gt;2) and significance for 30T vs 22T (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Other USRs associated with the type I IFN response were also identified; NF-кB (NFKB1/2), IRF1, STAT3, STAT6, IRF5 and STAT2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), with most of these also activated during CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. β-catenin (CTNNB1) was also recently shown to regulate RIG-I-dependent responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Only IRF8 and STAT1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed lower activity at 30°C. TRIM24, a negative regulator of the type I IFN response showed lower activity at 30°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The USR analysis showed no indication of a fever signature, consistent with data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g003">Fig 3C</xref>. Multiple USRs associated with promotion of the UPR and type I IFN responses were thus more active in feet of mice housed at 30°C.
