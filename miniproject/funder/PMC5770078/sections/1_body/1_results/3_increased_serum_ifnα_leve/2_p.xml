<p>When CHIKV infection rather than poly(I:C)/jetPEI injection was tested, the reverse result was obtained, with serum IFNα levels (on day 2) higher in mice housed at 22°C than in mice housed at 30°C (

This complication is clearly avoided by using poly(I:C)/jetPEI rather than CHIKV infection (see below). Nevertheless, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained from RNA-Seq after CHIKV infection also provided some evidence that the secondary type I IFN amplification loop is favored at 30°C (
