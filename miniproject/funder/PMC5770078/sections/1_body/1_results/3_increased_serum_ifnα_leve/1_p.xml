<p>The data so far argues that for wild-type mice infected in the feet, type I IFN responses work better when animals are housed at 30°C. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1H &amp; 1I</xref> also suggest increased systemic type I IFN activity at 30°C. Injection of poly(I:C) induces very rapid and transient serum type I IFN levels [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Furthermore, injection of poly(I:C)/jetPEI into feet represents a model of dsRNA-induced arthritis, with jetPEI (a transfection reagent) helping to deliver poly(I:C) to the cytoplasm, mimicking cytoplasmic viral RNA replication and stimulating cytoplasmic RNA sensors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Mice were housed at 22°C or 30°C and were injected s.c. in the feet with poly(I:C)/jetPEI, and IFNα and IFNβ levels were then measured in serum. IFNβ levels at all time points tested, and IFNα levels at 2 hours post injection, were not significantly different. However, at 4, 6 and 8 hours, IFNα levels were significantly 2–3 fold higher for mice housed at 30°C. IFNβ (and to some extent IFNα4) are generated in the first phase of the type I IFN response, with subsequent signaling via the IFNα/β receptor leading to up-regulation of

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Increasing the temperature of feet thus appears to promote the secondary amplification loop, rather than the initial sensing of dsRNA and the production of IFNβ [
