<p>To further investigate the effects of temperature on IFNα activity, Vero cells which can respond to, but cannot make IFNα/β, were cultured at 37°C, 35°C or 33°C. The cells were then treated with IFNα and infected with CHIKV. At 37°C, 50% protection against CHIKV-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) required ≈1.5 U/ml of IFNα (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). At 35°C, ≈50 U/ml of IFNα were required, and at 33°C no significant protection against CPE was observed even at 100 U/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). These data are consistent with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and other 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data using different mammalian viruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and argue that type I IFN receptor signaling and/or downstream anti-viral responses are diminished at the lower temperatures. In the absence of IFNα, CHIKV replication in Vero cells was not significantly affected by these small temperature changes (
