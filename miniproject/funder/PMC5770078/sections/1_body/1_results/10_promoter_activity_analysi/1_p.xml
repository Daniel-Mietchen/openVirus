<p>A recently released program called “Integrated System for Motif Activity Response Analysis” (ISMARA) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] allows for an independent analysis of the RNA-Seq data and provides an activity score for known promoters. The majority of the transcription factors identified as more active at 30°C by the IPA USR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) also showed a trend towards increased activity in the ISMARA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) and the ISMARA outputs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s011">S1 Table</xref>), was XBP1 (a key player in the UPR), with the ISMARA showing a clear increase in XBP1 promoter activity at 30°C after poly(I:C)/jetPEI treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, XBP1 30T vs 22T). The same trend (although not significant) was also seen for 30C vs 22C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, XBP1 30C vs 22C). The spliced form of XBP1 is transcriptionally active [
