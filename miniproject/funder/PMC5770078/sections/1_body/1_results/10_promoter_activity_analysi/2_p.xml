<p>The top scoring site (by Z score) in the ISMARA output for 30T vs 22T was ATF3, with ATF3 showing reduced activity in feet of mice housed at 30째C (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s011">S1 Table</xref>). ATF3 was also prominent (although less significant) for 30C vs 22C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s011">S1 Table</xref>). ATF3 is well described as a stress-responsive transcription factor [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and has been associated with repression of type I ISGs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] (and proinflammatory cytokine expression [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]). The reduced ATF3 activity at 30째C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) is thus consistent with increased antiviral activity in feet of mice housed at 30째C. As expected for a repressor, the ISMARA showed a negative Expression/Activity correlation for ATF3 (rho = -0.76, p = 0.007), whereas XBP1 and HSF1 showed significant positive correlations (
