<p>The ISMARA also highlighted increased heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activity after poly(I:C)/jetPEI treatment for mice held at 30Â°C (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006788.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). HSF1 activity is induced during conditions that cause an increase in unfolded or misfolded proteins, primarily in the cytoplasm and nucleus [
