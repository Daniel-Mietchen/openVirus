  <title>Moving mice from 22°C to 30°C and vice versa.</title>
  <p>(A) Foot swelling in mice infected s.c. in the feet and held at 22°C (22°C) or held at 22°C and then at the end of day 4 post infection moved to 30°C (22°C→30°C); (n = 12 feet from 6 mice per group). (B) Foot swelling in mice infected s.c. in the feet and held at 30°C (30°C) or held at 30°C and then at the end of day 4 post infection moved to 22°C (30°C→22°C); (n = 12 feet from 6 mice per group). (C) Temperature measurements were taken in the rear leg pits and the surface of feet of mice housed at 22°C or 30°C on the indicated days post s.c. infection in the feet (n = 6 mice per group). Measurements were taken using a pediatric infra-red thermometer, and were taken in quadruplicate to produce a mean for each mouse, with the mean of 6 mice and SE shown.</p>
