  <p>Mice were housed at 22°C or 30°C and were infected s.c. in the pectoral region with RRV. (A) Viremia. (Statistics by repeat measures ANOVA for days 3–6, n = 5 mice per group). (B) Feet titers. (Statistics by Mann-Whitney U test, n = 5 feet from 5 mice per group). (C) Disease severity score. This is primarily a score of hind limb paralysis.
