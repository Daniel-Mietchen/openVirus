  <title>Serum IFNα levels and responses after CHIKV infection.</title>
  <p>(A) Mice were housed at 22°C or 30°C (n = 5/6 per group) and were infected s.c. in the feet with CHIKV as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Serum IFNα levels were then determined at the indicated times post infection. The numbers above the bars represent the mean viremias in log
   <sub>10</sub>CCID
   <sub>50</sub>/ml. On days 2 and 3 the mean viremias were 3–4 logs higher in mice housed at 22°C. (B) RNA-Seq analysis of day 2 feet from mice infected with CHIKV was performed as described [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with mice housed at 30°C or 22°C. DEGs for both temperatures were determined relative to mock infected mice housed at the same temperature. DEGs (q&lt;0.01, fold change &gt;2) were analyzed using the Upstream Regulator (USR) feature of Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA). As expected, given the higher viremia in mice housed at 22°C (see above), most USR pathways associated with the type I IFN response had higher Z scores for mice housed at 22°C than for mice housed at 30°C. However, despite the difference in viral loads, USR Z scores for well annotated IFNαs that are involved in the secondary amplification loop were actually higher for mice housed at 30°C than for mice housed at 22°C. (C) Using the same DEG lists as in B and the “Top Diseases and Bio Functions” feature of IPA, “Immunological Disease” and “Cellular Movement” showed higher significance (lower p value ranges) for mice housed at 22°C than for mice housed at 30°C. This is consistent with the H&amp;E data shown in
