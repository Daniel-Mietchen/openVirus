  <title>Joints at lower temperatures are commonly affected during alphaviral arthropathies.</title>
  <p>(A) Limb and body temperatures in humans (adapted from New Human Physiology 2
   <sup>nd</sup> Edition. Chapter 21: Thermo-Regulation, Temperature and Radiation. Eds. Paulev PE, Zubieta-Calleja G. Copenhagen, Denmark). (B) The number of patients (n) and the percentage of CHIKV patients (%) with arthropathy in the indicated joints (n = 71 patients) (taken from Borgherini 
   <italic>et al</italic>., 2007 [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). (C) The percentage of RRV patients with arthritic disease in the indicated joints (for example; 69% of RRV patients report pain and/or swelling in their wrist joints) (produced by Environmental Health Directorate, Dept. Health, WA, Australia, 2006). (D) Joints affected in Mayaro virus patients (taken from Halsey 
   <italic>et al</italic>., 2013 [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). M03, M06 and M12 represent 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. The numerator represents the number of patients reporting arthropathy in the indicated joints, the denominator the number of patients present at the indicated follow-up time. The percentage is numerator/denominator x100.
