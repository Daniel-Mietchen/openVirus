  <p>(A) Activity and Z scores for promoter site activities for selected transcription factors associated with the type I interferon response. Analyses as for 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>. The activity of the indicated transcription factors nearly always tended to be higher at 30°C, although only XBP1 and ATF3 (see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) reached Z scores &gt;2 and non-overlapping error bars, conditions for clear significance recommend by ISMARA protocols. A unique IRF7 site is not available in ISMARA. (B) Expression/Activity correlations. ISMARA Expression/Activity correlations showing Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) and p values for transcription factor sites shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006788.g006">Fig 6C</xref>. (C) HSF1 target genes (identified by ISMARA) for HSF1 for 30T vs 22T, with heat shock proteins highlighted in yellow.
