  <title>GADD34 (Ppp1r15a) mRNA expression after CHIKV infection and dsRNA treatment.</title>
  <p>A major consequence of the UPR and responses to dsRNA (via PKR [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]) is translation inhibition, which appears to promote anti-viral responses via reduced translation of inhibitors (e.g. A20, SHIP-1, IкBα) [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. GADD34-mediated relief of translational repression (via eIF2α dephosphorylation and/or stress granule dissolution) is required for IFNβ protein synthesis [

   <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. (A) GADD34 mRNA is up-regulated in feet and lymph nodes 2 days post CHIKV infection (using the RNA-Seq data set described in Wilson 
   <italic>et al</italic> 2017); a result consistent with [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006788.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. (B) Although GADD34 mRNA was also up-regulated in feet at 12 h after poly(I:C)/JetPEI injection, there were no significant differences for mice housed at 30°C.
