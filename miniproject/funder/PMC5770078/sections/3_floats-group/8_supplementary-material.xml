  <p>(A) Library sizes. (T refers to Treatment with poly(I:C)/jetPEI and C to no treatment Controls). (B) Read numbers, data yield and percentage of reads mapping to the mouse genome. The per base sequence quality was high, with &gt;84% of bases above Q30 for all 12 samples. (C) MDS clustering for all samples, and for 30T vs 22T samples. (D) Boxplots showing the distribution of expression values for all samples before and after normalization. (E) Smear plots: log-fold-change plotted against the log counts per million. Genes showing significant differences (FDR&lt;0.05) are in red. Blue lines represent log2 fold change of 1 and -1 (i.e. fold change of 2 and -2).</p>
