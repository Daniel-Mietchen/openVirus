  <p>Using the commercial GeneGo MetaCore software (
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://portal.genego.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://portal.genego.com</ext-link>), genes associated with (i) the unfolded protein response (UPR) (blue) and (ii) Type I IFN response together with Response to RNA virus (green) were uploaded (GO module). Networks were constructed and merged (Build network module) and expression data from (A) 30Cvs22C or (B) 30Tvs22T applied as a filter to the merged networks. The two networks intersect at a number of nodes, and even without treatment feet of mice housed at 30Â°C show up-regulation (red circles) of genes associated with anti-viral responses.
