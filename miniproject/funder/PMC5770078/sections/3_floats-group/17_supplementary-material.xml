  <title>Molecular and Cellular Functions analyses.</title>
  <p>Genes associated with cell growth, survival, movement, morphology and development are up-regulated in feet of mice held at 30°C both in the absence of treatment (30C vs 22C) and after poly(I:C)/jetPEI treatment (30T vs 22T). IPA “Molecular and Cellular Functions” analysis (direct only) for all DEGs (up and down regulated) was undertaken for 30Cvs22C and 30Tvs22T (FDR&lt;0.01, CPM &gt;1 in at least 3 samples). (“Molecular and Cellular Functions” is a sub-category of the “Diseases and Functions” feature, which returns a number of “Diseases or Functions Annotations” for each of the listed categories; thus providing a p value range).</p>
