  <title>Expression of selected genes associated with anti-viral activities.</title>
  <p>(A) XBP1 mRNA levels after poly(I:C)/jetPEI injection of mice housed at 22°C or 30°C derived from the RNA-Seq data (Statistics by t tests). Spliced XBP1 levels were determined using the Sashimi feature of the Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV) v2.3.34. (B) Using the DEG lists for 30T vs 22T (top graph) and 30C vs 22C (bottom graph) (q&lt;0.01) the mean fold change (no log transformation applied) for selected genes where the change in expression would be associated with promotion of anti-viral activities (red) or where the change in expression would be associated with reduction of anti-viral activities (green). IRF7 is bolded. (C) IFNβ mRNA expression. Normalized counts for IFNβ mRNA for each condition; n = 3 for each. Poly(I:C)/JetPEI induced IFNβ mRNA expression at both temperatures (i.e. 22C vs 22T and 30C vs 30T), but levels were not significantly different for 30T and 22T.</p>
