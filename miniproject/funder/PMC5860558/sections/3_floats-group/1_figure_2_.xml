  <p>Simulated and reconstructed transmission trees. A simulated tree (A) was generated with bottleneck size 10 and mutation rate 0.001 per genome per generation. Cases are represented as numbered circles linked by arrows representing transmission routes. Based on the simulated genetic data from this outbreak, trees were reconstructed according to the maximum variant approach (B) and the minimum genetic distance approach (C) described in “Methods.” Arrows denoting unambiguous routes (weight = 1) are solid, while dashed arrows denote edges with weight &lt;1. Networks were plotted with the igraph package in R (Foundation for Statistical Computing) (
