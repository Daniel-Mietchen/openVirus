  <p>Reliability of estimated transmission routes. A) A comparison of the minimum distance (black) and the maximum variant (gray) approaches. The true path distance between estimated transmission pairs gives insight into the extent to which transmission links are misspecified. A perfect reconstruction would have mean path length of 1; greater values indicate increasing misspecification. Maximum variant path lengths are averaged over identified transmission pairs—that is, excluding hosts with no shared variants. B) The mean weight assigned to transmission links for each tree reconstruction method, under a range of scenarios and methodologies. Results are shown for a mutation rate of 5 × 10
   <sup>−4</sup> per genome per generation and were averaged across 10 simulated outbreaks for each scenario.
