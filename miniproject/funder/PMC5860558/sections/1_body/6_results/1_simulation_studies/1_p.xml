<p>As expected, the proportion of cases in which a SV was observed in at least 1 other host increased rapidly with mutation rate and bottleneck size (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F1">1</xref>A). The majority of SVs were observed in exactly 2 individuals, with the proportion shared among larger groups declining rapidly as the size of the group increased (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F1">1</xref>B). For each simulation, we constructed a weighted transmission tree according to the 6 methods outlined previously. An example simulated outbreak of a pathogen with characteristics similar to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Appendix 1</xref>) is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F2">2</xref>, along with reconstructions based upon two of these methods. While many edges are bidirectional and symmetric, asymmetry can occur under most methods due to the lack of commutativity (i.e., even if B is the closest host to A, A may not be the closest host to B).
