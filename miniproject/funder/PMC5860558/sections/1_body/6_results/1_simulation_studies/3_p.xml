<p>In addition to the reliability of individual links, we also considered the overall accuracy of a transmission tree reconstruction. This was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) statistic. For small bottlenecks, variant-based methods provide a poor tree reconstruction by this metric (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F4">4</xref>). We note that here we regard assigning no source (e.g., where no SVs exist) as an incorrect classification, leading to values below 0.5, the value expected under random source assignment. A tight bottleneck leads to little diversity persisting across transmission events, and as such, SVs are rarely observed, leading to a sparsity of informed links across the network. However, larger bottlenecks led to a considerably better performance under this measure for the variant-based approaches, which exceeded even the weighted distance approach with a sufficiently large bottleneck size and mutation rate (Figure
