<p>We used two metrics to assess the reliability of individual estimated transmission routes and compared the different methods described above. First, we considered the true path distance between inferred transmission pairs. We found that under the maximum variant tree, the mean path distance was typically less than 2, outperforming the minimum distance approach (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F3">3</xref>A). Second, we examined the mean weight assigned to the true source of each host. In the case of small (&lt;5) bottleneck sizes, methods based on SVs perform poorly because the likelihood of a monoclonal infection is high, resulting in most true links being assigned a weight of zero. Furthermore, those links that are inferred by SVs in small-bottleneck settings identify direct transmission with high confidence. The hybrid approaches perform best for small bottlenecks, incorporating SV information when available but not relying upon it. For larger bottlenecks, the distance-based approaches were markedly outperformed by the variant-based approaches (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F3">3</xref>B). As the rate of mutation increases, SV approaches outperform those based on distance alone to an increasing degree as mutation generates increasing diversity in the infecting population (
