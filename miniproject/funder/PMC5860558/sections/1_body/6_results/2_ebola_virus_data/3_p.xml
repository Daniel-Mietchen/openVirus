<p>In the second data set (Park et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx182C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)) 26 of 150 (for which replicate sequencing and variant calling was performed) shared a variant with at least 1 other host (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F5">5</xref>B). There were 5 pairs of individuals sharing a unique variant. As before, 1 variant was shared by multiple hosts, but unlike the previous data set these were not geographically or temporally clustered, coming from different regions and spanning several weeks. Furthermore, while some of these samples clustered on the phylogenetic tree, many fell in different clades (
 <xref rid="kwx182C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), suggesting the group is unlikely to represent a single transmission cluster but rather multiple transmission events in combination with homoplasy.
