<p>We next examined previously published data sets for Ebola in Sierra Leone, for which sequence data are available, and we can determine the presence and properties of intrahost variants. In order to reduce the risk of counting variant calling errors as true intrahost variants, we identified only variants in which the minor within-host allele frequency was at least 5% (routes estimated under a 1% threshold are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figure 4</xref>). Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F5">5</xref> shows the transmission trees reconstructed for each data set under the weighted variant approach, using no epidemiologic information. In the first data set (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx182F5">5</xref>A, (
 <xref rid="kwx182C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)) 19 of 78 hosts were found to share a variant with at least 1 other individual. Four pairs of patients shared more than 1 variant (3 pairs with 2 SVs and 1 pair with 4), while 1 additional pair shared 1 unique variant. Consistent with transmission, each of these pairs originated from the same geographic location, and permutation testing revealed that this geographic similarity was significantly higher than would be expected via random selection (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0075). Pairs were also temporally clustered; 3 of these links were sampled 2 or fewer days apart, while the remaining 2 were sampled 12 and 22 days apart, which is plausible given serial interval estimates for Ebola virus infection of 15.3 Â± 9.3 days (
 <xref rid="kwx182C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Under the minimum distance tree, 2 of these pairs were reproduced, 2 pairs belonged to a much larger group of samples with identical consensus sequences, and 1 pair, differing by a single nucleotide according to consensus sequences, remained unconnected due to the presence of other identical sequences (
