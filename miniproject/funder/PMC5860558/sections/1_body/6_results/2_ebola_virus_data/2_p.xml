<p>While a consistent result of our simulations was the sharing of variants among small numbers of hosts, rarely more than 2, in the Ebola data collected by Gire et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx182C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), 1 variant was shared by 11 hosts. Samples with this variant are highly clustered geographically (10 of 11 in the same chiefdom, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.022) and temporally (observed within an 18-day period), as well as phylogenetically, lending support to this group representing a transmission cluster.
