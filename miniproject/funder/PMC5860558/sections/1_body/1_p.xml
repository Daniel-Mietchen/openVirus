<p>Deep sequencing can potentially provide new insights into within-host diversity. Currently, sequencing a mixed population sample to sufficient depth to identify minor nucleotide variants has mostly been limited to viral samples. While consensus sequences may appear identical for 2 samples, comparing minor variants can offer additional resolution. For instance, if the same nucleotide variation is observed at the same locus in pathogen samples from 2 individuals (henceforth referred to as a “shared variant” (SV)), this could be considered strong evidence for direct transmission, particularly if the variant is not observed in any other host. This naturally relies on the possibility that a pathogen population of size greater than 1 survives the transmission bottleneck; otherwise, each infection must initially be monoclonal, implying that any variation found within distinct hosts must have arisen independently. There is evidence for larger bottlenecks occurring in viral pathogens such as influenza (
