<p>As yet, there are still few studies in which adequate data have been collected in order to use SVs as a feature to identify transmission routes. Deep and high-quality sequencing is required to reliably call minor variants, as well as dense sampling of the outbreak population such that the majority of infection sources are included in the study population. It is likely that such data will become more commonly collected in the near future, for both viral and bacterial pathogens, as the associated sequencing costs fall and the benefits become more evident. This work demonstrates that deep sequence data can be informative in outbreak investigations and epidemiologic studies, and it should motivate both the wider collection of such data and the further development of methodologies that might accommodate scenarios that stray further from neutral evolutionary dynamics. It is noticeable that bottleneck size in nature, as opposed to minimal infectious dose, has not received the attention it deserves. The importance of this parameter for these methods, as well as other factors such as the evolution of virulence (
