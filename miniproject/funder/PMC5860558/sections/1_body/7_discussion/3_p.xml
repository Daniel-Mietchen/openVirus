<p>The additional information we derive from SVs can inform the transmission tree in two distinct ways, depending on the region of parameter space. First, small but nonsingular bottlenecks (e.g., for airborne influenza transmission (
 <xref rid="kwx182C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) or sexually transmitted HIV (
 <xref rid="kwx182C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)) produce few inferred transmission pairs, but these are highly accurate. The small bottleneck means that the probability of observing a SV between individuals who are in the same transmission cluster, but not directly linked, is negligible. Second, SV data for pathogens with larger transmission bottlenecks (e.g., Ebola (
 <xref rid="kwx182C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), influenza transmitted via contact (
 <xref rid="kwx182C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), or intravenous drugâ€“associated HIV transmission (
 <xref rid="kwx182C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>)) provide good information on the overall tree structure and transmission clusters, but individual links may be more uncertain. In all cases, higher mutation rates make the observation of SVs more probable, which typically results in better inference of transmission routes.
