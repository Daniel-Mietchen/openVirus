<p>For the great majority of parameter space, excluding only very low mutation rates and tight bottlenecks, these methods outperform genetic-distance comparison methods, which have increasingly been used to identify potential transmission events (
 <xref rid="kwx182C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx182C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx182C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The limitations of distance-based methods that characterize a single genome are well appreciated. We note that although, for the purpose of comparison, additional data sources were not included in our inference of transmission routes, incorporating these independently would be a relatively straightforward step with these methods. Most simply, sampling dates could be used to provide directionality to inferred connections.
