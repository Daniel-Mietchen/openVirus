<p>Studying the Ebola data showed that both data sets contained a large group of hosts sharing the same variant, which was rare in all our simulations. The observation can be explained in at least two ways: recurrent mutation (as might arise through selection) or an anomalously large number of contacts with large bottleneck size (such as might be associated with a funeral-based exposure). Park et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx182C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) suggest that the large group in the second data set likely arose through a combination of patient-to-patient transmission and recurrent mutation. Subsets of this group do cluster on the phylogenetic tree, and having identified clusters of hosts with SVs, we might partition these groups by genetic background (e.g., ruling out transmission between hosts with &gt;1-nucleotide difference present across nonvariant sites).
