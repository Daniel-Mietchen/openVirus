<p>Sample contamination may be an additional source of error. Cross-contamination may potentially lead to SVs observed between unlinked hosts. However, in many settings we do not believe this would present a major concern. If no minor variants are contained in the contaminating sample, SVs would not link this to the contaminated sample. Still, it remains important to verify that observed SVs are consistent with transmission and to minimize the risk of contamination as much as possible. The second Ebola data set highlights the potential for false-positive connections to be identified between spatiotemporally inconsistent pairs. SVs observed across several samples with differing genetic backgrounds may be indicative of contamination. While such rules can eliminate obvious sources of error, further work is required to formally evaluate the risk of contamination based on deep sequence data.</p>
