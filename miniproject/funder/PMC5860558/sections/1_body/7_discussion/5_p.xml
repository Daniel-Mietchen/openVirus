<p>We applied these methods to Ebola data collected from Sierra Leone in 2014. While the first data set is thought to represent relatively dense coverage of the initial stages of the epidemic in the country, with around 70% of cases sampled (
 <xref rid="kwx182C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx182C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), the later data set comprised a sparser sample. While this reduces the expected number of linked cases in the data set, the reliability of transmission routes identified via SVs remains largely unaffected (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figures 6 and 7</xref>). As such, while only relatively few transmission routes were identified in the data sets, this is likely a function of both the proportion of missing data and the relatively low mutation rate of Ebola virus (
 <xref rid="kwx182C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx182C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Confidence in the transmission pairs identified was reinforced by investigating temporal and geographic clustering, which proved to be significant, and while the aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of transmission-route identification via genomic data alone, methodology combining spatial and temporal data sources will naturally provide further insight. Identifying even a small proportion of direct-transmission pairs can be of great interest in studying pathogen-level transmission dynamics as well as conducting outbreak investigations.
