<p>We have demonstrated the power of deep sequencing data to identify transmission routes with greater resolution than analogous methods using the genome of a single isolate. While homoplasy and contamination might generate false-positive results and, in some settings, might be relatively common, consideration of additional data sources (temporal, spatial, and similarity of genetic background) can sometimes identify and rule out such cases. Rigorous collection of epidemiologic data remains a crucial component of outbreak investigation, and combining this with deep sequencing and SV analysis can provide unprecedented insight into individual-level transmission dynamics. The development of models that suitably incorporate all data sources remains an important goal.</p>
