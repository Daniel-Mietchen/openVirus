<p>A hybrid approach that combines SVs and the sequence of either an individual, sequenced genome, or the consensus offers substantial benefit in the case of small bottleneck sizes (&lt;5), where we predict a method based on SV alone would struggle. Because transmission routes are assessed independently of one another, estimated transmission trees frequently comprise several unconnected nodes or clusters. Such unconnected clusters could be linked to one another if further structure is required, using the weighted distance approach on pooled within-cluster samples. Here we have simply used genetic distance, which is predicted to be efficient and reliable under the relatively short time scale of an outbreak, but more sophisticated models of sequence evolution could be applied.</p>
