<p>We have described some simple methods for reconstructing transmission trees using SVs, testing how well this approach performs for a range of parameters governing the rates of diversification within and between hosts. We have then applied the methods to data from the 2014 Ebola outbreak to identify links, using the genomic data alone, that are likely to be consistent with transmission given time and location.</p>
