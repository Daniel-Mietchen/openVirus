<p>Another deliberate simplification in the present work is the assumption of neutral evolution. While this is plainly faulty over longer time scales, over the relatively short timescale of an outbreak it is a first approximation, and this is supported by real data from outbreaks (
 <xref rid="kwx182C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx182C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and even longer periods (
 <xref rid="kwx182C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) showing evidence of incomplete purifying selection. Selection may not, however, have as severe an effect on these methods as we might assume. If a specific variant is maintained through balancing selection, it is likely to be found in multiple hosts and, as a result, will be less informative as to specific transmission links; if several hosts are connected by the same SV, this will be misleading only if no additional variants are observed. In contrast, diversifying selection by the host immune system is expected to produce the mutational hotspots we have studied here, which again have little impact. A similar argument can be made that sequencing errors will be less important than expected, because they are likely to be found in just one sample and hence be uninformative as to links to other samples. A more formal approach to this problem would be to test for selection and down-weight the identified loci from the analysis.
