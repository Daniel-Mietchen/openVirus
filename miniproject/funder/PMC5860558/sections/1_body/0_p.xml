<p>Genomic data offer new insights into epidemiologic and evolutionary dynamics, and sequencing pathogen samples is becoming increasingly routine, providing new insights for a range of issues of public health importance (
 <xref rid="kwx182C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Pathogen genomic data allow us to determine the phylogeny of isolates, which in turn sheds light on the potential transmission networks between the hosts from whom they were collected. Identifying routes of infection enables the estimation of risk factors for disease transmission, which in turn can inform the implementation of infection control strategies. As such, inference of transmission trees using genomic data is an increasingly well-studied field (
 <xref rid="kwx182C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="kwx182C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Although low-resolution pathogen typing has been used for some time to discriminate between independent outbreaks (
 <xref rid="kwx182C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="kwx182C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), whole-genome sequencing provides additional resolution with which genetic distance between identical phenotypes may be ascertained (
 <xref rid="kwx182C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="kwx182C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, this too has limits. Studies have shown that while transmission clusters may be identified with genomic data, individual-level transmission routes can rarely be identified with a great degree of certainty (
 <xref rid="kwx182C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx182C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Characterizing an infected host by a single pathogen genome (isolation and purification of a single colony for bacteria, or using the consensus sequence for viral pathogens) is common practice yet neglects within-host diversity. The variation in sampled genetic distances can be large relative to the expected number of mutations between hosts, rendering the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms a rather crude measure of relatedness on an individual level (
 <xref rid="kwx182C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As such, particularly for rapidly evolving pathogens, or those whose mode of transmission is associated with a large and potentially diverse inoculum (“transmission bottleneck”—the number of pathogens transmitted in an infection event), single-genome sampling can cause hosts to appear misleadingly similar or dissimilar.
