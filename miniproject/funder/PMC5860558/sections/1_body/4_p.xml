<p>In the present study, we investigated the predictive power of SVs for identifying transmission routes. In addition to pathogen genomes, many other sources of data may contribute information towards inference of transmission routes, including temporal and spatial data, contact patterns, and expression of symptoms. However, here we aimed to examine the information contributed by genomic data alone and, in particular, the additional benefit offered by considering SVs.</p>
