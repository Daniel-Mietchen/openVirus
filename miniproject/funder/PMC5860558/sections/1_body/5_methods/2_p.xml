<p>These 6 simple heuristics by no means comprise an exhaustive list of approaches to identify routes of transmission but are instead a range of readily implemented, distance-based approaches that require neither knowledge of evolutionary dynamics nor infection or sampling times. As has previously been demonstrated, simple methods based on genomic data alone can provide powerful insights into transmission dynamics (
