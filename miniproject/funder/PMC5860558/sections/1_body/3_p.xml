<p>Pathogens vary considerably in their bottleneck size, mutation rates, and transmission dynamics. It remains unclear how methods based on SVs are expected to perform in different regions of this parameter space. Establishing this is a crucial component of the interpretation of SVs and the value of the approach.</p>
