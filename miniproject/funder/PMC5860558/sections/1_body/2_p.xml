<p>The connection between SV presence and direct transmission has previously been suggested. Gire et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx182C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) noted the presence of SVs in Ebola virus samples from individuals who were potentially linked by transmission. Data collected from 2 influenza A animal transmission studies were used to explore the presence of SVs between hosts, and it was shown that such data were consistent with known contact patterns (
 <xref rid="kwx182C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This study used known contact patterns to identify characteristics of SVs that were more likely to be associated with transmission, allowing variants to be split into those consistent and inconsistent with transmission, minimizing false connections. Poon et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx182C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) identified routes of influenza transmission occurring during a household contact study using both consensus whole-genome sequence data and the presence of SVs. In the case of bacterial pathogens, the diversity in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections, which can be considerable, has been linked to transmission in a veterinary hospital (
