<p>PrEP is a potential user-controlled HIV prevention option with important utility, especially when condom negotiation is difficult [
 <xref rid="pone.0227632.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Information about motivations for the general at-risk population in a public sector setting choosing PrEP is limited worldwide and particularly for generalized HIV epidemics like Zimbabwe. The objective of this study was to, therefore, explore the experiences of clients that both accept and decline PrEP offered at a public facility. Specifically, we aimed to understand the factors that motivate clients to accept, decline, continue, or discontinue PrEP. Given the resource limitations of the MoHCC, it is important to understand how to effectively deliver PrEP in the public health system, which may not have the level of resources of well-funded early demonstration projects.
