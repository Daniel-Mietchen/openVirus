<p>Perceptions and consequences of living with HIV also motivate some people to take PrEP. Generally, participants strongly believed that antiretrovirals (ARVs) work and that HIV-positive people could have “normal healthy lives” if they adhere to medication. They noted that it would be difficult to cope with the infection but a positive mindset was essential to survival. Despite these beliefs, participants were still strongly motivated to prevent HIV. In considering the potential impact of HIV, many participants thought about the impact on their families and their children. Many participants described a fear of loss of economic productivity if they were infected with HIV. They expressed that HIV positive people are too weak to work in their fields or engage in day-to-day activities, and therefore, they and their families would suffer. Female participants expressed a desire to ensure that they remain healthy to care of their children so they wanted to protect themselves from HIV. They expressed concern that if they were no longer there to take care of their children, no one would care for their children as they would.</p>
