<p>Participants who considered themselves to be at high risk of contracting HIV were often interested in PrEP and continued taking it. Most individuals acknowledged being a part of an established risk group, such as sero-discordant couples (SDCs) or commercial sex workers (CSWs), or were concerned their partner may expose them to HIV due their confirmed or suspected extramarital affairs. Almost all men who took up PrEP were in SDCs and the other variations in risk profiles were among women. SDCs indicated a willingness to take PrEP indefinitely in order to live a “normal” sexual life with their HIV-positive partner.</p>
