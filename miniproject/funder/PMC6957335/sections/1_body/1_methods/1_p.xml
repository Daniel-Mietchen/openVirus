<p>A qualitative study was carried out from January to June 2018. This study was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe (Protocol MRCZ-A-2234) and the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (Protocol Pro00023165). The MoHCC offered PrEP in two semi-public Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC) clinics, a parastatal under the MoHCC mandated to coordinate the provision of family planning services in Zimbabwe. The MoHCC plan for PrEP rollout was also planned to start in these ZNFPC sites before scaling up to other public sector facilities. These facilities were chosen because they were expected to be good environments to reach members of the general population who were seeking services such as cervical cancer screening, VMMC, and family planning services. The two sites were selected because they had the highest HIV testing volumes in their respective settlements. The two PrEP learning sites were selected purposefully to include one urban and one rural site, and PrEP implementation at the learning sites was operated with support from CHAI and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. There were no other sites offering PrEP to the general population near the rural site. In the urban setting, two other partner-funded sites were offering PrEP: one site with outreach specifically targeted towards female sex workers and the other with a more general population focus.</p>
