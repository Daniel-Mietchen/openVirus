<p>This study was conducted to inform program planning for public sector PrEP rollout by looking at barriers and facilitators to initiation, adherence and retention in an effort to better understand how HCWs can discuss PrEP with clients. The findings from this study provide insight into the types of issues that HCWs and other program staff should be prepared for as they interact with clients around PrEP. For example, sexual relationships can be complex, and HCWs must, therefore, be prepared to counsel clients on their risk level based on a range of situations. Once clients begin taking PrEP, HCWs must ensure that they understand how long they must take PrEP prior to and after possible exposure to ensure maximal protection from PrEP, which may take up to seven days prior to exposure. The counseling needs to stress that daily PrEP is recommended for the majority of persons who cannot predict when they will have sex. However, if their risk changes (e.g., they are not sexually active or have one partner known to be HIV negative), they can discontinue PrEP after at least 28 days after their last exposure.

Future studies should focus on the perspective of HCWs as they perform counseling and rollout of PrEP to identify ongoing challenges.
