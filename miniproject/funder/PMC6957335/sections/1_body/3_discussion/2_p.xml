<p>Among the participants in this study, who were largely in FSWs or in SDCs or had a partner of unknown status, the perception of risk in these groups of people facilitated their uptake of PrEP, which is consistent with other studies in the United States where PrEP was integrated into a family planning clinic [
 <xref rid="pone.0227632.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For all groups, the perceived severity of living with HIV was a key driver of PrEP uptake and the use of PrEP was associated with comfort during sex with an HIV sero-discordant partner. This was also reported in a study among gay bisexual men in HIV sero-discordant male relationships [

In many parts of Africa, the risk of HIV infection is found in marriages where husbands may have acquired the virus through extramarital sex [

 <xref rid="pone.0227632.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] such that condom negotiation or refusing sex may be difficult. The theme of limited ability to negotiate condom use has emerged in other studies, particularly when considering relationships between AGYW and older men in Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0227632.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The quotations from several participants capture the conservative nature of rural Zimbabwe, where staying in a marriage is more respectable than divorce, and therefore, PrEP becomes a means to keep the peace in a marriage. However, a study conducted in Kenya on PrEP acceptability revealed that divorce rates among SDCs were high, highlighting a need to counsel SDCs on how to avoid HIV transmission within the marriage [
 <xref rid="pone.0227632.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With regards to male partners in SDCs, the results from this work also show that the men who took up PrEP in this study were in SDCs; however, there was one male decliner preferring condoms to any biomedical HIV prevention method.
