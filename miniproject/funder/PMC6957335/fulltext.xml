To date, most PrEP programs in limited-resource settings have been implemented by partner organizations for specific target populations, but the government of Zimbabwe aims to make PrEP available to the broader population at substantial risk in public sector clinics. However, there is limited information on general population perspectives about PrEP in Zimbabwe.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A qualitative study was conducted to explore clients&#x02019; motivation to take or decline PrEP and continue or discontinue PrEP. Through a PrEP pilot in one urban family planning clinic and one rural youth center in Zimbabwe, 150 HIV-negative clients screened as being at high risk of HIV and were offered PrEP between January and June 2018. Sixty semi-structured interviews were conducted with clients who agreed to follow-up (including 5 decliners, all from the rural youth center, and 55 accepters, with 42 from the rural youth center and 13 from the urban family planning clinic). Interviews were conducted after either the first or second PrEP follow-up appointment or after the client declined PrEP. Interviews were audio recorded, de-identified, transcribed, and coded thematically.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>PrEP uptake was driven by risk perception for HIV, and in many cases, that risk was introduced by the unsafe behavior or HIV-positive status of a partner. Among sero-discordant couples (SDCs), the desire to safely conceive a child was also cited as a factor in taking PrEP. Clients who opted for PrEP preferred it to other forms of HIV prevention. SDCs reported decreased condom use after PrEP initiation and in some cases were using PrEP while trying to conceive a child. After initiating PrEP, clients had more confidence in their sexual relationships and less stress associated with negotiating condom use. Family and partner support was critical to starting and continuing PrEP, but some clients stopped PrEP or missed appointments due to side effects or logistical challenges such as transportation.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results of this study can be used to provide operational guidance for national public sector roll-out of PrEP as part of combination HIV prevention in Zimbabwe. Based on feedback and experiences of clients, the training materials for health workers can be refined to ensure that health workers are prepared to counsel clients on the decision to start and/or continue PrEP and answer common client questions. Program advertisements should also be targeted with key messages that speak to client experiences.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trial Registry Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pactr.samrc.ac.za/TrialDisplay.aspx?TrialID=2651">PACTR201710002651160</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Department for International Development (UKAID)</institution></funding-source><award-id>DFID 205105</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>OPP1135316</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>UKAID funding support (DFID Project Number: 205105) was used for the Demand-Driven Evaluations for Decisions (3DE) program.

Initially, in 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended PrEP for special populations such as sero-discordant couples (SDCs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgender women who have sex with men [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, in 2015, WHO expanded their recommendation to include all population groups at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of a comprehensive package of HIV prevention interventions [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The UNAIDS fast track programme identified Zimbabwe as one of the countries that contributes to 89% of new HIV infections globally [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These countries are encouraged to take up new innovations such as PrEP in order to meet their 95-95-95 targets by 2030 and reduce the number of new infections. Zimbabwe has a generalized epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and would benefit from offering comprehensive HIV prevention and treatment services to the general population.</p><p>Other evidence exists on the factors related to uptake and continuation of PrEP in sub-Saharan Africa; however, this evidence comes almost exclusively from participants in clinical trials or other population-targeted programs. PrEP has been described by clients as an HIV prevention tool that allows the user to control their life with minimal cooperation from their partner, especially when condom negotiation is difficult or as additional protection [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Perceived risk is suggested to be key for uptake and support for adherence to PrEP by partners and has been highlighted as critical to continued use [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa, adherence was also facilitated by establishing a routine for taking PrEP [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, stigma was also expressed as a barrier to taking PrEP [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In Zimbabwe, PrEP was included in the 2016 National Guidelines for Antiretroviral Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV. In Zimbabwe, an estimated 38,000 new adult HIV infections occurred in 2018, up from 32,000 in 2016. Young women aged 15&#x02013;24 years account for 9,000 new infections compared to 4,200 young men in the same age group. Women account for 60% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Infection rates are higher among sub-populations, such as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), SDCs, and MSM. PrEP was first introduced in Zimbabwe in private sector demonstration projects for the aforementioned populations. However, the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) plans to add PrEP to the HIV prevention package in the public sector based on a client&#x02019;s risk profile. The risk profile is built from information on sexual practices and history in the six months preceding their appointment using a risk assessment tool (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227632.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>) and follows the eligibility guidelines laid out in the MoHCC&#x02019;s 2016 National Guidelines for Antiretroviral Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Those at risk are offered PrEP, or a client may request PrEP regardless of the risk assessment outcome. In addition to high-risk groups such as MSM or AGYW, other individuals eligible for PrEP may perceive themselves to be at risk of contracting HIV, possibly due to having multiple sexual partners or stable partners of people with multiple sexual partners. Zimbabwe&#x02019;s growing epidemic of extra-marital affairs popularly known as &#x0201c;small houses&#x0201d; that have been cited as key drivers of Zimbabwe&#x02019;s HIV epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] coupled with the country&#x02019;s socio-economic challenges necessitates a broader HIV prevention and targeting strategy. Accessing such individuals may require different programmatic approaches.</p><p>PrEP is a potential user-controlled HIV prevention option with important utility, especially when condom negotiation is difficult [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Information about motivations for the general at-risk population in a public sector setting choosing PrEP is limited worldwide and particularly for generalized HIV epidemics like Zimbabwe. The objective of this study was to, therefore, explore the experiences of clients that both accept and decline PrEP offered at a public facility. Specifically, we aimed to understand the factors that motivate clients to accept, decline, continue, or discontinue PrEP. Given the resource limitations of the MoHCC, it is important to understand how to effectively deliver PrEP in the public health system, which may not have the level of resources of well-funded early demonstration projects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>A qualitative study was carried out from January to June 2018. This study was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe (Protocol MRCZ-A-2234) and the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (Protocol Pro00023165). The MoHCC offered PrEP in two semi-public Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC) clinics, a parastatal under the MoHCC mandated to coordinate the provision of family planning services in Zimbabwe. The MoHCC plan for PrEP rollout was also planned to start in these ZNFPC sites before scaling up to other public sector facilities. These facilities were chosen because they were expected to be good environments to reach members of the general population who were seeking services such as cervical cancer screening, VMMC, and family planning services. The two sites were selected because they had the highest HIV testing volumes in their respective settlements. The two PrEP learning sites were selected purposefully to include one urban and one rural site, and PrEP implementation at the learning sites was operated with support from CHAI and the Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation. There were no other sites offering PrEP to the general population near the rural site. In the urban setting, two other partner-funded sites were offering PrEP: one site with outreach specifically targeted towards female sex workers and the other with a more general population focus.</p><p>All nurses at these sites were trained on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and TDF-FTC-based PrEP by MoHCC. Clients were eligible for PrEP if they were at least 16 years and had an HIV-negative test result. After HIV testing, clients were screened for PrEP eligibility according to a tool based on government guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227632.s001">S1 File</xref></bold>), and all clients determined to be eligible for and offered PrEP at one of the two sites were eligible for interviews. Clients were offered PrEP on the same day as eligibility was determined and, if they accepted, were given a one-month supply of PrEP on that day. They were then scheduled for a follow-up visit at one month, where they received a three-month supply. Thereafter, they were scheduled for visits every three months and provided with a three-month supply at each visit. During recruitment, the intervention was not formally advertised; however, clients were informed about PrEP when the nurses gave general health education to all clients during the appointment intake. Nurses would then proceed to conduct client HIV risk assessment during routine consultation. Once a nurse determined a client to be at risk, they would then speak to the client about HIV prevention in general and the possibility of them taking up PrEP. Thereafter, word of mouth from the clients served as the main means of advertising. In the rural site, the Ministry held a meeting with the local chiefs and village heads in order to gain acceptance of the intervention. The village heads proceeded to sensitise their communities on the intervention, and the nurse counsellor at the ZNFPC site would actively recruit clients based on his knowledge of the community around the site.</p><p>Interview candidates were categorized into five sub-groups to ensure diversity of perspectives, including people in the following categories (abbreviated with letters for later reference) (1) declined PrEP (D); (2) accepted PrEP but missed their first scheduled appointment (AM); (3) accepted PrEP and attended their first scheduled appointment (AA); (4) accepted PrEP, attended their first follow-up, but did not attend their second follow-up appointment (AAM); (5) accepted PrEP and attended their first and second follow-up appointments (AAA).</p><p><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227632.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold> shows the timing of the interviews with each population and the number of interviews conducted with each group.</p><fig id="pone.0227632.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0227632.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Client interview flow and number of interviews conducted.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0227632.g001"/></fig><p>For clients found to be eligible for and offered PrEP, health care workers (HCWs) described the study and requested their permission to be contacted for an interview. If an individual agreed to be contacted, MMG contacted them by phone. Follow-up phone calls were conducted only for the purpose of recruiting participants and not to encourage retention. Clients that declined PrEP were called approximately one week after they declined, and clients that accepted PrEP were called approximately 7&#x02013;10 days after either their first or second scheduled appointment regardless of whether they had attended or not. During the initial call, the study was again described. If clients agreed to participate in an interview, an in-person interview was arranged. Written informed consent was obtained from participants at the beginning of the interview.</p><p>Interviews were conducted and recorded by Zimbabwean interviewers in English or Shona. Aside from the participant and interviewer, no one else was present. Interviewers were trained qualitative data collectors with no link to the communities. Preferences from clients about interviewer gender were respected. Interviews were conducted in-person at the PrEP site or at the client&#x02019;s preferred location. The interview guide was based on the Extended Health Belief Model that explores health behaviour constructs, including perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action and self-efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227632.s002">S2 File</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227632.s003">S3 File</xref></bold> are the interview guides used for clients who declined or accepted PrEP, respectively. Interviews lasted 15&#x02013;60 minutes with the average being 45 minutes. Participants were provided with an allowance of US$8 for transport and other costs of participation. Based on a previous VMMC study in Zimbabwe, an $8 allowance was deemed to cover costs without manipulating clients to participate in the study.</p><p>Interviews were conducted and analysed on a rolling basis over five months. Recordings were de-identified, transcribed and translated by the interviewer, and the study coordinator (MMG) listened to the audio recordings and checked all the transcriptions to ensure accuracy. Three members of the research team (MMG, MLP, BEC) participated in coding the transcripts, using the constant comparative method to systematically code the transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227632.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the beginning, all members of the coding team independently coded the first three transcripts looking for key themes emerging from study participant responses. Based on this initial reading, the team created a codebook that was then applied to subsequent interviews and adjusted as needed. When all members of the coding team had triple-coded approximately half of the transcripts with any coding discrepancies discussed in the group to reach a consensus, the final codebook was agreed. At this point, the team switched to having two coders code each transcript. At the end of the coding process, the final codebook was applied to all transcripts coded earlier in the process to ensure all interviews followed the same codebook. The coding team provided on-going feedback to interviewers about topics that should be further explored and determined when theoretical saturation was achieved based on review of code reports. Dedoose software was used to organize coded data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><p>Three PrEP decliners declined to be interviewed and many more refused to be documented by the nurses as having declined PrEP.

Many participants described a fear of loss of economic productivity if they were infected with HIV. They expressed that HIV positive people are too weak to work in their fields or engage in day-to-day activities, and therefore, they and their families would suffer. Female participants expressed a desire to ensure that they remain healthy to care of their children so they wanted to protect themselves from HIV.

For instance, an HCW stressed to a client that they should take PrEP for at least seven days (Zimbabwe guidance) before engaging in risky sex to be protected. The participant misinterpreted this as taking PrEP for seven days before expected exposure, with a hiatus until the next expected exposure. Therefore, several months after her original appointment, the participant still had not exhausted her 30-day supply of pills.

Many participants reported no side effects. Those who experienced side effects reported them as minor, subsiding after a few days. Reported side effects included headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, extended or heavy menstrual periods, loss of appetite, and increased appetite. Participants developed coping strategies to deal with side effects, such as eating before taking PrEP pills to avoid nausea or consulting HCWs about them. For example, one participant who experienced nausea found that if she ate a meal before taking her PrEP pills, the symptoms of nausea were not as bad.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>[Side effects] started from the day I started to take the PrEP pills</italic>. <italic>Sometimes I could even feel a headache</italic>. <italic>I could even feel dizzy and I would also feel sleepy</italic>. <italic>Sometimes I would take paracetamol to manage the headache</italic>, <italic>but as for now the headaches are now better</italic>. <italic>As for now if I take PrEP orally I will feel dizzy</italic>, <italic>so I will take the pills in the evening before I go to bed and I will feel dizzy and sleep</italic>.<italic>&#x0201d;&#x02013;Female</italic>, <italic>aged 21</italic>, <italic>in SDC (RUR02) (AAA)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Based on participant responses, having information available about side effects was critical to allowing them to overcome this initial challenge without stopping PrEP. In some cases, participants felt comfortable enough and were able to return to the clinic to report their symptoms to a health worker and get advice:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>I faced a challenge when I first took my pills</italic>. <italic>I felt weak when I woke up in the morning</italic>. <italic>And I thought I should stop taking [PrEP] but I decided I should not stop without consulting [a health worker] on what was taking place</italic>. <italic>When I consulted they told me that</italic>, <italic>&#x02018;I should keep on taking them</italic>. <italic>Maybe they will work well on you</italic>.<italic>&#x02019; As for now as I am taking [PrEP]</italic>, <italic>and I no longer feel weak and no more nausea</italic>. <italic>It happened 1 week only</italic>.<italic>&#x0201d;&#x02013;Female</italic>, <italic>31</italic>, <italic>commercial sex worker (RUR04) (AAM)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Similarly, another participant went back to the facility to get pamphlets to take home and read for more information about side effects and other issues related to PrEP.

The effectiveness of PrEP is dependent on its acceptability, accessibility, adoption, and sustainability as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package. If these components are not there, even the most highly efficacious PrEP medication will have little to no impact in reducing HIV infections [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, HCWs should be trained and familiarized with all themes regarding reasons for initiating, declining, and barriers or facilitators for adherence in order to ensure high-uptake of PrEP within the general population.</p><p>Among the participants in this study, who were largely in FSWs or in SDCs or had a partner of unknown status, the perception of risk in these groups of people facilitated their uptake of PrEP, which is consistent with other studies in the United States where PrEP was integrated into a family planning clinic [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For all groups, the perceived severity of living with HIV was a key driver of PrEP uptake and the use of PrEP was associated with comfort during sex with an HIV sero-discordant partner. This was also reported in a study among gay bisexual men in HIV sero-discordant male relationships [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. With regards to SDCs, this work found that women start PrEP as a means to protect themselves from contracting HIV from their partners. In many parts of Africa, the risk of HIV infection is found in marriages where husbands may have acquired the virus through extramarital sex [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In some cases, the added threat of violence affects women's power and ability to negotiate the conditions of sexual intercourse, especially condom use [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A woman&#x02019;s sexuality within the Zimbabwean context is often controlled by her husband or her male partner [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] such that condom negotiation or refusing sex may be difficult. The theme of limited ability to negotiate condom use has emerged in other studies, particularly when considering relationships between AGYW and older men in Africa [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The quotations from several participants capture the conservative nature of rural Zimbabwe, where staying in a marriage is more respectable than divorce, and therefore, PrEP becomes a means to keep the peace in a marriage. However, a study conducted in Kenya on PrEP acceptability revealed that divorce rates among SDCs were high, highlighting a need to counsel SDCs on how to avoid HIV transmission within the marriage [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With regards to male partners in SDCs, the results from this work also show that the men who took up PrEP in this study were in SDCs; however, there was one male decliner preferring condoms to any biomedical HIV prevention method.</p><p>The reasons for declining PrEP found in this study included the fear of pill burden, mistrusting of biomedical means of HIV prevention, preferring condoms and discouragement from taking PrEP by family members. These themes are often supported by those found among MSM in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>This study showed how critical support, whether from partners or other family and friends, is to PrEP uptake and adherence. Although PrEP may give women the ability to prevent HIV without demanding condom use, many individuals reported difficulty concealing PrEP use from their partners and therefore sought permission before starting PrEP. Accounts from other women in this study described how having support from sexual partners and others improved their adherence. The findings on family and partner support and adherence are supported by evidence from a study among females in Kenya looking at factors affecting PrEP adherence [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. HCWs should be prepared to counsel clients on talking about PrEP with their partners or family members.</p><p>This study was conducted to inform program planning for public sector PrEP rollout by looking at barriers and facilitators to initiation, adherence and retention in an effort to better understand how HCWs can discuss PrEP with clients. The findings from this study provide insight into the types of issues that HCWs and other program staff should be prepared for as they interact with clients around PrEP. For example, sexual relationships can be complex, and HCWs must, therefore, be prepared to counsel clients on their risk level based on a range of situations. Once clients begin taking PrEP, HCWs must ensure that they understand how long they must take PrEP prior to and after possible exposure to ensure maximal protection from PrEP, which may take up to seven days prior to exposure. The counseling needs to stress that daily PrEP is recommended for the majority of persons who cannot predict when they will have sex. However, if their risk changes (e.g., they are not sexually active or have one partner known to be HIV negative), they can discontinue PrEP after at least 28 days after their last exposure. Qualitative studies that were conducted in Kenya and the United States [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] also highlight the key roles played by HCWs in counseling clients for PrEP adherence, other prevention methods and community awareness in order to improve PrEP acceptability. Future studies should focus on the perspective of HCWs as they perform counseling and rollout of PrEP to identify ongoing challenges.</p><p>The concern that taking PrEP will make clients more promiscuous was not confirmed by participants that were on PrEP. Most participants mentioned that they had not changed their sexual practices or added sexual partners due to the lower perceived risk. Instead, participants continued with the same sexual practices but with less anxiety over contracting HIV after taking PrEP. However, some participants reported decreased condom use after PrEP initiation, and in some cases it was reported that HCWs had recommended this for clients in stable marriages. While other research has shown that stereotypes of promiscuity were a deterrent to taking PrEP in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], this issue was not raised in the Zimbabwean setting.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Few decliners were documented by HCWs. We invited all the decliners for interviews and worked with HCWs to encourage improved documentation of decliners. Participants may have been reluctant to talk about sensitive issues. However, we trained interviewers to help participants feel comfortable in interview settings, matched gender where necessary and held interviews in locations selected by participants. In addition, these participants all self-identified as being motivated to seek PrEP by risk factors related to sexual encounters; this study does not explore access and retention these among other means of risk, such as injection drug use. Information was not available on the HCW perspectives on services and training received as part of this study but should be explored in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights how HIV risk perception, confidence in PrEP, and perceived challenges of living with HIV drove PrEP uptake in this population, while concern about pill burden and side effects and about partner reactions to PrEP, and reliance on other HIV prevention methods led others to choose not to take PrEP. Issues around HIV risk perception, routine or logistics, comprehension and counseling, partner and family support, and side effects were critical in either enabling or prevention clients from continuing PrEP. The introduction of PrEP added a valuable HIV prevention tool to the comprehensive care package in the two study facilities. It has addressed a gap where clients were previously not able to use existing HIV prevention methods for whatever reason. Based on feedback in this study, some of the greatest benefactors of PrEP were women who through this option are empowered to take HIV prevention into their own hands in instances where condom negotiation is difficult or whose sexual partners engage in risky behavior. SDCs were a specific at-risk group who required a backup method for protection or an HIV prevention lifeline, and this study shows that this significant unmet need was addressed through the introduction of PrEP as a prevention option. By understanding the factors that influenced uptake and continuation, future programs can be improved to better serve the target population.</p><p>Based on client feedback, we offer recommendations about how to enhance HCW training and service delivery models in order to meet the needs of clients and encourage PrEP uptake for those at risk in the general population. For example, clients may need support on disclosure of taking PrEP and planning appropriately for travel to ensure adherence. Also, going forward, the appropriate timing of use of PrEP needs to be clearly explained to HCWs for counseling purposes to clients. There were a few misconceptions among clients about how to take PrEP, especially if clients had intermittent risk exposure. The use of other prevention methods to complement PrEP was also cited as a point that needed clarity from HCWs, and MoHCC can provide some policy guidance on this issue. At the same time, when considering these recommendations, it is important to take into account the human resources constraints on PrEP programs previously highlighted in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>These results have been incorporated into policy documents such as the Zimbabwe National PrEP Implementation Plan [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and Health Care Worker Training Manual [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and the HIV Prevention, Treatment, and Care Communication Strategy [<xref rid="pone.0227632.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
