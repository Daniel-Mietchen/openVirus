  <p>The 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract inhibits the infection of four DENV clinical isolates representative of the four serotypes. Four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, 2, 3 and 4) were pre-incubated with the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract for 1 h at 37 °C. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Huh7.5 cells were infected for 48 h with DENV at the different MOI 0.2, 2, 0.5 and 2 for DENV 1–4, respectively. Recombinant IFN-α 2A (200 IU mL
   <sup>−1</sup>) was added 2 h post-infection and used as a positive control. The percentage of E positive cells was evaluated using the Operetta High-Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer). The results are the means ± SD of three independent experiments. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The residual infectious particles were titrated in C6/36 cells using a foci-forming immunodetection assay. The data represent the means ± SD from three independent experiments. A one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons were used for the statistical analysis (**
