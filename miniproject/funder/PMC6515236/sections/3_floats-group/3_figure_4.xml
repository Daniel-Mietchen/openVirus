  <p>Antiviral activity of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract against the African and Asian ZIKV lineages. ZIKV-MR766 or ZIKV-PF13 were incubated with the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract for 1 h at 37 °C. EGCG (100 µM) was used as a positive control. The Vero cells were infected at a MOI of 1 for 24 h. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The cells were processed for an immunofluorescence assay. The ZIKV E protein (red) and nuclei (blue) were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The images are representatives of three independent experiments. Scale bars are 50 µm. The quantification of the number of (
   <bold>B</bold>) ZIKV-MR766 and (
   <bold>C</bold>) ZIKV-PF13 infected Vero cells from the experiments are represented in the images. The results shown are the means ± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons (**** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
