   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract inhibits ZIKV attachment to the cell surface. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of time-of-drug-addition assays used to characterize the antiviral activity of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract (100 µg mL
   <sup>−1</sup>). Green arrow indicates the presence of the plant extract. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Flow cytometric analysis of GFP expression in Vero cells infected with ZIKV
   <sup>GFP</sup> during 24 h at MOI of 1 under the different experimental conditions shown in (
   <bold>A</bold>). The results are means ± SD of three independent experiments and are expressed as the relative value compared to untreated infected cells. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Virus binding assays: Vero cells were infected with ZIKV-MR766 at MOI of 1 for 1 h at 4 °C with or without 100 µg mL
   <sup>−1</sup> of the 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract. EGCG (100 µM) were used as a positive control. The number of virus particles bound to the cell surface was measured by RT-qPCR. The values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Viral inactivation assays: Vero cells were infected with ZIKV
   <sup>GFP</sup> pre-incubated during 1 h at 37 °C with four different concentration of 
   <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract. A flow cytometric analysis of GFP fluorescence was performed 24 hp.i. The results shown are means ± SD of three independent experiments and are expressed as the relative value compared to untreated infected cells. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s test for multiple comparisons (***
