<p>In conclusion, our data demonstrated that the extract from 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic>, an endemic medicinal plant from the Reunion and Mauritius Islands, exhibits an antiviral activity against historical and contemporary strains of ZIKV, as well as against four clinical isolates of DENV. Moreover, this plant extract does not exert a deleterious effect on mammalian cells, revealing that it could be an important source for antiviral drugs to treat Zika and Dengue fever in patients.
