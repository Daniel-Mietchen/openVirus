<p>The number of E-positive cells were quantified at 48 hp.i using antibodies against the E protein and the Operetta High-Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer). The 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract significantly decreased the number of E-positive cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). DENV-3 and -4 appeared more sensitive to the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> action than DENV-1 and -2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). The production of infectious viral particles was then quantified using foci forming immunodetection assays to relate the reduction of the number of E-positive cells to the DENV infectivity. A decrease of up to 2 log of the DENV infectivity was observed upon DENV-3 and -4 infections when the virions were treated with 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01860-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). These results show that the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract exhibits potent antiviral activity against the four DENV serotypes.
