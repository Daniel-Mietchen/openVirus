<p>The early steps of the viral infection include binding to the cell surface and internalization via endocytosis. To determine which of these steps are targeted by the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, viruses generated with the ZIKV-MR766 strain molecular clone were incubated on Vero cells for 1 h at 4 °C, to allow the attachment to the cell surface and prevent viral internalization, in the presence or absence of the 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract (100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The amount of attached ZIKV particles was determined by RT-qPCR. EGCG, which is known to inhibit the ZIKV attachment [

 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> extract, as compared to the untreated control cells (
