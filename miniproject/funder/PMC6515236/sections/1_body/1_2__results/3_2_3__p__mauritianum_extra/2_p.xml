<p>The production of ssRNA was first measured by FISH coupled to confocal microscopy 24 h post-infection (hp.i). The cells treated with EGCG, which is known to inhibit ZIKV entry [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], were used as positive controls. The FISH probe produced no signal in the non-infected control cells and a bright signal in the cytoplasm of the infected cells (
