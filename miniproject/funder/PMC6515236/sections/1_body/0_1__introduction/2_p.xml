<p>Dengue fever, caused by 4 viral serotypes (DENV 1–4), is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral infection in tropical and subtropical countries, including the southwest of the Indian Ocean region [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01860" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An epidemic of DENV-2 is currently taking place in the French overseas region Reunion Island. ZIKV causes important outbreaks in the South Pacific, Americas and South-East Asia. The recent ZIKV epidemics in French Polynesia and South America were associated with severe fetal brain injury and neurological defects in adults such as the Guillain-Barré syndrome [
