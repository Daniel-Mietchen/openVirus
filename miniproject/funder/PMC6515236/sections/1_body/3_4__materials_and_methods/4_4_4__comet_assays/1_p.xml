<p>A549, HKPM and FMa cells were seeded in 12-well plates one day before treatment. The cells were treated with different concentrations of plant extract during 24 h, then trypsinized, and kept in a freezing buffer until storage at −80 °C. Cell suspensions (100 µL) were mixed with 900 µL of 0.6% low melt agarose to obtained a density of 2×10
 <sup>6</sup> cell mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. On agarose pre-coated slides, 100 µL of this suspension was put down and kept on ice for 10 min. A H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (50 µM) treatment during 10 min was used as positive control. The slides were then brought in a lysis buffer for 1 h in the dark (pH 10, 2.5 M NaCl; 10 mM TRIS; 0.1 M EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 10% DMSO). Following this, the slides were rinsed three times using a diluted Tris-HCl buffer (1.2 mM TRIS pH adjusted to pH 7.4 with concentrated HCl). Electrophoresis were performed on the slides for 30 min at 21 V in a cold denaturation buffer (0.3 M NaOH; 1 mM EDTA). After washing, the slides were stained with 50 µL of Gel Red (1:10000). The slides were observed using Zeiss Axioskop 2.0 with an Alled vision technologies camera (Stadtroda, Germany). The pictures were acquired and analyzed using the COMET assay IV software (Instem, Stone, UK).
