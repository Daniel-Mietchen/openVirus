<p>C6/36 cells were seeded at a density of 1×10
 <sup>5</sup> in 24 well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C to perform a foci-forming immunodetection assay. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the supernatant were prepared in duplicate in the culture medium and 0.4 mL of each dilution was added to the cells for 1 h 30 min. Then, the inoculum was removed and a CMC media (L-15 supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.52% tryptose, 50 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> gentamicin, 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose) was added. After seven days of being incubated, immunostaining was performed using the mouse monoclonal antibody 4G2 followed by goat-antimouse immunoglobulin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A solution of NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium chloride) and BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-39-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt) (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used as a substrate to detect antibodies. The foci were counted and expressed as FFU mL
