<p>Two-fold dilutions of plant extract ranging from 4 to 2000 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> were used to treat Vero, A549, HKPM and FMa cells at a density of 1×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per cultured well, in 96-well culture plates. The cells were rinsed with PBS 1×, and 120 µL of the culture medium mixed with 5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> MTT (3-[4-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrahzolium bromide) solution was added, after an incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C. Following an incubation of 2 h, the MTT medium was removed and the formazan crystals was solubilized with 100 µL of Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a background subtraction at 690 nm. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined using a nonlinear regression on the Graphpad prism software (version 7.0; La Jola, CA, USA).
