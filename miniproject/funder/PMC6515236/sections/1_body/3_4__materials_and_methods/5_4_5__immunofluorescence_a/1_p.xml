<p>For the immunofluorescence assay, the cells were fixed (PFA, 3.7%) and permeabilized for 5 min (PBS 1× 0.15% Triton X-100) 24 hp.i. The cells were stained 1 h at room temperature in the dark for ZIKV using 4G2-Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1000 in PBS-BSA 2%). The DAPI staining was used to delineate the cells’ nuclei. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield and the fluorescence was observed using a Nikon Eclipse E2000-U microscope. The Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and NIS-Element AR (Nikon) imaging software were used to capture images. For the flow cytometry assay, cells were harvested, followed by a fixation with paraformaldehyde 3.7% for 10 min. Then they were submitted to a flow cytometry analysis using CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The results were analyzed using the Cytexpert software (Brea, CA, USA).</p>
