<p>The total RNA, including genomic viral RNA, was extracted from cells with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcribed using an E reverse primer (5′-TTCACCTTGTGTTGGGC-3′) and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) at 42 °C for 50 min. A quantitative PCR was performed on a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France). Briefly, cDNA was amplified using 0.2 μM of each primer and GoTaq Master Mix (Promega, Charbonnières-les-bains, France). For each single-well amplification reaction, a threshold cycle (Ct) was calculated using the CFX96 program (Bio-Rad) in the exponential phase of amplification. A synthetic gene coding for the nucleotides 954 to 1306 of the MR766 strain (GenBank: LC002520) cloned in the pUC57 plasmid was used as template to generate a standard curve, which then served to make an absolute quantitation of the bound viruses.</p>
