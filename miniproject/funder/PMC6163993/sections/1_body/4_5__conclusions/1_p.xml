<p>Although discovered only 17 years ago, the study of the HMPV infection by several groups around the globe has yielded substantial information that furthers our understanding of the complex interplay between HMPV and the IFN response. However, there are still many gaps of knowledge regarding the regulation of the antiviral response to HMPV that need to be defined, such as the role of other less known subtypes of IFN in HMPV infection, the effect of IFN-induced proteins on HMPV replication, the effect of age on the IFN induction, and the contribution of HMPV-induced IFNs on the adaptive immunity.</p>
