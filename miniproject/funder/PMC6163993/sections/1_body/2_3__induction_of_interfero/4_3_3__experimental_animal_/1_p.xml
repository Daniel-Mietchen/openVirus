<p>Similar to the aforementioned in vitro findings, studies in vivo demonstrate that HMPV is a more potent inducer of IFN-α than RSV [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The interaction of type I IFNs with the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) is essential for the activation of the host protective anti-viral response against HMPV [
