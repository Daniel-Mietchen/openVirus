<p>The human and mouse dendritic cells (DCs) are another in vitro model that has been used for the study of the IFN response to HMPV infection. DCs are among the first immune cells to respond during viral invasion [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Lung DCs respond to viral infection by secreting type I IFN, which may result from the recognition of viral nucleic acids by TLRs or other PPRs together with the activation of some signaling pathways that lead to the inhibition of viral replication and destruction of the viral genome. In that regard, our laboratory has shown that HMPV-induced signaling activates type I and type III IFN responses in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) and murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) through MDA5 [

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. However, the distinct PRRs activation by HMPV in epithelial cells and human or mouse DCs, to induce IFN response, can be attributable to the inherent differences of the experimental cell type used. TLR4 has also been implicated as an essential player in the activation of type I IFN in moDC after HMPV infection [
