<p>The study of the IFN response in HMPV-infected individuals is very limited. However, studies with nasopharyngeal aspirates from children infected with HMPV indicate that IFN-β is induced by HMPV A group, while IFN-λ was induced by both A and B groups. However, IFN-γ was not detected in those samples [
