<p>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a clinically relevant single stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic> in the new virus family 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HMPV genomic organization resembles that of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with the exceptions of lacking the non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and of having a slightly different gene order (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00505-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The HMPV genome, which is constituted of approximately 13,330 nucleotides, encodes 9 proteins represented in the order 3′-N-P-M-F-M2(1/2)-SH-G-L-5′, and includes the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), fusion (F), small hydrophobic (SH), attachment (G), polymerase (L), and matrix proteins (M1 and M2), for which M2 has two overlapping open reading frames (ORF) in the M2 mRNA that generates M2-1 and M2-2 proteins.

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Unlike the G protein, with its high genetic diversity, the F protein is considered the most conserved protein among other HMPV isolates [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The G protein contributes to the attachment of the virus to the host cell membrane, but is dispensable for virus replication [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The small hydrophobic (SH) protein has been reported to modulate membrane fusion promotion [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], however its functional role in viral infection is still unknown. The phosphoprotein (P), nucleocapsid (N), and viral polymerase (L) are essential proteins for viral RNA synthesis [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. M2-1 protein appears to be necessary for HMPV replication in vivo [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. HMPV has been classified into two main groups, i.e., A and B, and further subdivided into A1, A2, B1, and B2, based on genetic analysis [
