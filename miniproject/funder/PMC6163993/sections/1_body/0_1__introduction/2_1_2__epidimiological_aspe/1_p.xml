<p>Although discovered in 2001, HMPV has been present in the human population for at least 50 years before it was identified in nasopharyngeal aspirates by Osterhaus’ group in the Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This virus is known to be one of the most significant causes of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in humans [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since its discovery, cases of HMPV infections have been isolated on all continents [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Like human RSV, HMPV has a seasonal distribution and causes periodic epidemics which usually peak during the winter and spring [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The prevalence of HMPV infections is higher in infants and children (less than 5 years old) than in adults [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By the age of 5, almost all children have been exposed to HMPV [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, epidemiological and clinical studies show that HMPV is a major causative agent of severe respiratory infection associated with 5–15% of pediatric hospitalizations [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Data from two different studies indicate that HMPV was detected in nasal-wash samples of 12% of all lower respiratory infection (LRI) cases in a cohort of more than 2000 previously healthy outpatient infants and children [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], as well as in the respiratory aspirates of 12 (6%) of the 208 children hospitalized for ARTI [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Based on studies comprising young and older adults, HMPV disease can also occur in adults of all ages [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], although increased severity of the disease is observed in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, stem-cell transplant recipients and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been reported to have severe HMPV infection [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
