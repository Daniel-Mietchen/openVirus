<p>One of the HMPV proteins that regulates the IFN response in HMPV infection, is the attachment (G) protein. G protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein. Albeit the fact that the postulated functional role of G protein is for attachment to a host cell receptor, it is not essential for viral replication [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. That has been demonstrated in studies where the replication of the mutant virus lacking G protein (rHMPVΔG) in challenged nonhuman primates was strongly attenuated compared to its wild-type counterpart (rHMPV) [

 <xref rid="B116-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], demonstrating that G protein is dispensable for HMPV replication, but those findings also suggested that G protein interferes with the antiviral response. In fact, the G protein is implicated to have an inhibitory effect on RIG-I mediated activation of type I IFN (IFN-α/β) production in airway epithelial cells [
