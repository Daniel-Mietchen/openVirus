<p>Like G protein, the SH protein is a type II membrane protein. The function of the SH protein is not fully known. It is suggested that the SH protein of the HMPV act as a viroporin increasing cell fusion and permeability, similar to RSV [

 <xref rid="B121-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Reports using the recombinant HMPV virus lacking the SH protein (rHMPVΔSH), indicate that the mutated virus was capable of growing comparably to the wild type HMPV, as demonstrated in samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters. However, the mutated virus (rHMPVΔSH) replicated slightly less well in non-human primates [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In addition, it has been observed that HMPV uses the TLR7/MyD88 pathway to induce type I IFN response in murine pDCs and the pathway is targeted by the SH protein [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Thus far, there are very few reports depicting the role of the HMPV SH protein in regulating the IFN response. Therefore, it is imperative that further work is done to fully understand the function of SH protein on the antiviral response to HMPV infection (
