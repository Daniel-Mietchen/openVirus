<p>Most cells respond early to viral infection by producing IFNs to induce an antiviral response. Depending on the cell type and viral infection, detection of viral PAMPs by cellular PRRs leads to the activation of several down-stream cell signaling cascades that eventually results in the induction of several IFN-inducible genes (such as IFN-stimulated genes; ISG), which may include protein-coding and non-coding microRNA (miRNA) to establish an antiviral state [

Hence, IFN, ISGs, and miRNA are part of a cellular innate immunity that responds to virus infection. miRNAs have been of research interest since their discovery in 1993 [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. They are non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. miRNAs play important roles in diverse biological processes such as cellular differentiation and development, fat metabolism, pathogenesis of various diseases, and immune response [

Thus, miRNA regulating the expression of interferon genes may directly or indirectly inhibit or stimulate viral replication. For instance, expression of miR-22 blocks interferon production by directly downregulating the high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) and interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5) that eventually inhibits NF-ÎºB and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation [

 <xref rid="B73-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Work from our laboratory and other groups have demonstrated that HMPV infection induces different types of miRNAs in different cell types [

 <xref rid="B75-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Although several studies have implicated miRNAs in different lung diseases [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], future work is needed to determine the potential role of miRNAs in the IFN response upon HMPV infection.
