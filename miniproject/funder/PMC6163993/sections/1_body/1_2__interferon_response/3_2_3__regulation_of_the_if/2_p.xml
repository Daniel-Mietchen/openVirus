<p>Numerous ISGs have been shown to be involved in the regulation of immune responses. Some have been reported to interfere with the replication of different viruses [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], while others have not been characterized in regards to that effect. Using an overexpression screening assay, Schoggins et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] have catalogued several ISGs that might have an inhibitory or enhancing effect on different DNA and RNA viruses. Their results show CD9, HPSE, P2BY6, and interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as the top hits of ISGs for HMPV inhibition. In line with that, recent studies show that the expression of IFITM3 dysregulates HMPV F protein mediated cell to cell fusion and inhibits HMPV infection in vitro [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. They also found that over expression of IFITM1 and IFITM2 can impede HMPV infection [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been previously demonstrated that the expression of the 3 IFITM proteins mentioned above, effectively curtail RSV infection in vitro. However, unlike in HMPV, the IFITM proteins only interfere with RSV entry [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The restriction effect of IFITM3 against RSV has also be demonstrated in a knockout mouse model [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Additionally, the inhibitory effects of viperin and ISG15 against HRSV have been described previously [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Overall, there is limited information on the antiviral activity of IFN-induced proteins against HMPV replication.
