<p>Cells in the respiratory tract, such as epithelial cells, phagocytes, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), natural killer (NK) cells, among others, use receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) present in viral pathogens. Apart from cell surfaces, these receptors (PRRs) are also present in different cellular compartments such as endosome and cytosol. Those PRRs present in the endosomes are the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which can recognize different viral products, including the following: TLR3 (double stranded RNA, dsRNA), TLR7, TLR8 (single stranded RNA, ssRNA), and TLR9 (unmethylated DNA) [

 <xref rid="B59-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the cytoplasm, PRRs include RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) such as RIG-I (retinoic acid–inducible gene I) and melanoma differentiation-associated 5 (MDA5), which sense viral genomic dsRNA, or dsRNA produced as viral intermediates during the virus replicative cycle. Typically, RLRs recognize the following different molecules of dsRNA: MDA5 recognizes dsRNA that is over 2000 nts in length while RIG-I recognizes shorter (&lt;400 nt) structures of dsRNA or ssRNA with 5′ triphosphorylated (5′ppp) modification [
