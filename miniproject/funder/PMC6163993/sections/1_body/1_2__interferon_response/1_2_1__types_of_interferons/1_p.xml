<p>The production of interferon (IFN) is one important way by which a host immune system responds to invading pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interferons induced by viral infection constitute the first line of the innate antiviral immune defense. There are three types of interferons: type I IFN, a multi-gene cytokine family that includes several subtypes (α, β, ε, δ, κ, τ, ω, and ζ) [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], although the best characterized are IFN-α and IFN-β. In addition, human IFN-α is further classified into 13 subtypes, all in chromosome 9 [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Most cell types are able to produce IFN-β, whereas IFN-α is primarily released by plasmacytoid dendritic cells [
