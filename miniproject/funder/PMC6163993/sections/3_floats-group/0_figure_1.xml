  <p>HMPV and RSV genomic configuration and the proteins they encode. (
   <bold>A</bold>) HMPV and RSV are negative sense single stranded RNA viruses and are members of the family 
   <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic>. HMPV belongs to the genus 
   <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic>, while RSV belongs to 
   <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> genus; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Both viruses differ in the organization of the genomic proteins. Besides, the M2 and L proteins of RSV overlap by 68 nucleotides [
   <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00505" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another important difference between the viruses is that RSV genome encodes additional two proteins, non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2.
