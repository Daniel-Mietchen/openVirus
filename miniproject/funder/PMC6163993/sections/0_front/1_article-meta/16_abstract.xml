 <p>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is one of the leading causes of respiratory diseases in infants and children worldwide. Although this pathogen infects mainly young children, elderly and immunocompromised people can be also seriously affected. To date, there is no commercial vaccine available against it. Upon HMPV infection, the host innate arm of defense produces interferons (IFNs), which are critical for limiting HMPV replication. In this review, we offer an updated landscape of the HMPV mediated-IFN response in different models as well as some of the defense tactics employed by the virus to circumvent IFN response.</p>
