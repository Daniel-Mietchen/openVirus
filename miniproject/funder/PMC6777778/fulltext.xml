Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can effectively reduce HIV acquisition in women during these periods; however, understanding of its acceptability and feasibility in antenatal and postpartum populations remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth interviews with 90 study participants in Malawi and Zambia: 39 HIV-negative pregnant/breastfeeding women, 14 male partners, 19 healthcare workers, and 18 policymakers. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to identify themes related to PrEP. As a public health intervention, PrEP was not well-known among patients and healthcare workers; however, when it was described to participants, most expressed positive views. Concerns about safety and adherence were raised, highlighting two critical areas for community outreach. The feasibility of introducing PrEP into antenatal services was also a concern, especially if introduced within already strained health systems. Support for PrEP varied among policymakers in Malawi and Zambia, reflecting the ongoing policy discussions in their respective countries. Implementing PrEP during the pregnancy and breastfeeding periods will require addressing barriers at the individual, facility, and policy levels. Multi- level approaches should be considered in the design of new PrEP programs for antenatal and postpartum populations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Fogarty International Center</institution></funding-source><award-id>D43TW009340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1435-8455</contrib-id><name><surname>Chi</surname><given-names>Benjamin H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI131060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1435-8455</contrib-id><name><surname>Chi</surname><given-names>Benjamin H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K24AI120796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1435-8455</contrib-id><name><surname>Chi</surname><given-names>Benjamin H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00MH104154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Nora E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AI050410</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work received funding from the following sources: National Institutes of Health, R01 AI131060, Associated author(s): BHC, WM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nih.gov">https://www.nih.gov</ext-link>.

Across 19 studies&#x02014;and over 22,000 person-years of follow-up&#x02014;Drake and colleagues found that HIV incidence rates during this period (3.8 per 100 person-years) exceeded World Health Organization incidence thresholds for at-risk populations (3.0 per 100 person-years) [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In 2018, the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that 140,000 women newly acquired HIV during pregnancy and breastfeeding across 21 sub-Saharan African focus countries [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although many have emphasized the importance of HIV prevention in antenatal settings [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in most African settings, few HIV prevention modalities are available to pregnant and breastfeeding women.</p><p>Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV&#x02014;in the form of co-formulated tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC)&#x02014;has been studied extensively, shown to reduce HIV acquisition in women [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and to be safe for mothers and infants [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In PrEP studies among HIV-serodiscordant couples, early evidence on birth outcomes and infant growth has been reassuring [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. PrEP during pregnancy and breastfeeding is also cost-effective in settings where HIV incidence is high [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In women, daily adherence is critical to its effectiveness. In studies where adherence was high, the risk for new HIV infections dropped by as much as 85% [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; in studies demonstrating low adherence, results were equivocal [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Malawi and Zambia have generalized HIV epidemics, with both high fertility rates and high rates of HIV infection among women and children [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite their geographic proximity, the underlying national policies for PrEP between these countries have differed. PrEP was first included as part of Zambia&#x02019;s national HIV guidelines beginning in 2016 and subsequent policies have emphasized its role for pregnant/breastfeeding women at elevated risk for acquiring HIV [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, the current Malawi national guidelines for HIV do not include PrEP as part of HIV prevention [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, PrEP has been incorporated into the country&#x02019;s latest national HIV prevention strategy (2018&#x02013;2020), in particular its use among adolescent girls and young women [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In preparation for a pilot randomized trial of combination HIV prevention, we conducted formative qualitative research to further assess the landscape for PrEP during pregnancy/breastfeeding in these two countries.

We drew from the basic tenets of naturalistic inquiry, with no specific commitment to a pre-defined theoretical framework [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We recruited participants from four populations: HIV-negative pregnant or breastfeeding women seeking care, their male partners, healthcare workers (HCWs), and policymakers. The first three groups were enrolled from Bwaila District Hospital (Lilongwe, Malawi), the University Teaching Hospital (Lusaka, Zambia), and Kamwala Health Centre (Lusaka, Zambia). Policymakers from both Malawi and Zambia were identified through existing governmental technical working groups.</p><p>Female participants were recruited from maternal and child health care units (i.e., antenatal, postnatal, family planning, and well child clinics) at these hospitals via convenience sampling. All participants were aged 18 years or above and resided near the study sites. The inclusion criteria for pregnant/breastfeeding women were: confirmed pregnancy or reported delivery with continued breastfeeding, access of maternal-child health care services at one of the study sites, documented HIV-negative status, and report of a male sexual partner. Male partners of participating pregnant or breastfeeding women were eligible for this study. These individuals were only recruited after we received permission from the index pregnant or breastfeeding participant. HCWs were eligible to participate if they worked at the maternal and child health care units within the targeted study health facilities. Policymakers were recruited from the Ministries of Health, national AIDS commissions, partner implementing organizations, and donor agencies. All participated on governmental HIV technical working groups. Our target accrual was: 40 HIV-negative pregnant/breastfeeding women, 40 male partners, 20 HCWs, and 20 policymakers. This sample size was divided equally between the two countries.</p><p>We conducted in-depth interviews to better understand the role of PrEP in HIV prevention among pregnant and breastfeeding women. Women, male partners, HCW, and policymakers were all asked about their knowledge of PrEP, overall opinion/acceptability of PrEP, and perceived challenges for implementing PrEP in pregnant/breastfeeding women in Malawi and Zambia. Sociodemographic data for pregnant/breastfeeding women and male partners were collected using a separate form. We did not collect analogous information from HCWs and policymakers for reasons of confidentiality.</p><p>Researchers and research assistants trained in qualitative methods conducted the in-depth interviews to capture participant views on PrEP use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. All interviewers were local; they spoke the language of the participants and were familiar with the local context and culture. They used semi-structured interview guides developed by members of the study team. Prior to implementation, these interview guides were field tested at participating health facilities to assess content and ensure meaning. All interviews with pregnant/breastfeeding women, male partners, and HCWs were conducted in private rooms within study site facilities. Policymakers were typically interviewed at a private venue of their choosing. Interviews were conducted either in English or in local languages (e.g., Chichewa, Nyanja, or Bemba) depending on the participant&#x02019;s choice. Each interview lasted approximately one hour.</p><p>All in-depth interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated into English by bilingual study personnel. These were then verified for clarity and completeness by an independent reviewer who was part of the qualitative team but not involved in transcription and translation. Members of the study team developed a central codebook that was used in both countries. We used NVivo12 Version 10 (QSR International, Pty Ltd.; Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) to organize and code data. Initial inductive codes were derived from the interview guides and additional deductive codes were added as themes emerged.

Policymakers in Zambia were eager to implement the guidelines for PrEP which had already been evaluated in pilot programs within the country. In contrast, a major theme among Malawian policymakers was a need for more local implementation evidence before the intervention should be adopted as one of the HIV prevention strategies.

When the PrEP intervention was described, most pregnant/breastfeeding women viewed it favorably and considered it an important component of HIV prevention during pregnancy/breastfeeding. Male partners in Zambia expressed mixed opinions about PrEP: about half would advise their female partners to initiate PrEP while the other half would not due to safety concerns or the perception that it would promote promiscuity in women. In contrast, nearly all policymakers had prior knowledge of PrEP but their opinions about the intervention differed by country. In Zambia, where PrEP policies have been in place since 2016, there was greater acceptance of its public health utility. In Malawi, policymakers expressed a desire for local clinical and implementation research before PrEP was considered at a national level. Across our participant groups, barriers were identified at the individual (e.g., knowledge and fear of side effects), facility (e.g., health system burdens), and policy (e.g., guidelines and tools, sustainability) levels.</p><p>Despite supportive guidance from the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the inclusion of PrEP in guidelines for pregnant/breastfeeding women across sub-Saharan Africa has been uneven. In some national programs (e.g., Zimbabwe, Nigeria), pregnant and breastfeeding women are recognized as high-risk groups that are eligible for PrEP. Other national HIV guidelines have taken a more cautious approach; these Ministries of Health await locally generated evidence about feasibility and acceptability before issuing formal recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our study was conducted in countries where PrEP services were only recently incorporated into the national HIV strategic plan (Malawi) or remain in the early stages of public health implementation (Zambia). Neither national program has prioritized pregnant and breastfeeding women as a target for PrEP services, a policy context that mirrors much of sub-Saharan Africa. Our landscape analysis provides insights about the perceptions of PrEP in such settings and complements the growing body of research from pilot PrEP programs in antenatal settings [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Given PrEP&#x02019;s recent introduction to policy discussions in Malawi and Zambia, the low levels of existing knowledge about PrEP among patients and HCWs was not surprising. This is similar to studies done in the United States where HIV at-risk women also lack knowledge of PrEP, despite its availability as an HIV prevention method [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We were encouraged to find that, upon receiving basic information about PrEP, the majority of participants had positive opinions regarding the intervention. In fact, most pregnant and breastfeeding women stated that they would consider initiating PrEP if offered.</p><p>Despite these favorable opinions, the reported concerns among respondents require consideration, particularly in the design of future programs. For example, concerns about potential harm to mother and infant echo findings from other studies in the region [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar to other settings [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0223487.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the need for near-perfect adherence raised concerns and participants worried about the consequences of HIV transmission in the context of poor PrEP adherence. As services scale up in Malawi and Zambia, community education and outreach will be critical to patient uptake of and adherence to PrEP in antenatal settings. Approaches that identify and address patient concerns&#x02014;whether through peer/male engagement, support groups, or patient-centered counseling&#x02014;will be essential to eliciting and addressing such problems. The underlying social and gender dynamics in these settings must also be considered. Male partner engagement represents a potential facilitator if the male partner is engaged and a barrier if he is not [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Interestingly, few respondents mentioned the potential for stigma associated with PrEP use, even though many pilot programs have targeted key populations at elevated HIV risk [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. There was also little discussion about the potential for relationship conflict or social harms. These areas may require further consideration when designing community outreach activities for PrEP.</p><p>In Malawi and Zambia, the expansion of universal HIV treatment for pregnant and breastfeeding women (i.e., &#x0201c;Option B+&#x0201d;) has greatly increased access to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-positive women. In 2018, UNAIDS reported that both country programs reached national coverage rates of 95% [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], an important milestone for HIV treatment programs globally [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Given the demands of establishing and maintaining such successful programs, concerns about the sustainability of new HIV prevention services&#x02014;built upon the same antenatal platforms&#x02014;were not surprising. Policymakers articulated a need for prioritization within HIV prevention and treatment services, emphasizing the need for sustainability in the context of donor funding.</p><p>Among HCWs and policymakers, many of the recommendations about PrEP were operational in nature. Respondents articulated the need for standardized screening and triage procedures for pregnant/breastfeeding women at elevated risk of HIV acquisition. This may include setting-specific algorithm based on age (e.g., adolescent girls and young women), medical history, partner HIV status, and/or at-risk behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They recommended detailed clinical management guidelines, including management of new HIV seroconverters as well as monitoring and evaluation tools. The design and implementation of sustainable models is critical and could have important downstream impacts on service uptake [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In Kenya, for example, the PrEP Implementation for Young Women and Adolescents project has integrated PrEP services within routine antenatal and postpartum services across 16 health facilities in Western Kenya. The additional time required of healthcare providers ranged from a median of 18 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 15&#x02013;26) for those initiating PrEP and a median of 13 minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 7&#x02013;15) for each woman declining these services [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Integrated antiretroviral therapy and PrEP services&#x02014;as have been implemented for serodiscordant couples [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]&#x02014;could also be a promising strategy to embed PrEP into maternal and child health platforms. Task-shifting of certain tasks (e.g., eligibility screening, adherence counseling) to trained, lower-level health providers could further streamline the provision of services and reduce additional strain on understaffed clinical units.</p><p>PrEP is an important tool for comprehensive HIV prevention [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but its integration into existing national programs has varied. The responses from policymakers in Malawi and Zambia reflect these differences in policy discussions. In Malawi, government approval for the public implementation of PrEP was only recently articulated and remains limited to select populations [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The policy change occurred after the completion of our study; however, the concerns expressed in this study&#x02014;and others similar to them&#x02014;are likely to guide program implementation. This caution at the policy level likely reflects the country&#x02019;s resource-constrained and overburdened health system and its reluctance to initiate PrEP in this population without tools for effective risk stratification. In Zambia, policymakers were generally more supportive of PrEP services, reflecting PrEP&#x02019;s inclusion in the country&#x02019;s consolidated HIV guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Zambian policymakers more often stressed the importance of operationalizing these policy recommendations. This is in line with programmatic advances in Zambia, where PrEP demonstration projects are already in place for men who have sex with men, female sex workers, HIV serodiscordant couples and other key populations [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Despite our emphasis on pregnant/breastfeeding populations, there were few insights specific to these populations or to the antenatal care platform that support them.</p><p>An important strength of our study was its broad representation from Malawi and Zambia. To better understand the landscape for PrEP during pregnancy and breastfeeding periods, we solicited a diverse range of perspectives from stakeholders at different levels of the healthcare system. We acknowledge important limitations as well. First, the implementation of PrEP has only begun in our target countries, with little to no programmatic activity focused on pregnant/breastfeeding women. While policy and implementation context mirrors much of sub-Saharan Africa, our findings may be less relevant where PrEP programs have progressed more rapidly. Second, although PrEP was viewed favorably by participating pregnant/breastfeeding women and some male partners, we recognize that decision-making remained hypothetical. PrEP was not offered to participants following their in-depth interviews, so uptake and early adherence could not be assessed. Multiple studies have shown inconsistencies between intention and action, including for PrEP [<xref rid="pone.0223487.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Finally, the qualitative approach we undertook provided greater depth of insights about HIV prevention during pregnancy and breastfeeding; however, we recognize that the responses may not be fully representative of target populations. Those who were recruited may have had stronger opinions about these topics than those who declined participation; however, this was not captured in our pre-enrollment period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we conducted a landscape analysis of PrEP for pregnant and breastfeeding women, the first of its kind in Malawi and Zambia. We report a diverse range of perspectives, suggesting that PrEP for pregnancy and breastfeeding may be acceptable and feasible, but key barriers must be addressed for optimal service delivery. These results can help to inform strategies to increase uptake and retention along the PrEP cascade, particularly in settings where PrEP policies are newly introduced.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0223487.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Drake</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>John-Stewart</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>. <article-title>Incident HIV during pregnancy and postpartum and risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission: a systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title>. <source>PLoS Med</source>. <year>2014</year>;<volume>11</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>e1001608</fpage>

A few suggestions to strengthen the readership interest:</p><p>1. If available, include recent HIV incidence and MTCT rates in pregnant and breastfeeding populations in these two countries (an indication for prioritising this population in PrEP policies and guidelines).</p><p>2. In the Discussion, briefly discuss when Zambia and Malawi implemented the PMTCT programme, current status of the PMTCT programme, whether donor agencies primarily support the programme and your thoughts on how PrEP can be integrated into current PMTCT guidelines. Include discussions with HCW and policy makers if available.</p><p>3. Lastly, transcript for PM607 is repeated. You could either find another transcript or consolidate your interpretations/application while citing the transcript once.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

</p><p>RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS</p><p>Editor&#x02019;s comments</p><p>Congratulations on a well conducted study and mostly an unbiased account of your diverse findings. A few suggestions to strengthen the readership interest:</p><p>1. If available, include recent HIV incidence and MTCT rates in pregnant and breastfeeding populations in these two countries (an indication for prioritising this population in PrEP policies and guidelines).</p><p>* This has been included in the revised manuscript (lines 51-59). We have included data about HIV incidence among women of reproductive age, based on population-based surveys in Malawi and Zambia. We also include data from historical studies of HIV incidence during pregnancy and breastfeeding in these countries. Finally, we provide estimates from UNAIDS about the relative contribution of new maternal HIV infections to new infant HIV infections in the two target countries. </p><p>2. In the Discussion, briefly discuss when Zambia and Malawi implemented the PMTCT programme, current status of the PMTCT programme, whether donor agencies primarily support the programme and your thoughts on how PrEP can be integrated into current PMTCT guidelines. Include discussions with HCW and policy makers if available.</p><p>* Thank you for this suggestion. We have included a paragraph about the current status of the PMTCT programs in Malawi and Zambia, including their success in expanding antiretroviral therapy coverage. We discuss the concerns raised by policymakers about the prioritization between HIV prevention (PrEP) and treatment (antiretroviral therapy) in the context of donor-funded programs (lines 329-336). In the following paragraph (lines 338-353), we provide suggestions on how national HIV programs might integrate PrEP into existing maternal and child health platforms, including PMTCT. </p><p>3. Lastly, transcript for PM607 is repeated. You could either find another transcript or consolidate your interpretations/application while citing the transcript once.</p><p>* Thank you for flagging this repetition. Transcript PM607 is now only cited once.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Thanks for the opportunity to review this manuscript. It is clearly written and interesting. Here</p><p>are my comments:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1) Line 54 &#x0201c;Policymakers were identified from existing governmental technical working groups&#x0201d;</p><p>Is this in both countries? </p><p>* Yes. We have added a phrase to indicate that this applies to both countries</p><p>Methods:</p><p>1) Please include approximate length of the interviews. </p><p>* Interviews lasted approximately one hour (line 100).</p><p>2) Please include the approach for participant selection.</p><p>* Patients and their partners were recruited via a convenience sample. The eligibility and approach are described further in lines 71-81. </p><p>3) Could the authors describe a little more about the participant selection; was the intention to interview 39 women? Was age or parity a criterion? Why 7 men? Please</p><p>give a little more detail. </p><p>* The eligibility criteria and approach are described in lines 71-81. Our target accrual was 40 HIV-negative pregnant or breastfeeding women, up to 40 primary male partners (based on the index women&#x02019;s permission to recruit), 20 HCWs, and 20 policymakers. The sample was divided evenly across the two country sites (lines 81-83). </p><p>4) Please include the theoretical approach for analysis.</p><p>* We have included additional text in the revised manuscript. In lines 61-64, it reads: &#x0201c;We used a qualitative descriptive approach in the design, data collection and analysis of this formative study [18, 19]. Our goal was to provide accurate accounting of events&#x02014;and their meaning&#x02014;from the individuals interviewed [18]. We drew from the basic tenets of naturalistic inquiry, with no specific commitment to a pre-defined theoretical framework [20].&#x0201d;</p><p>Results:</p><p>1) Could you add the dates to the title in Tables 1 &#x00026; 2?</p><p>* This has been added to the titles for Tables 1 and 2.</p><p>2) Were there any differences in sociodemographics by country? </p><p>* Because of our small sample size, we did not further stratify the participating women and their male partners by country. We were concerned that, with 20 or fewer participants in any one category, differences would be difficult to interpret. </p><p>3) Please remove the participant ID numbers. This is not helpful to the reader. </p><p>* These have been removed as requested.</p><p>4) Do we know the HIV status of the male partners? </p><p>* Out of 14 male partners, 13 were reported to be HIV-negative. Only 1 partner had unknown HIV status (Table 2).</p><p>5) Would be nice to know the gender and age of the health care workers and policy</p><p>makers. Is this possible?</p><p>* We agree that this information could be helpful. Unfortunately, we did not collect this information for healthcare workers and policy makers for reasons of confidentiality. Because these groups are small, there were concerns that such details could lead in accidental disclosure. This is now explained in lines 89-90.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>1) Would be nice to discuss how this could be similar or different in different populations. What</p><p>about younger women 15-18years? What about higher risk groups?</p><p>* In lines 340-342, we discuss the importance of screening and triage procedures for pregnant/breastfeeding women at elevated risk for HIV acquisition. Currently, there are few validated measures; however, it is acknowledged&#x02014;including by respondents in this study&#x02014;that such instruments could help to make PrEP services more efficient and sustainable. </p><p>2) Is there any data about PrEP in other groups of adults in Zambia or Malawi? </p><p>* Data about PrEP use in these countries remains limited. In Malawi, programs are only now beginning. In Zambia, pilot programs have been implemented for other key populations. These are now referenced in lines 365-367. </p><p>3) As noted in the limitations &#x02013; there are PrEP programs already in place in most countries now, this is less interesting since its based on intention rather than on real experience. </p><p>* As noted in this comment, this limitation has been acknowledged within the paper. However, since the majority of countries have not implemented large-scale programs targeting pregnant and breastfeeding women specifically, we believe this remains a worthy contribution to the public health literature.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0223487.s001"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to reviewers.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0223487.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0223487.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0223487.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Moodley</surname><given-names>Dhayendre</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2019 Dhayendre Moodley</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2019</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Dhayendre Moodley</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0223487" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
