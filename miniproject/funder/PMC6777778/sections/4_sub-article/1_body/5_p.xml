<p>* This has been included in the revised manuscript (lines 51-59). We have included data about HIV incidence among women of reproductive age, based on population-based surveys in Malawi and Zambia. We also include data from historical studies of HIV incidence during pregnancy and breastfeeding in these countries. Finally, we provide estimates from UNAIDS about the relative contribution of new maternal HIV infections to new infant HIV infections in the two target countries. </p>
