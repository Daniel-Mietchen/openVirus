<p>* Thank you for this suggestion. We have included a paragraph about the current status of the PMTCT programs in Malawi and Zambia, including their success in expanding antiretroviral therapy coverage. We discuss the concerns raised by policymakers about the prioritization between HIV prevention (PrEP) and treatment (antiretroviral therapy) in the context of donor-funded programs (lines 329-336). In the following paragraph (lines 338-353), we provide suggestions on how national HIV programs might integrate PrEP into existing maternal and child health platforms, including PMTCT. </p>
