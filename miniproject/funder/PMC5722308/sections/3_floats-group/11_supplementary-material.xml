  <title>Phylogenetic tree of HA and NA genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus isolated during 2012.</title>
  <p>Trees were constructed for HA and NA full-length nucleotide sequences from different regions of the world. Viruses are coloured in black to represent worldwide strains, red for viruses from Mexico (non-Yucatan), and blue for viruses specifically from Yucatan. Trees were constructed using the PHYML method with a SH-like branch support.</p>
