  <title>Temporal occurrence of genetic variants in Yucatan.</title>
  <p>Viruses from Yucatan with changes in HA and NA were distributed in time from epidemiological week 23 to 38. The bars represent the total number of influenza cases reported by the Regional Laboratory. The clear section indicates the number of confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and the grey section indicates the number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with genetic changes in HA and NA (HA–A141T / HA–S162I / NA–N341S / NA–L206S). The black section corresponds to the number of samples negative to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.</p>
