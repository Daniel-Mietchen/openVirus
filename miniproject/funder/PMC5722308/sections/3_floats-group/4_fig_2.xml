  <title>Phylogenetic tree of HA nucleotide sequences of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from the year 2013.</title>
  <p>Twenty-six HA sequences from Yucatan were aligned with 272 sequences from other regions of the world including seven from other regions of Mexico. Two independent clades were formed with sequences from Yucatan, corresponding to viruses containing either A141T or S162I amino acid mutation.</p>
