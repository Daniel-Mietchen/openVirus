  <title>Schematic representation of the HA molecule of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus.</title>
  <p>HA molecules were modelled using as template the crystal structure of A 2009 H1N1 virus hemagglutinin from A/California/04/2009 (PDB 3LZG). Molecules were generated under flusurver structural model database (

Protein sequences were blast against A/California/07/2009 to identify differences on amino acid composition. Right side HA molecule was modelled based on the strain A/Yucatan/116/2013 to indicate localization of the amino acid change S162I (red oval). The HA molecule in the middle represents the amino acidic composition of the strain A/Yucatan/81/2013 indicating the position of the mutation A141T (blue oval). Mutations at residues V234I, K283E and E499K (HA2) placed these viruses in clade 6C. Left side molecule corresponds to the HA protein sequence of the strain A/Yucatan/18/2012.
