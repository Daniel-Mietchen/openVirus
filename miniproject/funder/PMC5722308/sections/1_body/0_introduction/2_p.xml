<p>The epidemiological characteristics of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Mexico has been extensively described during different seasons, since the initial wave of the pandemic in 2009 to the further recurrence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in season 2011–2012 and 2013–2014 [

 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Likewise, some studies have specifically reported the epidemiology in different geographic regions [

 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Under the same framework, the molecular characterization of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus is also a key component of the surveillance system worldwide. Conversely to the epidemiological description, in Mexico, there exists an enormous gap of knowledge about the molecular evolution of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus further after the initial characterization at the time of the virus emergence [

 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Differences in seasonal patterns of circulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] as well as geographic differences between the 32 Mexican states may influence the evolution of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus as has been described in other regions of the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The molecular characterization of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Mexico has been limited to studies that analysed a reduced number of viral isolates from the influenza season 2011–2012 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], or to studies that analysed clinical samples by deep sequencing to search for viral markers of pathogenicity associated with severity and mortality [
