<p>In the present study we describe the sequence analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from Mexican A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses submitted during 2012â€“2013 to the public databases. The molecular analysis also included 98 HA and NA sequences of viruses isolated in Yucatan during the recurrence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2012 and the following year 2013. The molecular characterization of all the sequences for the year 2013 identified the presence of two genetic variants circulating exclusively in Yucatan. The phylogenetic analysis clustered these variants as independent monophyletic groups, suggesting the occurrence of natural events of genetic evolution. These results underline the need to close monitor the evolution of the influenza virus through the molecular analysis in countries as vast as Mexico.</p>
