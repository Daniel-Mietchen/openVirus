<p>The molecular characterization compared to the reference strain identify for the HA a total of eleven amino acid changes (

 </bold>) detected in 95% of the sequences from Yucatan. Amino acid changes S185T, S203T, S143G and A197T at the HA1 region placed viruses from Yucatan at clade 7 in agreement with viruses isolated from Mexico (non-Yucatan) and around the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Interestingly, mutation D97N that grouped viruses in clade 6 was absent in all sequences available from Mexico and it was detected only in one sequence from Yucatan (A/Yucatan/86/2012), besides it was already in circulation in 55% of sequences from other regions of the world. Overall, all sequences from Mexico including viruses from Yucatan contain in addition two mutations S69T and N260D [
