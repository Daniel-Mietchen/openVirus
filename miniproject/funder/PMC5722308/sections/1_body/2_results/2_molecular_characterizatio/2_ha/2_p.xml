<p>The phylogenetic analysis of the HA sequences grouped together the Yucatan viruses characterized by the presence of the mutation S69T, but separated from the other Mexican sequences included in the study (

 </bold>). The single virus with the HA mutation D97N was distant from the rest of the viruses in a single branch; it probably indicates the beginning of circulation of clade 6 viruses in Yucatan. According to the phylogeny, there was a close relationship between all Mexican viruses analysed in this study along with viruses from North America and Latin American countries. Noteworthy is the fact that the season 2012 in Mexico was caused by viruses representing the clade 7 grouped in a big branch separated from 2012 viruses from clade 6 that were already in circulation.
