<p>The molecular analysis of the NA gene in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Yucatan showed the presence of mutations N44S, V106I, V241I, N248D, and N369K commonly present in virus from other regions of Mexico and the world (

 </bold>). In accordance with the HA gene, all NA sequences from Mexico including Yucatan contained the mutation G41R reported for viruses grouped in clade 7, although the frequency of detection in viruses from other regions of the world was of 45%. The mutation H275Y associated to neuraminidase inhibitors resistance was detected in 10 sequences from Mexico but none from Yucatan. The percentage of similarity between the sequences from Yucatan and the reference strain was of 99% and within them of 100% identity.
