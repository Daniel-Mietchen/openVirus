Interesting, the recurrence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus arose after a previous season of undetectable levels of circulation except for the particular outbreak in the Chihuahua state in March 2011, where several associated deaths were reported [

According to the report from the Direccion General de Epidemiologia (DGE), the recurrence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus caused at the national level 6,021 cases confirmed by laboratory and Yucatan contributed only with 1.2% (76 cases). Clinical samples for viral isolation were selected according to the temporal occurrence in Yucatan. For the year 2012 we selected a total of 48 clinical samples, viral isolation in MDCK cells was achieved in 35 (73%) distributed during the three months of activity.
