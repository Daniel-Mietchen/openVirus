<p>During the year 2013 the temporal distribution of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Mexico was clearly different to the previous season. Overall, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had an extended season in Mexico starting from middle May 2013 until May 2014 [

 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was widely distributed in the Mexican territory with a highest rate of detection than previous seasons; importantly the pattern of circulation showed a geographic shift from the Southern to the Central/Northern states. From May to December 2013 Yucatan contributed with a total of 144 confirmed cases (20% of positivity at national level). In particular according to the report by the Regional Laboratory, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in Yucatan as early in February throughout the year with the highest peak in the summer months of June, July and August, at the same time that the influenza virus H3N2 (

To analyse the molecular evolution of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in Yucatan during this year, viral isolates were recovered from a total of 45 (31%) clinical samples distributed from May to October 2013.
