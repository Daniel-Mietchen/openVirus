<p>The molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA sequences of viruses from Yucatan for the period 2013 showed the occurrence of two genetic variants that circulated at different times during the season. The percentage of homology within Yucatan sequences was of 99.8%, and compared to the reference strain A/California/7/2009 or the Mexican sequences from other regions the percentage of homology was of 98.3 and 99.1% respectively.</p>
