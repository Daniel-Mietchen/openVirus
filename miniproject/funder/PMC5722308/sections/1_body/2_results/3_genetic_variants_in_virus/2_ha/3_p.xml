<p>The phylogenetic analysis of the HA of viruses from the season 2013 clearly shows that viruses from Yucatan are grouped into three different clades, a group of 12 viruses containing the mutation S162I together with the virus from Mexico, a group of 11 viruses containing the mutation A141T, and two viruses grouping close to the other Mexican strains (

 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], viruses from Mexico (non-Yucatan) are grouped in clade 6B containing mutations D97N, K163Q, A256T and K283E. On the contrary, viruses from Yucatan are grouped in clade 6C containing mutations D97N, V234I and K283E. Viruses A/Yucatan/374/2013 and A/Yucatan/250/2013 were grouped in clade 6B along the other Mexican viruses; the virus A/Yucatan/329/2013 was grouped in clade 6C without the genetic changes we have described.
