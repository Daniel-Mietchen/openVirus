<p>The molecular characterization was performed in 26 full HA sequences from Yucatan and 7 from other regions of Mexico (available at the GISAID database). From all mutations detected in the previous year 2012, only six were conserved (P83S, S185T, S203T, I321V, E374K y S451N). The loss of mutations S143G and A197T and the occurrence of three new mutations, D97N, V234I and K283E at the HA1 region, place all A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Mexico including viruses from Yucatan in the predominant clade 6, subgroups 6B and/or 6C [

 </bold>). Interesting, we identified two mutations I116M and R205K at frequencies of 38% and 46% respectively in viruses from Yucatan and detected in only one virus from Mexico (non-Yucatan), and at very low frequencies of 3% in viruses from other regions of the world analysed in our study. These results suggest that viruses from subtropical Yucatan possessed particular genetic markers shared at very low frequencies with viruses globally in circulation.
