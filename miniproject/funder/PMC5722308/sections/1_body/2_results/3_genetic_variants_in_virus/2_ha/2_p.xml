<p>The most significant finding in the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Yucatan was the presence of two mutations A141T and S162I with percentages of frequency of 42% and 46% (

 </bold> Mutation A141T was present in only 2% of worldwide sequences analysed in this study with no presence in viruses from other regions of Mexico. Strikingly, mutation S162I was unique for sequences from Yucatan; it was identified in only one sequence from other regions of Mexico (A/Mexico/2733/2013) and in none of the sequences from other regions of the world analysed in this study.
