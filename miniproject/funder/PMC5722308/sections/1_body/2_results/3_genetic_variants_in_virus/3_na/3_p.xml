<p>The analysis of the temporal distribution showed that the genetic change N341S was detected in 70% of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses analysed in June (

The circulation of viruses with either genetic change was detected in July (N341S in 50%; L206S in 28.5%). These results clearly indicate the presence in Yucatan of a diverse pool of genetic variants of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus for the season 2013 (
