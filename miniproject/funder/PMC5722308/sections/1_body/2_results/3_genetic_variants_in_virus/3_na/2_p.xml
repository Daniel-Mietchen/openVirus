<p>The phylogenetic analysis of the NA sequences from Yucatan clustered viruses in six different groups according to the mutations we have previously described (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189363.g002">Fig 2</xref>
 </bold>), where the Yucatan viruses grouped separate from the viruses from other regions of Mexico. Two main clusters were formed, one for those viruses containing the mutation L206S but proceeded by the mutation D451G at the node; and the group of viruses containing the mutation N341S. These two mutations L206S and N341S in NA were detected in the same group of viruses where the HA genetic changes A141T and S162I were identified. A small subgroup within the D451G node was formed by viruses A/Yucatan/97/2013, A/Yucatan/116/2013, A/Yucatan/152/2013 and A/Yucatan/260/2013 characterized by lacking the mutation L206S, instead, they contained the mutation I321V which was highly prevalent in viruses from Mexico (86%) and worldwide (48%). Additionally, a second subgroup formed by viruses A/Yucatan/79/2013, A/Yucatan/123/2013, A/Yucatan/133/2013 and A/Yucatan/150/2013 was characterized by the amino acid change I393V although the N341S was absent within them. Finally, viruses A/Yucatan/250/2013 and A/Yucatan/374/2013 were characterized by grouping with viruses from other regions of Mexico containing mutations that were frequently detected worldwide (I34V and K432E); whereas viruses A/Yucatan/329/2013 and A/Yucatan/345/2013 characterized by lacking all of the mutation previously describe (
