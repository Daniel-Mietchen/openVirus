<p>The molecular analysis of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated during the season 2013 was performed in a total of 35 full NA genes from Yucatan and compared with 7 NA sequences from other regions of Mexico. Four mutations were conserved in all viruses from Mexico and around the world, N44S, V241I, N248D and N369K (

Interesting none of the viruses from Yucatan did acquire mutation N200S compared to sequences where the mutation was identified in 86% and 94% in viruses from other regions of Mexico and the world respectively. Another mutation that was absent in the Yucatan viruses was the N397K, which has been reported mainly in North America and it was present in 71% of sequences from other regions of Mexico analysed in this study. Moreover, we also identified four amino acid changes, L206S, N341S, I393V and D451G at variable frequencies in the Yucatan viruses but either absent or present in small numbers in viruses from other regions of Mexico and worldwide (

The change I393V was identified in four NA sequences from Yucatan but was absent from all other sequences from Mexico and worldwide analysed in this study; opposite, in 2012, this mutation was identified in the NA sequences from Mexico (non-Yucatan) and the world, but not in the Yucatan viruses. The last mutation of relevance was the amino acid change D451G, which was found in a group of 14 sequences from Yucatan (40%), in one sequence from other regions of Mexico and in only 3% of sequences from the world.
