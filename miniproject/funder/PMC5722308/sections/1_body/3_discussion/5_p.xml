<p>In this study we have described the emergence of genetic variants of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in a specific region of Mexico. Overall, this study underlines the need of continuous monitoring of influenza viruses in different regions of Mexico with different seasonal patterns as we have recently shown [
