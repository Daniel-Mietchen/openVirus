<p>The amino acid A141T (A144T in H3 numbering) is located in the antigenic site Ca
 <sub>2</sub>. This antigenic site together with Ca
 <sub>1</sub> and Cb are considered induce cross-reactive protection. In H3 viruses this residue was associated with the emergency of escape mutants during the 1972/1975 epidemics and the occurrence of antigenically different strains (A/Memphis/72 to A/Victoria/75 [

 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The relevance of this amino acid on (1) the antigenicity of the influenza virus, (2) the emergence of escape variants and (3) the response to neutralization, has been experimentally revealed in the presence of monoclonal antibodies against H3, H5 and recently the pandemic H1 virus [
