<p>The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus resurged in the Mexican territory during the season December 2011- March 2012. The influenza season was characterized by a short period of circulation but with a high incidence after two years of very low detection [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The molecular characterization of a limited number of early isolates from the central region of the country revealed the presence of three dominant amino acid changes with respect to the vaccine reference strain A/California/07/2009 [

Further during the same season the genetic analysis of a larger number of HA and NA sequences including viruses from Subtropical Yucatan showed high genetic similitude between all the sequences from Mexico. The amino acid differences, S69T, S143G and N260D were detected in all the Mexican viruses analysed, and were also detected in viruses from North America particularly from the regions of California and Texas (

It is of particular interest the high incidence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus during the season 2011–2012, even though the vaccination campaign in Mexico started a month before the peak of the season. Since the emergence in 2009, no immune scape variants have been identified for the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus that could change the HA antigenic profile, thus the vaccine strain composition for the H1N1 subtype has been maintain for the last seven years [
