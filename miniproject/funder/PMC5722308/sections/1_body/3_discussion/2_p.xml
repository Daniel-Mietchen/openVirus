<p>The molecular analysis of viruses isolated during the 2013 allowed us to identify the occurrence of genetic variants with amino acid changes in 27% of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Yucatan. Mutations detected in the HA -A141T and S162I- are located at the antigenic sites Ca
 <sub>2</sub> and Sa respectively, and they were recently reported in the H1N1pdm09 virus as B-cell/Ab epitopes [

 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Influenza viruses can escape from the antibody-mediated neutralization by accumulating mutations in HA in order to evade the protective immunity. However, the evolution of the H1N1pdm09 virus has been remained antigenically homogeneous and similar to the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009-like [
