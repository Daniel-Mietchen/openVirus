<p>HA and NA full gene amplification was performed by conventional RT-PCR according to CDC protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A set of ten or 8 primers (

  <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189363.t001">Table 1</xref>
 </bold>) were used to amplify five or four overlapping fragments covering the complete HA and NA genes, respectively. Amplification procedures were performed with the SuperScript One Step RT-PCR with platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen) under the following reaction conditions: 1X of Mastermix, 400 nM of each primer, 1 μl of the enzyme mix, 2 μL of viral RNA and molecular grade water to complete a final volume of 25 μl. Amplification conditions for the RT step were 1 cycle at 50 °C for 30 min and 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, followed of 30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 sec, 50°C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. All amplifications were performed in a C-1000 Thermal cycler (BIO-RAD). PCR products were visualized in 1% TAE-Agarose gels stained with Sybr Safe (Invitrogen).
