<p>Prior to sequencing, all PCR products were purified using the enzyme EXOSAP-IT (Invitrogen); each mixture containing 4 μl of Exosap-it and 2 μl of PCR product was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min followed of 80 °C during 15 min and immediately stored at 4 °C until use in the sequencing reaction. The sequencing reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 μl using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 4 μl of buffer, 2 μl of BigDye, 3.2 μM of M13 primers [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and 1 μl of purified PCR product. Cycling conditions were as follow 1 cycle at 96 °C for 1 min and 25 cycles at 96 °C for 10 sec, 50 °C for 5 sec and 60 °C for 4 min. PCR products were purified using 96-well CentriSep plates (Applied Biosystems) to remove excess of primers and labelled ddNTPs. Purified products were concentrated and eluted in 20 μL of Hi-Di Formamide (Applied Biosystems), heated at 95°C for 5 min and immediately placed at 4 °C just before the run in a 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystem) using a performance optimized polimer-6 and a 310GA 61cm x50 umid Capillary.
