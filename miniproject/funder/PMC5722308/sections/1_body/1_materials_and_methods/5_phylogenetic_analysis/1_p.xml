<p>Sequence analysis of 98 HA and NA full length genes from A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated from Yucatan during the 2012 and 2013 was performed with Geneious v6.0 (accession numbers are listed in

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189363.s001">S1 Table</xref>
 </bold>). All sequences were deposited at the GISAID influenza virus database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://platform.gisaid.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://platform.gisaid.org</ext-link>). Additionally, we retrieve 61-HA and 46-NA sequences from Mexico (non-Yucatan) that were available from the two years of study; however, the sequence and phylogenetic analysis was performed only with full-length sequences (35-HA and 22-NA). The analysis also included 443-HA and 445-NA full length sequences from isolates collected world-wide taking randomly sequences representative of all the continents deposited during the two years of study. Sequences were retrieved from the GISAID and the NCBI public database. Phylogenetic analysis was done with Mega v5. Independent phylogenetic trees for HA and NA from each epidemic period were constructed using PHYML (maximum likelihood phylogenies), the HKY85 (Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano, 85) model with a SH-like branch support. All trees were constructed using the reference strain A/California/07/2009 as out-group.
