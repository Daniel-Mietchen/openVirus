<p>Viral isolation was performed in Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK). The MDCK cells were seeded in 24-well plates and overnight incubated at 37 °C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator with 5% of CO
 <sub>2</sub>. An aliquot of each clinical sample (200 μl) was inoculated in duplicate and completed to a final volume of 500 μl per well with 1X Dubelco´s Modified Eagles Media (D-MEM- GIBCO) to avoid dryness during incubation. Plates were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm during 1 hour at 25 °C, the viral inoculum was removed and cells were incubated with 1 ml of 1X D-MEM supplemented with TPCK- trypsin (SIGMA) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Infected cells were monitored daily until cytopathic effect (CPE) and monolayer destruction was observed. Supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 2,500 rpm/10 minutes to remove cell debris, aliquot and stored at—70 °C until further use. Previous to storage, the presence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in the supernatant was detected by a conventional hemagglutination (HA) assay using a 1% suspension in PBS of turkey red blood cells, and confirmed by real time RT-PCR.
