<p>All viral isolates with an HA titre were confirmed as A(H1N1)pdm09 virus by real-time RT-PCR according to CDC protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The sequence of primers and FAM-labelled TaqMan probes were actualized according to the InDRE protocol [
 <xref rid="pone.0189363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous to confirmation, viral RNA was extracted by automated protocols using the MagnaPure LC 2.0 Instrument and the MagnaPure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit protocol (Roche). The amplification procedure was performed with SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq Mix Kit (Invitrogen) under the following reaction conditions, 5 μl of viral RNA, 1X Reaction Mix, 1 unit of RT/Platinum Taq enzyme mix, 800 nM of each primer, 200 nM of TaqMan probe, and molecular grade water for a final volume of 25 μl. A negative and a positive control were included for each run. The amplification conditions were, for the RT step: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 15 min and 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min; followed of 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 sec and 1 min at 60 °C. All real-time RT-PCR amplifications were performed using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystem), and data analysis using the OneStep Software V3.
