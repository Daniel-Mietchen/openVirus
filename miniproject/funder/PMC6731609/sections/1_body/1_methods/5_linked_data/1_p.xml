<p>Linking the data by EHIN made it possible to obtain the anonymized individual-level temporal sequences of OHIP claims, hospital admissions, hospital discharges, and death, for Ontario residents during the data years investigated. First we filtered individuals with at least one influenza-like illness diagnosis in the OHIP database and aggregated to the earliest date within an influenza year (individuals with multiple claims in the full study period may be counted multiple times, but will only be counted once per influenza year). Then, we filtered all individuals with influenza-like illnesses that had a hospitalization record in DAD. We were therefore able to establish relationships between physician visits associated with influenza-like illness and hospitalization (even if influenza or pneumonia was listed in only one record of the sequence for a given patient). Note that individuals who have influenza-like illnesses and present with pneumonia are often given a diagnosis of pneumonia rather than influenza.</p>
