 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ICD10</ext-link> (the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases) before our study period; however, the diagnosis codes recorded in the administrative databases used

All records for individuals with at least one record with a code in Table
