<p>In order to contribute to understanding of seasonal patterns of respiratory illnesses, we aggregated events according to diagnosis and billing date. Because multiple billings are frequently associated with the same individual during a single illness, a given individual is likely to contribute to counts in multiple categories on multiple days during any given illness. Thus, the aggregated counts provide a time series of health service utilization (which counts the frequency of each diagnosis observed per day) rather than an epidemic time series (which would count each case of a disease once).</p>
