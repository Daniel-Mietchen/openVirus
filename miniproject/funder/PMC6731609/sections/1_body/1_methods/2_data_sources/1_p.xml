<p>Three MOHLTC administrative databases were available to us: OHIP Ontario Health Insurance Program claims, as recorded in Medical Services Files. This database records all fee-for-service billings for 
 <italic>physician services</italic> in Ontario; for each procedure, there is a 
 <italic>service code</italic> and a 
 <italic>diagnostic code</italic>. DAD Discharge Abstract Database, which contains hospital 
 <italic>inpatient records</italic> (all data years) and 
 <italic>day procedure records</italic> (data years prior to 2003/04), including diagnosis codes (one of which is flagged as “most responsible”). Inpatient records include the date of 
 <italic>admission</italic> and the date of 
 <italic>discharge</italic> or 
 <italic>death</italic>. NACRS National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. Since 2003/04, Ontario hospitals have reported 
 <italic>day procedure events</italic> to NACRS rather than the DAD.
