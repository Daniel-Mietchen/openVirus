<p>We defined the start and end dates of data years via the “influenza year”, running from 1 April to 30 March of the next year. Thus, for example, “data year 2006” refers to the time period from 1 April 2006 to 30 March 2007. This definition captures the typical seasonal influenza epidemic in the northern hemisphere from November to March.</p>
