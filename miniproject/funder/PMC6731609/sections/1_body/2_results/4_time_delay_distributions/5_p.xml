<p>In addition to summarizing the delay distributions by their quantiles, we also fitted parametric distributional models (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Gamma models, using only two parameters (shape and scale), did a poor job fitting the delay distributions, which tend to have both sharp peaks and heavy tails relative to a Gamma distribution. We also fitted four-component finite mixtures of Poisson distributions; with 7 parameters (four rate parameters and three parameters determining the relative weights of the mixture components) these captured much more of the overall pattern, but still left some features unexplained. Other models, such as a finite mixture of negative binomial distributions, may provide better summaries; how complex a summary is most useful (e.g. a simple Gamma vs. a many-parameter finite mixture) will depend on particular applications.
