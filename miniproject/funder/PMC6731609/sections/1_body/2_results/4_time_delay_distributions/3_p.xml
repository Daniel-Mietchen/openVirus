<p>Normalizing the distributions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> by the total counts in the diagnostic category yields the estimated probability densities in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; these densities are normalized, and shown, on a 30 day timescale rather than the 100 day timescale presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> (in order to focus on pairs of events that are more likely to be causally connected). The leveling-off of the influenza distribution at a higher value than the pneumonia and other respiratory diagnoses in most of the plots (admission to discharge, admission to mortality) is an artifact of the smaller number of influenza cases; if the total number of cases is 10,000, then the non-zero values of the distribution cannot go below 10
