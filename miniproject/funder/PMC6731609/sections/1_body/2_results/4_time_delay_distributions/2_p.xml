<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> reveals that short delays (e.g., &lt;30 days) are most common overall; the exceptions are a very long tail in the distribution of delays from service to admission, and a roughly flat distribution for influenza-related service to mortality (for which sample sizes may be too small to draw confident conclusions). Delay distributions are similar for influenza and “other respiratory” diseases; pneumonia generally has a longer time from admission to discharge or mortality. The latter pattern may be driven by the more substantial 
 <italic>negative</italic> tail of delays from service to admission, which represents people who were admitted to hospital during the focal season but were first billed for services relating to one of the diagnostic codes listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> some time 
 <italic>after</italic> their admission.
