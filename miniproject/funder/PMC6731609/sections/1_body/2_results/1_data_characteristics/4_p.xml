<p>From Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> it is straightforward to estimate various outcome probabilities given specific events having occurred during the focal data year (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>P</italic>(Hospitalized | P&amp;I diagnosis) is defined as the probability that an individual who was diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during a given influenza year was hospitalized during that year; the reason for hospitalization may not have been related to pneumonia or influenza. Similarly, 
 <italic>P</italic>(P&amp;I diagnosis | Hospitalized) denotes the probability that someone who was hospitalized during the influenza year was diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza that year; the P&amp;I diagnosis might have occurred before, during or after the hospitalization. The one exception is the final row of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, where 
 <italic>P</italic>(Died in hospital | Hospitalized) denotes the probability that someone who was hospitalized during a given influenza year died 
 <italic>in hospital</italic> that year, which could have happened only after hospitalization (though potentially after multiple distinct hospitalizations); note that 
 <italic>P</italic>(Hospitalized | Died in hospital) would not be exactly 1 because some individuals who died in hospital in a given influenza year were hospitalized before the beginning of that influenza year.
