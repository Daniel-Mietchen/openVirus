<p>Influenza is a major global health concern that accounts annually for tens of thousands of deaths in North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and approximately 400,000 deaths worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Much effort has been invested in mathematical modeling of influenza dynamics in order to design improved control strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and to estimate their economic impacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A fundamental limitation of such studies is a lack of quantitative information concerning the relationships between influenza infection and health care system utilization. In particular, how should we expect changes in influenza transmission dynamics induced by control measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] to translate into (i) changes in influenza-associated visits to physiciansâ€™ offices or hospitals and (ii) health care system burdens from influenza-associated hospitalizations?
