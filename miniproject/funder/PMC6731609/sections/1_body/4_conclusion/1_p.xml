<p>Forecasting of influenza epidemics and associated patterns of health care system utilization can be conducted with greater confidence using the empirically estimated delay distributions that we have presented here (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; data in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). While quantifying delay distributions was our primary goal, we were able to obtain a number of statistics that are of independent interest (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). For example, approximately 5% of people admitted to hospital died there, and if they died in hospital then the probability that they had been diagnosed with influenza or pneumonia within the year was 10%.
