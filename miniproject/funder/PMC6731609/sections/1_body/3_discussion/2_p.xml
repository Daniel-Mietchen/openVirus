<p>In order predict the future time course of an epidemic, and the associated burden on societal structures, mathematical and statistical models require prior information [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The most basic ingredients of such models are the mode of transmission and natural history of infection (latent, incubation and infectious periods). If we wish to predict patterns of health care system utilization, then we also need to quantify the relationship between the time of initial infection and the time at which health care resources (especially hospital beds) are likely to be exploited.
