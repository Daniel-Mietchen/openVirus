<p>Furthermore, we were able to compare various outcome probabilities given specific events (P&amp;I diagnosis, hospitalization, and death) during different years. We emphasize that these conditional probabilities reflect associations, not causal links. Neverthless, they are useful for identifying patterns in the data that may be valuable to explore more thoroughly in the future. For example, we found that the probability of hospitalization for an individual who was diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during the pandemic year was, surprisingly, lower than in non-pandemic years; mortality in hospital was roughly the same for both pandemic and non-pandemic years.</p>
