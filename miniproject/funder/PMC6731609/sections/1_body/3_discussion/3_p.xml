<p>The time of initial infection is generally unobservable. However, for each influenza season that we examined, we were able to identify the time at which an individual was first 
 <italic>diagnosed</italic> with influenza, pneumonia or another acute respiratory infection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). By taking advantage of database linkage, we were able to estimate several “delay distributions”, i.e., the distributions of time from initial diagnosis to hospital admission, discharge and death. Fortuitously, the data years available to us included the 2009 influenza pandemic, so we were also able to compare distributions in non-pandemic years with a pandemic year.
