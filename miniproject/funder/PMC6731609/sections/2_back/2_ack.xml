 <p>This project would never have occurred without the enthusiasm and determination of Byron Spencer, who worked hard to make sure that the MOHLTC administrative databases became available to researchers in the Statistics Canada Research Data Centre (RDC) at McMaster University. At the RDC, we were supported by James Chowhan and Peter Kitchen. We are also indebted to many staff members at Statistics Canada, including Richard Trudeau, Donna Dosman, Paula Woollam, Evan Green, Carla Ross, and Tina Hotton.</p>
