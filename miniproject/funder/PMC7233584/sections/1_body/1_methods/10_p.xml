<p>At each level of vaccination, we modeled the two vaccination distribution strategies currently implemented on the Channel Islands [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Vaccinated animals were distributed at random across the island or grouped together in a firewall [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that spanned the entire width of the island (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232705.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The location of the vaccination firewall varied based on the simulated disease introduction site. In simulations of an epidemic originating in the high-density, northern portion of the island (e.g., landing docks or the town), the vaccination firewall was placed at the border between the high and medium-low density habitats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232705.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In simulations of an epidemic originating in the low-density, remote southern beaches, the vaccination firewall was placed in the medium-high density block (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232705.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This represents an optimistic assumption that the most likely site of disease introduction can be predicted. However, complete saturation of the local fox population with vaccines is not feasible, so there will always be some number of susceptible foxes surrounding the first infected fox even when the introduction site is correctly anticipated. The more foxes that become infected before the disease front reaches the vaccine firewall, the greater the risk that one of these infected foxes will “jump” the firewall through a long-distance dispersal event, abnormal movements of sick animals, or home range shifts as foxes die and habitat is left unoccupied (simulated by the “background” transmission rate). On the other hand, placing a firewall closer to the anticipated point of pathogen introduction carries a greater risk if introduction occurs on the unanticipated side, leaving fewer animals protected. To evaluate the importance of firewall location relative to the location of pathogen introduction, we tested two treatments for both low and high-density firewalls. Each firewall was placed so that either ~20% (200 foxes; “far firewall” treatments) or ~5% (50 foxes; “near firewall” treatments) of the total fox population was left on the “infected” side of the firewall where a pathogen was introduced. These treatments represent a range of scenarios that allowed us to explore the importance of predicting disease entry points on the efficacy of a vaccination firewall.
