<p>The simulated fox population remained static with no births or sources of mortality except from the diseases being modeled. We adopted these simplifying assumptions to remove variables that would complicate our understanding of the role that vaccination and monitoring play in an epidemic. There is some biological justification for simplifying the model, which simulated host-disease dynamics for only a single year. Island foxes are seasonal breeders and pups are born in the spring [
