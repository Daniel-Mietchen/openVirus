<p>We ran 1,000 iterations for each of the model treatments testing monitoring strategies (five levels of monitoring intensity and two levels of monitoring frequency for two introduction sites and two pathogens) and model treatments testing vaccination strategies (three levels of vaccination with three distribution strategies for two introduction sites and two pathogens). For each model treatment, we recorded the median and 25% and 75% quartiles (Q1 and Q3, respectively) of each output variable. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were chosen to summarize the data because the distributions of output variables were often highly skewed.</p>
