<p>Each simulation was run for 365 daily time-steps. On the first day of the simulation, one fox was randomly selected at either the northern, high-density end of the island, or the southern, low-density end of the island. This fox was put into the infectious class to start the epidemic. At each time-step, the probability of infection for each susceptible fox was calculated based on the contact it had with neighboring infected foxes, the background transmission risk from all infected foxes across the island, and the transmission probability of the virus (

Susceptible animals were disease free and unvaccinated, and therefore capable of becoming infected with a pathogen. Latent animals had been infected but were not yet capable of transmitting the pathogen to other foxes and remained in this class for an average of 42 days (maximum 90 days) for rabies and an average of 5 days (maximum 14 days) for CDV (
