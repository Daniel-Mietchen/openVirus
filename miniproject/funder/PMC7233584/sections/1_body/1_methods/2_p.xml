<p>Simulated fox home ranges did not overlap more than 75%, which was the maximum degree of overlap observed between unrelated fox pairs on SCI [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The exclusion of related pairs simplifies the model since the proportion of neighboring foxes that are related is not known, but this assumption likely resulted in slower pathogen spread in the model simulations compared to what could be expected in reality.
