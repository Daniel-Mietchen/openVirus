<p>Vaccinated foxes were placed in the vaccinated class on the first day of the simulation and were never susceptible to infection. We assumed vaccinations provided 100% immunity that lasted for the entire simulation. This is a reasonable assumption for rabies; dogs have been found to have 100% immunity after 2–4 doses of vaccine, with antibody levels suggesting that one dose is adequate [

 <italic>Mustela eversmanni</italic>) injected with CDV vaccine may develop immunity (two doses delivered four weeks apart) [

In order to achieve the target number of immune animals, managers may want to vaccinate 20%– 50% more animals than they hope to ultimately have protected and recapture these animals to give them booster vaccinations to maintain immunity. The model assumed that this has been done, and vaccinated animals represent individuals who were completely protected from infection.
