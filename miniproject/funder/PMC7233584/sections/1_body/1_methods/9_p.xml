<p>We also evaluated two aspects of vaccination strategy: the percentage of the population vaccinated and the distribution of vaccinated animals on the landscape. Vaccination simulations included four levels of vaccination: 0%, 10%, 30%, or 50% of the fox population. The target annual vaccination rate on SCI is 10%, and 30% approximates the highest vaccination rate achieved on any of the Channel Islands [
