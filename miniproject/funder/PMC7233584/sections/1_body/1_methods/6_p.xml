<p>Rabies is almost always fatal to mammals, and data on recovery is incomplete [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] so a recovered class was not included for this disease. Recovery of island foxes from CDV infection is likely very rare, based on the high mortality observed during the Santa Catalina Island CDV epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and in other

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Previous sensitivity analyses for this model included CDV recovery and found that it increased pathogen transmission and decreased the probability of epidemic fadeout due to the extended shedding period of recovering animals, and these changes were dependent on the percentage of foxes recovering from infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recovery was not included in the model treatments presented here because island fox recovery rates are unknown and the focus of this manuscript is on evaluating monitoring and vaccination tools.
