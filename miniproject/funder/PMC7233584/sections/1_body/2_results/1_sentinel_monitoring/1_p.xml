<p>Monitoring frequency had the single biggest impact on the time between pathogen introduction and epidemic detection. When monitoring frequency was sufficient to confirm an epidemic from the first sentinel death, epidemics were detected within a median of 5â€“16 days regardless of pathogen, introduction site, or monitoring intensity (

When monitoring frequency was lower (epidemic detection occurred from the fifth sentinel death), monitoring intensity had a larger influence on time to detection, which declined from a median value of 93 days with 50 sentinels to 31 days with 150 sentinels (
