<p>Increasing the number of sentinels and the monitoring frequency also reduced the variability in the percentage of foxes infected at the end of one year, but these improvements were most drastic for CDV. For rabies, the IQR was always narrow, with the largest IQR occurring with high-density introduction, low-frequency monitoring, and only 50 sentinels (IQR = 8.4%;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s002">S2 Table</xref>). For CDV, increasing the number of sentinels generally reduced the IQR across all combinations of introduction site and monitoring frequency. The most drastic reductions were for low-density introduction sites with low-frequency monitoring, where the IQR shrunk from 79.6% with 50 sentinels to 5.1% with 150 sentinels (

Increasing monitoring frequency also reduced outcome variability, especially for low-density introduction treatments. When only 50 sentinels were monitored, the IQR of foxes infected was 3.3% when the first sentinel was detected, compared to 79.6% when the fifth sentinel was detected (

For both pathogens, the decrease in model variability was generally largest between 50 and 100 collared sentinels, with the incremental improvements decreasing as the number of sentinels increased between 100 and 150 animals (
