<p>The variability in time to epidemic detection among model iterations (error bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232705.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) was influenced by monitoring frequency and intensity. When only 50 sentinels were monitored, the IQR of detection day was 51–55 days with low-frequency monitoring and 20–22 days with high-frequency monitoring (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s003">S3</xref> Tables). Overall, increasing monitoring frequency led to greater confidence that epidemics would be detected within three weeks of initial infection. Increasing monitoring intensity by collaring more sentinels also reduced model variability, but to a lesser extent.
