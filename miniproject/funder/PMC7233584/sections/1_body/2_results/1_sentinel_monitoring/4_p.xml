<p>In contrast to rabies, there was a wide range of potential outcomes with a CDV epidemic in terms of the percent of foxes infected at epidemic detection (

Increasing the number of sentinels yielded larger benefits when the initial CDV infection was in the high fox density region than when it was in the low fox density region. This was most dramatic in the worst case scenario, 50 sentinels monitored and confirmation at the fifth mortality, which resulted in 81.4% foxes becoming infected when an epidemic started in the high fox density region, compared to 34.6% of foxes when the epidemic started in the low density region (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s003">S3 Table</xref>). However, there was high variability in model outcomes (as indicated by the wide IQR), especially with low-density introduction (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Overall, increased monitoring frequency paid bigger dividends than increased numbers of sentinels. At the first sentinel mortality, a median of &lt;10% of foxes were infected at the time of epidemic discovery regardless of pathogen introduction site or number of sentinels monitored (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s003">S3 Table</xref>). There were still consistent declines in the percentage of foxes infected as the number of sentinels increased, but these were negligible compared to the reduction between the first and fifth sentinel mortality (
