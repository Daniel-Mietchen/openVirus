<p>All vaccine treatments reduced the percentage of foxes infected at the end of one year compared to no vaccination. At high fox densities, near firewall vaccination was the most successful strategy, with a median of &lt;2.0% infected foxes regardless of vaccination level (Figs

Both firewall treatments produced minimal additional reductions in infected foxes with increasing levels of vaccination. Increasing levels of randomly placed vaccinations led to decreases in the percentage of infected foxes, with the largest decrease occurring between 10% and 30% (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s004">S4 Table</xref>). At 10% vaccination, random vaccination was comparable to far firewall vaccination but resulted in 26.7% more infected foxes than near firewall vaccination. At 50% vaccination, random vaccination was comparable to near firewall vaccination and resulted in 16.7% fewer infected foxes than far firewall vaccination (
