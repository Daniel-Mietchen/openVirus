<p>For CDV, the probability of epidemic fadeout was always very high, with medians &gt;96% across all vaccination levels, vaccination distributions, and fox densities (

Depending on the model treatment, fadeout occurred due to a lack of susceptible foxes either locally (with minimal fox infections) or after the disease spread through the entire fox population (infecting most foxes on the island). This bimodal distribution of model outcomes is reflected in the large IQRs in the percentage of infected foxes (Figs
