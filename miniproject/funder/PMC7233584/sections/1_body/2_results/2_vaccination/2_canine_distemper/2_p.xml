<p>All vaccine treatments reduced the percentage of foxes infected at the end of one year compared to no vaccination, but there were dramatic differences in the efficacy of each treatment. At high fox densities, both random and far firewall vaccination treatments resulted in a near linear decrease in infected foxes with increasing levels of vaccination (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s005">S5 Table</xref>). For far firewall vaccination treatments, the median percentage of foxes infected was within 5–7% of the total susceptible (i.e. unvaccinated) population, demonstrating that nearly the entire unvaccinated population had become infected by the end of one year (ex. a maximum of 70% of foxes can become infected with 30% vaccination; Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s005">S5 Table</xref>). However, variability in model outcome increased as vaccination levels increased, reflecting that higher vaccination rates did result in more model iterations where larger numbers of susceptible foxes survived. In contrast, for random vaccination placement, increasing vaccination levels led to greater protection for the remaining unvaccinated foxes without leading to greater variability in model outcome (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s007">S2A Fig</xref>). For example, at 50% vaccination rates, a median of 5.3% out of a possible 50% of foxes were infected at the end of the simulation (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s007">S2A Fig</xref>). Near firewall vaccination was by far the most successful vaccine distribution, with a median of ≤4.0% of foxes infected across all levels of vaccination (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s005">S5 Table</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s007">S2C Fig</xref>). However, there was high model variability when only 10% or 30% of foxes were vaccinated (IQRs of 81.1% and 57.2%, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232705.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s007">S2C Fig</xref>). The upper quartiles of infected foxes came within 3.6% of the maximum susceptible foxes available, meaning there were 25% of model iterations in which all unvaccinated foxes became infected (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232705.s007">S2C Fig</xref>). This reflects that while near firewall vaccination was an effective strategy most of the time, if the firewall was breached then CDV infected the entire fox population within one year.
