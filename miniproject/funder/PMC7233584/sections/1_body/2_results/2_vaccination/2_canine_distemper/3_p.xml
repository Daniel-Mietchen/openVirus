<p>At low fox densities, the efficacy of different vaccination strategies generally mirrored the high-introduction site scenarios (especially for near firewall treatments), though there was greater variability in model outcomes. Far firewall vaccination had a high median of infected foxes similar to with high-density introduction, but the IQRs were wider and skewed towards very low percentages of infected foxes. This shows there were more iterations in which CDV faded out before many unvaccinated foxes were infected (

Random vaccination had a high median of infected foxes with just 10% vaccination, but the IQR was much wider than at high densities and skewed towards smaller percentages of infected foxes, again reflecting that sometimes this strategy was highly effective in stopping the epidemic (
