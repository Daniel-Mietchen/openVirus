<p>To be effective in preventing disease outbreak, there must be a high proportion of hosts vaccinated within the firewall and the firewall must be wider than the distance an animal will travel [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], meaning that a successful vaccination firewall must be at least several kilometers wide to prevent an infected fox from traveling across it. The probability of vaccine saturation within a firewall is likely unattainable for large areas of SCI because of the high density of foxes in some areas of the island [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and because vaccination is currently limited to hand injections due to the lack of approved oral rabies vaccines in California [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Even though this model assumed an unrealistic 100% vaccine saturation within firewalls, firewall vaccination was only substantially better than random vaccination when placed very near to pathogen introduction sites. However, even if a firewall does not stop an epidemic from spreading through the larger host population, managers should consider another potential benefit of clustering vaccinations: surviving, vaccinated animals will be able to maintain their social structure and relationships with known neighbors, potentially facilitating repopulation once the epidemic has passed.
