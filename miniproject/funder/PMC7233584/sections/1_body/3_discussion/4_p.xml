<p>CDV had a more complicated relationship between fox density and vaccination success, as illustrated by large IQRs and extreme median values, reflecting the wide variety of model outcomes (which were often bimodal). Depending on the density of hosts at high risk pathogen introduction sites, a combination of random and firewall vaccination close to the anticipated introduction site may be advisable across a management area. For example, the remote southern beaches of SCI that are not frequently monitored and have a relatively low density of foxes may be a good site for random vaccination. The town where the harbor and airport are located, along with a very high density of foxes that are frequently monitored, may be a good site for a firewall or clustered vaccination strategy. In addition, higher levels of vaccination may be required for successful prevention of a CDV epidemic regardless of fox density, due to CDVâ€™s longer infectious period resulting in faster pathogen transmission and more infected foxes [
