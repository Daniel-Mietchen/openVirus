<p>A key assumption of our model to bear in mind when interpreting these findings is that island foxes are isolated from other host species which could also propagate an epidemic. Higher vaccination levels will likely be needed to protect mainland host populations that are frequently exposed to rabies or CDV by unvaccinated reservoir species [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. We also assumed that all vaccinated foxes were fully protected for the one-year simulation. In order to achieve this, managers may have to account for vaccine failure by vaccinating more animals than they ultimately hope to have protected in the face of an epidemic. This level of vaccination may not be feasible depending on the cost of vaccines and the ease of animal capture for injectable vaccination. Alternative vaccination methods, such as oral vaccinations baits, could decrease the logistical burden of vaccination and allow managers to vaccinate animals over wider areas and in places which may be difficult for staff to reach by foot.
