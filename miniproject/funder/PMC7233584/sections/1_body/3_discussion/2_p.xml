<p>Our results from both pathogens show there is a relationship between the spatial distribution of vaccines and the level of vaccination required to stop pathogen transmission, and this relationship is dependent on the heterogeneity of host densities. In low host density regions, vaccinating randomly has a greater potential to suppress susceptible host densities below the epidemic threshold (R
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1) and prevent an epidemic from ever establishing. When a pathogen invades a region with high host densities, the same proportional vaccination effort is less likely to reduce the local density of susceptible individuals below the epidemic threshold [

Similar work has shown the complexity of this relationship, with some studies showing that vaccine firewalls effectively reduced the spatial spread and impact on host populations for a wide range of diseases [
