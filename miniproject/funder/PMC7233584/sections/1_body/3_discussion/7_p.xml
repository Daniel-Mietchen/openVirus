<p>There were substantial differences between the efficacy of firewalls located near vs. far from pathogen introduction site for both pathogens. A firewall strategy creates a small spatial zone where a disease can spread locally but will deterministically fade out due to the eventual depletion of susceptible hosts. However, as the number of infected animals increases, it becomes more likely that an infectious individual will cross the vaccine firewall and ignite the epidemic on the other side. This possibility is exacerbated when there is a high density of susceptible hosts (and hence R
 <sub>0</sub>&gt;&gt;1) on the infected side of a vaccine firewall. This scenario could be observed in our model simulations of CDV. CDV has a long infectious period, which resulted in a large number of simulated foxes in the infectious class at the same time, especially at high fox densities or when the firewall was placed far from the site of pathogen introduction. This large number of simultaneously infectious animals increased the chance that an infectious animal would cross the vaccination firewall, resulting in many model iterations where CDV jumped the firewall and the epidemic continued to spread through the entire fox population. However, when the firewall was placed closer to the site of pathogen introduction, fewer unvaccinated foxes were available to become infected and there was a much greater chance of pathogen fadeout with minimal population impacts.
