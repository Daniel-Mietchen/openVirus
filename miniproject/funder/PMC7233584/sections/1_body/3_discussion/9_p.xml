<p>The primary lesson from our research is that the potential impact of a pathogen on host populations and the effectiveness of monitoring and management strategies are heavily influenced by spatial variation in host density. Early detection of an epidemic is most likely if frequent monitoring is focused in areas with both a high risk of pathogen invasion and high population density. Vaccination programs in regions with high host density may not be as effective as providing high vaccine coverage in surrounding low-density areas where epidemic fadeout is more likely. Similarly, if pathogens are most likely to invade into low-density regions, vaccinating randomly throughout the area may be more effective. Previous studies have suggested that vaccination programs should also consider landscape features when designing deployment strategies: using natural barriers to enhance vaccination firewalls [

Firewall vaccination would likely be most beneficial in situations where host populations living in and around key landscape features (such as narrow habitat corridors) could be saturated with vaccinations in order to more effectively reduced the number of hosts infected early in the epidemic and the risk of infection crossing the firewall. The influence of pathogen entry location suggests another possible ecological management toolâ€”using landscape features to direct pathogen entry points away from areas with high hosts densities or towards regions with existing monitoring and vaccination programs [
