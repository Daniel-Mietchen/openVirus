<p>Our model did not simulate contact rates between mates or family members, only non-related neighbors. Field data from island fox proximity collars showed that mated pairs and family members have higher home range overlap and contact rates than non-related pairs [

Since the model predicts high transmission probability between non-related neighbors, it is reasonable to infer that related pairs will have higher transmission probabilities, which could accelerate the rate of pathogen spread in all model treatments. Previous CDV models and laboratory studies have also found higher transmission rates between individuals that were in contact frequently or for long periods of time [

Knowledge of fox social structure could help managers target highly connected individuals for vaccination in order to maximize the herd immunity benefit of vaccination (ex. adult females with pups, or family groups with yearling offspring assisting with raising the next generation of siblings).
