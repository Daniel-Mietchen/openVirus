<p>Any given introduction of a novel pathogen into a fully susceptible host population has a wide range of possible outcomes [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When a pathogen is spread directly between hosts, depletion of local susceptible hosts can lead to rapid fadeout with few hosts suffering infection. This is possible even for diseases with a high epidemic potential (i.e., basic reproductive number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, &gt;1) [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and is more likely to occur when epidemics are restricted to areas of low host density [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Once an epidemic reaches a region of high host density or infects highly connected individuals (so-called “superspreaders”), rapid pathogen transmission becomes more likely and can lead to severe impacts on the host population [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, high host density regions can conduct disease past low-density barriers because of snowball effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This often leads to a bimodal distribution of potential invasion outcomes which can be overlooked when focusing on the average course of epidemics, and traditional epidemic modeling approaches often fail to track the efficacy of disease monitoring or mitigation strategies [
