<p>Predictions of disease transmission in island foxes is complicated by sometimes drastic variation in fox density among different habitats within each island, resulting in similarly large variation in contact rates. Even across the relatively small spatial scale of an island, there is substantial variation in fox density across habitats within the same year [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that can alter fox home ranges and contact rates [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Foxes have more neighbors with overlapping home ranges at higher densities, resulting in more total contact with other foxes [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and potentially higher rates of pathogen transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Spatial heterogeneity in fox density and contact rates results in the location of pathogen introduction having a strong influence on the potential outcome of an epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, the density of foxes at the site of pathogen introduction might also influence the efficacy of different monitoring and vaccination strategies.
