<p>The recovery plan also recommends the long-term monitoring of “sentinel” foxes [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. “Sentinels” are radio-collared foxes that have not been vaccinated and are susceptible to introduced pathogens. They are monitored on a regular basis so managers will be alerted to an epidemic (or other population threat) when several sentinel animals die in quick succession or at a rate higher than the population’s baseline mortality. Sentinels also allow for quick carcass recovery, increasing the chances that a necropsy will identify a definitive cause of death.
