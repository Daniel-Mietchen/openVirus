<p>Here, we evaluate the influence of fox density at the site of pathogen introduction on the efficacy of epidemic management strategies for San Clemente Island (SCI) foxes. Rabies and canine distemper are considered to be the two primary disease threats to island fox populations and are a focus of fox management activities on all of the California Channel Islands [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both pathogens are directly transmitted and require close contact between hosts to spread. Rabies is most commonly transmitted through saliva when an infectious host bites a susceptible host [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to evaluate the influence of host density on the success of monitoring and vaccination strategies for these two diseases. We used this model to answer three primary questions: 1) How does the number of collared sentinels and monitoring frequency affect the detection of an epidemic? 2) What is the optimal number and spatial distribution of vaccinated foxes to prevent an epidemic? 3) How does fox density at the site of pathogen introduction modulate the success of these monitoring and vaccination strategies?
