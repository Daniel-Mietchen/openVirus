<p>Commonly used management techniques to reduce the density of susceptible hosts include vaccination, culling, and fertility control. Natural epidemics and simulation models have demonstrated mixed efficacy of these techniques to prevent or minimize epidemics [

When available, vaccination is often the preferred option because it maintains a stable host population with an intact social structure, while effectively reducing the density of hosts susceptible to disease. Ideally, vaccines are distributed in ways that maximize the chances that an infectious host will contact a vaccinated (i.e. immune) host. These distribution strategies include the saturation of an exceptionally high risk “core area” with vaccinated animals, vaccination “firewalls” at the edge of an epidemic or in key geographic areas that act as a barrier to the advancing disease front, vaccinating key individuals that are highly connected with neighbors, or vaccinating animals randomly throughout the population [
