<p>The introduction of novel disease is a persistent risk to island foxes due to the regular movements of humans and animals (both purposeful and accidental) between the Channel Islands and the mainland. Implementation of a disease mitigation plan was a key part of the recent reclassification of the Santa Catalina Island fox subspecies to “threatened” and the delisting of three other subspecies formerly listed as "endangered" under the Endangered Species Act [

The Channel Island Fox Recovery Plan recommends vaccinating a minimum of 80–100 foxes against both rabies and CDV in two or three strategic geographic “core areas” on each island where there are relatively high fox densities and disease introduction risks, such as harbors where tourist and supply boats regularly dock [

 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These core areas could be clusters of vaccinated animals (e.g. in and around a town) or in the form of a “firewall,” where vaccines are distributed in a linear band in order to stop an advancing disease front [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Some islands (such as Santa Catalina) vaccinate a larger number of foxes and space these vaccinations randomly around the island because they have several areas at high risk for disease introduction [
