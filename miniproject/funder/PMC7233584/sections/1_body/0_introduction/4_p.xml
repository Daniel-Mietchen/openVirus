<p>The introduction of canine distemper virus (CDV) to an isolated population of immunologically naïve Channel Island foxes (
 <italic>Urocyon littoralis</italic>) demonstrates the significant and rapid impacts disease can have on a host population, and how important epidemic preparedness is for wildlife management. The island fox is endemic to six of the eight Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. Santa Catalina Island is geographically divided into eastern (~87% of the island’s land mass) and western sections by a narrow isthmus, which few foxes have been observed to cross [

 <italic>Procyon lotor</italic>) that was a “stowaway” on a boat [

Luckily, the foxes inhabiting the smaller western portion of the island were largely untouched by the epidemic, likely because the narrow isthmus served as a barrier to fox movement and subsequent pathogen transmission to uninfected animals [
 <xref rid="pone.0232705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The speed and severity of this population decline, and the continued threat of future pathogen introduction from introduced species, resulted in the Santa Catalina Island fox subspecies being listed as “critically endangered” under the Endangered Species Act in 2004 [
