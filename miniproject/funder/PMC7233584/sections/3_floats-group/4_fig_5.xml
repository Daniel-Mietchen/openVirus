 <caption>
  <p>Model simulation results (medians, 25% and 75% quartiles) of canine distemper introduction to areas of San Clemente Island with high (A, C) or low (B, D) fox density and varying levels of fox vaccination (0%, 10%, 30%, or 50% of the population) distributed randomly or in a firewall. Simulations with firewall vaccination had either 5% of foxes (“near firewall”) or 20% of foxes (“far firewall”) on the side of the firewall where canine distemper was introduced. As the percentage of vaccinated foxes increased, the probability of epidemic fadeout (A, B) generally remained stable and the percentage of foxes infected (i.e. latent, infectious, or dead) by the end of the 365-day simulation (C, D) generally decreased.</p>
