  <title>Results of a spatially explicit disease model simulating the introduction of rabies into a population of San Clemente Island foxes with different vaccine distributions and percentages of the fox population vaccinated.</title>
  <p>The probability of epidemic fadeout was measured as the percentage of model iterations which resulted in no foxes remaining in the latent or infectious disease classes, so that rabies was extirpated from the fox population. The percentage of the total fox population infected (i.e. latent, infectious, or dead) at the end of the simulation (day 365) was used to assess the extent of pathogen spread. Simulations with firewall vaccination had either 5% of foxes (“near firewall”) or 20% of foxes (“far firewall”) on the side of the firewall where rabies was introduced. </p>
