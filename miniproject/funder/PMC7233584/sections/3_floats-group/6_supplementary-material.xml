  <title>Results of a spatially explicit disease model simulating the introduction of rabies into a population of San Clemente Island foxes with varying levels of sentinel monitoring.</title>
  <p>Day of epidemic detection was calculated as the day from the start of the simulation until the first or fifth unvaccinated, radio-collared sentinel animal died of disease. The percentage of the total fox population infected (i.e. latent, infectious, or dead) on the day of epidemic detection was used to assess the extent of pathogen spread.</p>
