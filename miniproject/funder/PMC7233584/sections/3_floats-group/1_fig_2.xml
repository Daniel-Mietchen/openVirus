  <title>Maps of San Clemente Island as depicted by the rabies and canine distemper models, with dots representing the simulated home range center of each fox.</title>
  <p>Vaccinated individuals (red dots; 10% of the fox population) were distributed randomly across the island or in a firewall configuration located in a high or medium-high density of foxes. Fox densities within each section of the island represent the average across all model iterations. Scales are in meters.</p>
