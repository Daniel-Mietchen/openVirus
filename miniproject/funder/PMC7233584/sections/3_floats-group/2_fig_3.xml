  <p>Model simulation results (medians, 25% and 75% quartiles) of rabies (A, C) and canine distemper (B, D) introduction to areas of San Clemente Island with low or high fox density and no vaccination, with varying numbers of radio-collared sentinels. As the number of unvaccinated sentinel foxes increased, the number of days until epidemic detection (A, B) and the percentage of foxes infected (i.e. latent, infectious, or dead) by the day of detection (C, D) decreased. Note the different y-axis of panel C.</p>
