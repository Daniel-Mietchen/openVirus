<p>In addition, the four stochastic (probabilistic) HFRS indicators above convey complementary information regarding the intraclass relationship between the same incidence class (i.e., 
 <italic>m</italic> = 
 <italic>n</italic>), and the interclass relationship between different incidence classes (i.e., 
 <italic>m</italic> ≠ 
 <italic>n</italic>) in Heilongjiang province during January 2005–December 2013 (in fact, intraclass incidence variations can be considerably different than interclass HFRS variations). These stochastic HFRS indicators and their interpretations are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007091.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Interestingly, the JIP, IIP and EIP indicators can be expressed in terms of the SIC (these relationships are displayed in the third column of 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007091.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Further discussion of the characteristics and interpretations of the four stochastic indicators can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s005">S5 Text</xref>. In practice, these interpretations can be used in a complementary manner to obtain a holistic assessment of the disease situation. Next, the above stochastic HFRS indicators are calculated using space-time maps of HFRS incidence generated by categorized (cd) BME and compared in the case of the Heilongjiang province that is the focus of this work.
