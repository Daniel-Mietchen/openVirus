<p>The spatiotemporal arrangement of the HFRS patches occupied by the different incidence classes can be described by the relative frequencies with which the different kinds of incidence classes occur next to one another, i.e., by the corresponding incidence probabilities across space and time. That is to say, the spatiotemporal dependence of HFRS incidences can be assessed quantitatively in terms of stochastic (probabilistic) indicators linking categorical HFRS incidences at points
