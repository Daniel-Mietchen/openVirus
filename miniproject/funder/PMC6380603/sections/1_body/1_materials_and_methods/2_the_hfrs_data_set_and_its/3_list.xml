  <p>The data was log-transformed by means of 
   <italic>Y</italic>(
   <bold>
    <italic>p</italic>
   </bold>) = log
   <sub>10</sub>(
   <italic>X</italic>(
   <bold>
    <italic>p</italic>
   </bold>) + 1). The additional advantage of this equation being that it can also account for zero values (such zero values are noteworthy since they may offer important clues to physical characteristics linked to the absence of disease or individual immunity).

  <p>The HFRS data set was categorized into four classes in terms of percentiles, as shown in 
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, i.e., considering that 58% of the original data consist of 0 values, we divided the remaining 42% of the data into four classes by percentile (so that each of them has 10.5% of the data), and, subsequently all 0s (58%) were added to the first class, i.e., 0–68.5%, 68.5–79%, 79–89.5% and 89.5–100%. The selection of four classes was based on the satisfaction of the following quantitative criteria: (
   <italic>i</italic>) the variability criterion (i.e., after dividing the original data into a certain number of categories, the incidence variability should be reduced); (
   <italic>ii</italic>) the coverage criterion (i.e., the data coverage across the entire study area should decrease with increasing number of categories, and it is suggested to have data that covers more than 60% of the study area); and (
   <italic>iii</italic>) the mapping criterion (i.e., based on empirical considerations, to assure mapping accuracy a rigorous technique requires that a certain number of space-time data points around the estimation point should exist in its category).
