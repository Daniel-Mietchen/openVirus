<p>More specifically, as regards criterion 
 <italic>i</italic>, due to the high HFRS data variability exhibiting a heavy-tailed distribution, it was found that by classifying the data in terms of incidence percentiles, the intraclass data variability was reduced significantly. In response to criterion 
 <italic>ii</italic>, the particular incidence classes were selected because they allowed a sufficient number of space-time points in each class for further processing (HFRS mapping and indicator analysis). Within these interval classes

Hence, in the present study there were at least 90 locations in each incidence class (which can be regarded as a spatial data coverage criterion for improved mapping purposes). As regards criterion 
 <italic>iii</italic>, based on empirical considerations a rigorous mapping technique requires that a certain number of space-time data points around the estimation point should exist in its category for mapping accuracy purposes.
