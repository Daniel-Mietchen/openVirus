<p>In relation to the above, two notions can be used to describe quantitatively the HFRS pattern across space-time: the global size of each incidence class, and the spatiotemporal arrangement of the different incidence classes relative to each other. Individual HFRS incidence classes may visually appear to occupy mutually exclusive “patches” of various sizes within the space-time domain of interest (e.g., any pair of classes 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> may have or may have not common boundaries). These patches may be spread uniformly throughout the domain of interest, or they may appear to be elongated along a particular direction, in which case the HFRS pattern will be characterized as anisotropic. The distribution pattern of incidence classes is determined by their spatiotemporal dependence, which makes the latter a key notion of a quantitative HFRS study.
