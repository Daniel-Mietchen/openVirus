<p>The plots of the four indicators offer complementary visualizations of the variation of the different probabilities of transition between incidence classes, i.e., the probabilities with which the different levels of HFRS incidences occur next to each other and so they describe the dependency pattern of the space-time arrangement of the HFRS patches occupied by the different incidence classes. Specifically, key features of interclass HFRS incidence relationships observed in this work are the space-time dependency, level of juxtaposition, and directional asymmetry of class patterns. The categorical HFRS incidences in the Heilongjiang province during Jan 2005-Dec 2013 exhibit rather smooth intraclass but complex interclass relationships. The complementary character of HFRS indicators of intraclass and interclass incidence transition and the estimated proportions of regional cover by each incidence class showed the dominance of the incidence class

 <sub>1</sub> dominated the Heilongjiang region. This phenomenon indicated that, independently of the particular infection level, the HFRS spread is dominated by point outbreaks with relatively small spatial ranges of influence. In other words, if an HFRS outbreak occurs at one location, it is necessary for the public health management to focus on in-situ HFRS prevention and control, as a measure to prevent further spread. This also reflects that the main pathway of HFRS infection is from rodents to humans, rather from person-to-person interaction [

Using the findings of spatiotemporal HFRS spread patterns, public health management can also determine the critical temporal and spatial scales for HFRS prevention and control. For example, if HFRS incidences at some location are identified to belong to class 2, effective measures should be taken for a period of approximately three months and within a radial distance of approximately 50 km (see
