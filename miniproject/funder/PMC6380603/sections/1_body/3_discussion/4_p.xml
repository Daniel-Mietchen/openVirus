<p>Another contribution of this work is in filling the gap in the quantitative modeling of the spatiotemporal HFRS transition mechanisms based on probability logic. In other words, the present study provides a solution to the problem of calculating HFRS spread across space-time. In this context, the proposed stochastic HFRS indicators were applied to estimate the probability of HFSR transmission between space-time domains exhibiting different infection levels as a function their spatial distance and time separation. The results of the Heilongjiang study suggested that the proposed stochastic HFRS indicators summarize well the space-time incidence patterns, and their physical meanings and interpretations of the proposed HFRS indicators provide useful information about the HFRS spread mechanisms in the Heilongjiang province during Jan 2005-Dec 2013. Some HFRS classes were found to be cross-correlated with apparent correlation ranges, but some classes were not cross-correlated in the usual sense (i.e., if classes occur at two distant parts of the Heilongjiang province, it may be appropriate to characterize their interclass relationship as non-adjacent). Each HFRS class has a relationship with any other class in the Heilongjiang province during Jan 2005-Dec 2013, and quantifying the spatiotemporal relationships between HFRS classes and incorporating them into disease analysis and mapping are help us realistic assessment of the real HFRS situation in the space-time domain of interest. The transition probabilities provided by the HFRS indicators describe the spatiotemporal arrangements between incidence classes and suggest interactions that can be explored further in detail.</p>
