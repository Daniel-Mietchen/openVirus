<p>Certain quantitative findings of this work are in line with previous qualitative assessments. For example, based on the finding of the previous studies HFRS incidences are closely associated with environmental factors, a finding that confirms, in part, the suggestions made by [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Given BMEâ€™s methodological features to assimilate secondary information and auxiliary variables (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), future work should focus on integrating environmental factors into BME analysis, to better understand HFRS spread patterns and provide more accurate predictions. The approach introduced in this work is likely to be valuable in comparisons of spatiotemporal incidence patterns at other regions of China or worldwide. Also, the same methodology could be used in the spatiotemporal modeling and mapping of other epidemics under similar in situ conditions, in which case the choice of the disease incidence classes could be linked to the specific public health purposes.
