<p>Future work should also focus on the current shortcomings of the proposed approach. One of them is the need for developing HFRS transition probabilities tests that could lead to stronger inferences regarding the interclass interactions suggested by these probabilities. Another is the relaxation of the space-time homostationarity assumption concerning HFRS spread, which may allow a more detailed assessment of the spatial anisotropy of transition probabilities as described by the HFRS indicators. Lastly, it must be kept in mind that real-world computations usually process datasets of potentially widely varying levels of uncertainty. As a result, in most cases the computational results may not satisfy exactly the theoretical assumptions. Instead, they are expected to strike a balance between theoretical rigor and computational cost is acceptable for practical purposes, which leaves room for potential improvement of the computational component of the proposed analysis.</p>
