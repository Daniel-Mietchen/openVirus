<p>In this work, the spatiotemporal distribution of HFRS incidences in Heilongjiang province during the period 2005â€“2013 was studied quantitatively using spatiotemporal random field modeling that accounts for both the structural and uncertain aspects of HFRS spread. In this modeling context, key attributes of the HFRS incidence distribution were quantified by means of covariance functions, shedding light on the predominant HFRS spread patterns in space and time. A methodological advancement of the present study is that a cd-BME technique was introduced to reduce skewness effects in the spatiotemporal distribution of HFRS incidence data. This technique demonstrated a significant ability in modeling the pronounced variability in HFRS data caused by infection outbreaks that result in skewed distributions. Further, a moving windows configuration (Akita et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]2012) was used that focuses mainly on local information (this configuration provides an HFRS variability representation that is closer to the real-world infectious disease spread pattern and less variable than the global pattern). The original dataset was optimally divided into four classes based on percentiles, which while maintained all advantages of BME modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies and correlations, it made HFRS predictions more accurate and robust.
