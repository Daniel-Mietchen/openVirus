<p>We concluded that the living conditions of rodents can dominate HFRS epidemics, as they influence the rodents-human interaction rate. As regards the space-time mapping of HFRS incidences in Heilongjiang Province during 2005–2013, the western part exhibits lower HFRS incidences than the eastern part. This is mainly due to environmental factors, as water resources expedite growth of plants, which serve as food and facilitate reproduction of rodents [

More precisely, in Heilongjiang Province, only Neng River is located in the western part of Heilongjiang Province (i.e. lower HFRS incidences), whereas Wusuli River, Songhua River and Mudan River locate in the eastern part of the province (i.e. higher HFRS incidences) [

Moreover, the eastern and southeastern parts of Heilongjiang Province exhibit mixed land types with forests, favoring rodents’ reproduction. As a result, the eastern part of Heilongjiang Province demonstrates a consistently high level of HFRS infections throughout the year, whereas, the HFRS incidences in the western part of the province are dominated by monthly outbreaks. This is due to the fact that large proportions of the western part of the province are croplands, which remain flooded for crop growth purposes during the entire farming period, preventing rodents’ reproduction. A general overview of HFRS spread patterns in Heilongjiang Province can be obtained from
