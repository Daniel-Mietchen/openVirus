<p>In what follows, the categorical HFRS incidence representation will be considered in terms of the four selected incidence interval classes, 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>m</italic> = 1, 2, 3, 4. In the context of the categorical HFRS representation used in this work, two kinds of HFRS spread patterns were assumed for comparison purposes: outward HFRS spread that links a specific incidence class to the entire set of incidence classes, and inward HFRS spread that is concerned with incidence transition from the entire set of classes to a specific class.
