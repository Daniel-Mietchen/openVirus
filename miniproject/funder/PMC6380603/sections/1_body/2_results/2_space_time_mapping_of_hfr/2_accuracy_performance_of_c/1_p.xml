Moreover, in order to test the robustness of the cd-BME, the original data set was also divided into 3 classes (with percentile ranges 0–72%, 72–86% and 86–100%), in which case the 10 fold-cross validation results showed that the cd-BME with 3 classes also outperforms the standard BME and IDW, although it is inferior to the cd-BME with 4 classes selected in this work (see, optimal selection of number of classes discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s003">S3 Text</xref>). By looking into each individual HFRS interval class, the performance of both ways of BME implementation (cd and standard) decreases with increasing incidence level (i.e., from incidence class 1 to class 4) but, in all cases, the performance of the cd-BME implementation remains superior (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s031">S4 Table</xref>). In terms of the MAE indicator, the accuracy improvement when using the cd-BME implementation instead of the standard BME implementation is 65.16%, 82.13%, 72.32% and 42.18% for the four incidence classes considered, respectively.
