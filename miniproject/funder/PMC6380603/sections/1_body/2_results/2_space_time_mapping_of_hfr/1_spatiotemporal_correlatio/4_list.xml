  <p>For all HFRS incidence classes considered, the non-zero slopes of the spatial covariance components at the origin indicate that the log-transformed HFRS incidence fields exhibit intense localized variations across space. Regarding the temporal HFRS covariance components, except for the incidence class 1, the slopes of these covariances at the origin are zero, implying (based on the underlying spatiotemporal random field theory) that the temporal incidence variation is apparently much smoother than the spatial incidence variation.</p>

  <p>Visual inspection of the temporal and spatial covariance plots of the HFRS incidence in the Heilongjiang province, obtained for different incidence classes, reveals that the spatiotemporal structure of incidence distributions embodied in the shape of the space-time covariance functions depends on the HFRS incidence level, with dependencies in time being stronger than those in space.</p>

  <p>The spatial and temporal covariance lags beyond which HFRS incidence dependencies are negligible (usually referred to as spatial and temporal correlation ranges, respectively) vary among the different incidence classes selected.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Beyond the corresponding spatial and temporal ranges, the spatial and temporal components of the covariance functions of the four HFRS incidence classes are approximately zero-valued, indicating that the log-transformed incidence is spatially homogeneous in space and stationary in time. Also, the selected theoretical models (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s029">S2 Table</xref> of the SI section) provide good fits to the empirical covariance values, thus validating the adequate theoretical representation of the actual HFRS variation in Heilongjiang province.
