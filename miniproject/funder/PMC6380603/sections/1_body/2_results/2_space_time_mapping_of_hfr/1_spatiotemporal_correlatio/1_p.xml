<p>Monthly spatial correlations of the original HFRS incidence

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). The covariance sill values explain the variance of HFRS incidence in the Heilongjiang Province during the same month, exhibiting certain noticeable peaks at twelve months period, the size of which reduce with time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). The interpretation of these high peaks is that they imply the presence of high uncertainty (or the presence of outbreaks at specific locations) in the HFRS variation during the peak times. The correlation ranges determine the HFRS domain of influence, showing a rough variation with time, which, like the HFRS mean variation, it also exhibits a periodic character (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g003">Fig 3c</xref>). The minimum and maximum values of the correlation range during the period 2005â€“2013 are 21,700 meters and 897,650 meters, respectively. The functional shapes of the HFRS mean, covariance sill and range are remarkably similar (e.g., in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g004">Fig 4</xref> large (small) HSRF mean values are directly linked to long (short) correlation ranges). Interpretationally, the two distinct peaks of the HSRF mean plot during June and November, which coincide with the corresponding peaks of the mean sill plot, detect the HFRS outbreaks that occurred during these months.
