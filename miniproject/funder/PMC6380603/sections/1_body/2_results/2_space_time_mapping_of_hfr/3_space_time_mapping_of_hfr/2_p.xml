<p>Alternatively, an informative visualization of HFRS spread over the Heilongjiang province during 2008 is provided by the categorical space-time maps in terms of the four different incidence interval classes defined earlier, and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g006">Fig 6</xref>. Specifically, the maps of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g006">Fig 6</xref> present to scale the monthly distribution of “patches” with incidence classes 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>4</sub> amidst class 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. An apparent feature of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007091.g006">Fig 6</xref> is that some parts of the Heilongjiang region are dominated by small patches of HFRS incidence, whereas in some other parts the HFRS patches seem to be large. These incidence patches are mutually exclusive, bounded and they have varying sizes. Certain HFRS patches seem to be distinctly elongated toward some preferred direction, indicating the presence of anisotropy. Sometimes the HFRS patches are clearly separated from one another, some other times they share common boundaries, and yet some other times they are completely surrounded by another class (e.g., in various monthly maps the classes 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>4</sub> occur as patches within the class 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>). The proportions of regional cover by each incidence class shows the dominance of class 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> within which all the other classes are embedded, so that class 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> acts like a background class.
