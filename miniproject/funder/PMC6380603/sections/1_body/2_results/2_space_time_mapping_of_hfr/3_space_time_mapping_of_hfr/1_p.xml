<p>The 108 spatiotemporal HFRS distribution maps with resolution 5

 <italic>month</italic> were obtained for each interval class (i.e., 108 × 4 = 432 maps were generated, in total), and subsequently superimposed to produce the final HFRS distribution maps (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007091.s015">S5 Fig</xref> shows the selected HFRS incidence map for the year 2008. One observes the following: (
 <italic>a</italic>) The HFRS incidences in Heilongjiang province exhibited two noticeable peaks during the months of June and November. (
 <italic>b</italic>) The first peak triggers the rapid spread of HFRS cases during the August-November period toward the western part of Heilongjiang province and also toward some counties in the eastern part of the province. (
 <italic>c</italic>) After November, the HFRS incidences decrease at some counties, and the number of counties suffering high levels of HFRS infections also decreases. (
 <italic>d</italic>) The western part of the Heilongjiang province exhibits a lower number of HFRS incidences than the eastern part.
