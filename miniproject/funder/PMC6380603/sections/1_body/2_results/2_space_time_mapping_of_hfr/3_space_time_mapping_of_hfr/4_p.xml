<p>It would be interesting to calculate the varying frequencies and dynamics of adjacent and non-adjacent HFRS classes in the Heilongjiang province during 2005â€“2013, as well as the probabilities of incidence transition from one class to another. This is the concern of the stochastic (probabilistic) HFRS indicators to be discussed next.</p>
