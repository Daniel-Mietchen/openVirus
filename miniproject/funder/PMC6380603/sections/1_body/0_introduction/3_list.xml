  <p>Identification of regions with severe HFRS outbreaks. Zhang et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], e.g., used spatial autocorrelation, local indicators of spatial association, and Kulldorff’s space-time scan statistic, to identify distinct cluster areas of outbreak episodes in northeastern, central and eastern China. Similarly, Wu et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] applied cluster analysis, temporal cluster analysis, and space-time cluster analysis, to identify various epidemic clusters in Liaoning Province of China (including a primary cluster in the western part of the province and two secondary clusters in its eastern part).

  <p>Quantitative analysis of the impact of physiographic characteristics and environmental variables on HFRS population-standardized incidences. Yan et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], e.g., employed a multivariate logistic regression model to study the relationship between HFRS incidence and various landscape and environmental elements. The study concluded that elevation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, annual cumulative air temperature, semihydromorhic soils, timber forests and orchards, were closely related to HFRS incidence. In a more recent study, Li et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] applied a geographically weighted regression model to Chinese data during the period 2005–2009, and concluded that temperature, precipitation, humidity, NDVI, land use and elevation significantly impacted the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of HFRS incidences. Also, Tian et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and He et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used wavelet analysis to study how the dynamics of HFRS are linked to rainfall, temperature, rodents’ density and the multivariate El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index.

  <p>HFRS incidence forecasting. Liu et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Li et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] successfully applied autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA models to produce forecasts of HFRS in China and Heilongjiang Province, respectively. Moreover, seasonal ARIMA models with exogenous variables (SARIMAX) were also developed for forecasting HFRS in four counties with severe HFRS outbreaks [

  <p>Clinical manifestation case studies. For example, Zhang et al. [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] compared various clinical indices involving 152 patients in Heilongjiang Province, and showed that SEOV infections are milder and less typical than those caused by HTNV.
