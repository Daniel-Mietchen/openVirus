  <p>To overcome data-related methodological and practical difficulties (such as highly heterogeneous data distributions across space-time) by using a cd-BME method that divides the infectious disease dataset into discrete classes (the incidence classes were selected based on variability reduction and mapping coverage criteria).</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>To generate HFRS distribution maps that account for the real fact that the intraclass and interclass incidence data is subject to uncertainty, and to show that the cd-BME method can produce more accurate incidence estimates at locations and times where no HFRS records are available than standard (class-independent) mapping techniques.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>To introduce practical and easily interpretable indicators of spatiotemporal dependency based on probability logic [
   <xref rid="pntd.0007091.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These indicators exhibit different yet complementary kinds of HFRS dependence (e.g., each indicator captures a different feature of HFRS transition from one class to another so that the combined study of the indicators can result to an improved assessment of HFRS distribution).
