<p>While, as described above, a significant level of understanding has been reached regarding the specific characteristics of HFRS and its linkage to physiographic variables, its dynamics and associated spatiotemporal spread patterns remain mostly unexplored. The present work aims at bridging this gap, by using the spatiotemporal Bayesian Maximum Entropy theory (BME) to develop a fully probabilistic approach that allows a rigorous quantitative representation of HFRS population-standardized incidences in the space-time domain (BME belongs to the field of modern spatiotemporal geostatistics, [
