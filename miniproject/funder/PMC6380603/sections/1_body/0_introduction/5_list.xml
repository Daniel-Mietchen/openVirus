  <p>Spatiotemporal evolution: The proposed approach not only accounts for the fact that, as is the case with all infectious diseases, the spatiotemporal HFRS evolution can be influenced by several environmental factors, but also for the fact that, as a natural phenomenon, the HFRS spread follows a propagation law with the number of human infections being closely related to human-rodents interactions. In this twofold phenomenological context, when a core area is formed during the disease outbreak, and as time advances, the disease spreads radially from the core center in all directions. The accurate characterization of the spatiotemporal HFRS spread pattern is of essence, and the thus acquired knowledge can be integrated with other information sources (about the disease and its environment) to improve public health management through prevention and control.</p>

  <p>Incidence heterogeneity: A crucial observation to be accounted by the proposed approach is that the HFRS infection level varies in a heterogeneous manner across space-time, which means that the adequate distinction between incidence classes can play a significant role in the accurate mapping and risk assessment of regional disease spread during the time period of interest. Furthermore, since infectious disease outbreaks can occur in very short time periods and infect a large number of individuals, and given the highly variable character of disease attributes, it is difficult (both theoretically and practically) and often unrealistic to model simultaneously both the extreme values and the regular values of population-standardized incidences. In other words, a model that considers the distribution of all incidence levels as a single (super) class can neither adequately represent nor fully explain the spread pattern of a specific incidence class, because of smoothing effects and the existence of extreme (high/low) incidence levels in the same setting.</p>

  <p>Class transmission and propagation: The probabilistic assessment of the HFRS transmission and propagation patterns among various incidence classes is currently lacking (e.g., the probability of HFRS transmitting from one incidence class to another class at various spatial distances and time separations apart). Yet such an assessment could provide valuable scientific support for HFRS monitoring and control purposes. Accordingly, the adequate representation of the spatiotemporal distributions and operations (transmissions, propagations) between of distinct incidence classes is an important task of any quantitative HFRS study.</p>
