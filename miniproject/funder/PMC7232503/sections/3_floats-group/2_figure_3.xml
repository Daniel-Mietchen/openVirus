 <caption>
  <p>Maximum clade credibility tree from Bayesian reconstruction of 59 rabies virus full nucleoprotein sequences (1353nt), using an HKY +G+I model of evolution with a strict molecular clock and constant population prior, for 30 million iterations in BEAST (v1.8.1). The maximum clade credibility tree was chosen using TreeAnnotator (v1.8.0) and visualised using FigTree (v1.4.0). African civet sequences are highlighted in red, posterior support is given at key nodes, and branches are coloured by the host with the highest probability at the ancestral node.</p>
