<p>In Zimbabwe, African civet rabies cases were generally diagnosed during jackal rabies outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting a spill-over of infection. Furthermore, wildlife rabies contributes approximately 25% of all laboratory-confirmed rabies cases in Zimbabwe [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Of the wildlife rabies submitted for rabies testing between 2010 and 2017, jackals comprised 35.5% of positive cases, followed by 3.2% each for the African civet, lion, kudu and zebra (personal communication, Lambert Gwenhure, Central Veterinary Laboratory, Harare, Zimbabwe). The African civet is a common terrestrial viverrid species found in most of sub-Saharan Africa [

Its geographical distribution is confined to the African continent (south of the Sahara), but is also found throughout all other West-African countries, from Senegal right through to Ethiopia in the east. In the southern parts of the continent, civets are found in the extreme southern parts of Somalia, in Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Angola, Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique, extending to Botswana on the eastern border with Zimbabwe and the Limpopo province (in South Africa), Namibia and the whole of Zimbabwe (
