<p>The African civet is characterised by a wide head with a pointed muzzle, small eyes and small, rounded ears. It is a nocturnal, terrestrial and opportunistic mammal, and is the largest African member of the family 
 <italic>Viverridae</italic>, which includes genets (small-spotted genet 
 <italic>Genetta genetta</italic>) and large-spotted genets 
 <italic>Genetta tigrina</italic> [

As a way of intimidating an intruder, the African civet increases its size, exposing its back, and through this process limits physical contact with other carnivores. This wildlife carnivore is omnivorous and nocturnal, and is recognized for scavenging on cave floors for food, which could feasibly justify the concept that interactions with cave-dwelling bats could also occur with the added risk of viral cross-species transmission events [
