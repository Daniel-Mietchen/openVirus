<p>This study has shown that African civets are infected by both canid and mongoose RABV biotypes and occasionally by other lyssaviruses, such as IKOV. There is, however, no evidence of rabies causing population declines in African civets. The data may suggest that maintenance of RABV within African civets occurs and that the African civet should be considered a possible host reservoir in southern Africa. These data reinforce the notion that it is important that the typing of viruses from wildlife species is part of a routine surveillance where such facilities exist, or through collaboration with rabies reference laboratories to undertake genetic typing. The identification of canid and mongoose rabies viruses do indeed demonstrate the extent that the African civet interacts with other domestic and wildlife host species in southern Africa.</p>
