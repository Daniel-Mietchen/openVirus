<p>Full coding N-gene sequences (1353nt) were analysed with previously published N-gene sequences representing the RABV diversity across Africa. Partial G-gene sequences (600nt) were also generated for the African civet viruses. The phylogenetic trees generated from the G-gene sequences were topologically similar to the N-gene phylogenies; therefore, only the N-gene dataset (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00368-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was used in subsequent analyses due to the larger dataset of related African RABV N-gene sequences publicly available (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00368">Table S2</xref>). Four distinct lineages were delineated; Africa 1, Africa 2 and Africa 4 (all canid RABV biotype), and Africa 3 (mongoose RABV biotype) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00368-f002">Figure 2</xref>). All the civet viruses were exclusively placed in Africa 1 and 3 lineages.
