<p>Surveillance data from southern Africa have demonstrated that wildlife rabies is a significant veterinary and public health problem, specifically with RABVs readily crossing the species barriers partly due to the overlapping host ranges (sympatry) of a susceptible species with that of a species already maintaining a cycle of RABV [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The known home range of the African civet interfaces with that of the slender mongoose in Zimbabwe and, hence, encourages the likely exchange of viruses between these host species. Whereas common and similar cellular and immunological traits are key to initial infection of a new host, recipient host population ecology is equally pivotal. From the available data from observations and studies undertaken in other parts of Africa, the African civet appears to be susceptible to infection with a variety of lyssaviruses, namely the canid and mongoose in southern Africa and, more recently, with IKOV in Tanzania [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The infrequent detection of lyssaviruses such as IKOV may point to the fact that African civets are indeed incidental hosts of this lyssavirus, but, alternatively, this may be due to low surveillance activities. The incubation periods of RABV infection in African civets in captivity are variable [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For instance, in Zimbabwe, an African civet was linked to an unusually long incubation period of at least 186 days compared to 11 days in a similar species in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], but this could be due to strain differences. Animals with prolonged incubation periods of rabies infection are believed to act as effective reservoirs of disease, bridging infection over periods where the propagation in endemic hosts is not logically favourable, for instance, but can contribute to the maintenance of the disease between rabies epidemics in jackals, harbouring the infection whilst the jackal population density recovered.
