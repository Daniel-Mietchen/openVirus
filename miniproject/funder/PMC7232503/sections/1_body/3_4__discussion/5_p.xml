<p>In Zimbabwe, the African civet is not considered a major host for RABV (it only accounts for about 1.5% of all confirmed wildlife cases), and the epidemiology suggests that most of these cases are detected during epidemics of jackal rabies. Initial monoclonal antibody typing studies of African civet viruses [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] showed that they were indistinguishable from jackal viruses (Africa 1, canid rabies biotype), but more recent data supported the notion that African civet populations may be capable of supporting the maintenance of enzootic mongoose rabies [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although Haydon 2012 discussed and highlighted the challenges of identifying reservoirs of RABV infection, Lembo et al. (2008) [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] demonstrated that persistence of infection in a population is a prerequisite for identifying reservoirs. Considering the trends analyses (2000â€“2015) in South Africa, rabies in the African civet occurred sporadically and represented a mere 0.3% of the total confirmed positive rabies cases. These data are heavily skewed due to sampling bias. African civets are, incidentally, not found close to human habitats; therefore, lyssavirus-positive African civet cases are likely to be underrepresented. However, African civets seem to be highly susceptible to a more divergent plethora of lyssaviruses, which include dog-mediated and dog-related RABV and IKOV. Whether the African civet is only involved in a multispecies cycling of the infection, similar to that shown in striped skunks (
 <italic>Mephitis mephitis</italic>) and in fox and raccoon rabies in North America, or can maintain its own enzootic cycle of RABV, is uncertain when analysing epidemiological data alone. Indeed, the data presented here suggest that African civets may be an important wildlife species in the maintenance of lyssaviruses, particularly the African RABV biotypes. Indeed, RABV survives favourably in the wild because it can infect a large spectrum of animals, thereby maximising its replication and dispersal opportunities [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The findings from this study highlight the importance of sequencing confirmed rabies-positive cases, particularly for wildlife species such as African civets, but also known host reservoirs species, such as the RABV biotype, as the lyssavirus species does not always behave as expected. Further analysis of African civet rabies-positive cases and other poorly understood wildlife species and improved surveillance of rabies cases from the same regions will help unravel the complexities of lyssavirus epidemiology.
