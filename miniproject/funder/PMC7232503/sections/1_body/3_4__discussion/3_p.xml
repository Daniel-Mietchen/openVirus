<p>Sequences of putative dog-related variants independently established in black-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes, as well as dog-maintained lineages circulating in southern Africa with conserved specific amino acid signatures otherwise also found in rabid civets, may demonstrate a marker for the establishment of formerly dog-maintained RABVs in the African civet population [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This civet maintenance host was not previously considered, likely due to the opportunistic and solitary nature of African civets [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, sampling bias has a significant effect on these and other evolutionary analyses, as we cannot rule out the possibility of RABV maintenance in other host species that are not included in these data. For example, the relative lack of dog or jackal sequences collected from similar locations and dates to the civet samples prevents definitive conclusions to be drawn.
