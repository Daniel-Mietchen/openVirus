<p>Cross-species transmission (CST) events occur when a pathogen (normally a virus) in a specific reservoir animal is transmitted to another host. Such CST events rarely result in successful propagation within a new host, as exemplified by lyssaviruses [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In these previous studies, it was shown that raccoons were four times more likely to transmit the rabies virus to other species than skunks. In Southern Africa, the spill-over of the mongoose rabies biotype to canid hosts (such as the domestic dog), apparently do not establish secondary dog-to-dog transmissions and result in dead-end infections [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Data from our current study demonstrated and revealed CST events between dog rabies virus maintenance hosts (namely dogs and jackal species) and the African civet on the one hand, and the African civet and other 
 <italic>Herpestidae</italic> species (slender mongoose), particularly in those geographical areas where host ranges of these species interface, on the other hand. Host and environmental factors that facilitate CST are, to a large degree, unknown [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00368" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Transmission of RABVs is heavily influenced by host ecology and opportunities for contact between susceptible species.
