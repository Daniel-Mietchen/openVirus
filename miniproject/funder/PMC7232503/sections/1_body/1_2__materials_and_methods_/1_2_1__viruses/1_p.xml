<p>Viruses archived at both the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI, Pretoria, South Africa) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA, Surrey, UK) were retrieved and included in this study. The epidemiological information of the viruses included in the investigation [South Africa (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) and Zimbabwe (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12)] is presented in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00368-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Viruses recovered from host species before the year 2000 were passaged once in mice, freeze-dried and then stored at −20 °C, whereas for all specimens received post-2000, the original lyssavirus-infected brain tissues were stored frozen (at −80 °C).
