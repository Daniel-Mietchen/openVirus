An in-house indirect ELISA was developed using a HA tri-stalk protein as a coating antigen for evaluation of HA stem-specific Ab levels in human sera collected in Luxembourg from 211 persons with occupational exposure to swine before the pandemic H1N1/09 virus had spread to Western Europe. Our results show that 70% of these pre-pandemic sera are positive for HA stem-specific Abs.

Apart from the seasonal epidemics which are caused by antigenic drift of influenza viruses, the introduction of novel virus variants from the zoonotic pool via antigenic shift can result in viruses capable of initiating human pandemics [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the past hundred years, four influenza pandemics have spread in the human population [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the deadliest of them being the 1918 influenza pandemic when the mortality reached up to 50 million cases [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Some avian influenza strains, such as H5N1, H7N9 and H6N1, represent a risk that if they become transmissible among humans new pandemic influenza strains will emerge inducing even more devastating effects to the public health [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Rapid diagnostics can speed up the treatment decreasing the spreading of the influenza virus and is one of the key components of pandemic preparedness.</p><p>Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) is the major surface antigen of the virion and the primary target of virus neutralizing antibodies (Abs) [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HA is a homotrimeric surface glycoprotein, with each monomer consisting of two disulfide-linked subunits (HA1, HA2), resulting from the proteolytic cleavage products of a single HA precursor protein. The HA1 chain forms a membrane-distal globular head and a part of the membrane-proximal stem region. The HA2 chain represents the major component of the stem region [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The head of HA mediates receptor binding while the membrane-anchored stem is the main part of membrane fusion machinery [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Neutralizing Ab responses are mainly targeted to the immunodominant head domain of HA [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, because of the high genetic plasticity of the head region epitopes [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Ab responses are strain-specific and lack broad cross-reactivity with different HA subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, sequence and structure of the subdominant HA stem are much more conserved across different influenza subtypes and broadly neutralizing Abs against this domain are considered promising therapeutic tools against various influenza virus strains [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, there are some Abs known that cross-react with HA stem from all influenza A subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or even with HA stem from both influenza A and B viruses [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>One of the most conservative HA stem regions is a 55 amino acid (aa) long alpha helix (LAH) which is currently under intensive investigation as a potential universal influenza virus antigen [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that the LAH, as well as its N-terminally extended variant (72 aa), incorporated into hepatitis B virus core (HBc) particles is highly immunogenic in mice [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Expression of the extended LAH antigen in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> resulted in efficient synthesis of a soluble product. We purified and crystallized the protein and determined its three-dimensional structure, revealing formation of an &#x003b1;-helical trimer (referred to as tri-stalk protein) highly similar to the corresponding region of native HA in its post-fusion form.</p><p>We have developed an in-house indirect ELISA using the HA tri-stalk protein as immobilized antigen to evaluate HA stem-specific Ab levels in mice and human sera. In addition, tri-stalk protein was successfully used in an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to estimate numbers of HA stem-reactive Ab-secreting cells in mice. To extend the previous study [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and examine the level of pre-existing Abs in this population, our in-house ELISA was used to test human sera pool collected from people with direct occupational contacts to swine before the pandemic H1N1/09 virus had spread to Western Europe. Our results show that 70% of these pre-pandemic sera are positive for group 1 HA stem-specific Abs. In addition, the levels of HA stem-specific Abs have positive correlation with the corresponding IgG titers and neutralizing activities against pandemic H1N1/09 virus. Taken together, we have demonstrated that the novel HA tri-stalk protein is a useful tool for evaluation of HA stem-specific immunity in both mice and humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>HA tri-stalk protein</title><p>The tri-stalk protein encoding HA amino acids 403&#x02013;474 of the pandemic strain A/Luxembourg/43/2009(H1N1) was PCR-amplified and cloned in the pETDuet-1 vector (<italic>Novagen</italic>) using <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Bsp</italic>TI restriction sites.

Structural data revealed that tri-stalk protein folding closely matches the native HA post-fusion conformation. This is in line with a previous study where HA2 polypeptide 38&#x02013;175 was also <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressed in post-fusion form [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our tri-stalk protein is significantly shorter and corresponds to HA2 amino acids 59&#x02013;130. In contrast to polypeptide 38&#x02013;175 being able to resist incubation at 68&#x000b0;C some portion of tri-stalk protein was found unassembled already after heating at 55&#x000b0;C indicating that the lack of internal cysteines negatively affects its thermostability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Nevertheless, the outcome of assembled tri-stalk protein using our purification method is estimated at about 5 mg/g of wet cells which makes it attractive for downstream immunogenicity and antigenicity studies and co-crystallization for structural and immunological analysis.</p><p>Since the discovery of broadly neutralizing Abs against HA stem [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] a number of attempts have been performed to construct universal stem-based influenza vaccines. One direction of investigations is targeted to design the trimeric mini-stem constructs being able to bind conformational Abs and protect mice from lethal influenza virus challenge [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The constructs described are notably longer than tri-stalk protein and contain either intermolecular disulfide bridge, or trimerization (foldon) motif to stabilize the structure. At this stage, our aim was not to outperform these proteins in terms of protection, but to produce an alternative variant in a cost-effective way to be applied in several immune assays for evaluating the future universal vaccine-induced response. While tri-stalk protein is only 72 aa long, it is promising candidate for exposition on the surface of VLPs which is a highly powerful platform for vaccine construction. Incorporation of the LAH within the major immunodominant loop of the hepatitis B core protein allows formation of chimeric VLPs [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], however, anchoring of both LAH ends prevents folding of native trimeric conformation. Nevertheless, this strategy led to strong seroconversion to both HA group antigens in mice [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] while immunization with tri-stalk protein alone generated Abs only against homologous group HA antigen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204776.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Ideally, both approaches should be combined to obtain possible synergistic effect. Genetic fusion of LAH-encoding sequence with N- or C-termini of a carrier protein gene would theoretically allow such assembly. Among large variety of carriers coat proteins of small RNA phages organized in simple <italic>T</italic> = 3 symmetry particles offer an attractive scaffold for exposition of trimeric proteins in their native form, since N- and C- terminal ends of the phage coat protein are arranged closely around quasi-threefold axis of <italic>T</italic> = 3 particle. Although we failed to expose LAH peptide on the surface of PP7 VLPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204776.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), it could be speculated that this chimeric protein at least partially assembles in trimeric structures capable to elicit potent immune responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204776.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This assembly is, however, hard to prove due to irregularity of LAH-VLP aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204776.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Although HA stem is closely packed to the viral membrane and therefore partly covered by the head domain, the majority of conserved region is accessible to anti-stem Abs [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, immune responses post-infection and post-vaccination are mainly targeted to the immunodominant HA head region [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, it is well established that anti-stem Abs are normally not found in individuals vaccinated with seasonal inactivated influenza virus vaccines whereas low levels of these Abs are induced by natural virus infection in humans as well as in mice [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, infection of individuals with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus induced high levels of stem-reactive Ab responses [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Cross-reactive immunity derived from anti-stem-specific Abs also tends to increase upon exposure to antigenically diverse influenza viruses [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Swine play a particular role in cross-species transmission of diverse influenza viruses because they are susceptible to both avian and human influenza viruses and can act as &#x0201c;mixing vessel&#x0201d; for reassortment of viral gene segments [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Previous study showed that, before the outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 2009, persons with professional contact with swine obtained higher serological cross-reactivity with various influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, European avian-like subtype H1N1 SIV, and 2007&#x02013;2008 seasonal influenza subtype H1N1 virus [<xref rid="pone.0204776.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that these SW harbor pre-existing cross-immunity against various influenza strains, possibly mediated by Ab targeting to conserved viral epitopes, like the HA stem. Indeed, using tri-stalk protein based ELISA to determine the binding of the cross-reactive Abs in these pre-pandemic sera, the results show that Abs targeting the tri-stalk epitope significantly correlate with the Abs specific to the novel antigen, HA H1/09. In addition, tri-stalk specific Abs also have a positive correlation with the neutralizing activities against the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, our results demonstrate that the novel HA tri-stalk protein, which comprises of the HA LAH region, can be applied in various immunological assays to determine HA stem-specific humoral responses in both clinical and animal samples.
