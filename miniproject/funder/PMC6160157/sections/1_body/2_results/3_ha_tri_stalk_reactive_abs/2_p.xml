<p>These ELISA conditions were then used to determine the HA tri-stalk specific total IgG titer in sera (3-fold dilutions from 1:300, to 1:218700) from mice vaccinated with LAH-PP7 or sublethally infected (s.i.) by pH1N1, sH1N1, PR8, sH3N2, X-31, or B/Lee/40 virus (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). Nevertheless, mice s.i. by group 1 viruses pH1N1 or PR8 showed significantly higher levels of HA tri-stalk specific IgG than the animals s.i. by the other viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Mice s.i. by strains with group 2 (sH3N2 and X-31) or B/Lee/40 virus exhibited no seroreactivity with HA tri-stalk protein (
