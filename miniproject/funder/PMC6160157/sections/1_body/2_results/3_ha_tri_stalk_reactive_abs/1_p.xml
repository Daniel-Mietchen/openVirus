<p>In order to set up the optimal condition using HA tri-stalk protein as a coating antigen in indirect ELISA for the detection of seroreactivity to HA stem, the checkerboard titration method was conducted using sera from mice immunized with LAH-PP7 fusion protein (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and methods</xref>) as positive samples and naïve mouse sera as negative controls. Optimal signal to noise (S/N) ratio was found with 1.25 μg/mL coated HA tri-stalk protein and serum dilution of 1:2700 (S/N ratio = 36,

The LAH-PP7 construct was originally designed to expose LAH peptide on the surface of bacteriophage PP7 shells in a form of natural trimer. Although we failed to detect the formation of VLPs, expression of this chimeric construct resulted in formation of soluble protein aggregates (
