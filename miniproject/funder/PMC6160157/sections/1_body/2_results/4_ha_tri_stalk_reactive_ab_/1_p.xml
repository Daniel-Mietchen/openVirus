<p>To evaluate HA tri-stalk specific Ab-secreting B cells induced by vaccination, BALB/c mice were immunized 3 times i.p. with LAH-PP7 fusion protein that induced high levels of humoral immunity against LAH domain of HA stem as described above. Two weeks after the last immunization, the splenocytes were stimulated

Visually distinct populations of IgG1- and IgG2a- secreting B cells were detected after HA tri-stalk protein stimulation in the vaccinated but not in the mock mice. Although in LAH-PP7 vaccinated mice the IgG1-secreting cells formed larger immunospots than the IgG2a-secreting cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), there was no significant difference in absolute numbers between both isotype subclasses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The vaccinated mice showed significantly (up to 10 times) higher numbers of both IgG1- and IgG2a-secreting cells after HA tri-stalk immunization than the mock mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This further supports the value of HA tri-stalk protein for monitoring vaccine-induced memory B cell responses against the stem domain.
