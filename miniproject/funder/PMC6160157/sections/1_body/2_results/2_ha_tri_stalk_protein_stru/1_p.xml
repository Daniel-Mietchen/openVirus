<p>The crystal structure of HA tri-stalk protein was solved to 1.7 Ã… resolution using molecular replacement technique. The space group was P6
 <sub>3</sub> and the HA tri-stalk protein was found to be located on the crystallographic 3-fold axis. Therefore, the crystallographic asymmetric unit contained one protein molecule. The final model included a single protein chain with 65 residues and 57 water molecules. The first 3 N-terminal and 3 C-terminal residues were not included in the final model due to poor electron density.
