<p>The structure revealed that HA tri-stalk is an elongated trimer with the length of approximately 63 Å (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Each monomer consists of a long α-helix at the N-terminus, shorter antiparallel α-helix at the C-terminus, and a small flexible loop region on the surface of the protein connecting both helices. The end of the N-terminus extends away from the rest of the protein. The central long α-helices form a tripartite coiled coil with the short α-helices packing along them and forming a 6-helix bundle-like structure. The protein clearly matched the structure of the corresponding stem fragment of the native HA at its low pH-induced post-fusion conformation [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, it displayed some minor deviations from the wild-type HA in the loop region and at the termini of the helices with Cα atom root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of about 0.94 Å (60 residues of one monomer were aligned) (
