<p>The newly developed indirect ELISA using the purified HA tri-stalk protein as a coating antigen was further applied to examine human seroreactivity to HA stem (as described in the Materials and methods). The mean OD of the negative sera was found 0.2115, +/- 0.1251 (SD), and the cut-off point of 0.5868 was calculated as the mean of the negative control sera plus three SD. Sera with an OD &gt;0.5868 were classified as seropositive. A total of 147 of 211 (70%) pre-pandemic SW sera were considered positive for HA stem-specific Abs, whereas only 30 of 71 (42%) pre-pandemic sera from non-SW showed positive for HA stem-specific Abs (
