<p>Furthermore, we tested the SW for neutralizing Abs against influenza A/Luxembourg/43/2009 (H1N1/09) virus. Significant correlations were observed between H1N1/09 neutralizing titers with HA H1/09 IgG titer (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, Spearman r = 0.1601, p = 0.0209). Whereas, IgG levels to HA of a pre-existing seasonal H1N1 virus, A/Texas/36/1991, showed no correlation with H1N1/09 neutralizing titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, Spearman r = 0.1128, p = 0.1066). These observations in SW indicate that pre-pandemic Ab levels to HA tri-stalk protein also translated into neutralizing activities against H1N1/09 virus.
