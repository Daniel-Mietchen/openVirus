<p>Our long-term research goal is exposition of the LAH region on virus-like particles (VLPs) in its native trimeric conformation. To assess structural and immunological properties of different LAH derivatives a number of constructs containing the LAH region have been compared for expression and solubility in

 <italic>coli</italic>. These peptides had the same C-terminus but differed by their N-terminal extensions. The stem peptide encoding HA amino acids 403–474 was the longest fragment (Mw = 8.5 kDa) which was efficiently produced in a soluble form and was selected for downstream applications as HA tri-stalk protein. For purification, we developed a fast and efficient method involving a combination of three chromatography steps: a weak anion-exchange, a strong anion-exchange and size-exclusion columns (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lane 1). To simplify the purification procedure, the soluble protein mixture was subjected to thermal treatment at 55°C. As expected, a lot of contaminating proteins precipitated under these conditions while the majority of target protein remained in solution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lane 2). Next, the protein solution was loaded on a weak anion exchange DEAE column. While the majority of contaminants passed through the column the tri-stalk protein was efficiently bound and eluted with ~200 mM salt (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g001">Fig 1A and 1D</xref>, lanes 3–4). The solution was then loaded on a strong anion exchanger MonoQ which further improved the purity of the tri-stalk protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>, lanes 5–6). Finally, protein was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography where two major peaks were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Both peaks contained predominantly target protein, but only the first peak corresponded to the trimer size (Mw = 25.6 kDa) according to its elution volume, while the second peak seemed to contain non-assembled product and was discarded. The final product had at least 90% purity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204776.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, lanes 7–8) and was further used for structural and diagnostic studies.
