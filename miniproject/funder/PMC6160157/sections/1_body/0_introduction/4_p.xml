<p>We have developed an in-house indirect ELISA using the HA tri-stalk protein as immobilized antigen to evaluate HA stem-specific Ab levels in mice and human sera. In addition, tri-stalk protein was successfully used in an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay to estimate numbers of HA stem-reactive Ab-secreting cells in mice. To extend the previous study [

Our results show that 70% of these pre-pandemic sera are positive for group 1 HA stem-specific Abs. In addition, the levels of HA stem-specific Abs have positive correlation with the corresponding IgG titers and neutralizing activities against pandemic H1N1/09 virus. Taken together, we have demonstrated that the novel HA tri-stalk protein is a useful tool for evaluation of HA stem-specific immunity in both mice and humans.
