<p>One of the most conservative HA stem regions is a 55 amino acid (aa) long alpha helix (LAH) which is currently under intensive investigation as a potential universal influenza virus antigen [

 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that the LAH, as well as its N-terminally extended variant (72 aa), incorporated into hepatitis B virus core (HBc) particles is highly immunogenic in mice [

We purified and crystallized the protein and determined its three-dimensional structure, revealing formation of an α-helical trimer (referred to as tri-stalk protein) highly similar to the corresponding region of native HA in its post-fusion form.
