<p>Influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) is the major surface antigen of the virion and the primary target of virus neutralizing antibodies (Abs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HA is a homotrimeric surface glycoprotein, with each monomer consisting of two disulfide-linked subunits (HA1, HA2), resulting from the proteolytic cleavage products of a single HA precursor protein. The HA1 chain forms a membrane-distal globular head and a part of the membrane-proximal stem region. The HA2 chain represents the major component of the stem region [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The head of HA mediates receptor binding while the membrane-anchored stem is the main part of membrane fusion machinery [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Neutralizing Ab responses are mainly targeted to the immunodominant head domain of HA [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, because of the high genetic plasticity of the head region epitopes [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Ab responses are strain-specific and lack broad cross-reactivity with different HA subtypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In contrast, sequence and structure of the subdominant HA stem are much more conserved across different influenza subtypes and broadly neutralizing Abs against this domain are considered promising therapeutic tools against various influenza virus strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, there are some Abs known that cross-react with HA stem from all influenza A subtypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or even with HA stem from both influenza A and B viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
