<p>Heat inactivated (30 min at 56°C) and receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, purchased from DENKA SEIKEN UK Ltd, Coventry, UK) treated sera were tested by microneutralization assay against influenza A/Luxembourg/43/2009 (H1N1/09) virus according to the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol (Serological Diagnosis of Influenza by Microneutralization Assay. WHO 2010). Equal volumes of serum and virus diluted to 2×10
 <sup>3</sup> median tissue culture infective doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) per milliliter were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The mixture was added to a confluent layer of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in 96-well tissue culture plates (1.5×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and incubated for 20 h. After fixation with ice-cold 80% acetone in PBS for 15 min, anti-influenza A NP mouse monoclonal Ab (1:1000 dilution) was added to the monolayers for 1 h. Virus‐infected cells were detected using an alkaline phosphatase conjugated with anti-mouse second step Ab. The optical density value of half-maximal effective dose (EC50) was then determined by the following equation: [(average OD
 <sub>405</sub> of virus control wells) − (average OD
 <sub>405</sub> of cell control wells)]/2. The reciprocal serum dilution corresponding to EC50 is the 50% neutralizing Ab titer for the serum sample.
