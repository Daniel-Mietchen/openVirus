<p>Prior to crystallization, purified HA tri-stalk protein was concentrated to 10 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, using Amicon 10 kDa MWCO filter (Millipore), and crystallized by mixing with equal volume of precipitant solution (1 Î¼L each) using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique. The HA tri-stalk crystals used for data collection were obtained at 2.0 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 5.5. For data collection, the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, after brief soaking in a cryoprotectant containing reservoir liquor and 30% glycerol. Datasets were collected at MAX-lab beamline I911-3 (Lund University, Sweden).</p>
