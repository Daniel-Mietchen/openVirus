<p>The diffraction images were integrated with MOSFLM [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and scaled using SCALA [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] from the CCP4i program suite [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The crystal structure of HA tri-stalk protein was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], using the corresponding fragment of structure of influenza HA at the pH of membrane fusion as the search model [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Initially the model was generated in BUCCANEER [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The structure was manually adjusted and validated using the COOT software program [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and refinement was carried out in REFMAC [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The HA tri-stalk 3D structure was visualized in PyMOL (The PyMol Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schr√∂dinger, LLC). SSM-superimposition was carried out in COOT. Statistics for data collection and structure refinement are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Coordinates and structure factors are deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 6GOL.
