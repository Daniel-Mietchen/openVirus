<p>The indirect ELISA conditions were optimized by checkerboard titration using serial dilutions of HA tri-stalk protein tested against serial dilutions of positive and negative sera. Briefly, the HA tri-stalk protein was coated overnight at 4°C to 384-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Austria) using concentrations of 0.156, 0.313, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 μg/mL. After washing, free binding sites were saturated at room temperature with 1% BSA in Tris buffer. After 2 h, plates were washed again and diluted mouse (starting with 100-fold dilutions) or human sera (starting with 300-fold dilutions) were added and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Binding was assessed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1/1000 dilution, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) and 4-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate (Phosphatase substrate, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm (SpectraMax Plus 384 Microplate reader), after 60 min of incubation at 37°C. Sera from naïve mice and low-titer sera from young children served as negative controls.</p>
