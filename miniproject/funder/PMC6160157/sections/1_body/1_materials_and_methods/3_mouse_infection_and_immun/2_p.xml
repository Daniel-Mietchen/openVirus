<p>For virus infection, 10-week-old BALB/c mice (n = 8 mice/group) were infected intranasally with a sublethal dose (8×10
 <sup>4</sup> half maximal tissue culture infectious dose; TCID50) of pandemic H1N1 influenza strain A/Luxembourg/46/2009 (pH1N1), A/Texas/36/91 seasonal H1N1 (sH1N1), A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8), A/Lux/01/2005 seasonal H3N2 (sH3N2), A/Aïshi/68 H3N2 (X-31), or B/Lee/40 virus in 50 μL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), after anesthesia with isoflurane.
