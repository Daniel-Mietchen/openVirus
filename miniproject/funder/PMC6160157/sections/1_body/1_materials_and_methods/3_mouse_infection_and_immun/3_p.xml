<p>For immunization of mice, LAH domain-encoding sequence from pH1N1/09 strain was genetically fused to the N-terminus of bacteriophage PP7 coat protein gene separated by a short GSG-encoding linker, designated as LAH-PP7. This fusion gene was cloned and expressed as described for HA tri-stalk construct. The cells were disrupted in lysis buffer A by sonication and centrifuged at 18,000 Ã— 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. Insoluble fraction was washed twice with lysis buffer and sonication repeated with the addition of 0.25 M urea in buffer A. After centrifugation, the soluble fraction containing LAH-PP7 fusion protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column in buffer A and target protein fractions were collected.
