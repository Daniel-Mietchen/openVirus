<p>The numbers of Ab-secreting cells under stimulation by HA tri-stalk protein were counted using commercial mouse IgG1 and IgG2a single-color ELISPOT assay kits (Cellular Technology Limited, Cleveland, OH) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Freshly isolated splenocytes from mock or LAH-PP7 immunized mice were pre-stimulated for 4 days at 37°C in a 7% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, the cells were then transferred to capture Ab-coated polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 96-well plates (5×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well). Following incubation for 20–24 h at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, the cell suspensions were removed. All wells were washed twice with PBS and twice with 0.05% Tween-PBS, anti-murine IgG1 or IgG2a detection solution was added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with 0.05% Tween-PBS, tertiary solution (Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate) was added at 80 μL per well for 1 h at room temperature. Following four more washes, 80 μL of blue developer solution (Substrate mix) was added for 15–20 min at room temperature in the dark to yield colored spots. Finally, the reaction was stopped by thoroughly rinsing with tap water. The plates were air-dried and stored in the dark until analysis. The number of spots was counted using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The average number of spot-forming cells was adjusted to 1×10
 <sup>6</sup> splenocytes.
