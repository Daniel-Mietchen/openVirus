<p>For purification of the antigen, the cells were disrupted in lysis buffer A containing 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mM NaCl (6 mL of buffer per 1 g of cells) by sonication. The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation (18,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, 30 min). The supernatant was subjected to thermal treatment for 30 min at 55°C and centrifuged again. The soluble fraction was applied to a weak anion exchange HiPrep 16/10 DEAE FF column in buffer A. Bound protein was linearly eluted (4 mL/min) with buffer B (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl) in 3 column volumes (CVs) until concentration of 0.6 M NaCl was reached. Selected fractions were pooled, diluted twice with 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, and applied onto a strong anion exchange column MonoQ 5/50 GL in buffer A (1 mL/min). Column-bound proteins were linearly eluted with buffer B in 10 CVs until concentration of 0.5 M NaCl was reached. Finally, protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl at 0.5 mL/min. All runs were performed at room temperature and monitored using the ÄKTA FPLC chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Purified HA tri-stalk protein was aliquoted and stored at -20°C until use.
