<p>The tri-stalk protein encoding HA amino acids 403–474 of the pandemic strain A/Luxembourg/43/2009(H1N1) was PCR-amplified and cloned in the pETDuet-1 vector (
 <italic>Novagen</italic>) using 
 <italic>Nco</italic>I and 
 <italic>Bsp</italic>TI restriction sites. The construct was expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells using a standard protocol (

Briefly, cells were cultivated in 2×TY medium in Erlenmeyer flasks under continuous shaking (200 rpm) at +37°C. When optical density OD
 <sub>A540</sub> = 0.6–0.8 was reached IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. After another 3 h, the cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation and stored at -20°C until use.
