<p>In this study, we have focused on the structure and applications of a novel HA tri-stalk protein comprising LAH region which has attracted much attention as a potential universal influenza vaccine component [

In contrast to polypeptide 38–175 being able to resist incubation at 68°C some portion of tri-stalk protein was found unassembled already after heating at 55°C indicating that the lack of internal cysteines negatively affects its thermostability (

Nevertheless, the outcome of assembled tri-stalk protein using our purification method is estimated at about 5 mg/g of wet cells which makes it attractive for downstream immunogenicity and antigenicity studies and co-crystallization for structural and immunological analysis.
