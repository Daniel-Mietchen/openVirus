<p>Although HA stem is closely packed to the viral membrane and therefore partly covered by the head domain, the majority of conserved region is accessible to anti-stem Abs [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, immune responses post-infection and post-vaccination are mainly targeted to the immunodominant HA head region [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Accordingly, it is well established that anti-stem Abs are normally not found in individuals vaccinated with seasonal inactivated influenza virus vaccines whereas low levels of these Abs are induced by natural virus infection in humans as well as in mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, infection of individuals with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus induced high levels of stem-reactive Ab responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Cross-reactive immunity derived from anti-stem-specific Abs also tends to increase upon exposure to antigenically diverse influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Swine play a particular role in cross-species transmission of diverse influenza viruses because they are susceptible to both avian and human influenza viruses and can act as “mixing vessel” for reassortment of viral gene segments [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Previous study showed that, before the outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 2009, persons with professional contact with swine obtained higher serological cross-reactivity with various influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, European avian-like subtype H1N1 SIV, and 2007–2008 seasonal influenza subtype H1N1 virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0204776.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that these SW harbor pre-existing cross-immunity against various influenza strains, possibly mediated by Ab targeting to conserved viral epitopes, like the HA stem. Indeed, using tri-stalk protein based ELISA to determine the binding of the cross-reactive Abs in these pre-pandemic sera, the results show that Abs targeting the tri-stalk epitope significantly correlate with the Abs specific to the novel antigen, HA H1/09. In addition, tri-stalk specific Abs also have a positive correlation with the neutralizing activities against the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus.
