<p>Altogether, our results demonstrate that the novel HA tri-stalk protein, which comprises of the HA LAH region, can be applied in various immunological assays to determine HA stem-specific humoral responses in both clinical and animal samples. The conserved feature of LAH domain makes the HA tri-stalk protein a promising tool for evaluation of pre-existing or cross-reactive immunity to a newly emerged influenza viruses.</p>
