  <title>The cross-reactivity of mouse sera.</title>
  <p>(A) Reactivity with group 1 HA proteins (H1, H2, H5, H9, H11 and H16). (B) Reactivity with group 2 HA proteins (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 and H15). Mice were immunized with LAH-PP7 fusion protein or adjuvant alone (mock). The panels show the mean and standard deviation of the optical density at 405 nm of the sera from 10 mice per group.</p>
