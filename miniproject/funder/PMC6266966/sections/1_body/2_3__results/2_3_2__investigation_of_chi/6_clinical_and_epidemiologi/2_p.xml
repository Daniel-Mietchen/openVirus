<p>In CHIKV monoinfections, individuals 26 to 30 years old (22.5%) were the most affected, followed by 51–55 years old (15.0%), 56–60 years old (12.5%), and &gt;65 years old (12.5%). The ZIKV monoinfections were observed in individuals between 26 to 30 years old (22.2%), 36 to 40 years old (22.2%), and 41 to 45 years old (22.2%). The CHIKV/ZIKV coinfections were confirmed in individuals in the age group of 41–45 years old (25.0%), followed by 61–65 years old (12.5%), and &gt;65 years old (12.5%). The CHIKV/DENV-4 coinfections were reported in individuals aged between 16 and 20 years old (33.3%), 21–25 years old (33.3%), and 56–60 years old (33.3%). The ZIKV/DENV-4 coinfection occurred in a 51-year-old patient. Arthralgia, chills, headache, exanthema, fever, lower back pain, myalgia, nausea, pruritus, and prostration were among the most common signs and symptoms observed in all CHIKV confirmed cases groups (
