<p>The first cases of ZIKV in Brazil in 2015 led to the occurrence of a triple epidemic of arboviruses caused by the co-circulation of CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV in some states of the country. This situation did represent a serious public health problem due difficulties in diagnosing the cases clinically due to their similar signs and symptoms and due to the lack of reliable tests for the differential laboratorial diagnosis [

The combination of laboratorial methods, such as the strategy used here, despite not always used in most laboratories due to its cost, is important for the accurate case confirmation. In this study, co-infections by CHIKV/DENV and CHIKV/ZIKV were observed in both states and this observation has been described previously in areas where multiple arboviruses circulate in the Americas, Africa, and Asia [
