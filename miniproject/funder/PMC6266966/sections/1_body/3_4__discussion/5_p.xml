<p>In AP, 13.0% (13/100) of acute samples were confirmed for DENV by molecular and/or serological techniques, and among those confirmed by RT-PCR (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10), eight were identified as DENV-1 and 2 as DENV- 4. Of the convalescent samples, 40.7% (44/108) were confirmed for dengue using serological methodologies. Thus, the data demonstrated that during 2014â€“2015, despite distinct arboviral epidemics occurring simultaneously in AP, chikungunya was predominant and only a few dengue cases were reported. In Laos in 2014, an opposite scenario was characterized during an epidemic, and a higher percentage of dengue cases was reported when compared to chikungunya [
