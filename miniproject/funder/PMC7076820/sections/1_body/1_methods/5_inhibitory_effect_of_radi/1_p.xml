<p id="Par17">Swine testicle cells were cultured in 96-well plates as described. After culture for 24 h to achieve 80% confluence, cells were infected with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of PRV for 1.5 h. Next, the virus fluid was removed, and cells were washed with PBS three times. Several different concentrations of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide and RPMI 1640 medium were added. Cells were also incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 68 h and MTT assays were then performed as described.
