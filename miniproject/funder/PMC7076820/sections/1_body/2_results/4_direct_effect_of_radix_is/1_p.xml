<p id="Par23">The antiviral effect of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide is of paramount importance for the drug industry. Compared to that in the control group, 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide markedly improved PRV killing. A concentration of 0.625 mg/mL was found to kill 67.422% of PRV, whereas even the lower concentration of 0.078125 mg/mL resulted in 32.214% PRV death (Fig.
