 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide on PRV infection, porcine testicle cells were first co-cultured with different concentrations of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide, which was followed by infection with PRV. Results showed that this treatment could prevent PRV infection at rates ranging from 6.668 to 14.923% (Fig.Â
