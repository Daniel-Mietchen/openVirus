<p id="Par20">The cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide extracts on porcine testicle cells was determined by the MTT method after a 68-h co-incubation. The concentrations of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide tested were 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.15625, 0.078125, and 0.0390625 mg/mL. Results revealed no or insignificant cytotoxic effects of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide extracts from 0.625 to 0.0390625 mg/mL, with only a slight cytotoxic effect (30.390%) at the highest tested concentration of 5 mg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Thus, 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide concentrations of 0.625–0.078125 mg/mL were selected for the next experiments.
