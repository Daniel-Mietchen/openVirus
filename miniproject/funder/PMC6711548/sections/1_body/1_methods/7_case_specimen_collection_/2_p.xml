<p>Nucleic acids were extracted using TGuide S32 Magnetic Viral DNA&amp;RNA Kit (TIANGEN BIOTECH [BEIJING] Co., Ltd, Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was used to detect the universal and specific primer. The primer sequence and the test procedure were performed according to “Diagnosis for dengue fever (WS 216–2018)” announced by National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. The E gene of dengue virus was amplified using one Step RNA PCR Kit (TaKaRa [Dalian] Co., Ltd, Dalian, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR procedures were performed as the protocol of E gene amplification which was deposited in protocols.io (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.zpuf5nw). The purified products amplified by PCR were used for gene sequencing directly. The sequencing was performed by Sunny Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China. The phylogenetic trees for the E genes were constructed using the neighbor-joining method provided by MEGA 5.2 software. Nucleotides and amino acids similarity were compared by MegAlign software.</p>
