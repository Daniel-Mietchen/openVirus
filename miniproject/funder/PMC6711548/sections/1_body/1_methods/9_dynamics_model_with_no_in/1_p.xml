<p>Several ordinary differential equation (ODE) models were developed to simulate the transmission of the virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, the transmission model was developed based our previous study[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the model, individuals were divided into the following six compartments: 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, susceptible; 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, exposed; 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>

 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, asymptomatic; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, removed. Vectors were divided into the following three compartments: 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>, susceptible; 
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>, exposed; 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>, infectious. Therefore, total number of the vectors (
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>) was calculated by adding up the three mosquito compartments. The human and vector compartments interacted with each other according to
