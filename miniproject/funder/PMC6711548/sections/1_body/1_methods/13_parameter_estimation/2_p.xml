 </sub> were calculated using the Models 1–5 to fit the reported cases data. The seasonality relative parameter 
 <italic>τ</italic> and 
 <italic>T</italic> were confirmed according to the onset date of the first case, the duration of the season, and curve fitting to the light-trap captured density and BI surveillance data in 2018. Thus
