<p>The second step simulation was to model the transmission in community A using Models 1–5. Berkeley Madonna 8.3.18 (developed by Robert Macey and George Oster of the University of California at Berkeley) was employed for model simulation and least root mean square was adopted to judge the goodness of fit of curve fitting between the simulation models and the reported data. The simulation methods were the same as the previously published researches [
