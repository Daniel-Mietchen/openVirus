<p>We performed a time series study in dengue cases reported in Ningbo City from January 2005 to November 2018. We performed a field epidemiological and modelling study to investigate the epidemiological and virological characteristics of a dengue outbreak, to simulate the incidence of the transmission, and to assess the effectiveness of intervention implemented in the outbreak from August to September 2018 in the city. To explore the seasonality patterns of the vector, a surveillance to investigate the density of the vector was also conducted from January to December 2018.</p>
