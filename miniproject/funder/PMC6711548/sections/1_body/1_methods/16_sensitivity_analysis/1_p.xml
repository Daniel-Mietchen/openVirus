 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The ranges of the 8 parameters, which were shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, were split into 1000 values and simulated separately. The prevalence of each simulation were used to calculate the mean prevalence, mean–sd, and mean + sd.
