<p>To reducing the HBR (rHBR) during the outbreak, bed net or mosquito repellents were encouraged to be used in the community. We assumed that the transmission relative rate from mosquitos to human and from human to mosquitos would be multiplied by an effective coefficient 
 <italic>θ</italic> when the HBR was reduced by different levels (10% to 100%). Therefore, 
 <italic>θ</italic> would be set as 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, …, and 0.0 consequently.
