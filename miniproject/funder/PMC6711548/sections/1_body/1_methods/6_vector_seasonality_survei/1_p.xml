<p>To identify the density and the seasonality of the vector in the city, the density of adult and larvae vector was monitored each month in 2018 from January to December. The adult density was monitored by using light-trap density. More than four surveillance sites were selected in each subarea of Ningbo City, among which two were selected in urban area such as parks and two were in villagesâ€™ households. A light-trap was hung about 1.5m above the ground in each mosquito capturing site from one hour before sunset to one hour after sunrise of the next day. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes were sorted and identified according to morphological characteristics. The light-trap density of the vector was calculated per light-trap per night consequently. BI was also monitored each month in four communities or villages. The investigation method was the same as the one used during the outbreak.
