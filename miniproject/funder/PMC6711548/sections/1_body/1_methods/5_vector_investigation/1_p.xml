<p>Human biting rate (HBR) and larvae density were conducted during the outbreak. In our study, HBR was monitored every day in three surveillance sites locating in the community using the human-baited double net (HDN) trap from August 18, 2018 to the end of the outbreak. One local volunteer was employed and rested inside the small bed net (length × width × height: 1.2m × 1.2m × 2.0m) and was consequently fully protected from mosquitoes during the survey. A larger bed net (length × width × height: 1.8m × 1.8m × 1.5m) was hung over the smaller net and was raised 50 cm above the ground. Both nets were protected from the elements by plastic-sheeting roofs but were not treated with any insecticide. One trained person helped to capture the mosquitoes for 30 minutes in and out the larger bed net per hour during high activity time. The vector species were identified in laboratory and the number of captured mosquitoes was recorded in each survey site to calculate the HBR (per person per hour).</p>
