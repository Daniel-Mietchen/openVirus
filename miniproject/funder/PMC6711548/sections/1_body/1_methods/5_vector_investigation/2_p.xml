<p>We used Breteau Index (BI) to assess the larvae density of the vector. An investigation of BI was conducted from 18 August to 14 September in the community. More than 100 households were surveyed each time by screening all possible habitats and larvae or pupae of the vector were collected and numbered to bring back to the laboratory of Ningbo Municipal CDC to bleed them until they emerged to adult mosquitoes for species classification. Therefore, BI was calculated per 100 households in each day of the community.</p>
