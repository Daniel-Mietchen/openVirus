<p>There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, our simulation model has dynamics the dengue incidence using the ODE model based on a small scale outbreak in a community. The small population based modelling might lead to some uncertainty. Fortunately, our previously research found that the simulation results would be stable when the population is larger than 2000 people [

We got gene sequences data of about 89% confirmed cases during the outbreak. The vector surveillance data during the outbreak and in the year of 2018 also provided a solid grounding in the foundations of model. These efforts have improved the reliability of our modelling and effectiveness assessment of intervention. Secondly, the effect of the Jongdari typhoon (23 Julâ€”4 Aug) was not taken into account, but this potentially may influence the number of dengue confirmed cases.
