<p>In our study, the ODE models were employed to fit the epidemic curves of the outbreak in a large community, the results of the Chi square test showed high good-of-fitness of our models to the reported data, suggesting that the models is suitable for this study and can be used to simulate the incidence of the outbreak and to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasures. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that our model is sensitive to
