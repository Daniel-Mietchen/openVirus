We analyze the reported data from 2005 to 2018 and comment that there was no dengue transmission in the city from 2005 to 2014 and the city was a non-epidemic area of dengue virus for more than 10 years. Therefore, by analyzing the epidemiological and the virological characteristics of the first dengue outbreak in a non-epidemic area since 2005 (the second outbreak since 1929), our study can provide important reference for the disease control and prevention.
