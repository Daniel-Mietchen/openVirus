<p>The surveillance of BI and light-trap density of the vector showed that the seasonality of vector is obvious with a peak from June to August in the city. The high density of the vector provides a high receptivity and therefore a high probability for the transmission. This is also the case in Ningbo City on 18 August, 2018. These findings of seasonality of vector density and the incidence were similar to transmission pattern of dengue in China, with indigenous cases mainly reported from July to November with the peak transmission mostly in the hot and humid seasons [
