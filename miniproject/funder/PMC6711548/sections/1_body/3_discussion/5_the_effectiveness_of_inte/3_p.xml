<p>To our knowledge, when conducting AVC, the HBR will decrease. However, our outbreak did not provide a background for our investigation. During our outbreak control, AVC was conducted immediately covering the whole community, thus the procedure of interaction between AVC and HBR was shortened in a short time (a day). The results of our models also showed that the TAR and DO of rHBR (100%), AVC, and rHBR (100%)+AVC were almost the same (
