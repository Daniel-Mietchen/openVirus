<p>Fortunately, our study showed that the rHBR has distinctive effectiveness. However, because of the high transmissibility of the disease, the effectiveness is obvious when HBR is reduced to 17.2% of the initial value of the outbreak and would reach a satisfying effectiveness when reduced to 8.2%. In reality, HBR is hard to reduce down to 0% in short time. Although AVC is not the most effective among the single intervention, its TAR and DO were close to rHBR
 <sub>100%</sub>. Therefore, rHBR and LC are strongly recommended during the outbreak. On 18 August, 2018 (the outbreak reported date), the HBR was 12 per person per hour. But after intervention implemented, HBR was reduced to 4 per person per hour (down to 33%) and 1 per person per hour (down to 8.33%) in the following two days. These surveillance data are similar to the simulated data.
