<p>Our study showed that the high transmissibility led to the rapid transmission of virus in the community in a short period although the density of the vector decreased after August. The high transmissibility also led to the control difficulty. Under this condition, LC would not be effective because there is a biological delay from larva to adult vector, and during that delay, the virus would have been transmitted widely among the population. But, to our knowledge, LC has a long term effectiveness. In the low or moderate transmissibility scenarios, LC would be valuable. In addition, high proportion of the asymptomatic infection leads to the disease transmission even though symptomatic individuals are totally isolated. Therefore, case isolation is not the primary intervention during an outbreak.</p>
