<p>Without intervention, DENV-1 could transmit rapidly within a short period of time and lead to high attack rate in community in China. The ODE models can be used to simulate the incidence dynamic of dengue outbreak and to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasures. AVC or rHBR should be recommended as primary interventions to control the dengue virus transmission rapidly at the early stage of an outbreak. Bed net or mosquito repellents were encouraged to be used in the community to reduce HBR, and space spraying of insecticides was recommended to control adult vector during the outbreak.</p>
