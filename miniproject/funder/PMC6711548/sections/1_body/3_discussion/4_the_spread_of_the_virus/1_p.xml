<p>Our model shows that dengue virus could lead to a high attack rate (higher that 30%) within two months without any interventions. This finding suggests that the transmissibility of the virus might be high during the outbreak although the value of the transmissibility was not quantified. Therefore, in future control of dengue transmission, it calls for a high sensitivity and specificity of the surveillance systems including the diagnosis in hospitals or clinics, specimen collection and testing by PCR method or gene sequencing, and field epidemiological investigation. When an outbreak is confirmed and reported to the local CDC, our models could be employed to forecast the TAR and DO to simulate the future transmission scenarios and enable public health department to perform timely countermeasures.</p>
