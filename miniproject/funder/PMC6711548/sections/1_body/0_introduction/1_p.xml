 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The virus has become a leading cause of illness and death in tropics and subtropics. More important issues show that the virus has spread much wilder in recent decades. As reported by World Health Organization (WHO), only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics before 1970. But now, the disease is endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO regions [
