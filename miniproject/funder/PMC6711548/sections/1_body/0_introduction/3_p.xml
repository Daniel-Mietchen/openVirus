<p>From 2005 to 2014, no indigenous case was recorded in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China. However, four indigenous cases occurred in the city in 2015. Then on 18 August, 2018, two suspected dengue cases were reported in two hospitals in Ningbo City. Serum specimens were collected and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, two cases were confirmed as DENV-1 dengue by the laboratory of Ningbo Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The first case was a 6-year old female who developed fever on 11 August. The second one was a 38-year old male whose onset date was on 15 August and his initial symptom was also fever. The two index cases were both connected to community A and had no travel history within 14 days before symptoms onset. These findings revealed that dengue virus had been transmitted among people in the community. By performing a standardized case-finding and field epidemiological investigation, the outbreak source was confirmed as a 65-year old male case living in community B where is about 500 meters far from community A whose onset date was on 30 July. He had the same E gene sequence as the two cases. Therefore, the outbreak provides a typical field to research the disease transmission in a non-epidemic area.</p>
