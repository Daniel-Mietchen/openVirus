<p>Dengue fever has been absent in China for about 30 years [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The reported incidence of the disease increased dramatically in recent years and cases have expanded from the coastal provinces of southern China and provinces adjacent to Southeast Asia to the central (Henan Province) and northern part (Shandong Province) of China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The climate of most areas lying in tropical and subtropical zone is suitable for the reproduction of the vector and therefore provides a suitable environment for the disease transmission. When the virus imports in a desirable season, the transmission risk would be high. The rapid expansion of virus is an alert to conduct a risk assessment so as to understand the virus characteristics clearly. It could be better to investigate the transmission chain from an imported case to secondary cases in a non-epidemic area where there was no dengue transmission before than in epidemic area. Therefore, to understand a dengue outbreak in non-epidemic area has become an essential public health issue for the disease control and prevention.
