<p>Mathematical model is commonly adopted to explore the transmission of an infectious disease. The basic dengue model is the simple vector-host transmission model in which the host population is represented by a Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) model and the vector is assumed to remain infectious until death (SI model) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In other researches, internal and external incubation were also considered and the vector and host transmission models were changed to Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Removed (SEIR) model and SEI model [

This study aimed to investigate a dengue outbreak in a non-epidemic area in Ningbo City in China by combining mathematical models we developed, to inspect the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the transmission, and to assess the effectiveness of intervention implemented in the outbreak.
