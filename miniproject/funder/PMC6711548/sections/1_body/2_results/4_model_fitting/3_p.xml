<p>Consequently, the seasonality of the vector population dynamic could be simulated by a trigonometric function with a cycle of 18 months. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007659.g005">Fig 5</xref>, we can see that the model simulated 10 months (306 days) in a year, thus, 
 <italic>T</italic> = 712. As the illness onset date was on 11 August, 2018, the simulation delay of the initial time in the whole season is 170 days, thus 
 <italic>Ï„</italic> = 170.
