<p>Of the 28 cases in communities A and B, specimens of 25 cases were obtained to detect the whole E gene sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007659.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The length of the sequence was 1485bp which coded 495 amino acids. Compared with the gene sequences in the GenBank database, the gene type of all 25 cases were all DENV-1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 25 virus strains in the outbreak highly aggregated into a branch which belonged to Genotypes I (GI) and were closely related to the virus in community B and the seven strains in Asia countries including China (YunNan, TaiZhou, and Guangdong), Myanmar, Malaysia, and Singapore, were closely related to the prototype strain Myanmar/2015/MG894863 which was origin from Myanmar and export to Taiwan Province, China in 2015, however they were much far from the prototype strain Hawaii/1944/KM204119 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007659.s002">S1 Table</xref>. The all 25 isolates shared high levels of nucleotide identity and amino acid similarity with the seven GI reference strains: 98.0%– 99.7% and 96.6%– 98.2%, respectively, while moderate levels with the prototype strain Hawaii/1944/KM204119: 94.5% –94.8% and 92.1% –92.5%, respectively and low levels with the prototype strains of Genotypes II–IV (G II–IV).
