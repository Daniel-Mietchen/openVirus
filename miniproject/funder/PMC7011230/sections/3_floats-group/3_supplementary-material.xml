    <bold>Additional file 1: Table S1.</bold> Positive cases of arbovirus and seasonality. χ
    <sup>2</sup>-test, negative cases vs total cases and infected. χ
    <sup>2</sup>-test was performed for the May–July period to avoid counts less than 5. ND, not determined because there are many cells with counts less than 5. *F-test, negative cases vs infected. **Others correspond to infection cases by OROV/DENV/ZIKV and OROV/DENV/CHIKV. 
    <bold>Table S2.</bold> Analysis of the distribution of clinical symptoms. The table is symmetric on the diagonal line. The numbers correspond to the 
    <italic>p</italic>-values associated with χ
    <sup>2</sup>-Test, no significant differences (
    <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). ND, not determined because there are many cells with counts less than 5. *Others correspond to infection cases by OROV + DENV + ZIKV and OROV + DENV + CHIKV. 
    <bold>Table S3.</bold> Positive cases of OROV by age and symptomatology. χ
    <sup>2</sup>-test, total positive cases vs positive cases by age.
