<p id="Par26">The present study is the first report of OROV detection in the Peruvian coastal region demonstrating a high incidence of this arbovirus in samples negatives for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in a first analysis. We suspect that landscape perturbation in addition to human migration may have played a key role in the virus spread probably from Cajamarca which part of its eastern territory includes the Amazon Rainforest and limits on the west with Piura.</p>
