<p id="Par29">Our work shows an important frequency of co-infections among the arboviruses studied, this idea is reinforced with studies that have shown that the vector 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> can transmit both ZIKV and CHIKV through a single bite and that the co-infection of ZIKV and CHIKV does not influence its vectorial competence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], which could also be applied for DENV. It has also been described that 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> can transmit all combinations of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV to humans, our report suggests that there may be co-infection with OROV although transmitted by different vector. In this context, it has been studied that simultaneous co-infection between 2 or 3 different viruses alters the immune response but that this does not imply a different or more serious clinical symptomatology if it is contrasted with single viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].
