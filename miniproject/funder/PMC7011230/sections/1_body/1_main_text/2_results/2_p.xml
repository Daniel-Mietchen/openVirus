<p id="Par19">An analysis of the infection was performed by age groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The population of AFI patients without infection caused by OROV were considered as negative cases. The distribution was significantly different in those infected only by OROV (χ
 <sup>2</sup>, p = 0.029) and those with OROV + DENV co-infection (χ
 <sup>2</sup>, p = 0.006). Consequently, the total population of patients infected with OROV (OROV and OROV + other arboviruses) was significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup>, p = 0.017) compared to negative cases. This difference is based on the significant increase (p &lt; 0.025) of the OROV positive cases in the groups of children aged 5–11 years and adults older than 60 years.
