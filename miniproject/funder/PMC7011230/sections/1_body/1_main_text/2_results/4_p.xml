<p id="Par21">The frequency of OROV infection was also analyzed for its possible seasonality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The annual distribution of the frequencies of OROV infection and co-infection of OROV + other arboviruses were significantly different (χ
 <sup>2</sup> with p = 0.045 and p = 0.016, respectively) to the distribution of AFI and negative cases. The distribution is unimodal between the months of May and July and the greatest number of cases of infection with ORV and OROV with co-infections (46.3% and 50.4%, respectively) is observed in the month of June. We found that OROV infection mainly occurs during late autumn and mid-winter. However, if we observe the annual distribution of rainfall and the little variation in temperature in the geographical area of study (inset Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), the rainy season corresponds to summer-autumn. In this sense, it is more accurate to indicate that OROV infection occurs mostly in the dry season.
