 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2). This means that it is very difficult to diagnose OROV infection clinically, and confirmatory molecular diagnosis is required. In all cases of co-infections, the frequency in the clinical presentation was similar to that presented in the cases only positive OROV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). When describing the clinical picture of OROV + patients, it was found that headache and myalgia are the most frequent in all age groups (Additional file
