<p id="Par18">OROV was detected in 26.4% (131/496) of AFI patients. We have that 16.5% (82/496) (95% CI 13.4–20.1%) of AFI patients were diagnosed with OROV as a single infectious agent and co-infection of OROV with other arboviruses was identified in 9.9% (49/496) (95% CI 7.4–12.8%). Co-infections of two viruses were the most frequent, such as OROV + DENV (36 cases), OROV + ZIKV (9 cases) and OROV + CHIKV (1 case). In addition, 3 cases of co-infection with three viruses simultaneous arboviruses were also identified (2 cases of OROV + DENV + CHIKV, and 1 case of OROV + DENV + ZIKV) (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Both cases (infections by OROV and OROV + other arboviruses) were significant (p &lt; 0.05) in the AFI patient population. This highlights the importance of co-infections as an epidemiological condition in the population.
