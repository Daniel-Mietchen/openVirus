 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This due to factors that interact with each other, related to the virus, humans, and the environment (temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.). These factors affect the spatial and temporal distribution, as well as the abundance of the arthropods, the characteristics of the life cycles and the transmission efficiency [
