  <title>Infection, dissemination, transmission rates and transmission efficiency of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>.

  <p>A) Infection and dissemination rates at 14 days post-exposure (dpe). B) Infection, dissemination, transmission rates and transmission efficiency at 21 dpe. Error bars show the 95% confidence interval. In brackets, the number of mosquitoes examined. IR: the proportion of mosquitoes with infected body among engorged mosquitoes; DIR: the proportion of mosquitoes with infected head among mosquitoes with infected body; TR: the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among mosquitoes with infected head. The lowercase letter on the top of some indices indicates the significant difference for pairwise comparisons. When the same letter is shared by several populations, this indicates that the difference is significant (
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) between them.
