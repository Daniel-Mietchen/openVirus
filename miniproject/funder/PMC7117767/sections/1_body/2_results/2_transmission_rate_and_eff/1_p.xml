<p>In 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, transmission rate (TR) and transmission efficiency (TE) varied according to the population tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For the TR, pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007) between Douala (39%) population and Yaoundé urban (100%) population; however, for other comparisons no significant difference (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) was reported. While, for the TE no significant difference (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.37) (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g002">2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g003">3B</xref>) was reported between populations after pairwise comparisons. Similarly, in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, TR varied significantly (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0014) according to the population with lowest TR reported in two populations from northern part of Cameroon, Bénoué (56%) and Maroua (43%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008163.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Pairwise comparisons showed a significant difference (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.021) between Maroua and Yaoundé (urban and rural) populations. Contrary to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, the TE for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was significantly different (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) according to the population origin. Pairwise comparisons indicated significant differences (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) between Bénoué population and both Yaoundé populations (urban and rural), and between Maroua and both Yaoundé populations also. When all populations of each species were analysed together, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (56%) exhibited higher TEs than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (42%) (Fisher’s exact test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Overall, ZIKV titres were significantly higher in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> compared to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (Chi-squared test: χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 6.4527, df = 1, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). In 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, significant differences in viral loads were reported according to population (Chi-squared test: χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 21.406, df = 5, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) with lowest titres in Maroua population, and highest in Brazzaville population. While in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, no significant variation of ZIKV titres was observed (Chi-squared test: χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.65, df = 3, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.44) (
