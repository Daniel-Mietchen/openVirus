<p>The first evidence of ZIKV circulation was reported in Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Central Africa, ZIKV circulation in human populations was confirmed in Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), and Gabon [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As an example, in Cameroon, 2 to 10% blood donors were ZIKV-positive [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and ZIKV was detected in two mosquito species in CAR (
