<p>For each population, six batches of 60, 7–10 day-old females were exposed to an infectious blood meal containing 1.4 mL of washed rabbit erythrocytes and 700 μL of viral suspension. The blood meal was supplemented with adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) as a phagostimulant at a final concentration of 5 mM. The titre of infectious blood-meals provided to mosquitoes was 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL using a Hemotek membrane feeding system (Hemotek Ltd., Blackburn, UK). Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 20 min through a pork intestine membrane covering the base of a Hemotek feeder maintained at 37°C.
