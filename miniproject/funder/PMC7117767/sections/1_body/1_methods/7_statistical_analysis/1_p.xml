<p>All statistical analyses were performed with R software. Qualitative variables were expressed as proportion and compared using Fisher’s exact test and quantitative variables by mean and compared using non-parametric test of Kruskal-Wallis because of non-normal distribution. Pairwise comparisons were performed using Fisher’s exact test for proportions and Kruskal-Wallis test for means. For multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was applied.
