<p>The ZIKV strain (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic> mosquito in Dakar, Senegal (GenBank accession number: KU955592) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008163.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The strain was provided by EVAg (

The strain was passaged four times on BHK-21 cells and freeze-dried before the shipment. Upon receipt, the sample was re-suspended in 400 μL of distilled water. The viral stock for mosquito infections was prepared after two passages of the isolate on Vero CCL-81 cells (ATCC, VA, USA) maintained at 37°C. Once cytopathic effect was detected (60–72 h after infection), supernatants were collected and adjusted to 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, CA, USA), aliquoted into 1.5 mL samples, and frozen at -80°C until thawed and used to prepare the blood-virus suspensions used to expose mosquitoes to ZIKV. The viral titre was estimated by serial 10-fold dilutions on Vero cells expressed in pfu (plaque-forming units)/mL.
