<p>Vero and HEp-2 cells were screened for cellular viability and cytotoxicity following siRNA transfection by CellTiter96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit and ToxiLight bioassay (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) following manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Cellular toxicity was evaluated at 0 and 48 h post-transfection. Data was normalized to siTOX control (100% cytotoxicity). siRNAs which resulted in &gt;10% toxicity were excluded from the screen. Cell growth assessment revealed no significant differences in cell adherence or doubling time between KD and wild type cells.</p>
