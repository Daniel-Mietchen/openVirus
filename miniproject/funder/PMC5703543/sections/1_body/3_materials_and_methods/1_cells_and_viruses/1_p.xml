<p>A siRNA screen was performed using Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells; received from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta) who obtained them from the Serum Institute of India (SI) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and HEp-2 cells (human laryngeal carcinoma, HeLa-derivative; received from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Vero cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; HyClone, GE Healthcare) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone). The same passage number of Vero cells and HEp-2 cells was used in validation studies to minimize differences and aid interpretation. A master cell bank was created to ensure that all experiments were performed using a consistent low number of cell passages. PV (Sabin-2) was obtained from National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Health Protection Agency, Potters Bar, United Kingdom. RV strain RV3 was obtained from the CDC and propagated in MA104 cells (rhesus monkey epithelial cell line; clone 1, ATCC CRL-2378.1 [

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Briefly, Vero cells were infected with RV (MOI = 0.2), the cells fixed prior to performing an immunofluorescent ELISA. For immunofluorescent staining, fixed plates were stained using a primary polyclonal rabbit anti-RV antibody (Rab A-SA11, Australia) the plates washed, blocked, and were then a goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody used for detection with a Beckman Coulter Paradigm spectrophotometer. Additionally, the percent of infected cells per well was determined relative to that of the non-targeting control by additional staining of the plate with DAPI to detect cell nuclei and scanning on a Cellomics Array scanner. IAV (A/WSN 33) and influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. DENV-1 (Hawaii, BEI resources NR-82) was grown in Vero cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. HAV (ATCC- VR-2266) was grown in MRC-145 cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Coxsackie Virus B5 (EV71; ATCC VR-185) was grown in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. MUV virus (ATCC VR-1438) was grown in HEp-2 cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. RUBV (ATCC VR-1359) was grown in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. VZV (human herpesvirus 3 ATCC VR-1367) was grown in MRC-145 cells [
