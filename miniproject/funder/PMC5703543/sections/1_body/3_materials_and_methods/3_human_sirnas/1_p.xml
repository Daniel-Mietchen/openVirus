<p>ON-TARGETplus siRNAs (GE Healthcare, Lafayette, CO) combine sense-strand inactivation with a novel seed-region modification and were used to target the host genes of interest (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t001">Table 1</xref>). Non-targeting controls allowed assessment of non-specific effects. Pooled siRNA controls were used for reduction of off-targeting with Vero cells, and for use with SMARTpool siRNA reagents that were used for validation.
