<p>siRNAs targeting the 18 host genes of interest (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t001">Table 1</xref>) were reverse transfected in triplicate into HEp-2 cells or Vero cells at a final concentration of 50 nM using 0.3% DharmaFECT-4, and triplicate experiments were done three independent times unless noted otherwise. Briefly, On-TARGETplus siRNAs were mixed with DharmaFECT 4 reagent in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM; Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. A NTC siRNA (GE Healthcare) and a PV, RV or IAV type-specific positive siRNA control target were included [

Transfected cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 48h, the medium was removed and cells were infected with PV (MOI = 0.1) in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. In some cases, 24h pi; the plates were frozen at 80°C and stored until analysis of antigen content by ELISA. For siRNAs targeting the other viruses (

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The validated gene hits from IAV, PV and RV studies were analyzed for the top 6 PV, IAV virus, or RV hits, and several end-point assays [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] such as plaque assay were re-confirmed. For PV, RV and IAV, all assays used an endpoint of day 3 pi with a MOI = 0.1. ZIKV was at day 5 pi at MOI = 0.1. For all other others examined an endpoint of day 7–10 pi was used. In all siRNA studies, there was &gt;95 gene KD (
