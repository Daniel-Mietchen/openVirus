<p>qPCR was performed to evaluate that KD took place with each of the siRNAs [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. We examined KD of the genes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t001">Table 1</xref>) in HEp-2 and Vero cells using the comparative CT method (ΔΔCT) for relative quantitation for measuring siRNA-induced KD of a particular gene using TaqMan, and &gt;95% gene KD was confirmed (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t002">Table 2</xref>). The RNA from the siRNA-transfected cells was assessed by measuring the RNA levels of the GAPDH gene, according to an endogenous 18S RNA. A NTC siRNA-transfected was also assessed to the experimental samples to assess the negative control samples. The ΔΔCT was used to calculate the percent remaining gene expression and the percent knockdown. Since the Vero genome is not fully annotated, we designed Vero specific primers using available contigs, amplified the regions from normal Vero cDNA using high fidelity Q5 Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and cloned the inserts into TOPO TA vectors which were then sequence validated. Amplifications conditions were optimized as needed.
