<p>Vero cells, established from an African green monkey (non-human primate; NHP) are commonly used during poliovirus (PV), rotavirus (RV) and in some influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines [

Egg-based vaccine production is the current method for vaccines like IAV, but is time-consuming, expensive and cannot respond rapidly to newly emerging strains. Mammalian cell culture-based vaccines can overcome these limitations, allowing for rapid scale up of vaccines, reduce production and purification costs, and exhibit equivalent or higher vaccine and efficacy in both immunocompetent and allergic individuals. As such, Vero cells are being used to make seasonal IAV vaccines due to variants that arise by antigenic drift [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. One option for developing influenza vaccines is to create a vaccine cell line that is permissive for a large cohort of influenza subtypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Infection with a range of IAVs will promote reassortment of viral segments, leading to a mixture of diverse species, which can be used for vaccination. Achieving this capability could transform vaccinology.
