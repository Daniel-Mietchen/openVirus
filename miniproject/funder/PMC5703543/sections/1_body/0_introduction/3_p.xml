<p>The studies examined here determined if KD of PV genes [

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or RV genes [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t001">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t002">2</xref>) would increase virus replication as determined by plaque assay in either Vero cell or HEp-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t003">Table 3</xref>). An aim was to determine if there were host genes which when silenced would enhance virus replication. We tested several RNA viruses including influenza A/WSN/1933 (IAV), poliovirus Sabin-2 (PV), rotavirus/G3P[
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]/BB (RV), influenza B/Malaysia/2506/2004 (IBV), Dengue virus type 1, Hawaii (DENV), Yellow fever virus 17 D vaccine (YFV), Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Coxsackie virus B5 (EV71), mumps virus (MuV), rubella virus (RUBV), and a DNA virus, Varicella zoster virus (VZV). The results identified genes that when KD allowed for enhanced viral permissiveness and replication as determined by plaque assay or ELISA across viral families. Specifically, there were several host genes which enhanced virus replication when CNTD2, COQ9, GCGR, NDUFA9, NEU2, PYCR1, SEC16G, SVOPL, ZFYVE9, and ZNF205 genes were KD in Vero cells (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t001">Table 1</xref>) might be useful to make a universal cell line, though KD of more than one gene identified was not examined in this study.
