<p>Stand out findings from the results are that 1) it may be possible to create an enhanced universal cell line permissive for many viruses, 2) the Vero cell lines are generally better at propagating viruses than HEp-2 cells, 3) there is increased virus replication is in the KD cell lines, and 4) virus strain differences affect the outcome and magnitude of virus replication. For example, this was evident between ZIKV strains PVRABC59 and lbH30656 which had nearly 5 x10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/mL and 2 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL between strains, respectively, using the same propagation conditions. The reasons for these differences are not presently known.
