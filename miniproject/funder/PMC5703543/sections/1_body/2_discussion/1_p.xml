<p>To make a universal cell line that is receptive to a range of viruses, one should identify host genes that influence intrinsic immunity and help determine restriction or permissiveness toward virus infection and replication. There is convincing evidence that many viruses have evolved not only to avoid the apoptosis-mediated viral elimination, but also to exploit and even activate it to facilitate their lifecycle. As one example, influenza proteins NS1 and PB1-F2 act as apoptosis promoters [
