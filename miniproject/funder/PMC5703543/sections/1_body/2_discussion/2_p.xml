<p>Vero cells are one of the first continuous cell lines that were used for vaccine production which was helped by their lack of anti-viral IFN signaling [

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This feature makes the Vero cell line more permissive for a wide spectrum of viruses [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t003">Table 3</xref>) that could be used to create a universal vaccine cell line. We have shown that Vero cells transfected with siRNAs to KD BTN2A1, CNTD2, EP300, GCGR, PYCR1 and ZNF205 will support enhanced virus replication of most viruses examined here including PV, RV, IAV, DENV, HAV, EV71, MUV, RUBV, YFV, VZV, or ZIKV.
