<p>HAV viruses are in the picornavirus family [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. HAV replicated to substantially higher levels in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), and to elevated levels in HEp-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). KD of CNTD2, COQ9, GCGR, NEU2, and PYCR1 genes in Vero cells led to ~100 - &gt;200-fold increases in replication. Similarly, NDUFA9, NEU2, SEC61G, and ZNF205 were found to be important for replication in HEp-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). KD of NDUFA9, NEU2, SEC61G, and ZNF205 led to 50-100-fold increase in HAV replication. Of note, the NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 9 (NDUFA9) gene is thought to be an accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The NEU2 gene catalyzes the removal of sialic acid from glycoproteins and oligosaccharides [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is not clear how these host genes affect HAV replication. EP300 functions as histone acetyltransferase and regulates transcription via chromatin remodeling [
