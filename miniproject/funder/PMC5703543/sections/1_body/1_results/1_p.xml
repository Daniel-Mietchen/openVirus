<p>The ability to connect systems biology with host gene discovery to aid our understanding of the virus-host network is essential for creating a universal vaccine cell line. We used complementary approaches and data sets from several high-throughput screens for IAV [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], PV [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and RV [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] to arrive at a multidimensional view of virus-host networks. We screened the 6 top host genes for PV, RV or IAV that enhanced virus replication (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t001">Table 1</xref>), and tested if gene KD using siRNAs in Vero cells or HEp-2 cell lines would affect host cell permissiveness and allow for enhanced virus replication for 12 different viruses compared to control WT cells or cells transfected with a non-targeting (NTC) control siRNA. All siRNAs tested were ON-TARGETplus siRNAs designed to be seed-region optimized, leading to minimal off-target effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The genome-wide screens for PV, IAV and RV showed no or negligible off-target effects. All host genes targeted for KD in Vero cells or HEp-2 cells were â‰¥95% silenced before virus infection (
