<p>Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Based on antibody neutralization, four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) are evident [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. KD of BTN2A1, STRADA, SVOPL and ZFYVE9 increased DENV-1 replication in Vero cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These findings indicate that Vero cells and Hep-2 cells are permissive to DENV-1 with 2-3-fold higher virus replication following KD of key genes in HEp-2 cells.
