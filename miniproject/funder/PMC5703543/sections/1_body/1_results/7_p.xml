<p>Yellow fever virus (YFV) is also transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitos [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As expected, IFN-deficient Vero cells were more susceptible compared to HEp-2 cells. KD of COQ9, EP300, GCGR, PLA2G1B or RAD51AP1 resulted in enhanced YFV replication (~50-100-fold) in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). KD of PLA2G1B had the greatest effect on virus replication, ~100-fold over NTC. YFV replication in HEp-2 cells was diminished relative to Vero cells, with peak titers following KD of BTN2A1 ~40-fold (
