<p>EV71 is a picornavirus [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and was propagated in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and in HEp-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In Vero cells, there was a ~ 8-fold increase in virus replication following KD of host gene EP300. As the results are expressed as fold-change over NTC, all â‰¥2-fold increase in replication was considered notable. Other notable host genes affecting EV71 replication were CNTD2, EMX2, GCGR, NAT9, NDUFA9, PLA2G1B, PYCR1, SEC61G, SOPL and ZNF205 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). For HEp-2 cells, KD of CNTD2, EMX2, EP300, and PLA2G1C increased EV71 virus replication 2-3-fold, while there was a ~2-fold increase when STRADA and ZNF205 were KD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Little is known about how these host genes and how they may affect EV71 replication. It is possible that KD of more than one gene may have synergistic or additive effects; however this is not well-understood and was not tested in this study. The Cyclin N-Terminal Domain Containing 2 (CNTD2) gene is orphan cyclin where it has a predominantly nuclear location and it is implicated in transcription regulation as described for other cyclins [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is known that the EP300 gene behaves as a histone acetyltransferase and regulates transcription [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. EMX2 is a gene that encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor and possibly regulates mRNA transport or translation [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The glucagon receptor gene (GCGR) has a role in glucose homeostasis and is implicated to modulate the activity of adenylate cyclase [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The N-acetyltransferase 9 (NAT9) gene is involved in the catalysis of the transfer of an acetyl group to a nitrogen atom on the acceptor molecule [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. NDUFA9 is a subunit of the hydrophobic protein fraction of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the first enzyme complex in the electron transport chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Phospholipase A2, group 1B (PLA2G1B) is an enzyme that catalyzes the release of fatty acids from glycero-3-phosphocholines [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes proline biosynthesis reducing pyrroline-5-carboxylate to L-proline [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit gamma (SEC61G) may function to aid protein translocation in the endoplasmic reticulum [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The SVOPL gene is poorly annotated and thought to function as a substrate-specific transmembrane transporter [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There is experimental evidence at the protein level that zinc finger protein (ZNF)-205 may be involved in transcriptional regulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For HEp-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), KD of CNTD2, EMX2, EP300 and PLA2G1B had a 2-3-fold increases in EV71 replication.
