<p>For these studies, the PV strain was Sabin-2 as the World Health Organization recently endorsed elimination of Sabin -1 strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We noted virus strain differences in the magnitude of PV replication while switching from Sabin-1 to Sabin-2, particularly in the use of host genes involved in the ability of these strains to replicate which we do not fully understand [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Vero cells, the highest PV replication resulted from KD of CNTD2 (~4-fold) followed by KD of BTN2A1 and GCGR (~3-fold), and EP300, NAT9, RAD51AP1, SEC61G and ZNF205 that ranged from ~2- increases (

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The highest absorbance (480 nm) was for KD of EMX2, EP300, NAT9 and NDUFA9 genes which was significantly above NTC background. We also evaluated the top 6 genes for IAV replication in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). IAVs are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The top genes identified that when KD increased IAV replication were CNTD2, PLA2G1B and PYCR1 (2-4-fold) followed by ZFYVE9 (~2-fold).
