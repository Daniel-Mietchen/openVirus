<p>There are four types of influenza viruses, A, B, C and D, where human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics and influenza type C infections generally cause a mild respiratory illness, and influenza type D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to infect or cause illness in people [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Currently, two lineages of type B influenza virus (IBV) co-circulate in the world, thus the key host genes that affect IBV replication were determined in Vero cells which are an FDA-approved vaccine cell line used to propagate flu viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). KD of BTN2A1, COQ9, EP300, FGF2, GCGR, NAT9, and NDUFA9 genes had a ~2-3-fold increased IBV replication. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g005">Fig 5B</xref> shows the results from one independent plaque assay where n = 3 wells/gene KD were evaluated, and the fold-change over the NTC is shown. Lastly, Zika virus (ZIKV) which belongs to the Flaviviridae family and is spread by mosquitoes [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) as ZIKV did not replicate in HEP-2 cells. Two ZIKV strains (PVRABC59 and lbH30656) were examined. These ZIKV strains only grew in Vero cells which is consistent with their IFN-sensitivity in HEp-2 cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In Vero cells, KD of PYCR1, RAD51AP1, and ZNF205 lead to a 200-1000-fold increase in ZIKV virus titers, with the highest increases for KD of ZNF-205. The role for these genes restricting virus ZIKV replication is not known. However, it has been shown that loss of PYCR1 function leads to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased adequate susceptibility to apoptosis under oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These finding show that there are a spectrum host genes that restrict cell tropism and virus replication. All raw data used to summarize data shown in Figs
