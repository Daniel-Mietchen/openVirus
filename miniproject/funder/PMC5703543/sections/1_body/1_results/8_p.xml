<p>Mumps virus (MuV) is typically propagated in Hep-2 cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] as it does not grow well in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We examined the permissiveness of MUV for Vero cells and HEp-2 cells having KD of select host genes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188333.t003">Table 3</xref>). KD of BTN2A1 and SVOPL dramatically increased MUV propagation in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), whereas only KD of BTN2A1 was associated with enhanced virus replication in HEp-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0188333.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). KD of BTN2A1 and SVOPL led to increased MUV replication ~10-fold in Vero cells. BTN2A1 KD in HEp-2 cells enhanced MUV replication ~20-fold (
