<p>Rubella virus (RUBV) is in the family Togaviridae [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. RUBV is an important human pathogen associated with it birth defects, known congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), but through use of vaccines rubella and CRS are controlled [
 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We investigated if RUBV would grow in Vero cell and HEp-2 cells, but found it could only be propagated in Vero cells (

 <xref rid="pone.0188333.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] but was not specifically investigated. KD of GCGR, PYCR1, SVOPL, or ZNF205 led to 10-&gt;100-fold increases in RUBV, where KD of ZNF205 led to highest increases in RUBV.
