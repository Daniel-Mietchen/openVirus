  <title>Raw viral titers/ absorbance values for all figures in the manuscript.</title>
  <p>Supplementary excel file contains all raw data from viral titer assays in this manuscript. All assays were done in multiple technical replicates with either two or three biological replicates. Each worksheet summarizes fold change in viral titers relative to NTC for Vero and /or HEp-2 cells. Worksheet labels indicate virus-cell line-Figure panel.</p>
