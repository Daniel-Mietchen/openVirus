<p>While some studies have found LAMP to have lower or similar sensitivity for the ZIKV when compared to RT-qPCR [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], others have found LAMP to out-perform RT-qPCR sensitivity. Calvert and coworkers demonstrated that the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect ZIKV RNA in serum and urine and showed sensitivity 10-fold higher than RT-qPCR [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Zhao and Feng developed a LAMP assay that detected 0.5 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> or 1.12 × 10
 <sup>−11</sup> pmol/µl DNA for NS5 or E genes, respectively. This represented a 100-fold greater sensitivity compared with conventional PCR and RT-qPCR [
