<p>To provide perspective on the analytical sensitivity of different LAMP assays for ZIKV, we assembled a table summarizing this measure for all studies using ZIKV-spiked or RNA-spiked samples (

The top-performing ZIKV RT-LAMP method could detect ZIKV RNA standard at as few as 0.02 PFU/test, using RNA prepared by in vitro transcription. For assays that used RNA extracted from ZIKV specimens, top-performing assays provided greater sensitivity than conventional PCR and demonstrated sensitivity similar to RT-qPCR [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Regarding reaction time, the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect viral RNA from ZIKV-spiked serum and urine samples (14.5 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) in as little as 15 min. However, this last study found that the limit of detection was less sensitive than the RT-qPCR assay for the diagnosis of ZIKV [
