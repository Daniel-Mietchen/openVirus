<p>Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a powerful alternative POC assay for the virus as it allows rapid, robust, and simple amplification of nucleic acid targets at a single and fixed temperature [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The assay has many advantages over RT-qPCR, including rapidity, low cost, high sensitivity, and high specificity. LAMP results can also be easily read with the naked eye through color-based reporters that can be added to the reaction mixture [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Importantly, the simple, single-temperature incubation allows LAMP reactions to be performed without expensive equipment, directly in the field [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Since the 2015 emergence of the ZIKV in Brazil, many LAMP assays have been developed for diagnosis by research groups across the world [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These diagnostic platforms based on LAMP have proven to be specific, sensitive and inexpensive POC tools that can be applied even in resource-limited regions of the world. Here we review the development and application of LAMP methods for the diagnosis of ZIKV and explore the next steps to bring this assay into mainstream use.
