<p>Given the lack of approved vaccines and antivirals against ZIKV, a rapid and reliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test for detection of ZIKV is urgently required for control and prevention measures and to increase the diagnostic capacity of ZIKV-affected, mainly in low-resource areas [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. ZIKV infection is diagnosed in the laboratory by nucleic acid amplification tests or serological methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT), and lateral flow assays (rapid tests) [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although RT-qPCR provides high-quality results, the test requires extensive sample preparation, RNA extraction, expensive equipment, and technical expertise to run and interpret the amplification of the viral RNA. Moreover, available serological methods are prone to produce false-positive results due to cross-reaction with other flaviviruses in circulation, such as DENV, and are therefore of limited value [
