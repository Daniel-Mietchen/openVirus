 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In regions where there is a circulation of other arboviruses, such as DENV and chikungunya (CHIKV), the clinical diagnosis of ZIKV infection becomes extremely difficult because of common symptoms. Therefore, laboratory-based molecular diagnosis is of fundamental importance to correctly identify the etiologic agent [
