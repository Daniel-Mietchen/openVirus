<p>Surveillance of ZIKV in mosquitoes is an important measure for identifying potential entry points and monitoring virus activity [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the need for RNA extraction, complex reagents, such as ammonia, and the LED blue light for visualization of fluorescent signal limits its applications for POC diagnostics in low-resource countries. Other work by Lamb et al. (2018) developed a one-step protocol without RNA extraction that provided results that can be visualized in under 30 min with the naked eye under natural light. We, too, have concluded that the LAMP assay is specific, sensitive, and robust for the detection of ZIKV in experimentally infected
