In the case of LAMP assays for ZIKV detection, it is important that analytical specificity be assessed in the presence of other mosquito-borne arboviruses found in the region. In the case of the most recent ZIKV outbreak in Latin America, this would include the arboviruses DENV 1-4, CHIKV, and YFV [
