<p>In another research, a total of 81 diagnostic specimens (serum and plasma) collected from patients in Nicaragua and Brazil was assayed by LAMP and the results compared with RT-qPCR [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. They performed the experiments in quadruplicate and considered the positive sample based on one or more positive replicates with a defined melting point. From the total number of samples tested, 55 positive samples were determined by the LAMP assay. Of the 55 positive samples, 39 matched the results from the gold standard method for diagnostic of ZIKV, and 16 were false positives. In contrast, of the 26 LAMP assay-negative samples, 12 were false negatives. The analytical specificity of the LAMP assay was tested against RNAs from BSQV, SLEV, Langat virus, LGTV, ILHV, DENV-2, WNV, YFV, and CHIKV.
