<p>In this context, we developed a highly specific RT-LAMP assay for the detection of ZIKV in mosquito samples [

We evaluated the analytical specificity with seven arboviruses circulating in Brazil, including ZIKV (PE-243), DENV-1 (PE/97-42735), DENV 2 (PE/95-3808), DENV 3 (PE/02-95016), DENV 4 (PE/10-0081), YFV (17DD), and CHIKV (PE2016-480). The study shows that RT-LAMP is very specific for ZIKV detection [
