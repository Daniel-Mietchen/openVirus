<p>LAMP is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method that generally employs a set of four or six different primers, which specifically bind to complementary sequences on the molecular target (

Primer sets for the LAMP assay include the forward outer primer (F3), the backward outer primer (B3), the forward inner primer (FIP), the backward inner primer (BIP), and two other primers designed to accelerate the amplification, including the forward loop primer (LF) and the backward loop primer (LB). With the primers in hand, the LAMP assay can be performed with simple and readily available incubation sources like a water bath or heating block for isothermal heating [
