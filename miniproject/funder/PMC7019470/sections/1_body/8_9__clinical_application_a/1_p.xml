<p>The current ZIKV epidemic has highlighted key limitations for the POC diagnosis of ZIKV and remains a significant unmet need in low-resource countries. With the fact that ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV cause similar symptoms and co-circulate in many regions of the world, definitive clinical diagnosis is not possible. Although there are reliable laboratory diagnostic methods for ZIKV infection, there remains a need for lower-cost diagnostic platforms that can be performed in the field and overcomes the drawbacks of the gold-standard RT-qPCR assay. LAMP has proven to be a rapid, easy, accurate, and inexpensive platform for ZIKV diagnostics, especially in remote areas and developing countries which have been heavily affected by this devastating pathogen.</p>
