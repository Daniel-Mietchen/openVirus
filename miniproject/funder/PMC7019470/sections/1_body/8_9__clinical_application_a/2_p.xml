<p>One-step LAMP platforms using enzymes with both reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase activities, such as Bst DNA Polymerase 3.0 or OmniAmp polymerase are more attractive due to convenience to set up the reactions and less handling of samples, thereby reducing pipetting errors and the risk of contamination. Moreover, protocols that do not required sample pre-treatment or RNA extraction combined with straightforward visualization of results are ideal for POC applications, especially in low-resource settings.</p>
