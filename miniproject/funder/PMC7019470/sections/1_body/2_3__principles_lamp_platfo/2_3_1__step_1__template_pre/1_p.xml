<p>The LAMP assay can be performed using either a one-step or two-step protocol directly from sample matrices, including serum, semen, urine, saliva, and mosquitoes homogenate. The use of Bst 2.0 polymerase, Bst 3.0 polymerase or OmniAmp polymerase enables the test to be performed in a one-step protocol [

These enzymes have both reverse transcriptase (RT) and DNA polymerase activities at a fixed temperature (50–72 °C), and so can be run isothermally for the direct detection of RNA or DNA targets. It is the robust nature of these enzymes, which are capable of maintaining their activities even in the presence of reaction inhibitors, that enables the assay to be performed in the field without the need to extract the genetic material from the samples [
