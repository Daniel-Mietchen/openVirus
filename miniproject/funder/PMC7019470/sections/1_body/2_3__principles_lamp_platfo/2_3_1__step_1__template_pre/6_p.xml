<p>In another study, Yaren et al. (2017) reported a multiplexed system based on RT-LAMP capable of detecting ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV in human samples and mosquito homogenate [

In contrast, for reactions using mosquito samples, it was necessary to treat samples with ammonia and ethanol before applying them to the LAMP reaction mixture [
