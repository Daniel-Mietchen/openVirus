<p>Similar to the Bst DNA polymerase 2.0, Bst DNA polymerase 3.0 is an in vitro derivative of 
 <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> Bst DNA polymerase and features further improved amplification reaction properties compared to Bst 2.0. The enzyme has been successfully used for rapid ZIKV detection in both human and mosquito samples [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Bst DNA polymerase 3.0 exhibits DNA polymerase activity 5′-3′ with either DNA or RNA targets, strong strand displacement activity, improved RT activity compared to Bst DNA polymerase 2.0 and lacks both 5′-3′ and 3′-5′ exonuclease activity. Importantly, Bst DNA polymerase 3.0 displays robust performance even in high concentrations of reaction inhibitors, which has enabled LAMP applications for the ZIKV even without sample pre-treatment or RNA extraction [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. These advantages make Bst DNA polymerase 3.0 an excellent candidate for POC platforms and the rapid detection of ZIKV and other pathogens. OmniAmp is an alternate engineered DNA polymerase, derived from PyroPhage 3173, that has shown strong RT activity and excellent performance in LAMP assays but has yet to be exploited for ZIKV detection [
