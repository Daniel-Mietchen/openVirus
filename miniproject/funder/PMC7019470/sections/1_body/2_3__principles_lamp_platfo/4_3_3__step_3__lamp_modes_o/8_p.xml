<p>AC susceptometry has also been used as a LAMP readout to detect synthetic ZIKV oligonucleotides [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The system contains streptavidin-magnetic nanoparticles (streptavidin-MNPs) premixed with LAMP reagents, including the analyte and biotinylated primers. LAMP results are then measured by a portable AC susceptometer, where the changes of the hydrodynamic volume are probed as Brownian relaxation frequency shifts, which can be used for the quantification of ZIKV. The authors evaluated the analytical sensitivity and showed that LAMP was able to recognize 1 attomolar (aM: 10
 <sup>âˆ’18</sup> moles per liter) synthetic ZIKV oligonucleotide in 20% serum within 27 min and also reported no cross-reactivity with other viruses, including four types of synthetic NS5 genes from relevant arboviruses, YFV, DENV, WNV, and JEV [
