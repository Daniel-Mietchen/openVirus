<p>In another study, the authors combined the Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase-based RT-LAMP with an LFA to detect ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This LFA LAMP platform contains an absorbent pad, a test line, a conjugate pad, and a buffer loading pad. Antidigoxigenin and biotin were also affixed at the control line and test line, respectively, and streptavidin-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were accrued in the conjugate pad. After 30 min of RT-LAMP assay at 72 °C, the resultant products of the assay were rapidly and simply analyzed using 1 µL of the reaction by the LFA test in less than 5 min with a total assay time of 35 min. Taken together, the research we have summarized suggests that the RT-LAMP assay, in combination with any one of these modes of diagnostic reporting, provides a powerful strategy for the development of POC tools for the rapid diagnosis of ZIKV, and, moreover, this system holds great promise for the POC diagnosis of the many other pathogens.
