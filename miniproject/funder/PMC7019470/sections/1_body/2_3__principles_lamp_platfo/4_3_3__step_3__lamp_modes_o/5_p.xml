<p>Coupling the LAMP assay to real-time fluorescence has been used for detection of ZIKV in several applications, including from patient and mosquito samples [

Although it is a useful strategy, real-time fluorescence monitoring requires costly instrumentation that is incompatible with use in remote and low-resource areas where containment and surveillance are critically required. Moreover, some studies reported the use of ZIKV probes in the LAMP reaction, which limits the application in low-resource countries due to the high cost and the need for expensive equipment for data acquisition and analysis of results [
