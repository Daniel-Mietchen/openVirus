<p>LAMP-based assays have also started to pair with portable companion hardware like the smartphone for reading ZIKV assay results [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Using this approach, Ganguli et al. (2017) developed a microfluidic platform using an RT-LAMP smartphone-enabled assay for simultaneous detection of ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV from whole blood samples. They showed that this system was specific and sensitive for the detection of ZIKV, including the ability to quantitatively measure the target genetic material from samples [

A similar RT-LAMP assay paired a microfluidic chip with smartphone-based measurement to simultaneously detect ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV in blood, urine, and saliva. They used a system involving RT-LAMP reaction coupled with another technology using quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters (QUASR), which offers bright signals, multiplexing capabilities, and reduces the detection of false-positives to analyze fluorescence, and the results can be analyzed by fluorescence intensity or by the naked eye [
