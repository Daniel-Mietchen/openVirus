<p>Turbidity offers an alternate approach to tracking LAMP-based detection. Using a turbidimeter or an absorbance-based (650 nm) plate reader, the optical density of LAMP reactions can be monitored for a white precipitation that is caused by the generation of magnesium pyrophosphate, Mg

 <sub>7</sub> (product generated during LAMP). Recently, turbidity-based LAMP was used to detect the presence of ZIKV in serum samples [
