<p>As mentioned, calcein has also been used to visualize LAMP products in assays for the detection of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00019" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Calcein dye is a metal ion binding fluorophore, which can be added prior to incubation, where it forms a complex with magnesium (Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> obtained from LAMP reaction). Here the positive generation of LAMP products leads to a change in color from orange to green, which can be visualized by eye under natural light or UV irradiation. ZIKV-negative samples are indicated by an orange color, whereas ZIKV-positive samples are indicated by a green color. More recently, several research groups have reported the use of other dyes for end-point reads of LAMP assays, with potential applications for ZIKV. These include malachite green dye [
