<p>Neves et al. (2019) developed a simple system based on an RT-LAMP assay using Bst DNA polymerase 3.0 without RNA extraction or sample pre-treatment [

Evaluating four reaction durations (5, 10, 15, and 20 min), they found that 10-min incubations were sufficient to detect ZIKV from serum samples, whereas 20-min incubations resulted in false-positive amplifications in non-template control (NTC) using water [
