<p>With the fundamentals of LAMP established, we now turn our attention to the practical aspects of designing and running reactions. Most LAMP reactions are carried out in plastic microtubes using a mixture of a buffer, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> ions, enzyme, dNTP, which are generally supplied as part of the kit. This is combined with custom primers and the sample of interest that may contain the target genome. The design of ZIKV primers begins with performing multiple alignments of ZIKV and other arbovirus sequences to identify unique and conserved regions within the ZIKV genome that do not share homology with the related flaviviruses. After choosing the target region, the design of LAMP primers can be carried out using online software such as PrimerExplorer (

LAMP primers for ZIKV have been successfully designed to target the genes encoding NS1, NS2A, NS4A, NS5, the capsid and envelope proteins of the ZIKV genome [
