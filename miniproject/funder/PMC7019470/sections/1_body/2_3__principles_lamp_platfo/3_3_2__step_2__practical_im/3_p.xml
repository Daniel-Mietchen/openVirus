<p>These parameters have recently been explored by Lee et al. (2016) in their work that optimized RT-LAMP for a ZIKV lateral flow assay (LFA) using Bst 3.0 DNA polymerase [

 <sup>2+</sup>, dNTP, and the reaction time could provide detection of the ZIKV RNA in 30 min without non-target amplification. In a similar work, Kaarj et al. (2018) optimized an RT-LAMP assay combined with a paper microfluidic chip and smartphone to detect ZIKV in only 15 min. Varying only reaction temperature, they found that no amplification occurred at 70 °C, while non-specific amplification in non-template control (NTC) occurred at the sub-optimal temperature of 65 °C, which, as mentioned above, is known to allow off-target amplification. However, by placing the reaction at 68 °C, the target template was successfully amplified from samples without false positives [
