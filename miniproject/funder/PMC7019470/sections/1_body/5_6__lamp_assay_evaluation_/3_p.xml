<p>In another study, Calvert et al. (2017) evaluated of the ZIKV RT-LAMP assay with 178 clinical samples, including 94 serum and 84 urine specimens. The study found the assay to have a sensitivity of 54.5% (95% CI 45.2%–63.5%), specificity of 94.1% (95% CI 85.8%–97.7%), likelihood ratio positive of 9.3% (95% CI 3.8%–23.9%), likelihood ratio negative of 0.5 (95% CI 0.4%–0.6%) and accuracy of 69.7 (95% CI 62.6%–75.9%) for detection of ZIKV relative to RT-qPCR for diagnosis of ZIKV infection. The positive and negative predictive values were calculated based on pre-test probability resulting in approximately 30% for both predictive values [
