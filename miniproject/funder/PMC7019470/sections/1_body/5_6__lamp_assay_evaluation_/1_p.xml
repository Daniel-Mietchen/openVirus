<p>The suitability of LAMP assays for ZIKV detection in clinical samples has been evaluated in several studies using approximately 800 selected samples from patients with suspected arboviruses infection in Brazil, Nicaragua, and the USA [

The comparative analysis of the ZIKV LAMP assays with RT-qPCR was based on several statistical parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratio positive, likelihood ratio negative, and overall accuracy [
