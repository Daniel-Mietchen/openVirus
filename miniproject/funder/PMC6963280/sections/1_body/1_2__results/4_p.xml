<p>Immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated the presence of DENV NS3 protein in macrophages and mesangial cells in the renal glomerulus (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Compared to the case control, there was an increase in the CD68 cellular infiltration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F) and CD8+ T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f003">Figure 3</xref>H,I) in the cortical and medullary regions. There was also an increase of TNF-α in the peritubular mononuclear cells infiltrate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f003">Figure 3</xref>K), an increase of macrophages expressing Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the capillary peritubular region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f003">Figure 3</xref>L), and an increase in Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF/R2) expression in peritubular macrophages in the medullary region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00223-f003">Figure 3</xref>M). DENV NS3 and CD68+ double-stained cells were also observed (
