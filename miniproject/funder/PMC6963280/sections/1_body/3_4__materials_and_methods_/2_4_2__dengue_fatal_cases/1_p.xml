<p>Young adults (20â€“33 years old) fatal cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4), were investigated as dengue-suspected cases during epidemics occurring in 2012 and 2013 in Brazil. All cases died within 3 to 4 days after the fever onset and no comorbidity was reported. All cases were confirmed as dengue by a positive result on the tissue by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR that confirmed DENV-4 as the infecting serotype.
