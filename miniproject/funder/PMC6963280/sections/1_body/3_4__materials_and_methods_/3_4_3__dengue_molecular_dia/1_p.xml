<p>Kidney tissues samples from necropsy were paraffin-embedded, fixed in 10% formalin, cut (4 µm), deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated with alcohol, as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For the paraffin-embedded viral RNA extraction, three 5 μm slices of each fragment were used and submitted separately to the PureLink FFPE RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for DENV identification and serotyping was performed as described by Lanciotti et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. DENV-4 quantification was performed by real-time RT-PCR technique described by Johnson et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] using a Taqman quantitative Real Time RT-PCR system. Kidney tissues sections (5 mm thick) were treated with different stains (hematoxylin–eosin, Masson’s trichrome, or PAS). After staining, sections were examined and visualized by light microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and digital images were obtained using Image Pro Plus software version 4.5. Four types of damage were considered for quantification: tubular degeneration in the cortical region, medullary tubular necrosis, infiltrates, and vascular congestion in the medullary region. Tissue damages were quantified and qualified in each of the 15 images as 0—absent, 1—light and focal, 2—light, 3—moderate, and 4—diffuse. To analyze differences in the number of damage counts between fatal and non-fatal cases, we used generalized linear models (GLM) and we built a different model for each tissue region/type of alteration. Differences between fatal and non-fatal cases were reported as 
 <italic>p</italic>-values. This analysis was performed using the

 <xref rid="B51-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For immunoperoxidase assay, antigen retrieval was performed by heating the tissue in the presence of EnVision Flex target retrieval solution high pH (Dako, CA, USA) or citrate buffer. Tissues were blocked for endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxidase in methanol and rinsed in Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). To reduce non-specific binding, sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-DENV NS3 recombinant antibody [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], mouse anti-human CD8 Clone C8/144B (Dako, CA, USA), macrophage antibody CD68 clone EBM11 (Dako, CA, USA), anti-MCP 1 monoclonal antibody (Novus Biologicals, CO, USA), anti-TNF alpha antibody, Clone ab6671 (Abcam, MA, USA), Rb anti-FLK-1, and VEGF/R2 (Spring Bioscience, CA, USA). On the next day, the sections were incubated with REVEAL COMPLEMENT secondary antibody (Spring Bioscience, CA, USA) for 10 min, and a REVEAL-HRP secondary antibody conjugate (Spring Bioscience, CA, USA) for 15 min at room temperature. Reaction was revealed with diaminobenzidine (Spring Bioscience, CA, USA) as chromogen and sections were counterstained on Harris hematoxylin (Dako, CA, USA). For immunofluorescence and CD68/NS3 co-staining, the paraffin-embedded tissues were cut at 4 μm and the slides were stained overnight at 4 °C with anti-DENV NS3 recombinant antibody [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00223" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and anti-human monoclonal CD68 (Dako, CA, USA). Sections were incubated with Alexa 488 conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 555, or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 555 (ThermoFisher, USA) and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
