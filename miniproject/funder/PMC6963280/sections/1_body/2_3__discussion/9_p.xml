<p>An inflammatory environment with mononuclear cells in several sites in the renal tissue was observed in this study. The evaluation of the immune response in the renal and medullary cortex showed increased detection of macrophages (CD68+) and CD8+ T cells in the peritubular space and around vessels in the medullary. CD68+ cells showed their co-expression with the DENV NS3 protein, confirming the participation of those cells during DENV-4 infection in renal tissue. In addition, the migration of CD68+ and CD8+ T cells could indicate those cells playing a role in the cytotoxic response in such lesions as a way to contain viral infection, leading to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [

Furthermore, it may be suggested that the renal tissue injuries observed here may have been due to the combination of both high viral load identified in those tissues and the exacerbated host immune response.
