<p>A diverse number of genetic clustering methods have been developed and applied for a broad range of bacteria and viruses including

 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], HIV [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], hepatitis C virus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Ebola virus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These clustering methods are nonparametric because the clustering criteria are based on empirical distributions, making no specific assumptions about the underlying biological processes. For instance, pairwise methods build up clusters from pairs of sequences with a genetic distance below a predefined threshold [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Subtree methods define clusters relative to the common ancestors of sequences in the phylogenetic tree, based on quantities such as the mean branch length among the descendants of the ancestral node [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nonparametric methods tend to be intuitive and relatively easy to compute. We have previously observed, however, that current nonparametric clustering methods seem relatively insensitive to variation in rates of transmission [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Instead, these methods tend to detect variation in rates of sampling, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., the delay between infection and diagnosis.
