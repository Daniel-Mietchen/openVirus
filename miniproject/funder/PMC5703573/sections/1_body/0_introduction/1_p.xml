<p>Genetic clustering is a class of methods for reducing large sequence data sets down to groups of closely-related sequences. In the context of infectious diseases, clusters may identify infections related by a common source [

Additionally, genetic clusters may represent locally elevated rates of transmission, particularly when we expect a measurable number of genetic differences to accumulate within a host between transmission events. Because genetic sequencing is increasingly a fixture of the clinical management of infections, there is growing interest in making secondary use of the resulting databases as a cost-effective resource for guiding public health responses in near real time [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The general motivation is that if genetic clusters define groups with higher rates of transmission, then they may facilitate a more cost-effective deployment of prevention services.
