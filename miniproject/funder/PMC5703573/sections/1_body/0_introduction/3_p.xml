<p>Here we introduce a fundamentally new approach to genetic clustering for infectious diseases that is based on modelling the evolution of transmission rates along the tree. We demonstrate that our model-based (parametric) clustering method substantially outperforms a variety of nonparametric methods in recovering clusters of rapid transmission in simulated data, and we show that these differences are recapitulated in an analysis of real HIV-1 data.</p>
