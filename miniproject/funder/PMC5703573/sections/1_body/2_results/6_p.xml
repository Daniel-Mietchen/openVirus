<p>Finally, the third simulation scenario combined both faster rates of sampling and transmission in the minority subpopulation (‘both faster’). The MMPP predictions attained a mean TPR and FPR of 88.7% and 18.5%, respectively. This level of performance was comparable to the subtree clustering and pairwise distance methods (patristic distance and TN93;
