<p>To assess how MMPP computing time scales with the size of the tree, we performed additional experiments on simulated trees with the number of tips varied from 100 to 50,000 tips. These results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s005">S5 Fig</xref>. Our results indicated that the computing time scaled linearly with the size of the tree. For instance, it required about 21.6 minutes on average to process a tree with 50,000 tips. We also observed an apparent ‘phase transition’ in time complexity in the vicinity of about 750 tips (from about 5 to 30 seconds) for the MMPP model with two rate classes. Finally, we repeated these experiments with a 3-rate class MMPP model and obtained similar timings (
