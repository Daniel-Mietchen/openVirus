<p>Based on our simulation analyses, the MMPP method seems to confer greater sensitivity and specificity to detect variation in transmission rates than the five nonparametric methods that we evaluated. These clustering methods are often applied to large sequence databases with thousands or tens of thousands of records [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a growing demand for genetic clusters to be identified rapidly so that this information can be used to inform public health decisions in near real-time [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hence, we evaluated the average computing time required to extract clusters from simulated data sets containing approximately 1000 sequences each; the actual mean number of tips per tree was 983.3 (range 969â€“994). Our results, based on the times required to process five replicate data sets, are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1005868.t001">Table 1</xref>. The most time-consuming method was the patristic distance method because our default approach was to generate distances for 100 nonparametric bootstrap samples of the data [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Accordingly, eliminating the bootstrap sampling reduced the computing time by roughly 100-fold at the cost of sensitivity and specificity. The fastest method was TN93, which does not require reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree from sequence variation. Our MMPP method required substantially more time to compute. However, the half-minute used to process a 1000-tip tree is still an acceptable amount for near real-time monitoring.
