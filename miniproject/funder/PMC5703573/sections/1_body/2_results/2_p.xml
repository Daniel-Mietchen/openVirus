<p>Our main results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005868.g002">Fig 2</xref> with respect to their true and false positive rates on 100 replicate simulations per scenario. In the first scenario, the minority subpopulation had a 3-fold faster per-lineage transmission rate but the same sampling rate as the majority subpopulation (‘faster transmission’). The MMPP method obtained high true positive rates (TPRs) and low false positive rates (FPRs) with means of 84.6% and 9.2%, respectively. We noticed that a small number (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7) of replicates resulted in substantially higher FPRs (&gt; 20%) than the others. In these cases, we determined that the MMPP method had incorrectly assigned the ‘faster transmission’ state to the root of the tree. We subsequently determined that increasing the number of rate classes in the model enabled MMPP to correctly identify clusters with the highest rate class. None of the nonparametric clustering methods obtained comparable TPRs or FPRs under this simulation scenario. For instance, the TN93, patristic and subtree clustering methods obtained a mean TPR of about 60% for an FPR of 30%. In contrast, Cluster Picker and PhyloPart performed poorly under this scenario, yielding cluster assignments with TPR and FPR rates that were comparable to random guessing (
