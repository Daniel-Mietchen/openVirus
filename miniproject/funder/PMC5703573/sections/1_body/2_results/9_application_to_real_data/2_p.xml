<p>The most apparent difference between the nonparametric methods and the MMPP results, which are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005868.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s007">S7 Fig</xref>, was the number of individuals assigned to clusters. Our MMPP model assigned only 78 individuals (150 branches in the tree) to 8 clusters, substantially fewer than the number reported in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Based on the assignment of branches to clusters, MMPP was more concordant with the subtree method (Cohen’s 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.573) than Cluster Picker (
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.101), where 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 1 indicates complete agreement. Within clusters identified by the subtree method but not by MMPP, terminal branch lengths (
 <italic>n</italic> = 92) were significantly shorter (Wilcoxon test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−12</sup>) and internal branch lengths (
 <italic>n</italic> = 64) were no different (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.24) from their respective distributions in the entire tree. Similarly, terminal branches in clusters identified by Cluster Picker and not by MMPP were significantly shorter (
 <italic>n</italic> = 143, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−16</sup>) but not internal branches (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.34); we note the number of branches in the latter comparison was small because the majority of Cluster Picker clusters were dyads. In contrast, internal branches were significantly shorter in MMPP clusters than the rest of the tree (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.84 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>). As noted in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], internal branch lengths can provide approximate upper bound estimates of local transmission rates. These results suggest that many of the nonparametric clusters may be caused by variation in sampling rates, which has been anticipated by mathematical modeling [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, we cannot ascertain the extent of this effect without additional information such as estimated dates of infection.
