<p>We obtained a published data set of 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3102 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences that were collected from a study of HIV-1 genetic clusters in Seattle, U.S. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These data were reduced to one sequence per individual and then filtered for non-recombinant subtype B sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1653, see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). We reconstructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny from these sequences as the primary input for the different clustering methods. First, we discovered that the MMPP method tended to assign faster branching rates throughout the base of the tree, including the root node. A lineages-through-time plot of the tree (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) was consistent with a period of population-level exponential growth in the first half of the tree, which may confound the MMPP model from detecting other sources of branching rate variation over time. Based on our experience with simulated cases where the faster of two rate classes was sometimes incorrectly assigned to the root of the tree, we increased the number of rate classes to 3 and grouped lineages assigned to the fastest rate class as putative clusters. The resulting clusters are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005868.g004">Fig 4</xref>, alongside the clusters predicted by two nonparametric methods (TN93 and subtree clustering). Our MMPP program required 43.6 and 28.7 seconds to analyze the ML tree assuming two and three rate classes, respectively (the slightly faster processing under the 3-rate model was consistent with our timing results for simulations of 1,000-tip trees; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Following the methods described in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we initially generated nonparametric clusters using ClusterPicker with a bootstrap cutoff of 95% and a branch length cutoff of 1.5%. However, these settings yielded only 51 clusters of 118 individuals, substantially less than the reported numbers (72 clusters of 168 individuals [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). This discrepancy was likely caused by minor differences in sequence processing and alignment. We subsequently adjusted the branch length cutoff to 1.8% to obtain 69 clusters of 162 individuals.
