<p>To illustrate the discordant results among these methods, we summarized the cluster assignments for Cluster Picker, subtree clustering and MMPP in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005868.g003">Fig 3</xref>. In this specific example, sequences sampled from the minority subpopulation are concentrated in two groups. Clusters identified by Cluster Picker were uniformly distributed throughout the tree. In contrast, cluster assignments by the subtree clustering method were distributed less evenly, with one subtree cluster coinciding accurately with one of the actual clusters. However, we found that this method was highly sensitive to the choice of mean branch length cutoff. For instance, increasing this cutoff from 0.0065 to 0.008 caused every terminal branch to be assigned to a cluster.
