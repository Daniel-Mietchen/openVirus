<p>We obtained qualitatively similar results (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Relative to the first parameter settings, the transmission rates in both subpopulations were reduced by a factor of 0.15, and the mortality rate of infected individuals was increased to equal the sampling rate in the majority subpopulation. In general, we observed higher FPR associated with the MMPP method for this set of simulations. The mean TPR and FPR of MMPP under the faster transmission scenario were 90.4% and 31.1%, respectively. To our surprise, MMPP was able to correctly identify clusters under the faster sampling scenario (82.3% TPR and 28.8% FPR), unlike the previous set of simulations. This level of performance was comparable to the subtree clustering method. We attribute this difference to the effect of lineage removal due to the elevated mortality of infected individuals [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The elevated sampling rate in the minority subpopulation resulted in more complete sampling of the corresponding subtree, leading to shorter lengths of internal branches. In contrast, infected individuals were seldom removed by mortality before sampling under the previous parameterization of the birth-death model.
