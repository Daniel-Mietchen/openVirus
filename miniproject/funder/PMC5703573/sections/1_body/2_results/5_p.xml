<p>In the second simulation scenario, the rate of sampling was elevated in the minority subpopulation but the transmission rates were held constant (‘faster sampling’). In other words, members of the minority subpopulation were more likely to be diagnosed sooner after infection. Here, true positives meant correctly selecting tips from the subpopulation with elevated sampling rates. Under this scenario the MMPP predictions were no better than a random guess with a mean TPR and FPR of 55.6% and 51.5%, respectively. This outcome was not surprising given that variation in sampling rates was not a target of the model; 
 <italic>e.g</italic>., terminal branch lengths were excluded from maximum likelihood parameter estimation of the MMPP model. The nonparametric methods were far superior, with the best results obtained by the subtree clustering method. At a bootstrap cutoff of 90% and mean branch length cutoff of 0.006, for example, the average TPR and FPR was 78.8% and 11.9%, respectively.
