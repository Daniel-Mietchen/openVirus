<p>Epidemic dynamics were simulated from a structured birth-death model using parameter settings from [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We assumed that one subpopulation was larger than the other with 9000 and 1000 individuals, respectively, and that the epidemic started with a single infected individual in the larger subpopulation. This model was designed to produce genetic clusters when the epidemic moved from the larger subpopulation into the smaller (minority) subpopulation in which rates of transmission and/or sampling were elevated. With replicate trees generated from the model, we simulated the molecular evolution of viruses along the trees, and then produced sequence alignments and tree reconstructions to use as inputs for five different non-parametric methods. In addition, we analyzed these data using our model-based clustering method that is based on a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). Put simply, we assume that each branching event in the tree approximates a transmission event. We next assume that these events occur at a constant rate over time, that this rate can switch between a finite number of rate categories, and that these switches in branching rates also occur at a constant rate over time (
