<p>When interpreting clusters produced under the MMPP model, we assume that the variation in the rates of branching events in the phylogeny is a sufficient approximation of variation in transmission rates over time. This not only assumes that the phylogeny was reconstructed without error, but it also assumes that branching events roughly correspond to transmission events. In general, nonparametric clustering methods that utilize trees require similar assumptions. There are several reasons why transmission events are likely to map to locations of the virus phylogeny other than the branching points, such as incomplete lineage sorting within hosts [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Another issue that is unique to model-based clustering is the problem of model misspecification. The present MMPP model assumes that rates of transition between branching rates are constant over time. For instance, fitting the MMPP model with two rate classes to the actual HIV-1 data set resulted in a majority of branches assigned to the faster rate class, including the root of the tree. This was likely caused by an early period of exponential growth in the epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), which induces lineage-independent variation in branching rates over time. Furthermore, the spread of an epidemic through a socially and spatially-structured host population is problematic for the MMPP model, which assumes that the evolution of branching rates is a memoryless process (
