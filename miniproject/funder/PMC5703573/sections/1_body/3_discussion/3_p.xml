<p>Genetic clustering can be an important resource for retrospective epidemiological investigations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and may eventually play a central role in the near-real time monitoring and prediction of infectious disease outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the growing popularity of applying genetic clustering to detect outbreaks of transmission needs to be tempered with greater skepticism about the underlying methods [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our model simulations represent a highly simplified hypothetical scenario where many clustering methods could potentially misdirect public health efforts away from groups suffering from higher rates of transmission, and towards groups where new infections were diagnosed sooner than the population average. Although ‘all models are wrong’, these simulations are instructive because they clarify the respective contributions of variation in sampling and transmission rates to genetic clustering. Furthermore, our results are transferrable to applications of genetic clustering to other infectious diseases where genetic differences can accumulate in the period between infection and sampling. For example, whole-genome clustering analysis is becoming an important resource for tracking outbreaks of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which can remain latent for years after infection until reactivation. Hepatitis C virus infections also remain asymptomatic for years after transmission with rapid within-host evolution, and genetic clustering may be confounded with sampling rates [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As we have shown with our analysis of the MMPP method, bringing new approaches to these clustering problems may provide a more complete picture, in combination with current methods, about the recent histories of infectious disease epidemics.
