<p>Here we have formulated and tested a model-based (parametric) method for clustering genetic sequences that have been sampled from an infectious disease epidemic. A potential advantage of a model-based approach is that we can focus on the parameter of interestâ€”namely, the variation in transmission rates over time that may be an indicator of outbreaks. Our approach is conceptually similar to the lineages-over-time model proposed by Holmes and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, we assume that branching rates evolve along branches of the tree as the epidemic spreads from one risk group to another, such that discordant rates may occur on contemporaneous branches on different parts of the tree. The MMPP model is also closely related to models of biological speciation where rates of speciation are determined by a single evolving character state,

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Specifically, our model can be interpreted as a special case of the multitype speciation-extinction model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] where extinction events are censored from the model. Our simulation results indicate that the interpretation of MMPP clusters with respect to sampling rates is dependent on the probability that a genetic sequence of the pathogen is sampled from an infected individual before their death. If most infected individuals are eventually sampled, then we predict that MMPP clusters will predominantly be determined by variation in transmission rates. However, if a substantial fraction of infected individuals are never sampled before their death and this varies among groups, then the MMPP clusters may be caused by variation in either rates of transmission or sampling. Nevertheless, we submit that this potential confounding is preferable to being unable to detect clusters of transmission at all (
