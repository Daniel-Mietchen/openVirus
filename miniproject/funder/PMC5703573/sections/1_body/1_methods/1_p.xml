<p>As in previous work [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we assume that the phylogenetic tree reconstructed from the genetic variation among sampled infections is similar in shape to the underlying transmission tree [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, we assume that a branching point in the tree roughly approximates a transmission event, which is also an implicit assumption of nonparametric clustering methods using trees, where subtree clusters are interpreted as ‘hotspots’ of rapid transmission. We model branching rates as a discrete character state that evolves along a phylogeny according to a continuous-time Markov chain [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Further, we assume the branching events in the phylogeny are generated according to a Poisson process whose rate is controlled by the evolving character. Under this model, the branch lengths of the phylogeny are not independent of the character state, as typically assumed when modeling the evolution of nucleotides or amino acids.
