<p>To compare these clustering methods on an actual data set, we obtained 3102 published partial HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences that were previously collected in Seattle, USA, and analyzed for clusters of transmission [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We reduced the data down to a single sequence per patient (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1653) by excluding sequence records that were annotated as an additional isolate (suffixed with an underscore and integer). Next, we removed codons associated with drug resistance mutations according to the surveillance list published by Shafer and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], using pairwise alignment of each sequence against the HXB2 
 <italic>pol</italic> reference to locate the respective codons. This step also trimmed sequence intervals that did not align to the reference. Aligned sequences that were shorter than 100 nucleotides (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22) were filtered out at this stage. We used SCUEAL [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to predict HIV subtypes from the sequence data (maximum three recombination breakpoints) and screened for sequences categorized as subtype B excluding intra- and inter-subtype recombinants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1653). A multiple sequence alignment was generated from these data using MAFFT (version 7.305b) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We reconstructed a neighbor-joining tree from this alignment with RapidNJ [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and a maximum likelihood tree with FastTree2 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Finally, we applied the different clustering methods using these trees and, if necessary, the sequence alignment as inputs.
