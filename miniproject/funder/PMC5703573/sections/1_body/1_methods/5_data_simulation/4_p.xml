<p>Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed from the multiple sequence alignments using approximate maximum likelihood (FastTree2, version 2.1.10) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or neighbor-joining (RapidNJ, version 2.3.2) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The alignments and reconstructed trees were used as inputs for five published non-parametric clustering methods—HIV-TRACE (TN93) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], PhyloPart [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], Cluster Picker [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], subtree clustering [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], patristic distance on bootstrapped alignments [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]—and our MMPP method. Because our method requires a rooted bifurcating tree, we randomly resolved polytomies using the 
 <italic>multi2di</italic> function in the R package 
 <italic>ape</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and used midpoint rooting with R package 
 <italic>phangorn</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
