<p>In our preliminary study [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the parameters of the model were manually adjusted until it yielded tree simulations that resembled the typical ‘star-like’ shape of HIV-1 molecular phylogenies (long terminal branches). For instance, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s001">S1 Fig</xref> compares the distributions of internal and terminal branch lengths, normalized by the mean branch length, for an HIV-1 phylogeny reconstructed from actual data (see next section) and a tree simulated under this set of model parameters. We also ran a second set of simulations under different parameters to evaluate the sensitivity of our results to these settings. Specifically, we reduced the baseline (majority) transmission rate from 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 7.5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> and reduced the sampling fraction 
 <italic>ψ</italic>/(
 <italic>ψ</italic> + 
 <italic>μ</italic>)—the probability that an infected individual was sampled before death—from 0.98 to 0.5 to reflect the parameter settings used in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We note that this sampling fraction is very different from the sampled proportion of the infected population, since the former does not include unsampled and surviving infected individuals. Unlike [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we increased the baseline sampling rate from 
 <italic>ψ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 0.15 to 1.0 so that the latter sampled proportion increased from less than 10% to about 40%. When 
 <italic>ψ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 0.15, the prevalence tended to exceed 90% at the simulation end-point where the target number of tips (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2000) was obtained. The parameter settings used in the two sets of simulations are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s009">S1 Table</xref>. For each scenario, we discarded a small number of replicates where the epidemic failed to spread and ran additional simulations until 100 replicates were obtained.
