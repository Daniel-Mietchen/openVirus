<p>Sequence evolution was simulated on each tree using INDELible (version 1.03) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with modifications to allow the user to specify the ancestral nucleotide sequence at the root. We initialized our simulations with the HXB2 
 <italic>pol</italic> reference sequence (Genbank accession K03455.1) at the root of each simulated tree. As previously described [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the simulation parameters were calibrated to an actual alignment of HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences. Specifically, we used the M3 codon model with a transition rate bias 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 8.0 and rate variation according to a gamma distribution (shape 
 <italic>α</italic> = 1.5, rate 
 <italic>β</italic> = 3) that we partitioned into 50 rate categories; a Lavalette distribution (LAV) indel model with 
 <italic>a</italic> = 1.5, 
 <italic>M</italic> = 4 and rate 0.001; and a scaling factor of 15.
