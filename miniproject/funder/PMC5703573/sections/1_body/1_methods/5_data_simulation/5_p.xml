<p>To measure the performance of each method, we calculated the false and true positive rates for a range of threshold parameter settings for each method, where a ‘positive’ prediction is the assignment of a sampled sequence to a cluster. For TN93 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we varied the genetic distance cutoff at all observed values. For Cluster Picker [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we fixed the bootstrap threshold to 0.9 and varied the distance cutoff from 0.005 to 0.1. Similarly, we varied the maximum distance from 0.005 to 0.0125 in PhyloPart [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We implemented a subtree clustering method with Biopython [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], where we screened internal nodes for a bootstrap threshold of 0.9 and varied the mean branch length cutoff from 0.002 to 0.2. Lastly for the bootstrapped patristic method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we varied the cutoff from 0.004 to 0.05 for a minimum of 80% of bootstrap replicates.
