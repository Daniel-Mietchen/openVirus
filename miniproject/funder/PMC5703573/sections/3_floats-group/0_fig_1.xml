  <title>Schematic diagram of a model-based genetic clustering method.</title>
  <p>The rate of branching events (approximating transmission events) evolves according to a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP). (A) A lineage switches between two states (fast and slow) that control the rates that branching events occur. (B) When rate shifts are mapped to the tree, we can identify clusters of high transmission rates (red).</p>
