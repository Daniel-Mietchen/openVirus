  <title>Comparison of predicted clusters and actual clusters of faster transmission.</title>
  <p>We mapped the clustering predictions from three different methods (Cluster Picker, subtree clustering and MMPP) onto one of the neighbor-joining trees reconstructed from sequence data simulated under the faster-transmission scenario. Branches are coloured light red if the method assigns that branch to a cluster, and dark blue otherwise. The correct assignments are indicated by labeling tips with filled circles if they belong in a cluster. Cluster Picker (version 1.2.4) was run with default initial and main support thresholds (0.9) and a genetic distance threshold of 0.025. Subtree clusters were extracted from the tree with a bootstrap threshold of 90% and mean branch length threshold of 0.0065.</p>
