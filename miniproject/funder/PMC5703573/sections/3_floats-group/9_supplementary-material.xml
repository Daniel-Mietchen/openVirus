  <title>Computing times required for our MMPP program to process trees with varying numbers of tips.</title>
  <p>Log-transformed computing times (
   <italic>y</italic>-axis) required for our MMPP program to process trees with varying numbers of tips. For each number of tips (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis), we simulated 10 replicate trees under the ‘faster transmission’ model. Each point represents a replicate simulation, labeled and coloured to indicate that 2 (blue) or 3 (red) rate classes were used in the model. The number of tips was varied along the following sequence: {100, 200, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000}. We used a random ‘jitter’ factor (∼ Unif(0.8, 1.2)) to separate points with respect to the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis for clarity. Our simulation experiments were concentrated in the interval between 500 and 1000 tips, where we determined that some transition in time complexity occurs. A dashed line represents a linear model fit to the computing times for 
   <italic>n</italic> &gt; 800 with two rate classes. All runs were executed on an Intel Xeon E5-1650v4 processor.
