  <title>Parameter values used for birth-death SIR model simulations.</title>
  <p>When present, the subscript indicates that the parameter is associated with the majority (
   <italic>N</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> = 9000) or minority (
   <italic>N</italic>
   <sub>1</sub> = 1000) subpopulation. We generated trees under two different sets of parameters, each comprising three scenarios (faster transmission, faster sampling, and both faster rates in the minority subpopulation). The first parameter set was adjusted until the model produced trees with the characteristic star-like shape of HIV-1 among-host phylogenies [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The second parameter set was derived from [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; however, we increased the sampling rates relative to that study, so that the target sample size (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1000) could be obtained before every individual in the population had become infected.
