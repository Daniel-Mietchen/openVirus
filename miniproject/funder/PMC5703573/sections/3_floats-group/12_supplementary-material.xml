  <title>Evaluating the effect of autocorrelated continuous rate variation.</title>
  <p>To quantify the impact of autocorrelation in branching rates on model-based clustering, we generated simulations where internal branch lengths were adjusted on a continuous scale by an evolving factor. (
   <italic>left</italic>) False positive rates under an unstructured (negative control) birth-death model. The 2-rate class MMPP model applied to simulated trees where branching rates were varied using the 
   <italic>simulate.autocor.kishino</italic> function in R package NELSI [
