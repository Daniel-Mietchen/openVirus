  <title>Distribution of ML estimates of the ratio of branching rates for the two-class MMPP model.</title>
  <p>Each curve represents a kernel density summarizing the distribution of ratio estimates obtained from 100 replicate simulations for trees with 
   <italic>n</italic> tips each, where 
   <italic>n</italic> was varied from 100 to 1000 (see legend). Each simulation was generated from a transmission tree simulated under a birth-death in MASTER, on which sequences were simulated under a codon substitution model with INDELible and then used to reconstruct a phylogeny with rapidNJ. The true branching rate ratio is 3.0, as indicated by the dashed line.
