  <title>Performance of MMPP and five nonparametric clustering methods on simulated data with an alternate parameterization of the model (Set 2, see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005868.s009">S1 Table</xref>).
  </title>
  <p>Sequence data were simulated under three scenarios where the minority subpopulation had (1) a faster transmission rate (left); (2) a faster sampling rate (centre), or; (3) both faster rates of transmission and sampling (right). The 
   <italic>x</italic>- and 
   <italic>y</italic>-axes correspond to the false and true positive rates of classifying individuals into the minority subpopulation, respectively. Each point represents the outcome when the MMPP model was applied to one of 100 replicate simulations. Each line represents the receiver-operator characteristic curve for one of the five nonparametric clustering methods (see figure legend), where different false and true positive rates were obtained by varying a threshold parameter of the method. Note that transmission rates in the minority subpopulation were only elevated by two-fold in this parameterization, in contrast to a three-fold increase in the first parameterizationâ€”this may partly explain an increase in false positive rates.
