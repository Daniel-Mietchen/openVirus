  <title>Comparison of three different clustering methods applied to a phylogeny reconstructed from real HIV data.</title>
  <p>The phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihood from a published data set of HIV-1 subtype B 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequences from a recent study of genetic clusters in Seattle, U.S. [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005868.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We adjusted the ClusterPicker and subtree clustering method parameters until the number of individuals assigned to clusters was similar to the number reported in the original study. For instance, the subtree method was used with a mean branch length cutoff of 0.65% and a bootstrap cutoff of 90%. Branches assigned to clusters are highlighted in dark red.
