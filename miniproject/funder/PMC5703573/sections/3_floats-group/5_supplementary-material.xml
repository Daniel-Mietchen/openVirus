  <title>Comparison of internal and terminal branch lengths in simulated and real HIV-1 phylogenies.</title>
  <p>Histograms summarizing the internal (red) and terminal (blue) branch lengths in phylogenies derived from a real HIV-1 data set (top) and from data simulated under our first parameterization of the birth-death model. Each distribution was normalized by the mean branch length of the respective tree.</p>
