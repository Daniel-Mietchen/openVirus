  <title>Performance of MMPP and nonparametric clustering methods on simulated data with an extreme disparity in transmission rates.</title>
  <p>Data were simulated under the Set 1 parameterization of the birth-death model, except that the ratio of transmission rates between subpopulations was elevated from 3- to 10-fold. The 
   <italic>x</italic>- and 
   <italic>y</italic>-axes correspond to the false (FPR) and true positive rates (TPR) of classifying individuals into the minority subpopulation, respectively. Each point represents the outcome when the MMPP model was applied to one of 100 replicate simulations. The mean TPR and FPR for MMPP were 93% and 7.3%, respectively. We observed that the MMPP no longer suffered from a higher FPR in any replicates, which implies that the greater rate disparity prevented the MMPP model from incorrectly assigning the higher rate class at the root of the tree. Each line represents the receiver-operator characteristic curve for each of the nonparametric clustering methods (see figure legend). The nonparametric results were very similar to those obtained under a 3-fold rate disparity in transmission rates (
