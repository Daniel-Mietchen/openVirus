<p>Diurnal temperature range is known to affect the competence of dengue vector 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> using relative 
 <italic>VC</italic> (
 <italic>rVC</italic>) has shown a great difference comparing without DTR (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>), especially in the cold to temperate climate zones in Northern hemisphere. This is because 
 <italic>rVC</italic> (
 <italic>VC</italic>) depends on DTR strongly, both the peak intensity and the position. When DTR increases from 0 °C to 20 °C, the peak height of 
 <italic>rVC</italic> reduced from 1.37 to 0.47 day
 <sup>− 1</sup>; the peak position of 
 <italic>VC</italic> reduces from 29 °C to 20 °C. Therefore, in models including DTR, temperate climate zones with larger DTR will have greater DEP, while tropical areas with less DTR will have lesser DEP than estimated by models using mean temperature alone. This is particularly relevant to Europe, where DTR is greater than tropical areas.
