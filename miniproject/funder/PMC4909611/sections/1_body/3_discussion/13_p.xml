<p>Third, for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, only two parameters with temperature dependent relations were available in the literature (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Delatte et al., 2009</xref>). The remaining parameters were assumed to have the same temperature dependent relationships as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, although they were adjusted to the level of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> based on a literature review (
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2010</xref>). This would limit the accuracy of the estimated value of DEP for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. See Supplementary information (Section S4) for more discussion.
