<p>The limitations of this study are mainly the assumptions made and parameters/data used for estimating the DEP through 
 <italic>VC</italic>. First, we assumed that the female vector-to-human population ratio (
 <italic>m</italic>) depends on temperature only. This is not exactly true in reality because vector populations change with the season due to climate including rainfall, vector ecology and control, etc. (

 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hales et al., 1996</xref>) The reason for making this assumption is that neither reliable data nor their temperature and rainfall dependent relationships are available. In addition, rainfall is known to affect the under-water stages of vector development (

 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2013</xref>). Once a vector population is established and abundant, temperature is the main climatic driver for dengue transmission and is included as the only climate variable in other mathematical modeling studies as well (

 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Tran et al., 2013</xref>). To compensate for the assumption made in our model, we performed sensitivity analysis of 
 <italic>VC</italic> to 
 <italic>m</italic>
