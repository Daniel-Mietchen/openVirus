 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is already widely spread in much of Southern Europe, especially in the Mediterranean areas (

 <italic>VC</italic> of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (

 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(b)) had similar seasonal windows but with lower intensity such that only Southern European cities could currently have dengue epidemics. The main reason for the absence of dengue outbreaks in these cities could be one or all of the following factors: 1) Insufficient adult vector populations that are actively biting humans for an extended period to sustain a dengue outbreak (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> bites humans and animals (

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Delatte et al., 2010</xref>)); 2) Insufficient infected humans with dengue for an extended period that could infect sufficient number of vectors to sustain a dengue outbreak (infected humans traveling back from dengue endemic areas are presumably isolated indoors or may have recovered before they traveled home); 3) 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is a less efficient vector for dengue transmission than what we estimated. We may have overestimated the 
 <italic>VC</italic> for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> due to limitations in temperature dependent data and studies (
