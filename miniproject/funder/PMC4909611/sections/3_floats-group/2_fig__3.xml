  <p>Season stratified maps of 
   <italic>VC</italic> for Europe of the last decade of this century (2090–2099) under the greenhouse gas emission pathways RCP2.6 (i &amp; iv) and RCP8.5 (ii &amp; iii) for two 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors. The maps show the ten-year ensemble mean of five projection model-based 
   <italic>VC</italic> calculations grouped by season (
   <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). Winter: December–February; Spring: March–May; Summer: June–August; Autumn: September–November. DTR was included and

   <sub>max</sub> = 1.5. Temperatures from five different global models (CMIP5 (
