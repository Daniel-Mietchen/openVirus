Dried blood spot (DBS) is an alternate method for collecting blood specimens on paper. This lowers biological risks associated with conventional blood transportation, does not require maintaining cold-chain during transportation and DBS card can be shipped at ambient temperature and even by ordinary mail [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Blood collection and transportation from resource-limited settings remains an obstacle to follow up large vaccine trials, seroepidemiological studies and diagnosis of infectious diseases as well as large population based estimations of public health interventions. DBS can therefore be a solution to the cumbersome specimen collection and transportation that is generally used.</p><p>DBS has been used as an alternative method for diagnosis of viral [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], bacterial [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], fungal [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and parasitic [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] infections. It has also been used to monitor HIV viral load and drug resistance in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The DBS analysis platform is routinely used for estimation of DNA, protein and drugs [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which have a great impact in clinical practice. DBS has been used for measuring immune responses after hepatitis A virus vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] with a positive agreement with plasma specimens. However, there is lack of information about the sensitivity of DBS to evaluate the immunogenicity in enteric infections.</p><p>In this study, we have used the DBS method to collect blood from patients with cholera, enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC) diarrhea, typhoid fever as well as recipients of an oral cholera vaccine to evaluate feasibility and accuracy of immune responses. Immune responses measured using the DBS method was compared with results obtained with plasma specimens in the same cohort of patients and vaccinees.

Blood was collected from cholera and ETEC diarrheal patients on day 2, 7 and 30 of onset of disease. From typhoid fever patients, blood was collected after culture confirmation (day 1), 2&#x02013;3 days later (day 2) and 18&#x02013;22 days later (day 3). Healthy participants were vaccinated with oral cholera vaccine at two time points (days 0 and 14). Blood was collected prior to vaccination on day 0 and 14 (prior to second vaccination) and two more blood samples were collected at day 28 and 42 after the first vaccination. Approximately 50 &#x003bc;l of blood was adsorbed on each spot (200 &#x003bc;l for four spots) of DBS card (Whatman 903, GE Healthcare) and air dried at ambient temperature (15&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) for two hours by placing on a clean paper towel. The card was then transferred to a black card holder (Advantus 4X6 index card holder, Jacksonville, FL, USA) box and kept overnight at RT for adequate drying. The DBS card was placed in a single, gas-impermeable zipper bag containing desiccant sachets (2 desiccants per bag) to protect the cards from moisture. A humidity indicator card was added to monitor the moisture level in the zipper bag and it was checked monthly.

DBS can also be prepared using finger prick blood since about 50 &#x003bc;l of blood is only required per DBS spot. It is also a less invasive way of blood collection method that this does not necessitate the presence of skilled staff to perform phlebotomy [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases and evaluation of disease specific immune responses after natural infection and vaccination can become less difficult to assess and monitor using DBS as an alternative procedure for specimen collection. This procedure as used in this evaluation of enteric diseases and the cholera vaccine brings in an alternative specimen collection and storage method. Although the DBS method has existed for long for sampling for diagnosis of genetic disorders, recently there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of this procedure for carrying out immunological studies in vaccine trials and infectious diseases diagnosis. Enteric infections such as diarrheal diseases (cholera and ETEC diarrhea) as well as typhoid fever are endemic in Africa and Asia. Vaccination is a preventive measure to protect the vulnerable population in these regions. However, to evaluate immunological response to vaccines and natural infection requires collection of blood samples, and transportation to well-equipped laboratories in the cold. We therefore tested the possibility of the use of DBS blood collection method to evaluate immune responses in cholera, ETEC and typhoid patients as well as vaccinees in a country with high rates of enteric infections.</p><p>Vibriocidal antibody response is considered one of the key surrogate markers for both natural cholera infection and vaccination in the field of cholera immunology. For the vibriocidal assay, blood needs to be collected to obtain serum or plasma. The procedure requires blood collection and then separation using centrifuges and storage and transportation under cold conditions. All these requires such facilities to be present in remote field settings and peripheral laboratories which are mostly non-existent. In this study, we have demonstrated that the vibriocidal assay can be carried out using dried blood spot, DBS specimens which provide comparable responses to that obtained with plasma in the conventional method. Vibriocidal assay requires measurement of OD values to investigate the growth of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> strain. As the DBS eluates are reddish in color because of the presence of heme makes it impossible for measuring vibriocidal antibody in conventional assay. We were able to circumvent the effect of heme in the DBS eluates by subtracting the OD values of the DBS eluates from the color of the background from test wells. This allows us to measure vibriocidal antibody responses in the 96-well plates similar to that used for the conventional vibriocidal assay. This method does not require additional determination of bacterial CFU measurement checking in microbiological culture plates and this saves time, resources and also makes the procedure less costly. The DBS based optimized vibriocidal technique that we developed does not require DBS serum separator card and it is based on a one-step procedure with measurement of optical density of bacterial growth only. However, like the conventional assay it is programmable in 96-well plate ELISA plate reader (Gene 5). Recently Iyer et. al. used DBS serum separator card to separate serum and then performed vibriocidal assay using the drop-plate technique. The drop-plate technique is based on the assumption of determining bactericidal growth or killing using measurement of clumped colonies or serrated margins of growth [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the method present here does not require additional determination of CFU of bacteria on agar-based culture plate that saves time, resources and money. The method presented here does not require serum separator cards to separate serum for performing the vibriocidal assay [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our opinion, the method described here can replace conventional assay method when only small amount of blood can be obtained from large population and also in field settings with limited resources.</p><p>Cholera is water borne disease that can be a cause of death within a few hours if not treated immediately. It has been shown that the oral cholera vaccines can protect people from three to five years from another episode [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By collecting blood samples from cholera patients and oral cholera vaccinees using the DBS procedure, we have shown that immune responses measured were similar to that seen using plasma. With the DBS usage using finger prick blood collection by venipuncture can be avoided. We also showed that responses to different diseases and antigens could be carried out using DBS specimens in ELISA procedures. In addition, the antibody responses measured in ETEC-infected diarrheal patients to LTB were also comparable when either DBS or plasma was used. Given that we observed a very positive correlation of immune responses in DBS compared to plasma specimen, we extended this observation to typhoid fever patients. The immune responses against membrane preparation (MP) in DBS eluates were also similar to that seen in plasma samples.</p><p>DBS has earlier been found to be useful for measuring antibody responses in viral infections e.g. hepatitis C, HIV and Measles [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

We show here that the vibriocidal antibody assay which is an indirect correlate of protection in cholera [<xref rid="pone.0218353.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] can be measured using the DBS eluates and we hope that this will make it easier to measure immune responses in mass vaccination campaigns as well as in serosurveys for estimating disease burden globally. Likewise large population studies on natural infection or vaccination in areas of typhoid and ETEC diarrhea both natural infection and vaccination as well as other infectious diseases will benefit with the DBS method of sample collection and testing described in this communication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0218353.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Agreement and correlation of vibriocidal responses between DBS eluates and plasma in cholera patients.</title><p>The Bland-Altman analysis of vibriocidal responses in plasma and DBS eluates of cholera patients at day 2 (A), day 30 (B) are shown.
