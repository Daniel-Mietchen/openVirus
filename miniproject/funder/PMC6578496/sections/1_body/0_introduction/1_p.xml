<p>Blood collection, processing and quick transportation to laboratories from remote areas in resource poor settings can be limitations in carrying out serological studies especially in developing countries where laboratory facilities and trained manpower as well as cold chain facilities are not optimal. Dried blood spot (DBS) is an alternate method for collecting blood specimens on paper. This lowers biological risks associated with conventional blood transportation, does not require maintaining cold-chain during transportation and DBS card can be shipped at ambient temperature and even by ordinary mail [

Blood collection and transportation from resource-limited settings remains an obstacle to follow up large vaccine trials, seroepidemiological studies and diagnosis of infectious diseases as well as large population based estimations of public health interventions. DBS can therefore be a solution to the cumbersome specimen collection and transportation that is generally used.
