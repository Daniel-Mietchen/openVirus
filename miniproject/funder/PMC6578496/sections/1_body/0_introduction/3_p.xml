<p>In this study, we have used the DBS method to collect blood from patients with cholera, enterotoxigenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC) diarrhea, typhoid fever as well as recipients of an oral cholera vaccine to evaluate feasibility and accuracy of immune responses. Immune responses measured using the DBS method was compared with results obtained with plasma specimens in the same cohort of patients and vaccinees. There was positive agreement between DBS and plasma specimen in the evaluation of immune responses in cholera, ETEC diarrhea and typhoid patients as well as OCV recipients.
