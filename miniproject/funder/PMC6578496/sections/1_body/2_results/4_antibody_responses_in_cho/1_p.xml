<p>We investigated LPS and CTB-specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibody responses in the DBS eluates and plasma specimens of cholera patients and vaccinees. There was a strong agreement of LPS-specific antibody responses between DBS eluates and plasma of cholera patients (Intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC: IgA = 0.9, IgG = 0.7 and IgM = 0.7; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>) and vaccinees (ICC: IgA = 0.6, IgG = 0.7 and IgM = 0.8; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). We also observed a strong agreement of CTB-specific antibody responses between DBS eluates and plasma of cholera patients (ICC: IgA = 0.9, IgG = 0.9 and IgM = 0.5; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g003">Fig 3D–3F</xref>) and vaccinees (ICC: IgA = 0.6, IgG = 0.7 and IgM = 0.6; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g004">Fig 4D–4F</xref>). We then investigated the correlation of LPS and CTB-specific antibody responses in DBS eluates and plasma specimens of cholera patients and vaccinees. There was a positive correlation of LPS-specific antibody responses in DBS eluates and plasma specimen of cholera patients (Parts A-C in
