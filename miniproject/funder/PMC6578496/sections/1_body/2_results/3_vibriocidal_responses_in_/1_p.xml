<p>We analyzed the vibriocidal responses in DBS eluates, plasma of cholera patients (n = 17) and vaccinees (n = 17). We found similar magnitude of vibriocidal antibody titer in the corresponding day points of DBS and plasma of patients and vaccinees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). The responder frequency of vibriocidal titer (four-fold increase) in DBS eluates and plasma (two-fold increase) were similar (90%). There was a strong agreement (Bland-Altman agreement) of vibriocidal responses between DBS eluates and plasma in both patients and vaccinees (ICC = 0.9 and 0.8 respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>).There was also a positive correlation of vibriocidal antibody responses at day 7 for patients (r = 0.73, p = 0.02; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) and at day 14 for vaccinees (r = 0.6, p = 0.006; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Similar agreement and correlation were observed at other time points in patients and vaccinees (Parts A-D in
