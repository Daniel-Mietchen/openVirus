<p>To investigate the immune responses in ETEC -infected patients we have measured IgA, IgG and IgM responses against LTB antigen by ELISA. There was a strong agreement of LTB-specific antibody responses between DBS eluates and plasma of ETEC-infected patients (ICC: IgA = 0.9, IgG = 0.8 and IgM = 0.8;

There was also a positive correlation of LTB-specific antibody responses between DBS eluates and plasma of ETEC-infected patients at day 7 (IgA: r = 0.87, p = 0.004; IgG: r = 0.8, p = 0.007, and IgM: r = 0.7, p = 0.01). Similar correlations were observed at day 2 and day 30 (
