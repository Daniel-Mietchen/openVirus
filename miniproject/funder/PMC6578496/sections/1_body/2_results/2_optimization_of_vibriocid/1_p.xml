<p>We set up the vibriocidal assay procedure using DBS eluates so that the assay could be measured in an ELISA Reader (Eon, BioTek, Vermont, USA) similar to the way the conventional and existing vibriocidal assay was being used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The heme color was the main obstacle in setting up the vibriocidal assay to directly measure the antibody titer. To alleviate this problem, the color effect seen in the DBS specimens from each participant were used as DBS control to which no bacterial inoculum was added and this value was subtracted from the OD value of DBS vibriocidal row using an average value for negative controls. We defined the DBS blank as serial dilution (1:2) of DBS eluates and added physiological saline (0.154 M) instead of bacterial inoculum as described above. The optical density from the DBS blank was considered for the heme color and was deducted from DBS plus indicator wells. We defined the final OD of DBS plus indicator wells according the following formula:
