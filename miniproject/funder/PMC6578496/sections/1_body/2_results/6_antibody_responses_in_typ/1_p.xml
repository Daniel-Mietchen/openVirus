<p>We used 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhi membrane preparation (MP) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to measure antibody responses in DBS eluates and plasma specimens of typhoid fever patients. There was a strong agreement of MP-specific antibody responses between DBS eluates and plasma of typhoid fever patients (ICC: IgA = 0.8, IgG = 0.7 and IgM = 0.8;
