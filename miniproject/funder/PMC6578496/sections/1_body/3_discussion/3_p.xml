<p>Cholera is water borne disease that can be a cause of death within a few hours if not treated immediately. It has been shown that the oral cholera vaccines can protect people from three to five years from another episode [

 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By collecting blood samples from cholera patients and oral cholera vaccinees using the DBS procedure, we have shown that immune responses measured were similar to that seen using plasma. With the DBS usage using finger prick blood collection by venipuncture can be avoided. We also showed that responses to different diseases and antigens could be carried out using DBS specimens in ELISA procedures. In addition, the antibody responses measured in ETEC-infected diarrheal patients to LTB were also comparable when either DBS or plasma was used. Given that we observed a very positive correlation of immune responses in DBS compared to plasma specimen, we extended this observation to typhoid fever patients. The immune responses against membrane preparation (MP) in DBS eluates were also similar to that seen in plasma samples.
