<p>Vibriocidal antibody response is considered one of the key surrogate markers for both natural cholera infection and vaccination in the field of cholera immunology. For the vibriocidal assay, blood needs to be collected to obtain serum or plasma. The procedure requires blood collection and then separation using centrifuges and storage and transportation under cold conditions. All these requires such facilities to be present in remote field settings and peripheral laboratories which are mostly non-existent. In this study, we have demonstrated that the vibriocidal assay can be carried out using dried blood spot, DBS specimens which provide comparable responses to that obtained with plasma in the conventional method. Vibriocidal assay requires measurement of OD values to investigate the growth of

 <italic>cholerae</italic> strain. As the DBS eluates are reddish in color because of the presence of heme makes it impossible for measuring vibriocidal antibody in conventional assay. We were able to circumvent the effect of heme in the DBS eluates by subtracting the OD values of the DBS eluates from the color of the background from test wells. This allows us to measure vibriocidal antibody responses in the 96-well plates similar to that used for the conventional vibriocidal assay. This method does not require additional determination of bacterial CFU measurement checking in microbiological culture plates and this saves time, resources and also makes the procedure less costly. The DBS based optimized vibriocidal technique that we developed does not require DBS serum separator card and it is based on a one-step procedure with measurement of optical density of bacterial growth only. However, like the conventional assay it is programmable in 96-well plate ELISA plate reader (Gene 5). Recently Iyer et. al. used DBS serum separator card to separate serum and then performed vibriocidal assay using the drop-plate technique. The drop-plate technique is based on the assumption of determining bactericidal growth or killing using measurement of clumped colonies or serrated margins of growth [

However, the method present here does not require additional determination of CFU of bacteria on agar-based culture plate that saves time, resources and money. The method presented here does not require serum separator cards to separate serum for performing the vibriocidal assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our opinion, the method described here can replace conventional assay method when only small amount of blood can be obtained from large population and also in field settings with limited resources.
