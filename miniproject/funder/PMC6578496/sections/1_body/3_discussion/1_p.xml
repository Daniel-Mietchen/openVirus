<p>Collection and transportation of blood specimen from field settings to laboratories is a problem in resource poor settings and especially in unpredicted epidemics and outbreaks, which often occur in places that have limited laboratory facilities. DBS can also be prepared using finger prick blood since about 50 Î¼l of blood is only required per DBS spot. It is also a less invasive way of blood collection method that this does not necessitate the presence of skilled staff to perform phlebotomy [

Thus, the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases and evaluation of disease specific immune responses after natural infection and vaccination can become less difficult to assess and monitor using DBS as an alternative procedure for specimen collection. This procedure as used in this evaluation of enteric diseases and the cholera vaccine brings in an alternative specimen collection and storage method. Although the DBS method has existed for long for sampling for diagnosis of genetic disorders, recently there has been a resurgence of interest in the use of this procedure for carrying out immunological studies in vaccine trials and infectious diseases diagnosis. Enteric infections such as diarrheal diseases (cholera and ETEC diarrhea) as well as typhoid fever are endemic in Africa and Asia. Vaccination is a preventive measure to protect the vulnerable population in these regions. However, to evaluate immunological response to vaccines and natural infection requires collection of blood samples, and transportation to well-equipped laboratories in the cold. We therefore tested the possibility of the use of DBS blood collection method to evaluate immune responses in cholera, ETEC and typhoid patients as well as vaccinees in a country with high rates of enteric infections.
