<p>DBS has earlier been found to be useful for measuring antibody responses in viral infections e.g. hepatitis C, HIV and Measles [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The DBS specimens have also been used for analyzing antibody responses in bacterial, fungal and parasite infections and to our knowledge, there is no published data using DBS for assessing immune response in patients with cholera, ETEC diarrhea and typhoid fever [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Measuring antibody responses using DBS was found to strongly correlate with plasma antibodies [

 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We show here that the vibriocidal antibody assay which is an indirect correlate of protection in cholera [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] can be measured using the DBS eluates and we hope that this will make it easier to measure immune responses in mass vaccination campaigns as well as in serosurveys for estimating disease burden globally. Likewise large population studies on natural infection or vaccination in areas of typhoid and ETEC diarrhea both natural infection and vaccination as well as other infectious diseases will benefit with the DBS method of sample collection and testing described in this communication.
