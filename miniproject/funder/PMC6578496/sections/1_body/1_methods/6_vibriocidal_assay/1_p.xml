<p>Vibriocidal antibody titer was measured according to the procedure described earlier [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, 25 μl of cold physiological saline (0.154 M) was dispensed in all wells except column #2 of 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc F, Denmark). Plasma and DBS eluates were heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. For plasma, 45 μl of cold saline and 5 μl of plasma and for DBS eluates 50 μl eluates were dispensed in corresponding wells in column #2. Both plasma and DBS eluates were serially diluted (initial dilution 1:10) in two fold dilutions. The dilution was accomplished by mixing the solution in column #2, aspirating 25 μl and dispensing and mixing the sample in column #3 and so on, until column #12 (1:10240 dilution). At the end, 25 μl was discarded from the last well in each row.

 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as well as used to measure vibriocidal antibody titer in plasma [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A loopful of bacteria was inoculated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) media for 2–3 hours at 37°C with shaking to mid-log phase of growth (OD to 0.4). Bacterial culture was centrifuged and resuspended in sterile saline (0.154 M) and the OD was adjusted to 0.3 at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU 530 UV vis). For vibriocidal assay using plasma, 25 μl of bacterial suspension (21.25 μl normal saline, 1.25 μl bacteria and 2.5 μl guinea pig sera) was added to all wells except wells #E1, F1, G1 and H1 in column 1 of 96-well plates and 25 μl of cold saline was added to wells # E1, F1, G1 and H1 (

For vibriocidal assay using DBS, 25 μl of bacterial suspension (21.25 μl normal saline, 1.25 μl bacteria and 2.5 μl guinea pig sera) was added to all wells except wells row #A2-A12, B2-B12 wells and column #E1, F1, G1 &amp; H1 wells and 25 μl of cold saline was added to wells # E1, F1, G1 and H1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The OD value of wells in row #A2-A12, B2-B12 was used as the color background control for DBS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour and 150 μl of BHI media was added to all wells and incubated again at 37°C. The plates were read spectrophotometrically (Eon, BioTek, Vermont, USA) until the positive control well reached OD around 0.20 to 0.28 at 595 nm.
