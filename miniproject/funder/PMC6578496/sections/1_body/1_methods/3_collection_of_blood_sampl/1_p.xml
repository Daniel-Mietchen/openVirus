<p>Venous blood was collected (8–10 ml from adults and 3–5 ml from children; only 200 μl was used for preparation of DBS) from the study participants in sodium heparin tube (Beckton Dickinson, CA). Blood was collected from cholera and ETEC diarrheal patients on day 2, 7 and 30 of onset of disease. From typhoid fever patients, blood was collected after culture confirmation (day 1), 2–3 days later (day 2) and 18–22 days later (day 3). Healthy participants were vaccinated with oral cholera vaccine at two time points (days 0 and 14). Blood was collected prior to vaccination on day 0 and 14 (prior to second vaccination) and two more blood samples were collected at day 28 and 42 after the first vaccination. Approximately 50 μl of blood was adsorbed on each spot (200 μl for four spots) of DBS card (Whatman 903, GE Healthcare) and air dried at ambient temperature (15–25°C) for two hours by placing on a clean paper towel. The card was then transferred to a black card holder (Advantus 4X6 index card holder, Jacksonville, FL, USA) box and kept overnight at RT for adequate drying. The DBS card was placed in a single, gas-impermeable zipper bag containing desiccant sachets (2 desiccants per bag) to protect the cards from moisture. A humidity indicator card was added to monitor the moisture level in the zipper bag and it was checked monthly. If the indicator turned purple then the desiccant sachets were replaced with new desiccant sachets. The dried blood spotted cards were stored at -80°C until tested (1–6 months).</p>
