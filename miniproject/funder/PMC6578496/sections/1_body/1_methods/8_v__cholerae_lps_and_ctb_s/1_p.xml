<p>For this assay, 96-well ELISA (Nunc F, Denmark) plates were coated with LPS of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O1 in PBS (100 μl/well) at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml and incubated at RT overnight. For anti-CTB, ELISA plates were coated (100 μl/well) with ganglioside GM1 (0.3 nM/ml) and incubated overnight at ambient temperature (15–25°C). The plates were washed with PBS and recombinant CTB (0.5 μg/ml) (gift of A.M Svennerholm, University of Gothenburg) added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed for three times with PBS and blocked with 200 μl/well of 0.1% BSA-PBS and incubated at 37°C for 30–60 min. The plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and once with PBS. Plasma and DBS eluates were added in the allocated wells (1:200 dilution) and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and once with PBS. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-human antibody was added in each well (100 μl/well) and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and once with PBS. For color development, orthophenylenediamine (OPD) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added together with the substrate H
