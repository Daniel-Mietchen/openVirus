<p>We assessed differences in the magnitude of the responses using the Mann-Whitney U test using GraphPad prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Two-sided P values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. Correlations were assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation. The Bland-Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement (LoA) were used to evaluate the agreement between results obtained with plasma and DBS. The 95% LoA was calculated as the average difference between the plasma and DBS ± 1.96SD (upper limit and lower limit) in SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The narrower the 95% LoA, the better is the agreement. In addition, the reliability of the DBS method was tested by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); if the ICCs were closer to 1, the reliability was higher. Figures were generated in GraphPad prism 6.</p>
