<p>Plasma antibodies specific to LTB were measured using a previously described ELISA method [
 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Briefly, 96-well ELISA (Nunc F, Denmark) plates were coated (100 μl/well) with ganglioside GM1 (0.3 nM/ml) and incubated overnight at ambient temperature (15–25°C). The plates were washed with PBS and recombinant LTB (0.5 μg/ml) (gift of A.M Svennerholm, University of Gothenburg) added to the wells (100 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed with PBS-T (0.05%) for three times and once with PBS. The plasma samples (1:200 dilution) was added and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T(0.05%) and once with PBS. HRP-conjugated anti-human antibody was added to wells and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T (0.05%) and once with PBS. Substrate was added to the wells and plates were read at 450 nm using the kinetic method (Eon, BioTek, Vermont, USA).
