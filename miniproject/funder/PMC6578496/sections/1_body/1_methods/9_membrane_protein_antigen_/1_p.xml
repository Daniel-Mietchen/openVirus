 <xref rid="pone.0218353.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, 96-well ELISA (Nunc F, Denmark) plates were coated with MP of 
 <italic>S</italic>.Typhi (Ty21a) in PBS at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml and incubated at RT overnight. The plates were washed for three times with PBS and blocked with 200 μl/well of 0.1% BSA-PBS and incubated at 37°C for 30–60 min. The plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and once with PBS. Plasma and DBS eluates were added in the allocated wells and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and once with PBS. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human antibody was added in each well (100 μl/well) and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The plates were washed three times with PBS-0.05% Tween and once with PBS. Orthophenylenediamine (OPD) with H
