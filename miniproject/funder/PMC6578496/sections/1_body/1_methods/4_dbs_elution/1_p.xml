<p>A 3.2 mm spot was punched with a DBS puncher (PerkinElmer, USA) from each blood-soaked circle of the DBS card. All punched spots from a single patient were transferred to one eppendorf tube and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.2) was added according to the desired dilution (18 punch in 270 μl; 1:10 for vibriocidal and 1 punch in 300 μl; 1:200 for ELISAs) and kept at RT overnight. The tube was centrifuged (2500 x g for 7 min) and eluate was collected in a fresh eppendorf tube.</p>
