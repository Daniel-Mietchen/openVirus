  <title>Conventional vibriocidal assay and modified vibriocidal assay for DBS eluates.</title>
  <p>A) The schematic diagram shows the conventional vibriocidal assay with plasma collected from cholera patients and cholera vaccinees using the 96-well plates (row A-F). Pooled sera obtained from cholera patients was used as positive control on each plate. B). The vibriocidal antibody assay was modified when DBS eluates were used to measure vibriocidal response in cholera patients/vaccinees. The first two rows (rows A-B) were used without adding bacterial inocula to calculate color background of heme in DBS eluates. Rows C to F were used for DBS eluates similar to the conventional vibriocidal assay and the last two rows (G-H) were used as positive control.</p>
