  <title>Immunogenicity of CHIKV-derived HLA-B*07:02, and DRB1*04:04-restricted peptides in HLA transgenic mice.</title>
  <p>HLA-B*07:02 (top panel), or -DRB1*04:04 (bottom panel) target cells that were pre-pulsed with the indicated CHIKV-synthetic peptides (CP
   <sub>17-25</sub> and E2
   <sub>133-145</sub>) were analyzed by ELISPOT for CD8
   <sup>+</sup> or CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cell activation with CHIKV-specific splenocytes obtained from HLA-B*07:02 (top panel), or -DRB1*04:04 (bottom panel) transgenic mice 7 days (acute response) post rVACV-CHIKV immunization (1x10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu). The results are calculated as mean of seven independent experiments ± SD. Significant P values with a non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test: **, p &lt;0.01; and ***, p &lt;0.001 versus negative controls (no peptide) are indicated.
