  <title>Identification of the CHIKV HLA class I and II ligands in infected cell extracts by mass spectrometry.</title>
  <p>MS/MS fragmentation spectra obtained from quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry of the ion peak indicated in 
   <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> from the CHIKV-VACV-infected cell extracts. The vertical axis represents the relative abundance of the parental ion and each fragmentation ion detected. Ions generated in the fragmentation are detailed, and the sequence deduced from the indicated fragments is shown in the upper left side of each panel.
