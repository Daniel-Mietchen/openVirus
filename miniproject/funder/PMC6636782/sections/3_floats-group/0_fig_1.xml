  <title>Diagram of the scheme of sequential immunoprecipitation.</title>
  <p>Uninfected or rVACV-CHIKV-infected JY or HOM-2 cells were lysed. HLA-peptide complexes were isolated via affinity chromatography of the soluble fraction of cell extracts with the following mAbs, sequentially used as indicated in the Fig: PA2.1 (anti-HLA-A*02), ME1 (anti-HLA-B*07, and -B*27), W6/32 (specific for a monomorphic pan-HLA class I determinant), L243 (HB55, specific for a monomorphic pan-HLA-DR determinant), and B7.21 (specific for monomorphic pan-HLA-DP determinant). The HLA class I and II molecules expressed in each human cell line is indicated in a box.</p>
