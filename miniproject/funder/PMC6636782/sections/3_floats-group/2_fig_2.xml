  <title>HLA-B*07:02 stabilization with CHIKV CP
   <sub>17-25</sub> synthetic peptide.
  </title>
  <p>The stability of HLA-B*07:02-peptide complexes on the surface of transfected RMA-S cells was measured by flow cytometry. Top panel, the indicated peptides were used at 200 μM. The CMV pp65
   <sub>7-15</sub> and VACV A34
   <sub>82-90</sub> peptides were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The mAb ME1 was used for staining. The results, calculated as fluorescence indexes, are shown as the mean ± SD of four independent experiments. Bottom panel, titration curves for the indicated synthetic peptides with HLA-B*07:02. Results are shown as mean values ± SD from four independent experiments. Calculated EC
   <sub>50</sub> values (μM; mean ± SD) are shown in the left panel insert. Significant p values with a non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test: ***, p &lt;0.001 versus negative peptide control (CMV pp65
   <sub>7-15</sub>, top panel) or between CHIKV CP
   <sub>17-25</sub> and VACV A34
   <sub>82-90</sub> viral peptides (bottom panel) are indicated.
