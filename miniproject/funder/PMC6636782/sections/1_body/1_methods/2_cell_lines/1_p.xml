<p>Two different Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cell lymphoblastoid lines were used. The homozygous human HOM-2 cell line expresses HLA-A*03:01, -B*27:05, and -C*01:02 class I molecules and HLA-DR B1*01:01, and HLA-DP B1*04:01 chains. The human JY cell line expresses HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, and -C*07:02 class I molecules and four HLA-DR chains: B1*04:04, B4*01:01, B1*13:01, and B3*01:01 and two HLA-DP chains: B1*02:01, and B1*04:01. Both human cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum.</p>
