<p>Peptide mixtures recovered after the ultra-filtration step were concentrated using Micro-Tip reversed-phase columns (C

 <sub>18</sub> tip was equilibrated with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA, washed with 0.1% TFA, and then loaded with the peptide mixture. The tip was then washed with an additional volume of 0.1% TFA, and the peptides were subsequently eluted with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. Lastly, the peptide samples were concentrated to approximately 20 μl using vacuum centrifugation [
