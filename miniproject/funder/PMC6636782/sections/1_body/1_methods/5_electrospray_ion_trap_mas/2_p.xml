<p>The HLA class I or II peptides recovered from immunoprecipitated HLA specific mAbs, were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS using a Q-Exactive-Plus mass spectrometer that was fitted with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanocapillary UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), using the same parameters previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The peptides were resolved on homemade 3.5 micron Reprosil C18-Aqua (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) capillary columns (75 micron ID and about 30 cm long [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with a 5–28% acetonitrile linear gradient for 2 h in the presence of 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.15 μl/min. The dynamic exclusion was set to 20 sec and the automatic gain control value for the full MS was set to 3x10
 <sup>6</sup>. The selected masses were fragmented from the survey scan of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 300–1,800 AMU at resolution 70,000. The 10 most intense masses were selected for fragmentation by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) from each full mass spectrum. No fragmentation was performed for peptides with unassigned precursor ion charge states or charge states of five and above. MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200. The target value of the MS/MS was set to 1x10
 <sup>5</sup> and the isolation window to 1.8 m/z. The maximum injection time was set to 100 ms and normalized collision energy to 25 eV. The peptide match option was set to Preferred.
