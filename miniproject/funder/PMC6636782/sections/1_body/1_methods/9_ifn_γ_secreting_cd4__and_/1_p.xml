<p>ELISPOT assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to detect antigen-specific T cell activation. Briefly, purified rat anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody (clone R4-6A2, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) was coated on 96-well MultiScreen HTS HA plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The plates were incubated overnight at room temperature and were blocked with medium that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 37°C. Duplicate cultures of erythrocyte-depleted spleen cells were prepared from HLA class I or II-transgenic mice at 7 days (acute response) post intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection infection with 1x10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu of sucrose-purified rVACV-CHIKV at different dilutions with 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M peptide. The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere and were then washed with PBS-T (PBS 0.05% Tween-20). The plate wells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ mAb clone XMG1.2 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), washed with PBS-T, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The plates were additionally washed before adding 3,3’-diaminobenzidine substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.4 that contained 0.015% hydrogen peroxide. To enumerate the IFNγ responses, spots were counted and wells were photographed using a Leica EZ4 HD stereo microscope and LAS EZ software (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Additionally, the percentage of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells was determined by flow cytometry after staining spleen cells with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and CD8 (clone KT15, Proimmune, England, UK) antibodies, respectively. Events were acquired on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed using BD FACSDiva software, version 6 (BD Bioscience).
