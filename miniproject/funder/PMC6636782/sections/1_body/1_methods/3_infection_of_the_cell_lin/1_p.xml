<p>The VACV Western Reserve strain expressing the CHIKV structural genes under control of a strong synthetic early/late virus promoter (termed rVACV-CHIKV), previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], was utilized to infect 1x10
 <sup>9</sup> HOM-2 or JY cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3 plaque-forming units/cell in 100 ml for 2 h at 37°C, and then cells were washed with PBS, as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These conditions were previously determined as the optimal to obtain infection of all cells without impairing the cell viability. Next, the cells were cultured for 4 h at 37°C and stained with the Omnitope antiserum-FITC that recognizes VACV virions (ViroStat Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA). Samples were analyzed measuring fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry to confirm VACV infection (1020 ± 87 mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] in VACV-infected cells versus 422 ± 48 in non-infected cells stained with the anti-VACV antiserum). The cells were then frozen in the presence of phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) until they were lysed.
