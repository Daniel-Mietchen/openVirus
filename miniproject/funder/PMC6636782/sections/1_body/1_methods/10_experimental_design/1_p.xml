Similar amounts of uninfected human cells were used as negative control to discriminate viral and cellular peptides (included in proteome databases as well as unknown peptides, whose parental proteins may not be included in current human databases) and to exclude erroneous assignments of viral peptides. In addition both human and VACV databases were used to identify non-CHIKV peptides. The CHIKV structural genes, inserted into the VACV genome, encode for 1248 amino acids. The proteome of VACV with 56795 residues is 40-fold greater than the CHIKV structural protein. Moreover, the human database utilized is 100-fold greater than the corresponding VACV database. Thus, the probability of erroneous CHIKV assignments is statistically insignificant. Also a maximum false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was estimated by searching against the database with the reversed viral and human sequences. No viral peptides were found in the search of the reversed database utilized. Moreover, several synthetic peptides were purchased from Peptide 2.0 (Chantilly, VA, USA) and their MS/MS spectra were used to confirm the assigned sequences. A schematic representation of experimental design is shown in
