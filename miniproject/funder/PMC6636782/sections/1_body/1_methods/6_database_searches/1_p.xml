<p>Raw mass spectrometry data were processed using Peaks 8.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, Canada) for peak-list generation from the nanoLC-MS/MS data. The peaks were identified using the Peaks 8.5 software programs using the human, VACV, and CHIKV parts of the UniProt/Swiss-Prot database (November 2017), which included 20267, 217, and 5 proteins, respectively. The search was not limited by enzymatic specificity and both the peptide mass and the fragment ion tolerances were set at 5 and 20 ppm, respectively. This search was not limited by any methodological bias (e.g., individual protein selection or HLA consensus scoring algorithm use). The following variable modifications were also analyzed: acetylation of N-terminal residue, cysteinilation (C), oxidation (M, P, H, F, Y, and W), methylation (N- and C-terminus) and phosphorylation (Y, S, and T). The identified peptides were selected when their -10logP score from Peaks 8.5 was &gt; 21. In addition, the maximum false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1%. No viral peptides were found in a search of the reversed database. When the MS/MS spectra fitted more than one peptide, only the highest scoring peptide was selected. The mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the MassIVE repository (
