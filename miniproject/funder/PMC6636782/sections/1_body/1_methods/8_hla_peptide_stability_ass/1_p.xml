<p>The following synthetic peptides were used as controls in the HLA/complex stability assays: VACV A34
 <sub>82-90</sub> (LPRPDTRHL, HLA-B*07-restricted) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and CMV pp65
 <sub>7-15</sub> (RCPEMISVL, HLA-C*01-restricted) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The RMA-S HLA-B*07-transfected cells were incubated at 26°C for 16 h. This allowed for empty HLA class I molecule expression (without any peptide) at the cell membrane that was stable at 26°C but not at 37°C. The cells were washed with FBS-free culture medium and incubated for 2 h at 26°C with various peptide concentrations in FBS-free medium. Cells were maintained at 37°C for additional 2 h incubation and then collected for flow cytometry analysis. This method allowed for the empty HLA class I molecules to become internalized, and thus we were able to discriminate between bound or unbound peptides. HLA expression levels were measured using the mAb ME1 (anti-HLA-B*07), as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Data were acquired on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed using BD FACSDiva software, version 6 (BD Bioscience). The cells that were incubated without peptides exhibited peak fluorescence intensities close to the background staining that were observed with the secondary mAb alone. The fluorescence index was calculated for each concentration point as the ratio of the mean peak channel fluorescence of the sample to that of the control incubated without peptide. Peptide binding was also expressed as EC
 <sub>50</sub>, which is the molar concentration of the peptide at 50% of the maximum fluorescence obtained in a concentration range of 0.01–200 μM.
