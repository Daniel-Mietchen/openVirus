<p>HLA-bound peptides were isolated from a total of 4 or 2x10
 <sup>10</sup> uninfected or VACV-infected HOM-2 or JY cell lines for 6 hours, respectively. The cells were lysed in 1% CHAPS (Sigma), 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 in the presence of the cOmplete, Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). After centrifugation, the supernatant was passed first through a control precolumn containing CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) to remove non-specific peptides and proteins. Next, the HLA class I/peptide or HLA class II/peptide complexes were isolated sequentially via affinity chromatography from the soluble cell extract fraction with PA2.1 (anti-HLA-A*02) [
