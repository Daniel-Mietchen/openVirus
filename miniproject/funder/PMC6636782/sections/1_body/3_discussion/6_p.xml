<p>Despite our data support a highly immunogenic vaccine, according to the very limited conservation between the HLA class I and II ligands from CHIKV proteins and their corresponding sequences in O'nyong-nyong virus, it is unlikely that the recombinant CHIKV vaccine may have some kind of cross-protective cellular immune response against this second alphavirus although mAbs specific for CHIKV recognized most of O'nyong-nyong virus antigenic sites [
