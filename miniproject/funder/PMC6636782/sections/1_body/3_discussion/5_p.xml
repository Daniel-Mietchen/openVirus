<p>Antibody-mediated immune response against CHIKV seems to mainly target the envelope glycoprotein E2 of CHIKV, although antibodies against E3, capsid and nsP3 proteins were also detected during the course of the disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In addition, this humoral early immune response is dominated by IgG3 antibodies specific mostly for a single linear epitope in the N-terminus of the viral E2 protein [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Although the sequences of the B and T cell epitopes are different, the immunoprevalence of the HLA class II ligands identified in the current report were also mainly focused on the E2 and E3 proteins.
