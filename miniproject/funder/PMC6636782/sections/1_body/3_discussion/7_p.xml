<p>To explain the generation of HLA class II ligands, two different models have been proposed. The first, the “cut/trim first, bind later” model, suggests that the proteolytic activity of lysosomal proteases on the viral protein generates peptides of different length and later, these protein fragments bind to HLA class II molecules. Conversely, the “bind first, cut/trim later” model assumes that first the HLA class II molecules interact with the exposed regions from viral proteins, and later the lysosomal proteases trim the unprotected protruding ends of antigenic proteins to release the corresponding HLA class II/peptide complex. Some studies supporting each of the two models are reviewed in [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and thus, exposed to allow the direct interaction with HLA class II molecules as suggest the “bind first, cut/trim later” model. In contrast, the X-ray crystallography [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] shows that all HLA-DR and -DP class II ligands from CHIKV E1 and E2 envelope proteins identified in the current study are located in the internal regions of these viral proteins and thus, their generation would be compatible with the “cut/trim first, bind later” model. Alternatively, the CHIKV HLA class II ligands would be accessible to direct interaction with HLA class II molecules if the denaturative environment of the lysosomal compartment allows first the unfolding of the viral proteins and thus, the non-exposed protein domains could be displayed to HLA class II binding.
