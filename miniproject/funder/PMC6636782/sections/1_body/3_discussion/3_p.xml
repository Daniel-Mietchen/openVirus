<p>Human MHC ligands from CHIKV are largely unknown, since only three 6K transmembrane protein-derived epitopes presented by the HLA class I molecule A*02:01 were previously identified [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the current report, using a high throughput immunoproteomic analysis from human cells infected with a rVACV-CHIKV vaccine expressing the CHIKV C, E3, E2, 6K, and E1 structural genes we identified several CHIKV ligands and epitopes associated to different HLA-A, -B, and -C class I molecules and HLA-DR, and -DP class II molecules, that derived from the capsid protein and the three envelope viral proteins (E1, E2, and E3), featuring the basis of both HLA class I and II antigen processing that trigger both cytotoxic and helper T cell responses against this reemerging virus. In addition, in this report the immunoprevalence of the proteins encoded by the CHIKV gene inserted in the recombinant VACV WR strain versus the VACV parental vector was also compared. In HLA class I, the abundance (relative to length protein) of CHIKV ligands was comparable in numbers with the one obtained from VACV proteins. In contrast, an enrichment in HLA class II-restricted ligands from CHIKV structural proteins versus the respective VACV proteins was found and thus, this high immunoprevalence of the HLA class II-restricted cellular immune response against CHIKV ligands (a key element to trigger protective both cellular and humoral immune responses) could mean that recombinant poxvirus-based vaccines against CHIKV could be effective.
