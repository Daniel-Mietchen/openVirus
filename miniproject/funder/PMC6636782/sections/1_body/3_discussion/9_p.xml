<p>Overall, this report has identified the CHIKV viral epitopes that bind to different HLA class I and II molecules, as well as those triggered by the recombinant VACV vector, providing an in depth characterization of the repertoire of HLA-restricted epitopes formed during infection of human cells with a vaccine vector, information relevant to understand viral pathogenesis and development of vaccines against pathogens. In addition, the natural CHIKV viral epitopes identified in the current report open a new way of studying more specifically the role of both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in the infection as well as in the chronic pathology caused by CHIKV.
