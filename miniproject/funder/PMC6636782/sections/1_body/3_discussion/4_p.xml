<p>Although a robust T cell response against infection is generally desirable, a major issue must be considered concerning CHIKV-related pathology. Vigorous adaptive immune responses in chronic CHIKV patients who displayed higher viral loads during the acute phase were previously found [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Remarkably, infiltrating CD4
 <sup>+</sup> but not CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were found in the injured synovial tissue of these chronic CHIKV patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], suggesting a role of these lymphocytes in the chronic arthralgia/arthritis. More specifically, in the mice model these CHIKV-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> but not CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were strongly associated to the inflammation in the joints by an IFN-Î³-independent mechanism [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In chronic disease, CHIKV RNA and proteins are detected in musculoskeletal tissue, indicating that the immune response of the host fails to eliminate the pathogen from some tissues [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, transfer of splenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes from CHIKV-infected wild-type mice generated a severe joint inflammation into recipient animals of these HLA class II-restricted T helper cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, an exacerbated T helper response causing chronic arthralgia and/or arthritis by the high immunoprevalence of the HLA class II-restricted cellular immune response against CHIKV structural polyprotein in the vaccine construct should be assessed and eventually ruled out in later studies. However, the depletion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup>, but not CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, after vaccination with an MVA-CHIKV vaccine expressing E2 and E3 CHIKV proteins in mice that were later infected with CHIKV caused death of all animals analyzed, demonstrating the indispensable role of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in the protection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Although MHC class II
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice are able to control CHIKV viraemia, these MHC class II-deficient mice have 2.5 logs higher than normal mice with a delay in viraemia control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells induced by MVA-CHIKV can help to effectively control the viral replication of CHIKV while minimizing collateral tissue injury.
