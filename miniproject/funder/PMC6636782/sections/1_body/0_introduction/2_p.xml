<p>CHIKV is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense, 12kb single-stranded RNA genome that encodes two large polyproteins [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The first is the nonstructural P1234 precursor, where the C-terminal domain of the nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) releases the four multifunctional nonstructural proteins. In contrast, in the maturation of the structural polyprotein three different proteases are involved: first, the capsid is autocatalytically released, and later the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal peptidase and furin proteases from the host generate 6K transmembrane and the three E1, E2, and E3 envelope proteins [
