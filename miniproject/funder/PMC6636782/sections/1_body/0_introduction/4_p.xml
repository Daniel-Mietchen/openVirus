<p>The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II antigen processing pathways are the key elements to trigger adequate antiviral CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte functions, respectively. Proteolytic degradation by cytosol proteinases, mainly proteasomes, of the newly synthesized viral or cellular proteins, some of which are defective in synthesis or folding, generates peptides 8â€“10 residues long. These short peptides, after translocation to the ER lumen by transporters associated with antigen processing, bind to the newly synthesized HLA class I molecules. These stabilized HLA class I/peptide complexes are then exported to the surface of all nucleated cells for cytolytic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell recognition [

Moreover, antigen presenting cells synthesize HLA class II molecules that, after insertion in the ER, are later transported to endosomal compartments without binding antigenic peptides. Next, these organelles fuse with late endosomes, which can contain exogenous protein material as viral particles and/or extracellular host proteins that were previously engulfed by endocytosis, phagocytosis or pinocytosis. These exogenous proteins can be processed by the different lysosome-resident cathepsins, yielding cellular and viral peptides of different lengths by molecular mechanisms currently controversial (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). These peptides, up to 30 residues long, stabilize the HLA class II molecules and then, these HLA class II/peptide complexes are transported to the cell membrane where they are exposed for CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T helper cell recognition [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In absence of appropriate HLA class I and II-restricted T cell recognition both cellular and humoral immune responses cannot be efficiently activated and thus, the infective virus could spread within the whole organism with fatal results for the host.
