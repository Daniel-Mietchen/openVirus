<p>Although the immune mechanisms involved in the control of CHIKV disease are not fully characterized, CHIKV-infected humans show different timing of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the acute phase of infection. CHIKV-specific cytolytic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte-mediated immune response displays a peak at the first day post-illness onset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while the corresponding CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes is increased around the end of the acute phase [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Abundant activated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, responsible for destruction of the infected cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], can be detected in blood samples from patients two months postinfection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, the production of cytokines by CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T helper lymphocytes stimulates the cell-mediated and antibody immune responses against CHIKV.
