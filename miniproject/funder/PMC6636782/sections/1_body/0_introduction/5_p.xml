<p>The insertion of CHIKV structural genes inside the vaccinia virus (VACV) genome (rVACV-CHIKV) has been proposed as a vaccine candidate for this mosquito-borne virus, due to the high antiviral efficacy against CHIKV challenge [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Previously, the characterization of their immunogenicity profile and efficacy in the BALB/C mice model was carried out [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This recombinant virus was utilized, in addition to other different vaccine candidates including DNA-launched RNA replicon, soluble recombinant p62-E1 CHIKV protein and attenuated CHIKV, in several prime-boost protocols of immunization and virus challenge studies in a nonhuman primate model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, to date, only one study using one of these vaccine candidates in humanized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models has been carried out [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. By selection of potential HLA class I ligands based on an HLA class I binding prediction algorithm [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and subsequent analysis of peptide-specific IFNÎ³-secreting cells from rVACV-CHIKV-immunized HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice, three epitopes from the short (60 residues) 6K protein were identified [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, no natural HLA class I or class II ligands for neither CHIKV natural infection nor CHIKV vaccine candidates has been described so far. In this work, using an immunopeptidomics analysis of HLA ligands which were isolated from large amounts of human cells infected with rVACV-CHIKV, we describe several natural CHIKV ligands and epitopes restricted by different common HLA class I and II molecules.
