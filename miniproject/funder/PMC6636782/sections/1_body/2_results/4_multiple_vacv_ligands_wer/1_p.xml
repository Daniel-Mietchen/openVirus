<p>Moreover, in addition to the three fragmentation spectra resolved as CHIKV structural polyprotein-derived peptides, other 69 fragmentation spectra present in any of the five virus-infected HLA class I-bound peptidic pools obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007547.g001">Fig 1</xref>), but absent in their respective control uninfected pool, were resolved with high confidence parameters as peptides derived from 40 different VACV proteins. In addition, the human proteome database searches also failed to identify these spectra as a human protein fragments, backing the viral origin of these HLA-bound peptides. These ion peaks were assigned to the VACV amino acid sequences described in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Thus, 6, 4, 12 and 15 peptide sequences were obtained bound to HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, -B*27:05, and -C*07:02 molecules respectively (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 36 of these 37 VACV peptides were predicted as ligands for the respective HLA class I molecule by one or both computational approaches utilized (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, IEDB and NetMHCpan algorithms failed to predict B*07:02-binding for the VACV A37
 <sub>5-15</sub> ligand (
