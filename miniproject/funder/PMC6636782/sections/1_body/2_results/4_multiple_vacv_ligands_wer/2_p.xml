<p>The other 32 sequences were obtained from the virus-infected W6/32-bound pool of the HOM-2 cells and thus, these peptides could be presented by HLA-A*03:01 and/or HLA-C*01:02 class I molecules in virus-infected cells. Theoretical binding affinity and allele assignment of these peptides was carried out by IEDB and NetMHCpan bioinformatics tools. 23 and 5 of these VACV sequences were assigned as HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-C*01:02-restricted ligands, respectively (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the other 4 VACV sequences (D6
 <sub>595-603</sub>, D12
 <sub>99-111</sub>, E5
 <sub>117-127</sub>, and E6
 <sub>72-80</sub>) of this peptide pool were assigned as viral ligands with theoretical affinity for both HLA-A*03:01 and -C*01:02 class I molecules (
