<p>Thus, collectively these data indicate that all analyzed HLA class I molecules bound viral ligands. In addition, up to 73 different natural HLA class I-VACV peptide complexes (6 with HLA-A*02:01, 27 with HLA-A*03:01, 4 with HLA-B*07:02, 12 with HLA-B*27:05, 9 with HLA-C*01:02, and 15 with HLA-C*07:02) can be presented in the two virus-infected cell lines.</p>
