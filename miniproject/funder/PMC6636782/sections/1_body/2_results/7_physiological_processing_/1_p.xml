<p>Similarly to JY cell line, the HLA-DR-bound peptide pools were isolated from either uninfected or rVACV-CHIKV-infected HOM-2 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007547.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In this experiment, seven different fragmentation spectra presented in the virus-infected HLA-bound peptide pool, but absent from the control uninfected pool, were determined as CHIKV E1, and E3 protein peptides (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Additionally, both human and VACV proteome database searches failed to identify any of these spectra, consistent with the CHIKV origin of these peptides.
