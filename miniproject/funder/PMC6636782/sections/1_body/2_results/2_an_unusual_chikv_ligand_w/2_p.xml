<p>HLA-C*07:02 class I molecules preferentially binds, as other HLA-A, -B, and -C class I proteins, peptides of 8 to 11 residues long (SYFPEITHI database [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). The YEHVTVIPNTVGVPYK peptide is a 16mer and thus, must be a noncanonical HLA class I ligand. The MHC binding prediction by IEDB bioinformatic tool showed that the 11mer sequence TVIPNTVGVPY would bind with relatively high affinity to HLA-C*07:02 molecule (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the 9mer with sequence TVIPNTVGV obtain a high affinity score using the NetMHCpan software for HLA-C*07:02 binding (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, these binding prediction analyses suggest that the CHIKV E1
 <sub>1-16</sub> peptide, identified by mass spectrometry, is an unusual HLA class I ligand that interacts with HLA-C*07:02 molecules by a central core and their N- and C-terminal residues probably protruded out of the HLA-C*07:02 binding groove.
