<p>After sequential immunoprecipitation of HLA-A*02:01 and -B*07:02 class I molecules, the HLA-C*07:02-bound peptide pool was obtained from JY cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007547.g001">Fig 1</xref>). One fragmentation spectrum from the rVACV-CHIKV-infected W6/32-bound pool, but absent in its control uninfected pool, was determined as a CHIKV-derived peptide (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the human and VACV proteome database searches also failed to identify this spectrum as a proteic fragment of these organisms, sustaining the CHIKV origin of this HLA-bound peptide. The ion peak, with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 908.5, was assigned to the viral amino acid sequence YEHVTVIPNTVGVPYK, which spans residues 1â€“16 of the CHIKV E1 envelope protein. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref> shows the experimentally obtained MS/MS spectra and the respective assignments. In addition, the experimental fragmentation spectrum of CHIKV E1
 <sub>1-16</sub> was absent in HLA-A*02:01 and -B*07:02 peptide pools, and thus this viral peptide was most likely a HLA-C*07:02 ligand.
