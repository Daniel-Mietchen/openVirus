<p>In addition, the HLA-DP-bound peptide pools were also isolated from either uninfected or rVACV-CHIKV-infected JY and HOM-2 cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007547.g001">Fig 1</xref>). No CHIKV peptides were identified after immunoprecipitation of HLA-DP molecules from JY cells. In contrast, from the HOM-2 cells three different fragmentation spectra presented in the virus-infected HLA-DP-bound peptide pool but absent from the control uninfected pool, were determined as CHIKV E1, and E2 protein peptides (
