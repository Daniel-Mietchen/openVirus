<p>In this study, 12 different natural HLA class II-CHIKV peptide complexes, restricted by four HLA class II molecules, were identified (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As the CHIKV structural genes encode for 1248 residues, thus, the ratio was one HLA class II-CHIKV peptide complex per 104 residues.
