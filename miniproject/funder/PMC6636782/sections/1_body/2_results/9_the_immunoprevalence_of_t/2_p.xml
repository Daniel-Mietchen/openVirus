<p>Likewise, 30 natural HLA class II-VACV peptide complexes were previously identified in the same rVACV-CHIKV-infected cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The source of ligands naturally bound to the HLA class II molecules is mostly derived from proteins included in the viral particles and/or from the extracellular medium, which were previously engulfed by endocytosis, phagocytosis, or pinocytosis, and later processed by several resident cathepsins from lysosomes. Thus, about half of the VACV WR strain proteome may be susceptible to entry in the HLA class II antigen processing and presentation pathways according to the information available in the UniProtKB database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb</ext-link>). 30290 residues are included into these 97 viral proteins and thus, the ligand/residues ratio was one HLA class II-VACV peptide complex per 1010 residues. Moreover, if only the six different HLA class II core CHIKV ligands detected by mass spectrometry are considered, the CHIKV ratio was one HLA class II Iigand per 208 residues. Similarly, with the 23 different HLA class II core ligands from VACV proteome the equivalent ratio was one HLA class II-VACV ligand per 1317 residues. These six or ten-fold enrichments in HLA class II-restricted ligands from CHIKV proteins versus the respective VACV proteins, that were statistically significant (P value &lt; 0.001, Fisher's exact test), indicate a high immunoprevalence of the HLA class II-restricted cellular immune response against CHIKV structural polyprotein in the vaccine construct.
