 <sub>17-25</sub> ligand. In addition, the prediction of peptide binding using two different computational approaches, the NetMHCpan neural network-based alignment method and the IEDB prediction software, suggested that this CHIKV peptide could be a HLA-B*07:02 high affinity ligand (

 <sub>17-25</sub> ligand bound to HLA-B*07:02 class I molecules with EC
