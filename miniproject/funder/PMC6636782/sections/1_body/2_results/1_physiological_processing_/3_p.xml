<p>To study 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> the physiological relevance of the identified CHIKV CP
 <sub>17-25</sub> ligand, HLA class I-B*07:02 transgenic mice were infected by the i.p route for 7 days with rVACV-CHIKV. Later, a physiological measurement of the functional 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> activity of T cells against this viral ligand was carried out. Spleen cells of infected mice specifically recognized cells that were pulsed with the CHIKV CP
 <sub>17-25</sub> peptide (
