<p>Different HLA class I-bound peptide pools were isolated from large numbers of either uninfected or rVACV-CHIKV-infected cells from the human cell line JY (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007547.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These peptide mixtures were subsequently separated by capillary reversed-phase HPLC and were analyzed on-line using tandem mass spectrometry. No CHIKV peptides were identified after immunoprecipitation of HLA-A*02:01 molecules. By means of bioinformatics tools, one fragmentation spectrum detected in the virus-infected HLA-B*07:02-bound peptide pools (but absent from control uninfected pool), was resolved with high confidence parameters as CHIKV structural polyprotein-derived peptide. This ion peak, with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 375.2, was assigned to the viral amino acid sequence RPWTPRPTI, spanning residues 17â€“25 of the capsid protein (CP) of CHIKV (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This theoretical assignment was confirmed by high similarity with the MS/MS spectrum of the corresponding synthetic peptide (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007547.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Additionally, a database search using human and VACV proteomes failed to identify this spectrum as human or VACV protein fragment, supporting the CHIKV origin of the fragment protein.
