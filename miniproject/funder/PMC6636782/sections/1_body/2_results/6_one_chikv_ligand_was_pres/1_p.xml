<p>Similarly to HLA class I, the HLA-DR-bound peptide pools were isolated from either uninfected or VACV-infected JY cells. The ion peak with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 381.0, absent in the HLA-DR-uninfected pool, was assigned to the viral amino acid sequence PPVIGREKFHSRP, which spans residues 133â€“145 of the CHIKV E2 envelope protein. (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007547.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the database searches with human and VACV proteome also failed to identify this mass spectrometry spectrum, supporting the CHIKV origin of this HLA class II-bound peptide. This theoretical assignment was confirmed by identity with the MS/MS spectrum of the corresponding synthetic peptide (

 <sub>133-145</sub> ligand was carried out. The two bioinformatics methods utilized predicted high affinity values for DRB1*13:01 chain binding but not for other three HLA-DR chains from JY cell line (

As at the present day, these bioinformatics tools are not totally accurate in their predictions, especially to detect the non-canonical ligands, HLA-DRB1*04:04 transgenic mice were infected with rVACV-CHIKV; other HLA class II-transgenic mice were not available. Later, a physiological measurement of the functional 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> activity of T cells against the CHIKV E2
 <sub>133-145</sub> ligand was carried out. Spleen cells of immunized mice specifically recognized cells pulsed with this peptide as part of the acute response to the vaccine utilized (
