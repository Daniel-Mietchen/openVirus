<p>Theoretical binding affinity and allele assignment of the CHIKV E1
 <sub>1-16</sub> peptide was carried out by IEDB and NetMHCpan servers. Both computational approaches predict the 9mer sequence TVIPNTVGV (the same core for HLA-C*07:02 binding) as a high affinity ligand for HLA-C*01:02 class I molecules (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, using the same bioinformatic tools, the 10mer sequence IPNTVGVPYK ranks with a moderate score for binding prediction to HLA-A*03:01 class I molecule (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that CHIKV E1
 <sub>1-16</sub> peptide was most likely a non-canonical HLA-C*07:02 ligand, and even an HLA-A*03:01-bound peptide too.
