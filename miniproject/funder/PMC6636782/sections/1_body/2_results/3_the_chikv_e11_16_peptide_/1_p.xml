<p>Similarly to JY cells, sequential immunoprecipitation of HLA class I molecules was performed using the soluble fraction of cell extracts from the HOM-2 cell line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007547.g001">Fig 1</xref>). No CHIKV peptides were identified after immunoprecipitation of HLA-B*27:05 molecules. In contrast, the same fragmentation spectrum corresponding to CHIKV E1
 <sub>1-16</sub> ligand, previously identified bound to HLA-C*07:02 was obtained from the rVACV-CHIKV-infected W6/32-bound pool of HOM-2 cells. As previous, this spectrum was absent in its control uninfected pool and the earlier immunoprecipitation of HLA-B*27:05 molecules (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the CHIKV E1
 <sub>1-16</sub> peptide was endogenously processed and presented by HLA-A*03:01 and/or HLA-C*01:02 class I molecules in rVACV-CHIKV-infected cells.
