<p>O'nyong-nyong virus is closely related to CHIKV, as long as mAbs specific for CHIKV recognized most of O'nyong-nyong virus antigenic sites, albeit mAbs against O'nyong-nyong virus do not recognized the CHIKV particles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, to evaluate the possible cross-reactivity at cellular immune response level, an amino acid sequence comparison was carried out for the HLA class I and II ligands, identified by mass spectrometry, from CHIKV with the representative Igbo Ora strain of O'nyong-nyong virus. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows that only the E2
 <sub>351-358</sub> ligand sequence was conserved between both related alphaviruses. In addition, although the E1
 <sub>1-16</sub> ligand presents a change in P4 position versus the respective O'nyong-nyong virus sequence, this mutation could not alter the predicted binding of this peptide to HLA class I molecules as suggest from the bioinformatic tools (Tables 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In summary, the HLA molecules mainly binds not conserved peptides of CHIKV compared to O'nyong-nyong virus, in accordance with the 86% of amino acid identity of proteins between both virus. Thus, this analysis suggests that the crossreactivity of CHIKV HLA ligands from rVACV-CHIKV against homologous proteins from O'nyong-nyong virus would be unlikely.
