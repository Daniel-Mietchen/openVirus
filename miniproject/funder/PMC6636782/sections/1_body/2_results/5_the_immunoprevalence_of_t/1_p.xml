<p>In this study, four different natural HLA class I-CHIKV peptide complexes, each one restricted by the HLA class I molecules HLA-A*03:01, HLA-B*07:02, HLA-C*01:02, and HLA-C*07:02, were found (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007547.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The CHIKV structural genes, inserted into the TK locus of the VACV genome, encode for 1248 amino acids. Thus, the ratio was one HLA class I-CHIKV peptide complexes per 312 residues. Similarly, we found other 73 natural HLA class I-VACV peptide complexes and the proteome of the WR strain of VACV contains 56795 residues and thus, their ratio was one HLA class I-VACV peptide complexes per 778 residues. Although the ratio is a little more than double in CHIKV than in VACV proteins, however this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, if only the two different HLA class I CHIKV ligands detected by mass spectrometry are considered, the CHIKV ratio was one HLA class I Iigand per 624 residues. Similarly, with the 69 fragmentation spectra from VACV proteome the equivalent ratio was one HLA class I-VACV ligand per 823 residues. Thus, the ligands to which HLA class I antigen processing and presentation are addressed to, that is, the immunoprevalence of the HLA class I-restricted cellular immune response against CHIKV structural polyprotein was comparable with a well-established poxvirus vaccine.
