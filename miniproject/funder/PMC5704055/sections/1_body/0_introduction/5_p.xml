 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Primary human dermal fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells have been shown to be susceptible to ZIKV infection

 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Hamel et al., 2015</xref>). DC-SIGN (Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin) and members of TIM and TAM family of receptors, particularly AXL and Tyro3 have been also shown to facilitate infection and blocking antibodies to these receptors prevent infection, suggesting that they might serve as entry receptors (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Hamel et al., 2015</xref>). Primary human neuronal stem cells and astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, and microglia cells have also been shown to be susceptible to infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Retallack et al., 2016</xref>). Other 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that primary human placental cells and explants-cytotrophoblasts, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, Hofbauer cells in chorionic villi, amniotic epithelial cells and trophoblast progenitors can also be infected (
