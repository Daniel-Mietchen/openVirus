<p id="p0125">DRAG mice are devoid of murine T, B and NK cells (
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Danner et al., 2011</xref>), and thus presumably, non-humanized DRAG mice should not be able to elicit any antibody response. To confirm that mouse IgG did not contribute to the antibody response against Zika virus, we immunized non-humanized DRAG mice (without HSC (hematopoietic stem cells) injection) with full-length DNA vaccine, and 4Â weeks later, tested the sera for murine antibody response by ELISA using non-immunized DRAG mouse sera as negative control. No ZIKV-specific antibody response was found in these mice (
