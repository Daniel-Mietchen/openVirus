<p id="p0135">To evaluate human cell types that support infection, spleens of control and vaccinated mice were pooled into 3 groups (5 mice each treatment, 2 mice each were pooled into 2 groups, and 1 mice for third group). The CD45Â + human cells were first isolated, followed by isolation of human T cells and B cells were further isolated using Miltenyi beads. The T and B cell-depleted cell population was considered to be mostly myeloid cells. The purities of the three cell types range from 95 to 99% (data not shown). All three populations were intracellularly stained for ZIKV E protein and examined by flow cytometry. The myeloid cells and surprisingly, B cell population from control mice were positive for E protein, whereas all cell types from the vaccinated mice were negative (
