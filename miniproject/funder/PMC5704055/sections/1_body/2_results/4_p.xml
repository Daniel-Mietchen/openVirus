 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Larocca et al., 2016</xref>) and full-length prM-E (AAs 126–794) coding sequence were used for DNA vaccines. We therefore tested both of these forms for E protein expression. We synthesized the prM-E of ZIKV (strain PRVABC59) and cloned it into a mammalian expression vector pTTVH8G. These constructs were transfected into 293 T cells and after 48 h, cells were stained with ZIKV-E protein specific antibody and examined by flow cytometry. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, both partial prM-E and full-length prM-E containing plasmid-transfected cells expressed E protein, although full-length prM-E expression was somewhat higher. We also tested the supernatants from transfected cell culture for antigenicity by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). We found no significant difference between the partial and full-length constructs in terms of protein E specificity (Supplementary Fig. 1.). We further confirmed PrM-E protein expression by Western Blot (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, we used the full-length plasmid for further studies.
