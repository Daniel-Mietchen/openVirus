<p id="p0140">Human myeloid cells especially macrophages were reported to be infected with ZIKV (
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Quicke et al., 2016</xref>), but we find that B cells are also infected. To further confirm B cell infection, we infected another set of DRAG mice (n = 4) and collected blood at day 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8. The PBMCs were then stained with ZIKV E and B cell-specific antibody. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A and Supplementary Fig. 6, the ZIKV E stained B cells were strongest at day 3, similar to the viral load curve in the sera as described in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C. To investigate whether human B cells could be infected by ZIKV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, CD19 + B cells were isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and then activated using human B cell expansion kit. One million activated B cells were then infected with ZIKV at a dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu for 4 h, followed by extensive washing to remove free virus, at which time cells were cultured in fresh medium. Supernatants were collected at days 0, 1, 3, 5, 8 and were tested for viral load by RT-PCR. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B, the viral RNA in the supernatants steadily increased with time, peaking at day 3–5, and then began to decline. To test for replicating virus, we examined B cells for ZIKV negative strand RNA by a two-step RT PCR. For this, 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> B cells were collected at different days after infection and cellular RNA was tested for ZIKV negative strand RNA. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C, a 150 bp PCR product amplified from the ZIKV negative strand RNA could be seen at days 1, 3, 5 and 8 after infection but not in uninfected cells. It is worth noting that viral RNA was undetectable after 3 days of ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in resting (non-activated) B cells (Supplementary Fig. 7), implicating that activation of B cells may promote expression of cellular receptors for ZIKV infection.
