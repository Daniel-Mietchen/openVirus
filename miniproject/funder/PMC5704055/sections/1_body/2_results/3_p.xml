<p id="p0110">To generate humanized mice, DRAG mice were irradiated (350 gy) and intravenously injected with human DR4 + CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from fetal liver (obtained from Advanced Biosciences Inc.). Twelve weeks later, PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) obtained from retro orbital bleeding were tested for human immune cell reconstitution by flow cytometry using human-specific antibodies. Human CD45 + cells in the spleen constituted ~ 50% and included CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, monocytes and dendritic cells (

 <sup>4</sup> PFU (Plaque forming units) per mouse), disease progression was monitored daily and sera collected at days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8 for viral load detection. ZIKV infection did not cause any significant symptoms or weight changes in infected mice when compared with uninfected mice (n = 2), however, infected mice did present with detectable viremia during an 8-day-follow-up period with peak viral load averaging 8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> viral copies/ml at day 3, indicating effective viral replication in these mice (
