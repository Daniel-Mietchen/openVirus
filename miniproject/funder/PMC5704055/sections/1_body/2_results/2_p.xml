<p id="p0105">While routinely used humanized mouse models, including BLT mice are good models to test for efficacy of drugs and gene therapy, they do not permit testing of vaccination approaches due to poor antibody response including class-switching. However, in recently described DRAG mice, which lack murine class II, but transgenically express human HLA-DR4, antibody response including class switching is robust (
