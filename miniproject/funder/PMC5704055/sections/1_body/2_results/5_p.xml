<p id="p0120">DRAG mice were then immunized with a control plasmid (pTTVH8G vector only) or ZIKV DNA vaccine (100 μg per mouse) intramuscularly. The vaccination was repeated 3 weeks later. Sera collected 3 weeks after the first and second immunization was tested for ZIKV E protein-specific human IgG antibodies by ELISA using Alpha Diagnostic human ZIKV Envelope ELISA kit (with IgG-specific secondary antibody). As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, human E protein-specific antibodies were detected following the second immunization. The sera were then tested for ZIKV neutralizing antibodies using previously described microneutralization assay (

 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Larocca et al., 2016</xref>). Significant titers of neutralizing antibodies were also detected after the second immunization (

We further determined specific antibody isotypes development in DRAG mice after ZIKV vaccine immunization using Iso-gold rapid human antibody isotyping kit (Bioassay Works LLC, Ijamsville, MD) in pooled sera from twice immunized animals. The results demonstrated that all isotypes, including IgG (subclasses IgG 1, 2, 3), Ig A and IgM were present in the sera (Supplementary Fig. 3).
