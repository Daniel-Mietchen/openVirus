<p id="p0090">The above-purified immune cells were treated with fixation/permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences) for 30 min, then intracellularly stained with mouse anti-Flavivirus mAb for 1 h, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min. Then, the cells were washed once with FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS), then respectively stained with fluorescence-labeled human CD19, CD3 and CD14 antibody, and the cells were counted by flow cytometry.</p>
