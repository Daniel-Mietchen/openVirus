<p id="p0085">The spleens harvested from DRAG mice were mashed and filtered through a 40 μm strainer twice. Then the human cells (CD45 + cells) were isolated using mouse/human chimera isolation kit (StemCell Technologies). Next, the human cells were used to isolate B cells using CD19 positive selection kit (StemCell Technologies), the rest of cells were used to further isolate CD3 + T cells with CD3 positive selection kit, and the final subpool of the cells were considered as myeloid cells. After isolation, the cells were checked for purity by staining with CD19, CD3 and CD14 antibodies respectively (The purities of the three cell types range from 95 to 99%, data not shown).</p>
