<p id="p0080">Neutralizing activity of mouse sera was determined using a ZIKV microneutralization (MN) assay as described previously (
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abbink et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Larocca et al., 2016</xref>) with small modifications. In brief, serial dilutions of mouse sera were incubated with 100 μL of ZIKV PRVABC59 (containing 100 PFU of viruses) at 35 °C for 2 h. Next, the antibody-virus mixtures were added to overnight-cultured Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated for 4–5 days until the CPE developed. The cells were fixed with ethanol/methanol (1:1), then stained with mouse-anti flavivirus antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody, and then developed by adding TMB substrate. The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded. The neutralizing titers were calculated as the average of mouse sera (triplicates for each serum) and presented as the reciprocal of serum dilution yielding 50% inhibition of the OD450 (compared with preimmune mouse serum values) after plotting the data with Sigmaplot software using a polynomial regression (quadratic) curve-fitting model (
