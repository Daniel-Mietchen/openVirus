<p id="p0060">Human B cells were isolated from human PBMCs using CD19 positive selection kit, then were activated and expanded with B cell expansion kit for 4 days. The activated B cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) were infected 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu of ZIKV for 4 h, following which the cells were extensively washed to remove free virus and cultured with fresh medium. The supernatants and aliquots of B cells were collected at days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8. A two-step RT-PCR was used to detect the negative strand RNA. Cellular RNA was extracted as described earlier, and reverse transcribed using the forward primer complementary to the viral negative strand. The RT primer sequence is as follows: ggaggattccggattgtcaat. Reverse transcription was performed according the protocol of SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA). The RT reactions were then treated at 95 °C for 10 mins to inactivate the enzyme. The PCR was then performed using the following primer pair: forward primer “ggaggattccggattgtcaat” and reverse primer “tgccgtgaatctcaaaaaggc”, which target a 150-bp-long fragment at the conserved region of capsid gene negative strand.
