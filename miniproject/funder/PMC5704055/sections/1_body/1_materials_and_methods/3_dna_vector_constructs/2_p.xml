<p id="p0045">ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (Genbank Accession number: KU501215.1) was used to design the DNA vaccine plasmid. Full-length pre-membrane and envelope gene (PrM-E, defined as amino acids 126–794 of the ZIKV polyprotein) or short version of PrM-E (216–794), as described in 
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Larocca et al., 2016</xref> were mammalian codon optimized, synthesized (Genscript, NJ) and cloned into mammalian expression vector pTTVH8G driven by the CMV immediate early promoter for mammalian expression. A Kozak sequence and a Japanese encephalitis (JE) signaling sequence were also included. The plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and amplified in E.coli DH5α, and the plasmid was prepared with Qiagen
