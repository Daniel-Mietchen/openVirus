<p id="p0055">ZIKV viral loads were determined by quantitative RT-PCR assay using RNA extracted from cells or serum. Briefly, cellular RNA was extracted with RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) and the serum RNA was extracted using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the RNA concentration were determined by Nanodrop. The Zika virus RT-PCR detection kit was purchased from Primerdesign Ltd., UK and quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed according the manufacturer's instructions. The viral loads were calculated as copy numbers per ml according to the standard curve.</p>
