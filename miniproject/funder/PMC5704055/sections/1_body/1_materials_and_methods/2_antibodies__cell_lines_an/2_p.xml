FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma Inc. (MO, USA). Fluorescence-labeled anti-human CD45, CD4, CD19, CD14 and CD11c antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (CA, USA). Vero cells (strain Vero 76, clone E6, RRID:

 <sub>2</sub>. ZIKV (strain PRVABC59) was obtained from ATCC. The viral stocks were produced by infecting Vero cells in the laboratory using an MOI (Multiplicity of infection) of 0.01. The supernatants were collected at day 4–5, then clarified, filtered, aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C. These viral stocks were used for FRNT (focus reduction neutralization test) neutralization assays and mice challenge.
