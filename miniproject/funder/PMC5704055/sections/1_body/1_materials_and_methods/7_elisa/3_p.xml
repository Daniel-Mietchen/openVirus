<p id="p0070">To determine ZIKV protein E specificity of the vaccine constructs, 2 μg of full or short versions of DNA constructs were transfected into 293 T cells cultured in 12-well plates. After 3 days, the culture supernatants were collected and 100 μL of each (triplicate) were coated into 96-well immune plate overnight. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk (in PBS) for 2 h, the primary antibody ZV-67 (ZIKV E protein DIII region-specific, purchased from absolute antibody Inc., UK) were added for 1 h, followed by HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. The color was then developed with TMB substrate, and OD450 were recorded as described earlier.</p>
