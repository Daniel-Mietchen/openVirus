<p id="p0065">The antibody titers in the DRAG mouse sera were determined by ELISA. To determine the ZIKV-specific IgG from human cells, the Human ZIKV Envelope ELISA kits were used, while mouse ZIKV Envelope ELISA kits were used for test the mouse ZIKV-specific IgG. Both ELISA kits were purchased from Alpha Diagnostic International, TX, USA. 96-well plates coated with ZIKV Env protein were first equilibrated at room temperature with 300 μL of kit working wash buffer for 5 min, then 1:20 dilution of DRAG mouse sera were added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing 4 times with wash buffer, 100 μL of HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (or anti-mouse IgG if testing the mouse antibody) was then added to each well and the plates incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were then washed 6 times, developed with 100 μL of TMB substrate for 15 min at room temperature then stopped by adding 100 μL of stop solution. OD450 measurements were then recorded on a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader. Antibody titers were expressed as thresholds of OD of 1 U/mL calibrator (&gt; 1 threshold was considered as positive) and calculated according to the Manufacturer's instructions, and all data are reported as the average of three measurements.</p>
