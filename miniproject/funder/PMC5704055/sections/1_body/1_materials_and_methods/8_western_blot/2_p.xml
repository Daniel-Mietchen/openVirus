<p id="p0075">To assess the PrM-E expression of the vaccine constructs and the E protein specificity, cell lysates were collected after 72 h from PEI-transfected 293 T cells. The lysates were treated with lysis buffer, heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and then run on a precast 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel (BioRad, CA, USA). The gel was then transferred onto a PVDF membrane and then blocked overnight with 5% skim milk in PBS. The membrane was incubated with the primary antibody ZV-67 (1:2000) for 2 h, followed by washing 4 times using PBS-T buffer. Then, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG (HRP-labeled, 1:5000) for 1 h. After washing away the unbound secondary antibody with PBS-T for 5 times, the color was developed by using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (ThermoFisher, CA, USA).</p>
