<p id="p0050">Humanized DRAG mice (NSG mice transgenic for human DR4, RRID: IMSR_JAX:017914) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and bred in TTUHSC animal facility. To increase scientific rigor where ever possible, experiments have been done in a blinded manner and to exclude sex bias, each experiment contains equal number of male and female mice. To generate humanized DRAG mice, animals were irradiated with a dose of 350 cGy and injected intravenously with 0.2 million of DR4 positive HSCs isolate from the fetal liver (Advanced Bioscience Inc.). After 10–12 weeks, the reconstitution will be confirmed by flow cytometry by staining the PBMCs with human CD45, CD3, CD4 and CD8. After confirming successful reconstitution, the DRAG mice were immunized intramuscularly (IM) by injection of 100 μg of plasmid DNA twice at week 0 and week 3. Sera collected at weeks 0, 3 and 6 were used for ELISA and Microneutralization assay. For ZIKV challenge, both unimmunized and immunized male and female DRAG mice were intraperitoneally administrated with 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of ZIKV strain PRVABC59. Three days after challenge, the animals were sacrificed, and the blood as well as spleen cells were collected for immunostaining assay. Also, the blood cells and sera were used to extract RNA for quantitative RT-PCR to determine the viral loads.
