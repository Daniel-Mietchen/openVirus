<p id="p0150">A number of Zika vaccine candidates have been tested in various animal models from mouse to monkey as has been previously described (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kublin and Whitney, 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Ming et al., 2016</xref>). Monkey models have experimental limitations such as high cost and difficulty in obtaining a large number of animals for a significant study, while the commonly used immunodeficient AG129 mice do not generate sufficient cellular and humoral immunity due to lack of IFN α/β/γ receptors. Moreover, they do not allow testing the human immune response. Humanized BLT mice have been used to test vaccine efficacy (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Lavender et al., 2013</xref>), but in the commonly used BLT and similar models, the antibody response is weak and fails to switch class to IgG isotypes. Here we have shown that in the humanized DRAG mice, all kinds of immune cells including T cells, B cells, macrophages and DCs develop normally, and after vaccination, human ZIKV E-protein-specific antibodies of different Ig isotypes could be detected. Therefore, our results showed that DRAG is a potentially attractive animal model for testing human immune response to vaccine candidates.
