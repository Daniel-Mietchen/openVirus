<p id="p0155">We used PrM-E (AA 126–794) as an immunogen in our DNA vaccine construct, differing from the ones used by either

 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Larocca et al. (2016)</xref> (AA 216–794). It has been reported that flaviviral PrM-E proteins can assemble together to form subviral particles, though such virus like particles are non-infectious, they are structurally similar to infectious virions (

 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Ferlenghi et al., 2001</xref>), and are potentially important for eliciting a potent neutralizing antibody response. By careful examination of the PrM-E protein sequence, we found that there is a potential Golgi proteolytic cleavage site (Normally contains RR, KK or RK, as found in other flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Stocks and Lobigs, 1998</xref>)) at R127 and R128, thus it is highly likely that the start amino acid of propeptide is from R128, suggesting that AA 123–127 may not be necessary for propeptide generation (although this remains untested). Nevertheless, our construct expressed ZIKV E protein — the major immunogenic component of the vaccine — as demonstrated by flow cytometry, ELISA, as well as Western blot after transfection of 293 T cells. Thus, we believe that our construct does not disturb correct expression and folding of the immunogen. It is worth noting that proteins of full length (which encoding AA 126–794) and shorter version (which encoding AA 216–794) constructs have the same size (around 60 kDa), indicating the successful cleavage at the furin cleavage site (AA 212–215, residues RSRR) after expression.
