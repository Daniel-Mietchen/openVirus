<p id="p0160">Among cells of the immune system, we have shown that in addition to myeloid cells, B cells also potentially support ZIKV infection. Even though we showed evidences of B cell infection in cell culture and humanized mouse model, it must be cautioned, however, that there is always a possibility that studies in experimental models may not necessarily reflect the situation in humans. Particularly, we cannot exclude the possibility that in the scenarios of either cell culture or humanized mouse model, the susceptible human cell types for Zika infection is highly restricted, thus distinct from the clinical situation in ZIKV infection. Therefore, the relevance of B cell infection as it pertains to clinical ZIKV infection remains to be further dissected. In addition, if the B cell infection indeed occurs in humans, whether the virus remains in memory B cells and seeds other tissues such as testis remains to be tested in future experiments.</p>
