  <p>Characterization of humanized DRAG mice and ZIKV infection. (A) Irradiated DRAG mice were intravenously injected with DR4-matched human CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Twelve week later, PBMCs were stained with indicated human antibodies to verify reconstitution of T (human CD3 and CD4/or CD8 positive) and B cells (human CD19 positive), monocytes (human CD14 positive) and dendritic cells (human CD11c positive). (B) DRAG mice were intramuscularly administrated with 1 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu of ZIKV (strain PRVABC59, n = 4), and the uninfected mice (n = 2) were used as negative control. The sera were collected at days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8 to extract viral RNA and ZIKV RT-PCR was performed to determine the viral load.
