  <p>Confirmation of B cell infection 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>. DRAG mice were infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu of ZIKV and blood collected at days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8. The PBMCs were stained with fluoro-labeled anti-humnan-CD45, CD20 and anti-ZIKV E antibodies. (A) A representative flow cytometric data of ZIKV infected B cells (CD20 and ZIKV E double positive cells) at indicated time points are shown. (B, C) Human B cells were isolated from human PBMCs using CD19 positive selection kit, then were activated and expanded with B cell expansion kit for 4 days. The activated B cells (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> cells) were infected 1 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu of ZIKV for 4 h, following which the cells were extensively washed to remove free virus and cultured in fresh medium. The supernatants and aliquots of B cells were collected at days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8. RNA extracted from the supernatants at indicated time points were tested for ZIKV by RT-PCR (B) and the cellular RNAs were tested for the presence of ZIKV negative strand RNA by two step RT-PCR to test for replicating virus (C). Lane 1: RNA from uninfected B cells; Lane 2–6: RNA from infected B cells sampled at days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 8; Lane 7: RNA from infected humanized DRAG mouse sera served as negative control; Lane 8: RNA from infected humanized DRAG mouse myeloid cells served as positive control.
