  <p>ZIKV DNA vaccine induces antibody response in humanized DRAG mice.</p>
  <p>(A) DNA vaccines encoding either a full-length or a short form of PrM-E gene were transfected into 293 T cells and the cells stained with ZIKV E antibody after 48 h. Representative flow cytometric data (left) and cumulative data on MFI from 3 independent experiments (right) are shown. Histograms from left to right represent vector control, partial PrM-E, and full length PrM-E respectively. Red histograms represent isotype control and blue histograms represent staining with E protein antibody. (B) DRAG mice were intraperitoneally administrated with 100 μg of full- length PrM-E DNA vaccine and boosted at week 3. Sera obtained at week 0 (preimmune), 3 and 6, were tested in triplicate for E-specific antibody response by ELISA. Each symbol represents mean of triplicate from individual mouse. (C) Pre-immune and vaccine boosted sera were tested for ZIKV neutralizing antibodies by microneutralization assay. The neutralizing titers were presented as the reciprocal of serum dilution yielding 50% inhibition of the OD450 (compared with preimmune mouse serum values).</p>
