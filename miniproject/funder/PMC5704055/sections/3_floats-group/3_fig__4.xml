  <p>Susceptibility of different human immune cells to ZIKV infection. Control and DNA vaccine-immunized mice were challenged with ZIKV and after 3 days, human cells (CD45 +) were first isolated from the pooled spleens as described in the text (5 mice each treatment, 2 mice each were pooled into 2 groups, and 1 mice for third group). B cells (panel B), T cells (panel A) and myeloid cells (panel C) were further isolated and respectively stained with fluoro-labeled anti-E antibody (intracellular staining) together with fluoro-labeled anti-CD20, CD3 and CD14 (surface staining), and analyzed by flow cytometry. A representative flow cytometric data from each of 3 pools (left) and cumulative data from all mice tested (right) is shown. (D) The indicated isolated immune cell pools were tested in triplicate for ZIK viral load by qRT-PCR. Each symbol represents mean of triplicates from individual pools.</p>
