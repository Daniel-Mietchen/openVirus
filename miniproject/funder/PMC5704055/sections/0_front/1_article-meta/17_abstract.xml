 <p>A Zika virus vaccine requires testing in human immune cells to determine its effectiveness. In this communication, we report that a DNA vaccine encoding Zika prM and E protein is able to elicit protective neutralizing antibodies against Zika virus in humanized DRAG mice, and that human myeloid cells and B cells are primary targets of Zika virus.</p>
