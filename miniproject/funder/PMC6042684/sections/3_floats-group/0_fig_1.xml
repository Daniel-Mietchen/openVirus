  <title>Distribution of countries according to R. A. Mashelkar.</title>
  <p>Developed, industrialized nations occupy the top-right quadrant; less developed countries the bottom-left quadrant. Countries of high economic strength due to abundant natural resources (such as the oil-exporters rich countries of the Middle East) occupy the top-left position. The lower-right quadrant was regarded by Mashelkar as the most interesting as it was home of countries with high S&amp;T capacity but at the turn of the century relatively weak from an economic point of view.
