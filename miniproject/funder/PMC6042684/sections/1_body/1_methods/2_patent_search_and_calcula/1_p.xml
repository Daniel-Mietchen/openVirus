In the present study we refined this approach by dividing the total number of patents filed by each country under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) by their respective GNI or GDP per capita. Countries that were not considered high income economies by the World Bank (GNI per capita higher than US$ 12,476 in 2015) but in our analysis ranked among the top 25 innovative nations, fit the IDC category.
