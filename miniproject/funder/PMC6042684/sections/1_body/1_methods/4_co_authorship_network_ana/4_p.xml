<p>After processing, data was formatted into adjacency matrixes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006469.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] by VantagePoint to map co-authorship relationships between countries. Matrixes were imported into the open-source software Gephi [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006469.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for network visualization and calculation of centrality metrics. For the spatial visualization of the international collaboration networks, country affiliation data were manually geocoded and processed using the “GeoLayout” and “Map of Countries” plugins available within Gephi. In these networks, nodes represent countries, and two or more countries were connected if their members shared the authorship of one or more papers. As co-authorship requires reciprocal cooperation among the participants, all connections have been considered as non-directional.
