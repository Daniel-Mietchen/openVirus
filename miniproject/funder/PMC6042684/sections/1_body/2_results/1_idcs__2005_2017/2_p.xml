<p>We also explored the characteristics of our metrics in two additional ways. Firstly, using both the Gross National Income (GNI) per capita and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. GDP measures total output produced, based on location, focused on domestic production and represents the strength of a country’s economy, while GNI measures the total income received, based on ownership, focused on income generated by citizens and represents economic strength of country’s nationals. We found that interchanging GDP for GNI did not significantly alter the final results and rankings (Supporting Information

As we are particularly interested in the country residence of the patent applicant and in the income generated by the residents of that country, we adopted GNI per capita as the default. Secondly, using specific patent classes in the calculations, therefore selecting and delineating areas of technology or products of interest, allowed the detection of those countries that are more active in a given “product space” [
