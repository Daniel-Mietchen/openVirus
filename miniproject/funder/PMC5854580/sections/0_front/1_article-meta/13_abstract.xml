 <p id="Par1">Seasonal influenza vaccines have proven to be effective against well-matched viruses in healthy adults. However, rapid accumulation of mutations in the main antigenic surface proteins of influenza can compromise the efficiency of flu vaccines. Occasionally, influenza pandemics arise and present a different type of challenge to current seasonal vaccines. Novel vaccination strategies that can educate the host immune system to generate immune responses focusing on conserved epitopes on theses antigenic surface proteins are crucial for controlling and limiting influenza epidemics and pandemics. In this study, we have sequentially vaccinated mice with heterosubtypic influenza HA virus-like particles (VLPs) harboring H1, H8, and H13 from the HA phylogenetic group 1, or H3, H4, and H10 from the HA phylogenetic group 2, or in various combinations. The immunized animals were fully protected when challenged with lethal doses of heterosubtypic viruses from either phylogenetic group. Our vaccination approach demonstrates a promising strategy for the development of a ‘universal influenza vaccine’.</p>
