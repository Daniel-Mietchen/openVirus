  <p>rVet and rSH- specific serum IgG/IgG subtype endpoint titers and intracellular ELISA. Endpoint titers are expressed as the highest dilution of serum having a mean OD
   <sub>450</sub> greater than the mean plus 2 standard deviation of similarly diluted naïve serum samples. For intracellular ELISA, MDCK cells were exposed to Cal09 or Phi82 virions, used as antigens in the ELISA. After permeabilization, MDCK cells were incubated with diluted sera, followed by detection with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Figure represents (
   <bold>i</bold>) rVet-specific (
   <bold>A</bold>) IgG, (
   <bold>B</bold>) IgG1, (
   <bold>C</bold>) IgG2a, and (
   <bold>D</bold>) IgG2b; (
   <bold>ii</bold>) rSH-specific (
   <bold>E</bold>) IgG, (
   <bold>F</bold>) IgG1, (
   <bold>G</bold>) IgG2a, and (
   <bold>H</bold>) IgG2b; and (
   <bold>iii</bold>) (
   <bold>I</bold>) Cal09-specific and (
   <bold>J</bold>) Phi82-specific IgG levels in sera. Results are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 5). (*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.001, ns-non-significant).
