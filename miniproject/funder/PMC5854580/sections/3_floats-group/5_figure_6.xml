   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) IL-6, and (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) IFN-γ were evaluated in the lung samples after the virus challenges. Lung samples were prepared on day 4 post-challenge and the cytokines were estimated by ELISA. Results are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 5). (*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01).
