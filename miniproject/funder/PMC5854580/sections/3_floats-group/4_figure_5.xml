  <p>Estimation of cytokine levels. Splenocytes were isolated from immunized mice 3 week after the final immunization. Cells (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>) were seeded into 96-well culture plates. The inactivated rVet or rSH viruses were added into each well and secreted (
   <bold>A</bold>) IL-2, (
   <bold>B</bold>) IFN-γ, (
   <bold>C</bold>) IL-4, and (
   <bold>D</bold>) TNF-α levels were determined as described in materials and methods. Results are represented as the mean ± SD (n = 5). (*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01).
