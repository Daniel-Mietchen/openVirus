  <p>Characterization of purified VLPs. Figure represents Western blot of (
   <bold>A</bold>) HA and (
   <bold>B</bold>) M1 proteins in the different VLPs. Total HA and M1 contents in the prepared VLPs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot using mouse anti-influenza HA and anti-M1 antibodies, respectively, (
   <bold>C</bold>) Negative staining electron micrographs of different influenza HA VLPs. Bars represent ∼100 nm.
