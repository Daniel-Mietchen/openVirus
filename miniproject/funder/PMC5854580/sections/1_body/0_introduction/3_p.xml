<p id="Par4">Although tremendous efforts are under way, no universal influenza vaccine has been fully developed. While broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are ideal for protective immunity and the generation of such antibodies could result in universal protection, they are rare and difficult to produce via vaccination. Vaccinations with the seasonal vaccine formulations typically skew the specificity of B cell responses towards strain-specific epitopes. The generation of bnAb immune responses relies on guiding the human immune system to recognize conserved but not strain-specific epitopes. The induction of bnAbs via vaccination thus must educate the host immune system to ignore the highly immunogenic strain-specific epitopes but to focus on the less immunogenic conserved ones
