 </sup>. These studies into optimal immunogen designs and iterative antigenic exposure provide important novel insights into the development of immune responses for creating a successful ‘universal influenza vaccine’. These observations strongly suggest that sequential infections or vaccinations play a central role in the induction of broadly cross-reactive antibodies. In the present report, we have designed a cross-subtypic sequential vaccination strategy with different subtypic influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) containing HA from H1N1, H8N4, H13N6 (HA phylogenetic group 1) or H3N2, H4N6, and H10N2 (HA phylogenetic group 2) viral strains or in combination, to elicit broad protection against divergent viruses in the same HA phylogenetic group or both groups.
