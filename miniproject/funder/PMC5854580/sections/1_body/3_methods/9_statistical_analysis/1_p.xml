<p id="Par27">The data for virus-specific antibody levels, HAI titers, and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by paired student t-tests (n = 5). All the experiments 
 <italic>with five mice in each group (n</italic> = 
 <italic>5)</italic> were done three times independently to check the reproducibility and the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Survival differences were evaluated by Log Rank Mantel-Cox test. Levels of significance (P value) were compared between PBS, and the other vaccination groups. Tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (San Diego, CA, USA). P values of &lt;0.05 (P &lt; 0.05) were statistically significant.
