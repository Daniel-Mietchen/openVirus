 </sup>. The rVet and rSH viruses were kindly gifted from Dr. Sang-Moo Kang, Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA. The reassortant viruses contain HA and NA genes from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) and A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) viruses but remaining backbone genes from A/Puerto Rico/08/1934 (H1N1). The LD
 <sub>50</sub> (Lethal dose inducing 50% mortality) and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (Tissue culture infectious dose infecting 50% cells) of these strains were determined by infection of mice with serial viral dilutions and calculated by the Reed and Muench method.
