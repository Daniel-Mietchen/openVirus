<p id="Par20">The recombinant baculoviruses (rBVs) expressing M1 and full-length HA genes from A/PR/08/1934 (H1N1), A/Aichi/02/1968 (H3N2), A/mallard/Netherlands/01/1999 (H4N6), A/mallard/Sweden/24/2002 (H8N4), A/mallard/Sweden/51/2002 (H10N2), and A/black-headed gull/Sweden/1/1999 (H13N6) (BEI resources, Manassas, VA, USA), were generated using the Bac-to-Bac insect cell protein expression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Influenza VLPs (HA/M1 VLPs) were produced by co-infection of SF9 cells with rBVs expressing HA and M1 as described previously at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 4 and 2, respectively

 </sup>. The VLP protein concentration was determined by MicroBCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The HA, and M1 protein profiles in VLPs were analyzed by Western blot using HA-specific (BEI resources, Manassas, VA, USA) or M1-specific (Serotec, Kidlington, UK) antibodies. Total endotoxin or bio-containment levels were analyzed by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test. A quantitative ELISA was done as described previously to determine HA contents in VLPs, using recombinant HA (Sino Biological Inc., North Wales, PA, USA) as the calibration standards
