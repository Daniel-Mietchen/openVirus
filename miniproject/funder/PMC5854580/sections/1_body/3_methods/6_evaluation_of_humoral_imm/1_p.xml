 </sup>. Briefly, MDCK cells were grown on 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates (Nunc-Immuno Plate Maxisorp; Nunc Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland), and exposed to Cal09 or Phi82 virions at MOI of 5 PFU/cell. After removing the unbound viruses, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. After permeabilizing and blocking the cells, serially diluted sera were added to each well. For ELISA or intracellular ELISA, color was developed using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgA antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA). The optical density at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450</sub>) was read with an ELISA reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The highest dilution which gave an OD
 <sub>450</sub> two-fold higher than that of the naïve group without dilution was determined as the antibody endpoint titer.
