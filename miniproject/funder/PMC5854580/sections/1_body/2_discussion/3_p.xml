<p id="Par16">Following infection or vaccination, the induction of protective immunity against invading pathogens depends on the generation of an appropriate type of immune response through affinity maturation which is the key in generating bnAbs. Affinity maturation takes place in germinal centers (GC) where antigens are transferred by antigen-presenting cells (APCs)

 </sup>. During antigen presentation to B cells, somatic hypermutation occurs and B cells with higher affinity are screened and later differentiate into memory B cells

 </sup>. When stimulated with similar antigen, these memory B cells quickly amplify and secret bnAbs to clear the specific antigen. This strategy is difficult to apply when dealing with highly variable antigens, such as those found on influenza virus or HIV. Influenza’s HA stalk domain is very conserved but heavily masked by the highly variable head domain
