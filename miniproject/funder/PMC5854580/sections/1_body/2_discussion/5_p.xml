<p id="Par18">In the current report, we have sequentially immunized mice with native influenza HA VLPs mimicking the natural structure of the stalk domain and then challenged with live viruses. Our results demonstrate that sequentially immunized animals generated broader antibody responses and showed complete protection against various homosubtypic and heterosubtypic influenza viruses. Our results demonstrate that using multiple antigen variants with high genetic diversity can elicit bnAbs, demonstrated by the increased serum neutralizing activity. Similar studies of influenza virus has also found that immune or infection history profoundly affects broadly protective B cell immune responses

 </sup>. In conclusion, sequential immunizatons with diverse HA VLPs educate the host immune system to generate broad reactive immunity conferring immune protection against challenges by different viruses in mice.
