 </sup>. While almost all antibodies elicited to a traditional vaccine are strain-specific and head-domain-specific, most of the bnAbs discovered react with the stalk domain. Researchers have begun to focus their efforts on designing an antigen that can elicit stalk-specific bnAbs because the stalk domain is highly conserved between HA antigens of different subtypes
