<p id="Par15">Many research teams have sought to create a ‘universal vaccine’ by inducing responses to shared conserved epitopes, including bnAbs, that could provide long-lasting protective immunity to multiple viral strains. However, the generation of broadly reactive responses towards the conserved epitopes on HA is the main obstacle to the development of a ‘universal vaccine’. The idea behind sequential vaccination is to divert the host’s immune response from dominant-but-variable epitopes to more conserved antigenic sites. In the current report, we have evaluated sequential
