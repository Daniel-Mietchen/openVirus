<p id="Par9">Because influenza viruses infect hosts through the respiratory tract, it is essential to evaluate mucosal immune responses. Two-weeks after the final immunization, nasal, tracheal, and lung washes were collected from the vaccinated animals and rVet and rSH-specific IgA levels were measured in nasal, tracheal, and lung secretions. The levels of nasal IgA against rVet in group 1 were found to be significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than that of group 3, and comparable with that of group 4. rSH-specific nasal IgA levels in group 2 were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than that of group 3, and comparable with that of group 4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). We observed that the highest levels of rVet-specific IgA were induced in group 4 when compared to other vaccination groups in tracheal washes. On the other side, the highest rSH-specific tracheal IgA levels were detected in group 3, which were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher than the levels observed in other groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). In lung secretions, rVet-specific IgA levels were enhanced significantly in mice of group 1 when compared with animals of groups 3 (P &lt; 0.05) and 4 (P &lt; 0.01). Lung IgA levels against rVet in group 4 were observed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than group 2 (Fig.
