 </sup>. The elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β and IL-10) during influenza infection have also been primarily associated with increased lung pathology and worse outcomes, but it is uncertain whether some of these cytokines could also be protective during seasonal influenza infection

 </sup>. At day 4 post-challenge, IL-6 and IFN-γ levels were measured by sandwich ELISA in lung tissue. IL-6 and IFN-γ levels were significantly higher in PBS immunized mice after being infected with Cal09, Phi82, rVet or rSH. On the contrary, very low levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ were detected in animals of both groups 3 or 4 than other groups of animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A–D</xref>). These data show that groups 3 and 4 had low levels of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs after different virus infections.
