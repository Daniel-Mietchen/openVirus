<p id="Par11">Next, we determined the H5N1 and H7N9 virus-specific induced cytokine levels using ELISPOT. In rVet and rSH-specific IL-2 secretions, a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in IL-2 levels in groups 3 and 4 were found when compared with group 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Mice of groups 3 and 4 showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) enhanced levels of IFN-γ while the IFN-γ levels were undetectable in group 1 and 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). We also observed that IL-4 levels were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased in both groups 3 and 4 compared to the animals vaccinated with group 1 or 2 in rVet and rSH-specific responses, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Like other cytokine levels, rVet and rSH-specific TNF-α levels was also increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in both groups 3 and 4 compared to group 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). PBS immunized mice were not able to induce cytokine-producing lymphocytes specific to either of the viruses. These results suggest that sequential immunization induces both Th1 and Th2 types of cytokine levels.
