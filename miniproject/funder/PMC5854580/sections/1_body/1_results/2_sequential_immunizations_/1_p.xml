 </sup> studies have shown that sequential immunizations with modified antigens elicited bnAb responses that conferred complete or partial protection. A recent study reported that a VLP vaccine, composed of a cocktail of different antigens, protects mice from multiple subtypes of Influenza A virus

 </sup>. To determine whether sequential immunizations with influenza VLPs induce cross-protection, the groups of mice were sequentially immunized with different subtypic influenza VLPs or a mixture of various VLPs through an intranasal (

 <sup>rd</sup> week. Antigen-specific IgG and IgG subtypes in immune sera and IgA in mucosal samples were measured at every 2
 <sup>nd</sup> week post-vaccination in mice immunized with different vaccine formulations.
