<p id="Par8">After the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> immunization, reassortant A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (rVet) (H5N1)-specific total IgG levels were comparable in all the groups and did not show any increase in their total IgG levels. We observed that after the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> vaccination, the total virus-specific IgG endpoint titers were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased in groups 3 and 4. Meanwhile, no significant differences were found in the other vaccination groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). These results suggest that the immunizations of animals of group 3 and 4 enhanced the rVet-specific serum antibody levels in the systemic circulations. To further demonstrate the humoral immune responses, we measured endpoint titers of serum IgG subtypes, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>. IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b, after each vaccination. Group 1, 2, and 5 did not show any increase in either IgG1 or IgG2a/2b antibody levels. IgG1 and IgG2a levels in the animals of group 3 and 4 were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) induced when compared to group 1. On the other side, groups 3 and 4 did not support the induction of IgG2b antibody levels. These data demonstrated that groups 3 and 4 showed mixed Th1 and Th2 type of immune responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B–D</xref>). Furthermore, we also evaluated reassortant A/Shanghai/02/2013 (rSH) (H7N9)-specific total serum IgG and IgG subtype levels in mice vaccinated with various vaccine formulations. IgG endpoint titers were found increased after the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> vaccination when compared to rSH IgG results. Although the level of IgG and IgG subtypes were increased after immunization, no significant differences were observed between the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> immunization or when compared with group 2 (P &gt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E–H</xref>). For IgG subtypes, all the VLP immunized animals showed no change in both the rSH-specific IgG1 and IgG2a/2b endpoint titers. To determine if sequential immunizations can elicit antibodies against A/California/07/2009 (Cal09) (H1N1) or A/Philippines/02/1982 (Phi82) (H3N2), intracellular ELISA was performed as described in the material and methods. Results showed that Cal09- (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>) and Phi82-specific antibodies were enhanced more specifically in the sequentially immunized animal groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that sequential immunizations can induce heterosubtypic serum IgG levels.
