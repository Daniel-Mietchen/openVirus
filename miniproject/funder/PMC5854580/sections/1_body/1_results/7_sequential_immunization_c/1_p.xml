<p id="Par13">To determine whether sequential immunizations protect mice from lethal virus challenge, vaccinated animals were challenged with 10 × LD
 <sub>50</sub> of mouse adapted Cal09, Phi82, rVet, or rSH viruses. Interestingly, mice sequentially vaccinated with influenza VLPs in different formulations showed complete (100%) protection towards all the viruses used for challenges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A–D</xref>). During body weight analysis, the body weight of mice of group 3 began to drop at day 4 post-challenge, similar with what happened in the PBS immunized animals. But at day 7, the sequentially immunized group of animals showed recovery and began to regain body weight (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7D–G</xref>). These results showed that the animals of groups 3 and 4 developed complete protection from heterologous and heterosubtypic virus challenges and maintained their body weight throughout the study when compared to the negative control groups.
