<p id="Par10">HAI titers are correlated to the protective efficacy of influenza antibody responses. To further compare the induced antibody responses, we determined the serum HAI titers against Cal09, Phi82, rVet, and rSH viruses. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, both group 3 and group 4 have significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher HAI titers compared to group 1, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>. Cal09 (H1N1) and rVet (H5N1), or group 2, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>. Phi82 (H3N2) and rSH (H7N9).
