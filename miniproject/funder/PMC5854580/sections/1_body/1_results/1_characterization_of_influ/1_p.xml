 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>) and ∼25 KD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) were observed for HA and M1 proteins, respectively, which were consistent with the molecular weights estimated from their amino acid compositions. TEM data showed that the prepared VLPs were spherical in morphology with a diameter of ∼100 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), which was similar with previous studies
