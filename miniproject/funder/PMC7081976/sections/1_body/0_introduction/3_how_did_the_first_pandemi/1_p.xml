<p>It is inherently difficult to predict when and where a pandemic virus will evolve. Pandemic viruses have a rare combination of properties, including animal-origin surface proteins that are antigenically divergent from human viruses and thus evade immune detection while retaining a capacity to replicate and transmit in humans. The evolution of such a variant is facilitated by a process termed “reassortment,” in which whole segments of the IAV genome are exchanged between viruses coinfecting a host cell, rapidly repositioning genes into different genetic backgrounds (

Reassortant viruses are therefore more likely to evolve in locations where multiple distinct lineages cocirculate and in hosts with high capacities for reassortment, such as wild birds, poultry, and swine. The pandemic viruses of 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1) were all reassortants with chimeric genomes derived from multiple lineages. The 2009 pandemic was the first to occur in the genomic era, providing large-scale sequence data to understand how globalized swine production and long-distance viral migration contributed to the evolution of a novel reassortant virus.
