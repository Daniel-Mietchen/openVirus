<p>All three pandemics of the 20th century (1918, 1957, and 1968) were of avian origin, and birds have been key sources of novel viruses in a range of other mammalian hosts, including swine, equines, canines, and phocines. For decades, the large numbers of human infections in Asia with IAVs of the H5N1 subtype and, more recently, H7N9 subtype were considered indications of impending pandemics, prompting governments to stockpile antivirals and vaccines targeting H5 and H7 antigens. H5N1 and H7N9 viruses continue to infect humans, but the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission to date underscores the difficulty of predicting pandemics, especially as large numbers of human infections and deaths are only one measure of multifaceted pandemic risk [
