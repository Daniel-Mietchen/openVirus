<p>In addition, pigs were flying (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008259.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). To meet the needs of expanding middle classes for animal-sourced protein, many countries imported more productive sows (female breeding pigs) with improved genetics from North America and Europe. Imported swine must be declared free of certain pathogens, such as African swine fever (ASF) or foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). However, influenza is not routinely tested for, and many countries do not quarantine, facilitating the long-distance spread of IAV-S [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008259.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Using genetic sequences of IAV-S collected in different countries over time, the direction and timing of viral movements can be inferred from the evolutionary relationships depicted on phylogenetic trees. Trees reveal how international trade of live swine in the 1990s and 2000s facilitated the long-distance dispersal of IAV-S between trade partners, shaping the global spatial distribution of IAV-S lineages that is observed today. Many countries in Asia import swine from different continents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008259.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), introducing multiple divergent lineages and creating nexuses for genetic diversity. By the end of the millennium, the high genetic and antigenic diversity of IAV-S made it one of the most intractable diseases for swine producers in the US and present in most swine-producing countries [
