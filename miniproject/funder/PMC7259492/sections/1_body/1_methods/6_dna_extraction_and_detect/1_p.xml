<p>As the endosymbiont 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is known to make 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes refractory to Zika virus infection we tested for the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> DNA in our samples [
 <xref rid="pone.0233309.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Homogenate from ten mosquito bodies of each species were pooled into four groups of five. DNA was extracted using Qiagen’s DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Extracted material was amplified by PCR using Qiagen’s HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions using previously described primers (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) [
 <xref rid="pone.0233309.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PCR product was then run on a 2% agarose gel stained with SYBR safe in TAE at 120 mV for 45 min (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Gel was imaged using a Bio-Rad GelDoc (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
