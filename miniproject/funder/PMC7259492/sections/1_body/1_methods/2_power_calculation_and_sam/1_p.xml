<p>A Monte Carlo simulation was used to produce a power curve, by generating ten-thousand simulated data sets with expected proportions of infection for sampling days 5, 7, 9, and 14. Each simulated data set was analyzed using a generalized linear model with a logistic link function and binomial likelihood. The following expected proportions of infection at each sampling point for each species were as follows for days 5, 7, 9 and 14 respectively: 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti–</italic> 0%, 30%, 40%, 60% and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus–</italic> 0%, 3%, 13%, 33%. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> proportions were derived from work previously published by Christofferson and Mores (2011) on 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> competence for dengue virus and the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> proportions were based on unpublished preliminary data using Zika-MEX [

 <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; = 0.05 were the simulated experiment was considered to have detected the true difference between species and was therefore considered as having sufficient power, the power of detecting a significant difference between species at each time point was calculated by dividing the number of these results by the total number of simulations for each simulated sample size and sampling point to provide an estimate of power given alpha of 0.05.
