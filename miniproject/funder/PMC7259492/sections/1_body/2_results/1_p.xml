<p>Our data indicate that 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquito populations in New Orleans, Louisiana are not competent vectors for Zika virus given low levels of viremia (
 <xref rid="pone.0233309.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only 1 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was positive at 4 and 15 DPI while no 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were positive. None of the exposed mosquitoes had virus present in the saliva, indicating a low likelihood of successful establishment of Zika virus from low-level viremia and/or asymptomatic cases.
