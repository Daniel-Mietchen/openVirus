<p>Zika virus is a flavivirus first detected in the Americas in March 2015 when it was diagnosed in Bahia, Brazil, although it is thought to have been in circulating since at least February of that year [

However, when Zika virus emerged in the Western Hemisphere, the presence of a competent vector and a largely immunologically naïve population resulted in a large-scale epidemic that affected most of the western tropics. Its association with neuropathology had also not been recorded [

As demonstrated by the confusion in diagnosis, Zika’s typical pathology is that of a non-descript febrile illness that was not easily differentiable from that of mild dengue or most other febrile illnesses. By early 2016, an association between clusters of cases of micro-cephalic neonates and nearly 7,000 reported cases of Zika virus was made. On February 1, 2016 the World Health Organization declared that Zika constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [
