<p>Viremia levels of Zika patients vary according to several factors. For instance, one study found that hospitalized patients in Nicaragua had higher viremia compared to non-hospitalized patients [

In this study, the non-hospitalized patients got up to 4.1 log virus/mL, and it could be presumed that non-hospitalized patients have more contact with mosquitoes compared to those in a hospital where mosquito avoidance may be employed. Other studies have also showed low-level viremia in the range of 4 logs/ml in asymptomatic or subclinical patients [
