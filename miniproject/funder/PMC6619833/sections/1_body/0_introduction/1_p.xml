It has become a substantially increasing threat to public health and represents a challenge to health services and a burden to economies. It was recently estimated that there are 390 million dengue infections every year (95% confidence interval 284–528 million), of which 96 million (67–136 million) infections manifest clinically [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are at risk for infection with dengue viruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, dengue is still one of the most neglected tropical diseases, which are caused and maintained by the social and environmental determinants of health [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The social determinants of infectious disease control are difficult to address [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For that reason, the Special Programme for Tropical Diseases Research and Training from the World Health Organization has called for more research on the interplay between the demographic, social, and environmental factors in infectious disease occurrence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In recent years, outbreaks of DF have occurred along the China-Myanmar-Laos border, and most of these outbreaks affected Dai or Shan ethnic communities [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The population dynamics of

 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Outbreaks of DF may also be attributed to the social and environmental characteristics of the residents. Human behavior change communication (BCC) is one of the currently adopted strategies to reduce the

 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Understanding people’s health beliefs, knowledge and perception about dengue may help to generate better strategies for dengue control [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Data about people’s health beliefs, knowledge and perceptions about dengue are still lacking at the China-Myanmar-Laos border. This kind of data may help to explore locally adaptive strategies and solutions for the next steps in dengue prevention and control. This study investigated the health beliefs, knowledge and perception of the Shan people about dengue in Eastern Shan Special Region IV (ESSR4), Myanmar. The purpose of using both qualitative and quantitative methods is to triangulate the study outcomes, to try to gain in-depth understanding and to compare any potential differences between the general community and the key informants who are supposed to have more chances to receive health information. Here, we report our findings and provide a discussion on their implications.
