<p>Because of the malaria control program, the residents’ knowledge of adult mosquito control was improved to a certain level across ESSR4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the HHS, 79.9% (95% CI: 74.5–84.6%) and 69.9% (95% CI: 63.9–75.4%) of the participants mentioned that they had used coils and bed nets, respectively. More of the participants in V1 than in V2 and V3 knew how to use mosquito coils and bed nets. However, only a few people knew that dengue-transmitting mosquitoes bite during the day and that small-scale pond water is the main breeding site of dengue-transmitting mosquito larvae. Most participants knew to protect themselves from the bites of adult mosquitoes, but they did not know that eliminating the habitats of dengue-transmitting mosquito larva is beneficial for the control of dengue vectors (Tables

 <xref rid="pntd.0007498.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Combining effective interventions against multiple arboviral diseases has been suggested by some scholars as one of the most cost-effective and sustainable strategies for the reduction of vector-borne diseases [
