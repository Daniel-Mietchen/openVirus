<p>Our results suggest that CCP implementation within NYC would require a more targeted approach and reduced costs to achieve cost-effectiveness. However, the CCP with a 2-year average enrollment period has the potential to be cost-effective in environments with a lower background of VLS, and/or when restricted to those who have been consistently unsuppressed in the year prior to CCP enrollment, and/or where substantial reductions in programmatic costs could be achieved.</p>
