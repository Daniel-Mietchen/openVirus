<p>The CCP intervention in both scenarios achieved favorable value across lower costs and higher effect sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215965.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). When considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, in sensitivity analyses (results not shown) the model outcome was not sensitive to characteristics of the general simulated population (e.g. proportion linked to treatment). However, the model outcome was sensitive to the cost of care and treatment.
