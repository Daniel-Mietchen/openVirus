<p>If instituted with an average 2-year time frame and targeted to persons with unsuppressed viral load in the year prior to enrollment (corresponding to an RR of 1.32), the cost per QALY gained versus no intervention was $130,069. To achieve favorable value, the year-one cost per client must be decreased by more than 14.8%, from $7,274 to $6,196 (

If instituted without enrollment time limits but targeted to persons with unsuppressed viral load (corresponding to an RR of 1.32), the cost per QALY gained was $244,457. To achieve favorable value, the year-one cost per client must be decreased by more than 38.7%, from $7,274 to $4,458, with subsequent annual costs being proportionately decreased (
