<p>Increasing the time horizon to 50 years resulted in an improved cost effectiveness for both implementation scenarios. Scenario 1 resulted in a total 50-year discounted cost of $383,992,076, and 2,043 QALYs gained corresponding to a cost effectiveness of $187,918/QALY. Scenario 2 resulted in a total 50-year discounted cost of $4,202,467,698, and 9,981 QALYs gained corresponding to a cost effectiveness of $237,509/QALY.</p>
