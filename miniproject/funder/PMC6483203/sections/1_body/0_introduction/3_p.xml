<p>A recent effectiveness study demonstrated that the CCP, relative to “usual care,” was effective at promoting VLS at 12 months (VLS 58% versus 52%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08–1.14), especially for newly diagnosed persons (VLS 73% versus 63%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09–1.23) and those who had no evidence of VLS in the year prior to the start of follow-up (VLS 43% versus 32%; RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23–1.42).[

However, as implemented currently in NYC, the program is expensive, with a per-participant cost of approximately $7,274 in the first year and $5,195 per year in subsequent years. Thus, assessing its cost-effectiveness is a necessary prerequisite for considering scale-up of the program or implementation of the intervention in other settings. The objective of the present study was to use a computer simulation of local HIV progression and transmission to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the scale-up of the CCP strategy in NYC to all those who appear to be at risk of suboptimal outcomes.
