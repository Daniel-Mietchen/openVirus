The simulation is composed of two models. The first model is a natural history model that follows a cohort of HIV-infected patients and predicts time until HIV antiretroviral (ART) failure, accumulation of resistance mutations, and patient death. This progression model provides data to inform the second model, a transmission model. This process is described in detail in
