<p>The transmission of HIV is predicted by a compartmental model. Segments of a hypothetical population can become HIV-infected, learn their HIV status, and access and adhere to treatment, which can minimize the risk of onward transmission. Segments of this population can also modify the risk of onward transmission by increasing or decreasing their number of sexual partnerships, condomless sex encounters, exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and substance use. The model included both sexual transmission of HIV and transmission through syringe and injection-related paraphernalia-sharing during injection drug use (IDU). The probability of transmission between partners was adjusted to account for an infected partner's gender, disease state, and treatment status, and for uninfected partnersâ€™ use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The design of the simulation, as well as its calibration and validation (

 <xref rid="pone.0215965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We used the calibrated simulation to evaluate the impact and value of scaling up the CCP intervention in NYC. Two scenarios were explored. In scenario 1, to represent the practical expectation of approximately two-year average program enrollment periods, the intervention effects and costs were limited to the two years at the start of the simulation. In this scenario the direct benefits of the intervention (i.e. increased VLS) stop at the two-year mark; however, benefits incurred downstream (i.e. transmission events, improvements in life expectancy) are continued after two years. In scenario 2, the program was assumed to be continuously implemented over the full time horizon, with individuals receiving the intervention as they become eligible and remaining in the program until death.
