<p>For each scenario, the CCP increased the proportion of PLWH experiencing VLS. The interventions effects were represented in the transmission model by increasing the probability of transitions from “in care but not adherent to ART” to “in care and adherent to ART” compartments. ART adherence was represented as a percentage of pills taken as prescribed per month. ART adherence then influences the likelihood of response to treatment and the achievement of VLS. Since CCP eligibility criteria could not be directly replicated for the model, the scale-up was modeled amongst all HIV-infected individuals who have behaviors associated with risk for nonadherence and/or nonretention in care (i.e., IDU), lessening the likelihood of VLS, and/or higher probability of transmission for a particular VL (e.g., multiple concurrent partners), as surrogate inclusion criteria. A post-hoc sensitivity analysis, “targeted CCP,” aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the intervention if delivered exclusively to the subgroup that had been consistently unsuppressed throughout the year prior to enrollment. However, due to constraints of the simulation architecture, we were unable to limit the intervention’s effect to this specific group. Accordingly, for the “targeted CCP” analysis, we applied the effect size observed in this consistently-unsuppressed subgroup to the same population as in the base case analysis. The simulation was calibrated to NYC epidemiological data, with the goal of replicating trends in NYC HIV prevalence, incidence, and deaths, from 1997 to 2015. The model inputs are described in
