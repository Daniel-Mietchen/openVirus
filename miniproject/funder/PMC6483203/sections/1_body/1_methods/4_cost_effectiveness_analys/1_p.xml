<p>We conducted simulations where the CCP intervention was “turned on,” and calculated the health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratio over the 20-year time horizon. These simulations were compared to a counterfactual scenario representing standard of care in NYC with no CCP intervention. Outcomes measured include total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, cost per QALY gained, number of new HIV infections averted, and cost per infection averted. As a sensitivity analysis, we varied both intervention efficacy and cost independently across plausible ranges. In cost sensitivity analyses, we maintained the ratio of 1
 <sup>st</sup>-year costs to costs in the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> year and beyond so that the 1
 <sup>st</sup>-year costs were proportionally higher than all later-year costs throughout the analyses. A cost-per-QALY-gained value less than $100k was considered cost-effective.[
