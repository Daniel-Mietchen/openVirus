 <xref rid="pone.0215965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in NYC was modified to incorporate the observed effects and costs of the CCP intervention. The simulation estimated the impact and cost-effectiveness of a scale-up of the CCP intervention among all persons at apparent risk for sub-optimal HIV care outcomes in NYC (approximately 35% of PLWH) compared to no implementation of CCP. All study methods were approved by the NYC DOHMH IRB.
