<p>The CCP intervention promotes care and treatment engagement among persons at risk for suboptimal HIV outcomes. The CCP combines various evidence-based programmatic elements including case management, patient navigation, directly observed therapy, structured health promotion in home/field visits, and outreach to assist patients in accessing needed medical care and related support services, such as mental health treatment, substance use treatment, and housing assistance. Patients receive and transition through different levels of intensity of programmatic support based on their assessed needs. At the time of this writing, CCP eligibility criteria permitted enrollment of HIV-infected adults or emancipated minors who have residence within the New York grant area with a household income &lt;435% of federal poverty level and who are (1) newly diagnosed with HIV; (2) starting a new ART regimen; (3) never in care or lost to care for at least 9 months; (4) irregularly in care; (5) experiencing ART adherence barriers; or (6) displaying ART resistance or treatment failure. The intervention has previously been described elsewhere.[

The primary outcome incorporated into the HIV model was the proportion of participants experiencing VLS at 12 months and the cost per patient of the intervention (
