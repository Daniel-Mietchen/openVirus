<p>In an effectiveness study conducted in a real-world service delivery environment, the CCP intervention was shown to have a significant positive effect on VLS beyond “usual care” in the short-term (i.e., in 12-months of follow-up). Within the study population, a substantial number of individuals (40.1%) were consistently unsuppressed in the year prior to follow-up. This group demonstrated the greatest effect from the CCP compared to the general study population (VLS RR 1.32 vs. RR 1.11).[

Targeting to this population with an enrollment limit of 2 years became cost-effective when programmatic costs were $6,437 in the first year with a proportional reduction in the next year. Consequently, if programmatic costs can be reduced (by 12% from current costs), our models suggest that targeting the CCP for individuals who have been consistently unsuppressed, while applying an average enrollment period of 2 years, may make CCP scale-up a valuable and cost-effective tool in the fight to end the HIV epidemic. The achievement of 90-90-90 goals will depend upon identifying and disseminating such interventions capable of yielding successful HIV treatment outcomes in vulnerable populations.
