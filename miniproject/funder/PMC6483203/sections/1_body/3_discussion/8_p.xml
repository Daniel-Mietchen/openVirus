<p>Third, we conservatively assumed that any treatment effect ceased as soon as the intervention (enrollment) was concluded (after 2 years in Scenario 1 and 20 years in Scenario 2). However, while the program could be implemented over a long period, individuals would be unlikely to receive the intervention and thus incur intervention costs for a full 20 years, and since an intervention effect

Fourth, the simulation was calibrated through 2009, the year the CCP began; however, in prospective validation the model under-predicted the number of PLWH in NYC, and this may have resulted in an underestimation of intervention health impact. While the 2015 values do not match exactly, we performed sensitivity analyses around these values and determined that the differences would not change the outcome of the analyses. Fifth, the simulation did not look at the year-by-year uptake of PrEP in NYC. While large-scale PrEP use is likely to reduce the impact of the CCP intervention on the number of new infections averted, PrEP use (although increasing) remains modest in NYC.[
 <xref rid="pone.0215965.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] Therefore, while the cost-effectiveness of the CCP for infections averted may potentially be overestimated, that overestimation is likely to be minimal as CCP specifically targets a low-income, non-white population that is less likely to access PrEP. Fourth, the analysis applied the same intervention costs for all individuals enrolled in the CCP, including those who did not ultimately receive the intervention or dropped out after a short time and those who received the program elements at varying levels of intensity. This likely overestimates the total cost of implementation. Finally, our simulation does not measure additional programmatic effects on social determinants of health such as housing, engagement in mental health care, substance use treatment, or treatment for comorbidities, which likely impact both health and quality of life. Consequently, the total health impact of the intervention on QALYs is potentially underestimated.
