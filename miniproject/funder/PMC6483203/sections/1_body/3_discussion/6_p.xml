The multi-component nature of interventions like the CCP also poses a challenge for determining how best to decrease programmatic costs and maximize intervention effectiveness. As a result, in addition to targeting the intervention, further research is needed to determine the most essential components of the CCP intervention and determine if there are components of the intervention that can be scaled back, modified, or eliminated in order to reduce programmatic costs while maintaining program effectiveness. This process is now underway in NYC, through a study comparing the original CCP to a revised CCP model in a stepped-wedge design (R01MH117793).
