<p>For the CCP intervention with an enrollment limit of 2 years to be cost-effective in a general high-need population, while maintaining the same programmatic costs, future effectiveness studies must demonstrate a substantial increase in effectiveness (from RR 1.11 to RR 1.46). The CCP effectiveness range is similar to those observed in other interventions; a meta-analysis of similar integrated interventions targeting transmission risk and care continuum outcomes found that the overall effect size on undetectable viral load was OR 1.46 (95% CI 0.93–2.27, p = 0.098).[
