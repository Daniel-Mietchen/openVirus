<p>We provide estimates of the impact and cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical scale-up of a comprehensive HIV care coordination intervention for promoting VLS among persons in NYC with documented barriers to care and treatment. Our analyses suggest that, from a health sector perspective, a broad scale-up of the CCP was not likely to be cost-effective at current costs and observed levels of effectiveness. Our findings are robust over a range of assumptions regarding cost and effectiveness, with the scaled-up CCP in both the time-unlimited enrollment scenario and the 2-year average enrollment scenario becoming cost-effective only after a decrease in programmatic costs or an increase in effectiveness, while the targeted CCP became cost effective with a smaller decrease in programmatic costs. Thus, CCP scale-up could achieve cost-effectiveness through an increased focus on populations for whom the existing program is most effective, and/or by determining and applying an optimal enrollment period.</p>
