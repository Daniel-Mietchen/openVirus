<p>Our analysis has a number of limitations. First, our model was unable to directly replicate the exact risk strata of patients in the study, and so risks for poor adherence were used as surrogate inclusion criteria in the model. Due to the simulation structure, general high-risk groups (i.e., those with multiple concurrent partners, IDU), each associated with different likelihoods of VLS, are used to represent PLWH without VLS. As a result, the analysis likely overestimates the transmission prevention impact of the program, as increasing VLS among high-risk behavioral groups will have a greater impact on HIV transmission than increasing VLS in groups without (or with lower prevalence of) these behavioral risk factors. Likewise, because the model could not select only consistently unsuppressed individuals for enrollment, the investigation of a targeted intervention utilized the RR1.32 without decreasing the population size, and therefore overestimates the total deaths averted and total QALYs gained. However, costs were also proportionally increased, and thus the cost-effectiveness ratios are likely to be conservative. Second, our model identifies people in broad categories who may be eligible for the CCP, but does not apply actual CCP eligibility criteria.[
