  <p>The potential of the liquid biopsy as a non-invasive and accurate approach to the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic liver disease by disease associated markers from EVs, cfDNA, and serum protein. Biomarks have potential for further gene allele and mutation study to design the genomic testing depends on the gene expression and sequencing result for personalized therapeutic strategy. The biomarks expression testing level not only to monitor the disease process, also can apply for the drug design, drug testing and therapeutic efficiency in the future.</p>
