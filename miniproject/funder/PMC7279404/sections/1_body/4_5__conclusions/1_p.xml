<p>In the present review, we have highlighted the use of virus-related cfDNA, proteins and lncRNA in EVs/EPs and exosomes for liquid biopsies for the diagnosis of chronic liver diseases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-03732-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Numerous studies have demonstrated that EVs affect the chronic inflammatory response in the progression of liver diseases. EVs released from stressed hepatocytes are fundamental modulators of these responses and take effect through various actions in different target cells including HSCs, MSCs, and macrophages; they are implicated in complex networks of cell-to-cell communication in liver disease development and progression. Some studies have presented analyses of EVs as carriers of specific proteins or genes involved in the biogenesis of diseases which can provide therapeutic targets in the future. This indicates the potential of the liquid biopsy as a non-invasive and accurate approach to the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic liver disease.
