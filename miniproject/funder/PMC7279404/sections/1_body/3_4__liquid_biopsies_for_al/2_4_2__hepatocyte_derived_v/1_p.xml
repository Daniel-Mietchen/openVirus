<p>Investigations into EVs as biomarkers for alcoholic hepatitis in humans have revealed increased levels of EVs in alcoholic hepatitis patients and patients who consume excessive amounts of alcohol [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. A study involving alcohol-fed rodents and human patients who consumed alcohol revealed elevated levels of cytochrome P450-2E1 and cytochrome P450 isoforms in exosomes. The authors further reported an increase in the number of EVs involving CYP2E1 and P450 isoforms that was associated with an increase in oxidative stress in the endoplasmic reticulum [

EV levels are elevated in patients with a history of alcohol abusive compared to those that consume extreme levels of alcohol and those that do not drink. EV levels are positively associated with ALT serum levels, mtDNA serum levels, and circulating neutrophil levels [
