<p>Hepatocytes secrete a variety of EV proteins including exosomal marker proteins (tumor Susceptibility 101 (Tsg101), Cd63, and Cd81); hepatic-specific proteins such as asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R); and disease-related proteins such as annexin A2 (ANXA2), paraoxonase-1 (PON1), apolipoprotein-E (APOE), catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), and insulin receptor substrate (IRS). Exosome membrane proteins contain functional features that stimulate the expression of non-exosome proteins in exosomes [
