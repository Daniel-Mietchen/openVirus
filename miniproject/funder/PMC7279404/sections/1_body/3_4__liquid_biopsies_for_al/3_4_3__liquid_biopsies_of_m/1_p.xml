<p>The accumulation of hepatic macrophages has been observed in the portal tracts of ALD patients. EVs stimulate the activation of macrophage activation and the induction of inflammatory cytokines, as demonstrated in an unbiased microarray-based antibody neutralization experiment [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Alcohol-exposed, monocyte-derived EVs activate naive monocytes to polarize M2 macrophages by increasing the expression of surface receptors CD68, CD206, and CD163, and the secretion of IL-10 and TGFÎ², which elevates phagocytic activity [

The proteins detected within EVs during macrophage activation suggests that CD40L may stimulate the activation of macrophages in experimental alcoholic hepatitis models [

 <xref rid="B93-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. IL-8 levels are extremely elevated in both circulating and hepatic neutrophils, which are associated with alcoholic hepatitis and disease aggression [
