<p>Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of various chronic liver diseases, and for determining the patterns and severity of liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis stage. However, liver biopsy is invasive, and is prone to sampling errors during the investigation of fat deposition in hepatocytes. It also carries the potential risk of bleeding. Moreover, despite intensive research, currently available non-invasive blood tests are not sufficiently sensitive or specific and are therefore of limited use. Various imaging modalities—including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based and ultrasound-based elastography—are used for the assessment of liver steatosis and fibrosis, but there is much room for improvement with regard to diagnostic accuracy, especially in the early stages of fibrosis [

Biomarkers that can redress these shortcomings might provide significant advances in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and regression in clinical settings. Liquid biopsy has potential as a less invasive alternative to tissue biopsy. It addresses several unmet clinical needs, including sensitivity, specificity, the determination of prognoses, and the prediction of therapeutic responses.
