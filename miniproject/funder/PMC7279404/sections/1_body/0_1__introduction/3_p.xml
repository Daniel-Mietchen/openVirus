<p>Liquid biological specimens comprising elements such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from intact blood, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are potential tools for monitoring tumor dynamics in terms of the early detection of de novo growth and recurrence [

 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The three main types of EVs are microparticles/microvesicles (MPs/MVs), exosomes, and apoptotic bodies, which are released from disintegrating or activated cells. They are generated in different ways and vary in size and composition. In general, MPs/MVs are 100–1000 nm in diameter and are directly generated from the plasma membrane by a budding process [

 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Exocytosis is a cellular process that involves the release of multiple vesicles (40–150 nm in diameter) known as exosomes, which are formed by the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. EVs contain various cellular components including proteins, DNA molecules (double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)), RNA molecules (messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and lncRNA), and lipids [
