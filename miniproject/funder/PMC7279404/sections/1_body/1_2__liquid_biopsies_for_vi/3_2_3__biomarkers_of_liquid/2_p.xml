<p>Viral amplification and replication could be used in target detection. Chronic HBV infection is characterized by a persistent episomal viral genome, namely covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). cccDNA constitutes a stable mini-chromosome within the infected hepatocyte nucleus [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The persistence of cccDNA and the inability of the immune system to eradicate the virus contribute to the failure of viral clearance and to relapse, even after treatment goals have been achieved. Therefore, true HBV clearance or functional cure is generally defined as the complete elimination of cccDNA from infected hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Theoretically, even if one molecule of HBV cccDNA with replication potential remains in a liver cell, there is still a risk of virological recurrence after ceasing antiviral therapy. The presence of pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) in mature HBV viral particle nucleocapsids is linked to the persistence of viral infection and the risk of virological recurrence. Lin et al. demonstrated the use of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine HBV pgRNA levels in the sera of HBV-infected patients, and to make a better assessment of changes in the sustained viral response (SVR) [

 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Iida et al. also reported an association between the level of cfDNA in the serum and the metastatic capability of HCV-related HCC, which suggests the potential of cfDNA as an active metastasis biomarker following curative surgery [
