<p>Viral hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver associated with infection by a hepatitis virus. Researchers have debated whether viruses have infection strategies that integrate EV-regulated communication pathways [

 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Phosphatidylserine groups have been identified on the surfaces of exosomes in numerous studies. This suggests that hepatitis viruses may incorporate themselves into EVs during biogenesis to enhance viral spread, as indicted by cell models and serum samples [
