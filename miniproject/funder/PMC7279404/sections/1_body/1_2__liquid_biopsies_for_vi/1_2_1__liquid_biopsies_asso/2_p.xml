<p>Hepatitis A—which is a picornavirus—uses the host’s EV machinery to propagate enveloped hepatitis A (eHAV); it comprises of two components: a nonenveloped form and a virus-like particle structure derived from the host membrane that is similar to an exosome. eHAV virions are further implicated in the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) pathway, which promotes the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Study found that eHAV virions resemble enveloped viruses and are infectious; they may be transported via an exosome-like system in which the HAV capsids are packaged as cargo into MVBs, and eventually enter the blood [

 <xref rid="B23-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. EV fragments are transported and delivered by MVBs. Simultaneously, machinery perturbation arrests viral maturation by blocking the encapsulation of viral envelope proteins derived from solvent-insoluble membranes. This may hinder viral propagation. As with EVs, hepatitis C virus (HCV) targets are determined by multiple factors. The HCV viral entry mechanism has evolved considerably and requires numerous molecules including Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), liver/lymph node-specific intracellular adhesion molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN), Dendritic cell–specific ICAM-3 grabbing-nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), Transferrin Receptor (TfR1), NPC1 Like Intracellular Cholesterol Transporter 1 (NPC1L1), Cluster of Differentiation 81 (CD81), Claudin 1 (CLDN-1), Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), and Occludin (OCLN), which illustrates the intricacy of the EV entry mechanism [

Moreover, EVs isolated from the sera of CHC patients not only contain HCV RNA and independently regulate HCV replication via viral receptors, but are also corelated with HSP90, Argonaute RISC Catalytic Component 2 (Ago2), and mir-122, which increase HCV replication by EV-regulated HCV transmission to naive cells [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GB virus C (GBV-C), formally known as hepatitis G virus (HGV), is a member of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. It has been shown that GB virus C particles inhibit T cell activation via envelope E2 protein-mediated inhibition of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These findings suggest that EVs play various functions in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis as shown in
