    "During the progression from hepatitis to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure, the accumulation of stressed/damaged hepatocyte elements associated with liver inflammation is critical. The causes of hepatocyte injuries include viral hepatitis infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (Hep-EVs) released from stressed/damaged hepatocytes are partly responsible for liver disease progression and liver damage because they activate non-parenchymal cells and infiltrate inflammatory cells within the liver, which are in turn are an important source of EVs. This cell-to-cell signaling is prevalent during inflammation in many liver diseases. Accordingly, special emphasis should be placed on liquid biopsy methods for the long-term monitoring of chronic liver diseases. In the present review, we have highlighted various aspects of current liquid biopsy research into chronic liver diseases. We have also reviewed recent progress on liquid biopsies that focus on cell-free DNA (cfDNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), and the proteins in EVs as potential diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic targets in patients with viral hepatitis, fatty liver steatosis, and alcoholic liver diseases."
