<p>Postcolonial policies in Uganda shape contemporary economic opportunity, which is limited after decades of policies that privilege economic growth over job creation [

While the country saw improved economic growth, this growth has been concentrated in the upper echelons of society as the Gini coefficient raised from 0.39 in 1996 to 0.43 in 2016 [

Yet any significant development of health service delivery systems was principally urban-oriented and in the central regions of Uganda. As such, communities in borderlands tended to lag behind in public service delivery. Health care access is much more limited in borderlands compared to the central regions of the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Together, such historically rooted drivers of limited access to health services bred a sense of mistrust in public authority, especially in historically neglected border districts in the West.
