We describe persistence of Ebola risk behavior not as a failure of the individual per se, but as a manifestation of key aspects of political economy in Uganda: (1) the role of British colonial policies in marginalizing certain ethnicities, such as those in this study, and (2) the postcolonial drivers of poor socioeconomic status characterized by low-wage and precarious employment. Firstly, we should acknowledge that the present-day national borders are colonial fabrications that were political and arbitrary [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These borders do not reflect the shared kinship and traditions by Congolese and Ugandans on both sides of the border. Additionally, Uganda’s border regions are populated by ethnic groups that were historically marginalized in British colonial Uganda. British colonial rulers privileged the Ganda Kingdom, ruling through Ganda leaders who were given positions of power over other ethnic groups [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These dynamics are emblematic in the case of the “Lost Counties” when British captured territory in the Nyoro Kingdom in Western Uganda was given to Ganda rulers [

 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This colonial privileging of one ethnic group over others has implications for contemporary tensions across Uganda [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Importantly, it bred tendencies to mistrust authority, which continued throughout the postcolonial era to affect uptake of public services including health services. Additionally, this framing draws on other research on the historical and political context of trust in authorities in Uganda [
