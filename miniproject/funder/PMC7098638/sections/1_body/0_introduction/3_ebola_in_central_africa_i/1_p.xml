<p>While the geographic scope and scale of the EVD epidemic in DRC has now reduced greatly [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], at its peak many people were reported to be no longer seeking care and responders raised concerns about community trust in the response [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cases were reported in Goma [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which is a major transportation hub in Central Africa with linkages and routes to nearby nations. This was particularly of concern due to the porous border between the DRC, Rwanda, and Uganda, and political instability in the affected area leading to a continuous influx of refugees to Uganda, low community uptake of Ebola prevention activities in Uganda's high-risk districts, and fluid social and cultural norms related to Ebola prevention and control [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Meanwhile, during the epidemic, the Ugandan National Task Force for EVD Preparedness and Response cited an urgent need for a strategy for border health, cross-border cooperation, and scaled-up risk communication among other priorities [

 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These and future efforts must be underpinned by local community engagement [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with an understanding of borderland dynamics. Effective local community engagement requires an understanding of the political and economic context of EVD outbreak, which anthropology is well-placed to examine.
