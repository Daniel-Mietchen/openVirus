<p>Anthropologists have been increasingly engaged in epidemic response, for example through the Ebola Response Anthropology Platform (ERAP) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform (SSHAP) [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Anthropologists have contributed in key areas, such as bolstering more authentic community engagement in the response [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], reframing harmful terms like “resistance” or “compliance” with response activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and demonstrating the cultural importance of dignified burials [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Previous literature in an epidemic context demonstrates how Ebola containment efforts may hinder livelihood opportunities [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and how livelihood strategies and coping mechanisms make individuals resilient to changes in livelihood [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In prior research, mistrust of health workers is contextualized to describe the low community uptake of response efforts [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. There are also significant examples of anthropological work on the broader context of Ebola in West and Central Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We build on this existing work to contextualize Ebola in Uganda’s borderlands.
