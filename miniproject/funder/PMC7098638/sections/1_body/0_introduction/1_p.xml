<p>Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was declared a public health emergency of international concern on July 17, 2019. Prior to that, the first confirmed cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) to spread beyond DRC emerged in Kasese District in Uganda on June 12, 2019. A 5-year old boy and his mother had crossed into Uganda, avoiding screening and isolation protocols at the border. This case was not unexpected in a region where communities are socially, economically, and politically integrated along a porous border. This case also underscores the importance of anthropological research in borderlands, where anthropologists can interrogate the reasons for community and individual reluctance to engage with Ebola response efforts.</p>
