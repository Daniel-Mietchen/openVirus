<p>While the reasons are varied, officials (
 <italic>n</italic> = 64) and community members (
 <italic>n</italic> = 127) reported that border populations inter-marry, inter-trade, and inter-socialize. Indeed, as one participant stated: “we are one family, we are one tribe.” The porous nature of the border was observed on several occasions, where official points of entry (POE) were sparse. Meanwhile informal points of entry were more frequently used and included unmarked small roads or other land whereby individuals can cross into DRC from Uganda, and vice versa. Our research team conducted one FGD at an informal POE in Arua District, where men were seated near a small shop. Market traders prefer to cross via informal POE, where customs officials are not present and their goods will not be subject to additional charges (
