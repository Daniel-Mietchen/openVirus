<p>Participants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 61) discussed the high level of regional connectivity along the DRC-Uganda border, where large numbers of people cross the border each day. We noted mainly circular movementâ€”Congolese come to Uganda to purchase merchandise, then return to the DRC shortly thereafter, and Ugandans go into the DRC for water or to trade at the market, and then come back shortly thereafter. Large numbers of Congolese cross into Uganda each day, seeking asylum from war or economic pressures at home. Our team observed Congolese refugees at all border crossing points in Uganda. Many Ugandans also go to DRC to cultivate land and crops. In other words, there is a high level of cross-border movement and socializing. The main reasons for crossing the border are reported below (
