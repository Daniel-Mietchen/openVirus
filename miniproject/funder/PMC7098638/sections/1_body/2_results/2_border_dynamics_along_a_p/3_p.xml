<p>As reported above, participants crossed the border for primarily economic reasons, to engage in livelihood strategies such as fishing or market trading. Participants described crossing the border to seek more customers, because goods were generally expensive in the DRC. Bringing goods from Uganda to the DRC allowed traders to make a high profit. A concerning response was how commonly Bunagana (a border town) residents crossed into nearby DRC to fetch water. There were few sources of clean water in Bunagana, and crossing the border was a more practical option. In economically deprived areas with patchwork infrastructure, crossing the border is necessary for daily survival.</p>
