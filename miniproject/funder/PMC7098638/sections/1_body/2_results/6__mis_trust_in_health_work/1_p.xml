<p>Perceptions about local government health workers had implications for trust and demonstrate low faith in the health system in general. As evidenced in the quote from Kagadi District, poor experiences with the health system are commonplace and contribute toward perceptions of neglect. Health facilities, meanwhile, are understaffed and undersupplied, especially in rural areas further from central Uganda. The consequence of this neglect is that rural residents do not choose a government health center as their first point of contact, often preferring private clinics (if they can afford them) or traditional healers. In one FGD in Pakwach District, 60% of individuals described having a poor opinion of government health workers. In another FGD in Kagadi District in Western Uganda, women described difficulties accessing health facilities which prevented them from seeking health care in time. Even if they do go to a government health center, it is often closed or under-staffed. These results demonstrate that the root causes of (mis)trust require a more substantial mode of community engagement than public education campaigns.</p>
