<p>Special attention must be paid to the dynamics in fishing communities, where trust in authority figures is very low, particularly trust in army soldiers. Due to the historical and political context in fishing communities, fisherfolk are wary of authorities after the military was described as seizing control of the fishing industry. Only regulated fishing boats were allowed on the waters, but these licenses were too expensive to obtain. Fishing communities were being asked to pay what they perceived as exorbitant fees to buy bigger boats, register existing boats, and pay for fishing licenses. Some participants (

It also meant that families could no longer fish for their household consumption, unless they had a licensed boat. In these areas, trust in authorities is very low and many participants even expressed their frustration in terms of one individual (quoted above) who wished that Ebola should come there and kill them, so that they do not have to pay back a loan they cannot afford. The participant above indexes deep mistrust and the reality that Ebola was not his most pressing concern, but rather it was the economic reality that shaped his day-to-day.
