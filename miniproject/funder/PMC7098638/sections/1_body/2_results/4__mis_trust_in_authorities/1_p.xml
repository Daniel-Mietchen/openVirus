<p>This final section details the ways in which rumors and information are spread across borders, exacerbating mistrust in Ebola preparedness and control efforts, and signifying general issues with trust in authorities.

In districts with official POEs, trust in authority is hampered by a long history of fragile engagement between authority figures and community members in the borderlands. Participants (

These economic transactions further degrade trust in officials, who are perceived to be working for their own benefit. The unintended consequence is that by crossing at informal POE, there is no Ebola screening of those individuals.
