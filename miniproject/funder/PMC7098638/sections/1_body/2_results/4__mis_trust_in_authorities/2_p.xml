<p>All FGDs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25) and key informant interviews with local leaders (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) and health workers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) raised issues of community (mis)trust in various authorities. Trust in local leaders was generally high, and local leaders were seen as a source of trusted information on Ebola prevention. Local leaders are also deeply engaged in their communities, involved in local issues and dispute resolutions, and they are historical sources of organization within Ugandan communities. On the other hand, trust in health workers was lower, with many community members complaining that government health workers in particular were not to be trusted. International and national NGO staff were regarded as an important source of support to communities, most likely because of the programs that they bring to communities. In fishing communities, there was generally a high mistrust in authorities, particularly the army. These nuances are discussed further below.
