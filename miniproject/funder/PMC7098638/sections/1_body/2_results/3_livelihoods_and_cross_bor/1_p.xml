<p>Livelihood needs drive cross-border movement and present a challenge to Ebola preparedness, prevention, and response. In this context, livelihood strategies refer to economic modes of subsistence including market trading, cash crop agriculture, fishing, transportation, or small businesses. Livelihood strategies among our participants ranged, from fishermen (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19) to farmers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 17), from long-distance truck drivers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) to 
 <italic>boda boda</italic> (motorcycle taxi) drivers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8). Livelihood seeking necessitates frequent cross-border movement, which Ugandans perceive as putting them at higher risk of contracting Ebola. Participants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 43) also described their economic precarity, and how low economic security necessitated extraordinary measures to engage in livelihood strategies. It is precisely because of this precarity that individuals are less able to make decisions about where and when to cross the border.
