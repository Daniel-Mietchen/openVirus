<p>The study revealed that there was a high level of knowledge about Ebolaâ€”its origins, prevention, and treatment, and a high level of fear. Yet, changing behavior was weighed against the need to continue regular socioeconomic activities, much of which is subsistence work. In towns at the border of Uganda and the DRC, traders regularly cross the border to engage in market trading, and to obtain cheaper goods and items. Although long-distance truck drivers in Vurra, Northwest Uganda, are afraid of Ebola, they still have to cross deep into areas of the DRC in order to do their work. 
 <italic>Boda boda</italic> (motorcycle taxi) drivers (

 <italic>boda bodas</italic> are the least costly way to transport a dead body. In Luweero, we interviewed one family that had multiple Ebola survivors (and deaths) because one son had transported a sick person in 2012 and who was later found to have Ebola.
