<p>Qualitative data analysis employed an inductive and emergent approach, typical in thematic analysis [

 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. After the codebook was developed, we pilot tested it on five KII transcripts and two FGD transcripts from various cultural groupings. The coding process was iterative and ongoing and used a priori codes chosen beforehand and in vivo codes that came up throughout the analysis [

 <xref rid="pone.0230683.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Once the codebook was finalized, multiple coders coded text from the FGDs, the KIIs, and relevant field notes. One single researcher synthesized codes into broader themes. Patterns were identified by examining the frequency of codes, code context, and how the codes could be grouped into categories. These specific themes were refined further to develop the final list of themes and theme definitions.
