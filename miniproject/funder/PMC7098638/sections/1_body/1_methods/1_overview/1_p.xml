<p>We use an anthropological approach to describe the political and economic context of livelihood strategies and (mis)trust in the epidemic response in order to inform Ebola prevention, transmission, and preparedness. Our research engages with previous anthropological work on low community uptake of Ebola response activities and contributes to the literature on Ebola by investigating the ways in which borderland dynamics and political economy shape trust. Anthropological research was conducted in February-March 2019 in 17 border districts designated by the MOH as being at moderate-risk (Priority 2 and 3) and high-risk (Priority 1) of EVD in Uganda. The research informed the Ministry of Health National Task Force on Ebola risk communication and social mobilization (RCSM) work related to Ebola preparedness in Uganda.</p>
