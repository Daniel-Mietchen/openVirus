<p>The study was primarily conducted in district offices, health facilities (public hospitals, private clinics and pharmacies), daily-livelihood spaces (market areas, local shrines, water collection points, village meeting points) and at formal and informal border crossings. In each district, research assistants met with the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO; the district administrator) and District Health Officer (DHO) to get the relevant approvals for research. All introduction and study approval letters were stamped by each districtâ€™s officials. From there, the team commenced work with an interview with the DHO or an official in the DHO's office. These interviews served as a guide to help us to hone our study sites in each district.</p>
