<p>In this paper, we investigated the borderland context of Ebola, with a particular focus on livelihood strategies, constraints, and (mis)trust in authorities. We have confirmed existing anthropological literature on border dynamics and how local context contours community responses to Ebola preparedness and control activities. Namely, communities with existing mistrust in authorities must be considered when designing more context-specific approaches. Additional work must be conducted to respectfully engage fishing communities, especially given the longstanding mistrust in government authorities. Ebola response activities should also consider the numerous informal points of entry along the porous DRC-Uganda border, where a majority of citizens cross routinely. The lack of surveillance activities in these areas portend negative consequences for current and future disease control efforts. Moreover, these findings should apply to other epidemic contexts, especially in borderlands. More research around policy and service delivery in border areas is urgent and critical to building effective public health strategies in border regions. Within this agenda, we argue that the efforts to strengthen linkages to communities during an Ebola response must be sensitive, locally responsive, and must promote meaningful partnerships.</p>
