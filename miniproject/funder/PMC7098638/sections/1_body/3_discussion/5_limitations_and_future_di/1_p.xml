<p>Our research focused on towns and border crossings. Additional research should focus on more rural areas in high-risk districts, beyond town centers. Many rural areas in the high-risk districts experience high traffic at informal border crossing points as community members go about their daily routines. Moreover, when persons crossing from DRC might avoid the formal border crossing points in towns, they resort to passing through rural areas with less monitoring. While it was important to engage local leaders in the process, we may have also oversampled from their networks. It would be important to include voices of those not connected to local leaders. Trust would also have implication for uptake of treatment, referral to Ebola Treatment Units, and uptake of vaccines. There are additional opportunities to build on research on those topics, similar to the work of other researchers [

Lastly, our work was conducted in a context of Ebola preparedness, before the outbreak crossed the border into Uganda. We were also time limited in conducting this research given the urgency due to the need to respond to an emergency. Trust is a difficult concept to operationalize. We encourage other researchers to build on our methods and findings to improve measurement of trust. We also see value in research that considers additional manifestations of trust, such as health-seeking behavior or movement across borders. Additional research on trust should be conducted on the DRC side, as well as in Uganda.
