<p>Meanwhile, while work on trust has been conducted it also highlights the under-researched nature of this topic in an Ebola context [

Here, our work contributes to the literature on trust and Ebola by investigating the ways in which borderland dynamics in a marginalized setting shapes trust in authorities. In an area with a porous border, not only people move, but ideas and rumors cross borders as well. In a region where the health systems are under-resourced, trust in government health workers was lower compared to private health workers. The dynamics of trust are often driven by life in the borderlands, where trust is a complex issue shaped by a political-economic context of colonialism and postcolonial economic policies.
