   <italic>Enhance sensitizing and training targeting individuals working in the transportation sector</italic> (i.e. 
   <italic>boda boda</italic> and truck drivers) to bring attention to the risk of transporting ill persons or dead bodies.

   <italic>Train and engage more Village Health Workers (VHWs) to accompany Ebola response efforts at the community level</italic>. Due to limited access to health care facilities, VHWs are critical to enhance Ebola preparedness in hard-to-reach areas. During an outbreak such as currently in DRC, neighbouring countries can consider increasing deployment of VHWs through tapping into volunteers trained specifically for Ebola or other such outbreaks.

   <italic>Engage trusted groups in border districts</italic>, including local leaders, NGO workers, private health workers, or religious leaders. These individuals should be engaged and supported to lead context-specific Ebola prevention activities.

   <italic>Translate messages into local languages</italic> and offer solutions, not just prescriptive "practices to avoid". In other words, due to significant barriers (e.g. livelihoods) to taking up Ebola prevention measures, it is important that we demonstrate ways to safely conduct burials, if possible. If we persist with a "stop" all behaviors approach, the uptake will be low and individuals may not take up recommendations.

   <italic>Support economic well-being</italic> approaches that bolster economic security, especially in the short-term during an epidemic. If a root cause of border crossing is livelihood, then the response should either support linkages to alternatives, or support mechanisms that secure (ideally both) informal and formal POEs.

   <italic>Coordinate response efforts across borders</italic>. This research demonstrates the interconnectedness of border regions. It is imperative that activities do not stop at the border, but specific coordination is in place to address the dynamic and porous border.
