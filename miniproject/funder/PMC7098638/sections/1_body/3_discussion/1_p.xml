<p>Our research points to interrelated themes on Ebola in the borderlands of DRC-Uganda, from the perspective of 287 participants in moderate- and high-risk districts in Uganda. In the border context, communities are inter-linked and frequently travel across porous borders. Livelihood strategies and economic need necessitate cross-border travel, even when Ebola is present. The need to earn a living and survive is weighed against a perceived risk of Ebola, and these mental calculations shape individual decisions. Further, this constant cross-border movement has implication for the spread of information and lowered trust in Ebola response efforts. Our work demonstrates the importance of understanding the political economy of borderlands, where structural violence by the state contributes to community perceptions of neglect and disadvantage.</p>
