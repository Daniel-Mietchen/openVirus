 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>Flu-related variables can be freely downloaded from the FluNet website. However, Philippine Data Privacy Act restricts our ability to share potentially identifiable health data so we cannot share the dataset with counts of deaths per day. Data on deaths per day can be obtained from the Vital Statistics Division (VSD) of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Contact Aurora Reolalas, Chief of VSD at PSA (+632 8461 0500 local 820). On the other hand, meteorological data can be secured from the Climatology and Agrometeorology Division (CAD) of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAG-ASA). Contact Edna C. Juanilo, Weather Services Chief of CAD PAG-ASA (
  <email>ejuanillo@pagasa.dost.gov.ph</email>; +63 02 434 9024/ +63 02 435 1675).
