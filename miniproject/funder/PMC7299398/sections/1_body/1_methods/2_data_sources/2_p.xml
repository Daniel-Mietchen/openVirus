<p>Weekly percentages of laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B cases in the Philippines were obtained from the WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) FluNet database [

 </bold>). The GISRS data for the Philippines was collected through passive surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection cases at sentinel sites located throughout the country. In the surveillance, ILI was defined as an acute respiratory infection with measured fever of ≥38C° and cough with onset within the last 10 days while severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) was defined as an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38C° and cough with onset within the last 10 days and requires hospitalization [

Laboratory confirmation of influenza virus from clinical samples was performed at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, Metropolitan Manila, Philippines (the WHO-designated National Influenza Center) by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. More details about the surveillance can be found in a previous study [
