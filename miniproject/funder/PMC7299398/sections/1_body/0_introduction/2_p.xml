<p>Although the burden of influenza has been extensively evaluated in temperate regions of Europe and North America, it is less well characterized for many countries in Asia. The Philippines is located in Southeast Asia’s tropical climate region, which is generally considered an important source of new viruses and global influenza epidemics because of the large and highly interacting human and animal populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0234715.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Circulating influenza strains tend to match the Southern rather than the Northern Hemisphere vaccine strains, hence the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine is used in each year’s national vaccination program [

The mean annual influenza incidence rate has been estimated as 5.4 per 1,000 individuals in an urban region of the country, with particularly high incidence (22.6 per 1,000) in young children [
 <xref rid="pone.0234715.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the rate of influenza-associated mortality has not been quantified. Here, we used negative binomial regression models to estimate the influenza-attributable excess mortality in the Philippines from 2006 to 2015, and compared these influenza mortality estimates with death registry data to quantify under-reporting of influenza deaths.
