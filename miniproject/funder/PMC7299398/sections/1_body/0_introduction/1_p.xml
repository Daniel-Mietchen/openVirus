<p>Influenza is a serious public health concern that causes 3âˆ’5 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths worldwide each year [

Estimates of the influenza burden in individual countries are needed to formulate public health policies and strategies to control influenza. This is particularly important to protect those at greater risk of developing life-threatening influenza complications, such as young children, older adults, and people with chronic illnesses [
