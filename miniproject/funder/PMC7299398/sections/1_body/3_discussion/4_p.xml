<p>For each age group, we estimated significantly more influenza deaths than the numbers registered in national statistics. Although this might partly follow unreliable use of ICD-10 during death registration and low level of diagnostic confirmation [
 <xref rid="pone.0234715.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we suspect that our greater estimates largely result from the additional deaths from underlying health conditions exacerbated by influenza (e.g., cardiovascular conditions) besides those caused by influenza directly (e.g., influenza that leads to pneumonia). Our findings suggest that influenza mortality in the Philippines is greater than previously thought, and this information may help encourage improvements in the national influenza surveillance and public health programs. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage among risk groups could be an effective way to reduce influenza-attributable mortality in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0234715.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indeed, vaccination coverage was only 2.3% for adults aged 60 years and older during the Philippinesâ€™ last public influenza vaccination program [
