<p>The age group-specific EMRs estimated in our study are consistent with previous Filipino influenza mortality estimates by Iuliano et al., who estimated mortality rates per 100,000 of 4.0 (95% CI: 0.6−8.5) for those aged less than 65 years and 50.8 (95% CI: 12.9−96.1) for 65−74 year-olds [

However, these earlier estimates for the Philippines were extrapolated using EMRs of neighboring countries, and may not fully reflect the local parameters used in our study. On the other hand, our EMR for children aged &lt;5 years of 2.1 per 100,000 is close to a recent meta-analyses by Wang et al. who found that EMR for the said age group for low-middle income countries is 1.7 [
