<p>The authors intend to compare all-cause influenza-associated mortality with cause-specific influenza-associated mortality. The most commonly used cause-specific mortality is respiratory (ICD10 â€¦) e.g. references 1 and 2. The authors only look at J10 and J11 (influenza the main cause of deaths). This is of cause interesting, but it would have been of more interest, if they (also) had looked at respiratory cause of deaths, and made serious comparisons, for example if there is a general relation e.g. has it been suggested that influenza-associated mortality estimated using all-cause is the double of respiratory.</p>
