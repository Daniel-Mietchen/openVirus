<p>6. Reading through the methods, I assume that the data from the 2009 pandemic period were included in the analyses, is this correct? If so, I would suggest that the authors rerun the analyses with the pandemic data excluded. This is particularly important if they are seeking to estimate the mean annual EMRs associated with influenza. A quick look at the data suggests an additional few hundred deaths (~300 deaths) annually if the data from the pandemic period are included.</p>
