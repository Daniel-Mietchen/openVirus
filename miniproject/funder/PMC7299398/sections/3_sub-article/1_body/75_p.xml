<p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript estimates Influenza-associated excess mortality in the Philippines during the period 2006 through 2015 using negative binomial regression models. As the authors indicate, mortality burden of influenza in the Philippines has not been quantified before thus findings from this manuscript will help to inform public health policies and strategies for the control of influenza.</p>
