<p>We disagree that our results are surprising in this aspect. While we modelled all-cause mortality, we expect that most of these deaths would be respiratory deaths and cardiovascular deaths since these are the top causes of mortality in our population and other studies have linked flu to respiratory and cardiovascular deaths. Since our outcome includes respiratory deaths, our estimates should be close to Iuliano et alâ€™s estimates.</p>
