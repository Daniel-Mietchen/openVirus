<p>We had to drop weather stations that had 6-monthsâ€™ worth of missing data so in effect, our meteorological averages were computed from 37 instead of 52 weather stations. We therefore cannot conclusively say that the weather stations we ended up using are proportionate to the population. Furthermore, using a weighted mean calls for another layer of assumption, specifically, the weight to be used. Because of these reasons, we decided to use the simple mean instead. </p>
