<p>We have done as you suggested in lines 88-94: “In the surveillance, ILI was defined as an acute respiratory infection with measured fever of ≥38C° and cough with onset within the last 10 days while severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) was defined as an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38C° and cough with onset within the last 10 days and requires hospitalization.” Our definitions are aligned with the definitions by FluNet and WHO. </p>
