<p>Upon reviewing our files, we found out that this sharp peak was due to a typographical error that arose when we transferred our estimates to Excel to generate the graphs. Apologies for this inconvenience and thank you for noticing. Please rest assured that all estimates were done appropriately â€“ it was just in the graphing that the error arose.</p>
