<p>Apologies for being unclear. What we meant to say was that we wanted to compare the flu mortality estimates with the official flu mortality data from the death registry data. So that it will be clearer, we revised the sentence into (lines 66-69): “Here, we used negative binomial regression models to estimate the influenza-attributable mortality in the Philippines from 2006 to 2015, and compared the flu mortality estimates with death registry data to understand under-reporting of influenza deaths.” </p>
