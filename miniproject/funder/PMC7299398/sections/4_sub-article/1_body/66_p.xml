<p>While there was a peak in actual all-cause mortality in 2014 due to Haiyan, we do not think that models are made to predict all the peaks and troughs as exactly as the real data. We would run the risk of overfitting the model if we try to predict every single peak and trough. However, since Haiyan is a special event that needs to be accounted for, we have revised the modelling strategy to control for the Haiyan week. We found that our updated results did not lead to drastically different estimates. We also found that the original models without the Haiyan and pandemic controls and the revised models perform well as its predicted all-cause mortality is 90+% correlated with the actual all-cause mortality. For the final paper, weâ€™ve decided to include the Haiyan variable in the main model.</p>
