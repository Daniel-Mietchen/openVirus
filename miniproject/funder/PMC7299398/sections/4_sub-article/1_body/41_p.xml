<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree that Haiyan caused an unusual spike in death for week 45 of 2013. However, we felt that it would be better to keep the data as it is for the base case, and then run the modelling on imputed values. We dealt with it by adding a dummy variable for Haiyan as a control variable instead. We conducted a sensitivity analyses that either excludes this week or used an imputed value instead and found that the results did not change to a large degree.</p>
