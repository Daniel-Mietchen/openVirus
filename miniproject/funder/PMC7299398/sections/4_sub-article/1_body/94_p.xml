<p>ILI sentinel surveillance sites are health centers and hospital outpatient departments while SARI sentinel surveillance sites are hospital inpatient departments. The FluNet data did not specify how many sites there were, but according to this study which documented flu surveillance in the Philippines, from 2006 to October 2008 there were 18 health centers and 18 outpatient departments. Then by 2009, 16 more health centers were added. As of 2009, there were 52 sentinel sites. Unfortunately, we cannot find a dossier that gives an update on the number of sentinel sites from 2009-2015, 2015 being the last data point of our study. We have added these details in the methodology.</p>
