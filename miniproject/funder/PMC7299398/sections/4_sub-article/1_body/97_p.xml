<p>We apologize for the confusion. The World Meteorological Organization has no specific guideline on average weekly temperature. We just applied their recommendation for average daily temperature to come up with the weekly temperature. Specifically, on page 78 of their manual, they say that “All ordinary climatological stations observe a daily maximum and minimum temperature … Hence, the recommended methodology for calculating average daily temperature is to take the mean of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures.”</p>
