<p>Thank you for this excellent point. We tried running the models without the pandemic year but the results seem to be close to the original EMR of 5.33 per 100,000. In fact, we got a slightly higher EMR of 5.81 when we excluded the pandemic year. Thus, we decided to just keep the whole dataset and run the models with the pandemic year controlled for. After controlling for the pandemic, our new runs yielded a more conservative estimate of EMR of 5.03.</p>
