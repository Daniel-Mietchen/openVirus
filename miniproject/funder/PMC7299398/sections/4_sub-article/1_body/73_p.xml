<p>We agree with this point since other papers have used cause-specific causes of death in the modelling. There is however the problem of inaccurate coding of causes of death. Many doctors were not cognizant to the right way of coding cause of death on the death certificates (Hufana et al 2009). Due to this uncertainty in coding, we went with the conservative route of just using all-cause mortality instead of the cause-specific deaths because there is more certainty in the counts of total deaths than cause-specific deaths.</p>
