<p>Many previous studies (e.g. Aungkulanon et al 2015; Chow et al 2006) included meteorological controls in their models. A local paper by Lucero et al (2016) points out that flu circulates year-round, but is more pronounced from June to November. Given that the extant literature suggests that meteorological controls are important in modelling EMR, we included meteorological controls in all our models by default. </p>
