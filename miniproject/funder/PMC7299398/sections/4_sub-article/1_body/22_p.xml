<p>1. In line 78: The authors state, “No adjustment was made for under-registration of deaths”. Before that, the authors indicate that deaths “must be registered within 48 hours”. Isn’t this a contradiction? It would be of help to the readers if the authors could state why no adjustments were made for under-registration. Is it that no data are available to quantify deaths that are not registered, or perhaps that there is so much variation by site/hospital or region in the country to allow for meaningful adjustments?</p>
