<p>“Our regression models also projected a peak in influenza deaths in the week of typhoon Haiyan. Although this peak could be related to struggling health services and increased transmission of infections following the typhoon [27], it might also be partly influenced by the increased all-cause deaths at this time. By nature of regression analyses, trends of both dependent and independent variables are summarized by a fixed coefficient. Therefore, the peak in all-cause deaths – the dependent variable – could have translated to upward trends in estimated influenza deaths, even if the influenza positivity rates of tested samples were not elevated during the same period. Nonetheless, the overall EMRs were largely unaffected by this exceptional event since we controlled for the Typhoon Haiyan week in the main analyses and in the sensitivity analyses, where we used an imputed value to replace the peak in all-cause deaths for the Haiyan week.”</p>
