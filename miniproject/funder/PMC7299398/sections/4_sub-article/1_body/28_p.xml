<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We tried introducing up to two-period lags for the flu variables and the model with two lags yielded the best model fit. We did not introduce lags for the meteorological controls since this is not commonly done in similar studies (e.g. Aungkalanon et al 2015; Chow et al 2006). </p>
