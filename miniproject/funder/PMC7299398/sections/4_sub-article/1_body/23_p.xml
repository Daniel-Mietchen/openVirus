<p>Apologies for the confusion. We meant that the policy dictates that deaths should be recorded within 48 hours. But this does not always happen. In fact, there is one small study that quantifies the extent of underreporting. This was done in only one province in the Philippines so we cannot confidently say that the extent is true nationwide. Given the uncertainty of the degree of underreporting according to location and according to cause of disease, we have decided to not adjust for underreporting. Our findings would likely underestimate the burden of disease due to flu. We have included these points in the limitations section of our discussion. Moreover, since the analysis does not depend on 48 hour policy, we decided to remove that information to avoid confusing the readers. </p>
