  <p>The depletion of cathepsin C rescued cortactin polypeptide degradation in IAV-infected cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 cells were transfected with 10 nM of control (Ctrl) small-interfering RNA (siRNA) or cathepsin C (CatC) siRNA for 72 h. Cells were then infected with WSN at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3.0. After 24 h, total cell lysates of uninfected (UNI) and infected (INF) cells were prepared, and cortactin, actin, and viral nucleoprotein (NP) polypeptides were detected by western blotting (WB). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The cortactin and actin bands were quantified using Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR) and the levels of cortactin were normalized with the corresponding actin levels. Then, the normalized level of cortactin in the respective uninfected sample was considered 100% to determine its level in the corresponding infected sample. (
   <bold>C</bold>) A549 cells, transfected with control or cathepsin C siRNA, were processed to detect cathepsin C and actin mRNA levels by qPCR. Then, the levels of cathepsin C mRNA in control siRNA transfected sample and cathepsin C siRNA transfected sample were normalized with corresponding actin mRNA levels. Finally, the normalized level of cathepsin C mRNA in the control siRNA transfected sample was considered 100% to determine the cathepsin C mRNA level in cathepsin C siRNA transfected sample. The error bars represent the means Â± standard errors of the means of three biological replicates. The asterisks represent 
   <italic>p</italic>-values stated in the text and calculated by ANOVA (
   <bold>B</bold>) or unpaired t-test (
   <bold>C</bold>) and indicate significant differences in the means. MW: Molecular weight; ns: Nonsignificant.
