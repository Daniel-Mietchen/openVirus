  <p>The degradation-resistant cortactin mutants, D93E and D116E decrease the amount of IAV progeny released from infected cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) MDCK cells were transfected with empty plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Vect), plasmid expressing wild type (WT) GFP-cortactin or GFP-cortactin containing D27E, D93E, D96E or D116E mutations for 48 h. Cells were then infected with WSN (
   <bold>A</bold>) or NC (
   <bold>B</bold>) at an MOI of 3.0. After 24 h, the culture media from each cell were harvested and the amount of WSN (
   <bold>A</bold>) or NC (
   <bold>B</bold>) progeny released was measured by the microplaque assay. Then, the amount of progeny released from empty plasmid pEGFP-C1 transfected cells was considered 100% to compare the amount of progeny released from the cells transfected with indicated cortactin plasmid. Error bar represents the means Â± standard errors of the means of three biological replicates. The asterisks represent 
   <italic>p</italic>-values mentioned in the text calculated by ANOVA and indicate the significant differences in means; ns: Nonsignificant.
