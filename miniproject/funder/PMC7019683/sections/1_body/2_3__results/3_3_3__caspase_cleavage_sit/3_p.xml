<p>Next, we quantified the recovery in the full-length cortactin polypeptide level from degradation as a consequence of D93E and D116E mutations. For this, we overexpressed these two mutants alongside the WT GFP-cortactin and infected the cells with WSN, and GFP-cortactin polypeptide levels were analysed and quantified by WB as above. Both mutations though D93E (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>C), rescued the cortactin polypeptide from degradation during IAV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with reduction in endogenous cortactin polypeptide level above, the level of ectopically expressed GFP-cortactin WT polypeptide was reduced by a significant 79% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004) in response to IAV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). However, the level of GFP-cortactin D93E polypeptide was reduced by only 54% (though still significant, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) in response to IAV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Likewise, compared to a significant 76% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002) reduction in GFP-cortactin WT polypeptide level, the level of GFP-cortactin D116E polypeptide was reduced by only a nonsignificant 22% in response to IAV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). In other words, D93E and D116E mutations recovered the GFP-cortactin polypeptide levels in infected cells from 21% to 46% and from 24% to 78%, respectively. There was no significant difference in viral NP polypeptide levels between WT cortactin expressing cells and D93E or D116E mutant cortactin-expressing cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>E)), indicating that overexpression of these mutants do not affect viral protein expression.
