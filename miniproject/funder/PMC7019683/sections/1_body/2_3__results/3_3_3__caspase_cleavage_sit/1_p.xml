<p>We next endeavoured to identify the location of caspase cleavage sites in cortactin polypeptide using site-directed mutagenesis. Earlier, we could not detect a cleavage product of endogenous cortactin polypeptide in IAV infected cells by WB using the anti-cortactin antibody [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). We envisaged that cortactin cleavage occurs sequentially and at multiple locations resulting into fragments which are too small to detect under the WB conditions employed. This notion was supported by the identification of 34 putative caspase cleavage motifs in human cortactin polypeptide by CaspDB database [

 <xref rid="viruses-12-00087-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, four smaller fragments, marked with letters a, b, c, and d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), were observed when cortactin polypeptide fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminally was ectopically expressed from a plasmid in WSN-infected cells, and detected by WB using the anti-GFP antibody. (These fragments were also observed at a lower level in uninfected cells, presumably because of a basal level of caspase activation due to plasmid transfection).
