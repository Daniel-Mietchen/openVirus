<p>This indicated that cortactin polypeptide is getting cleaved at caspase cleavage sites that are located at the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminus, and the resulting cleavage products became sufficiently larger and detectable by WB after the addition of GFP (27 kDa). Therefore, to identify the caspase cleavage sites, we used this WB profile of wild type (WT) GFP-cortactin polypeptide as a template to screen ectopically expressed cortactin mutants containing Asp (D) â†’ Glu (E) mutation in P1 position of each putative caspase cleavage motif, XXXD (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00087">Figure S2</xref>). Out of 33 such cortactin mutants screened, we identified two mutations, D93E and D116E (

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] that rescued the full-length GFP-cortactin polypeptide from degradation in WSN-infected cells. Furthermore, the D93E mutation resulted in the disappearance of fragment b, whereas the D116E mutation shifted the mobility of the fragment a upwards in WB profile (
