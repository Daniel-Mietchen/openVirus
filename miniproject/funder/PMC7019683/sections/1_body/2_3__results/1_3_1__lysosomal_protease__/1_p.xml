<p>In our previous report [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we utilised lysosome and caspase inhibitors to identify the role of lysosome-associated caspases in cortactin degradation in IAV-infected cells. Lysosome has long been described to be involved in inducing the apoptosis under various conditions [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B have been shown to contribute to both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To further understand the role of this pathway, we sought to identify the cathepsins involved in cortactin degradation during IAV infection. For this, we performed a RNA interference screen and depleted the expression of representative cathepsins: Cathepsin B, C, D, G, H, K, O, and W [

The A549 cells depleted with the expression of individual cathepsins were then infected with influenza virus A/WSN/1933/(H1N1) strain (hereafter referred as WSN), and the level of cortactin polypeptide was compared in uninfected and infected cells by western blotting (WB) using actin as loading control. This initial screen indicated the involvement of cathepsin C in cortactin degradation during IAV infection. Out of the cathepsins that were targeted, the depletion of cathepsin C expression rescued the level of cortactin polypeptide in infected cells when compared to uninfected cells (
