<p>In conclusion, the data presented here has strengthened our argument that host cortactin is degraded during IAV infection by a lysosome-associated apoptotic pathway. The initial cleavage of cortactin polypeptide occurs at the 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminus in actin-binding repeat 1, and cleavage-resistant cortactin interferes with the IAV progeny release from infected cells. Further elucidation of the precise role of cortactin in IAV infection may reveal potential antiviral targets.
