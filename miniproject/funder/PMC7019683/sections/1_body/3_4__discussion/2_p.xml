<p>We also endeavoured to identify the caspase cleavage motif(s) on cortactin polypeptide using site-directed mutagenesis. The cortactin polypeptide has well-defined multifunctional domains: 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal acidic domain followed by 6.5 tandem actin-binding repeats (each 37 aa long), helical domain, proline-rich region, and 
 <italic>C</italic>-terminal SH3 domain [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cortactin binds to actin branching promoter complex, Arp2/3, and filamentous actin through its 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal acidic domain and actin-binding repeats, respectively, and promotes and stabilises the branched filamentous actin network [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The actin-binding repeats of cortactin also possess the acetylation sites [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Through its 
 <italic>C</italic>-terminal SH3 domain, cortactin interacts with proteins such as cortactin-binding protein 90 (CBP-90), zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), and Dynamin 2 that are involved in signal transduction, cytoskeleton regulation, and membrane trafficking [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further, cortactin undergoes phosphorylation on several sites spanning the helical domain and proline-rich region [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The phosphorylation and acetylation conversely regulate the cortactin folding and actin-binding functions [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Apparently, each of these cortactin domains has a putative caspase cleavage motif (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00087-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Particularly, each of the cortactin actin-binding repeats possesses at least one caspase cleavage motif (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00087-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This suggests the complete removal of actin-binding and consequently branched filamentous actin-stabilising capability of cortactin during the late stages of IAV infection. Indeed, consistent with this hypothesis, the two cortactin mutants, D93E and D116E out of 33 screened that rescued the cortactin degradation in response to IAV infection were located in actin-binding repeat 1 [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In other words, the cleavage of cortactin polypeptide occurs at caspase motifs VEQD (position 90–93) and SQVD (position 113–116) located within actin-binding repeat 1. However, we believe that cleavage on these motifs occurs independently of each other, because the fragment a did not disappear from WB profile of D93E mutant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) and the fragment b did not disappear from D116E WB profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Further, the cleavage of cortactin polypeptide is potentially not limited to only these two motifs, because we did not detect a larger cortactin polypeptide fragment. Our working model is that the first major cleavage in cortactin polypeptide occurs at SQVD motif (position 113–116) that exposes the rest of the polypeptide for further cleavage at VQMD motif (position 127–130) and DRVD motif (position 130–133) and onwards (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00087-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) by caspase-3 or other caspases. This model finds support from the data obtained with cortactin double mutants D116/130E (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00087">Figure S2</xref>) and D116/133E (not shown). While no change was observed in the WB profile of cortactin single mutants D130E or D133E, the mobility of fragment a shifted further upwards when these mutations were created along with D116E mutation (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00087">Figure S2</xref>, asterisk). Nonetheless, several additional simultaneous mutations in multiple caspase cleavage motifs of cortactin polypeptide are needed to propose a complete model of cortactin degradation during IAV infection.
