<p>Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and A549 cells were grown and maintained in a complete minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, and L-glutamine (Life Technologies) at 37 °C under a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Influenza virus A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1) and A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) strains were propagated in 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs and titrated on MDCK cells [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The plasmid expressing human cortactin-GFP fusion was a gift from Kenneth Yamada (Addgene plasmid #50728) [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and was amplified in
