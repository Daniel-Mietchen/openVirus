<p>Due to the small number of positive samples, only three variables were included in the final multilevel model for RVFV seropositivity in slaughterhouse workers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These were variables from the univariable analysis that had been previously reported as high risk for RVFV seropositivity and had p&lt;0.2. Age was included in the model since it is a common confounder [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. No further model selection was performed. The final model included age, if the worker only slaughtered cattle and being the slaughter man (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005731.t004">Table 4</xref>). Being the slaughter man was significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity in slaughterhouse workers after multi-level analysis (OR 3.5; 95% CI 1.0â€“12.1, p = 0.047).
