<p>Using univariable logistic regression there was not a significant difference in seropositivity between genders (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005731.t001">Table 1</xref>). There was a significant difference across age with only one seropositive individual in the 5–19 year age group giving a seroprevalence of 0.1% (95% CI 0.0–0.6%); compared with 14 positives (1.6%, 95% CI 0.9–2.6%) in the over 20 year age group. The youngest seropositive participant was aged between 10–14 years (age data was collected in categories).
