<p>Variables that have been previously described as being associated with RVF seropositivity were tested using univariable logistic regression analysis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005731.t001">Table 1</xref>). Variables that were significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity included: increasing age (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1–1.4, p &lt; 0.001), owning goats (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.1–8.7, p = 0.033); slaughtering cattle at the homestead (OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.1–11.5, p = 0.029) and sheltering goats and sheep in the house (OR 4.9; 1.1–22.3, p = 0.039). Other variables that have been associated with RVFV seropositivity in previous studies such as handling animal abortus, and assisting with animal birthing were positively associated with RVFV seropositivity but not significantly using the traditional level of 0.05 (
