<p>Variance Inflation Factors (VIFS) were calculated to check for collinearity. VIFS &gt;4 were considered a problem and the variable removed from the model. The Moran’s I statistic was calculated to check for spatial autocorrelation in homestead/slaughterhouse level residuals which can influence the stability of model co-efficients. The Moran’s I statistic measures if the outcome (group level residual log odds of seropositivity) is clustered or randomly distributed through space [

 <italic>ape</italic> package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in R. A histogram of the group-level residuals was made to check for normality.
