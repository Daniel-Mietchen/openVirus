<p>Multi-level logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for RVFV seropositivity in community members and in slaughterhouse workers and estimate the strength of the relationship with the outcome. A multi-level mixed effects logistic regression model was used to account for the clustering of individuals within homesteads. A separate multi-level mixed effects logistic regression model was used to account for the clustering of workers within slaughterhouses. Univariable logistic regression was used to screen variables of interest, against disease seropositivity at the individual level. Variables were included from both the individual and homestead/slaughterhouse level. Variables screened were those that have been previously identified as risk factors associated with RVFV seropositivity for community members and slaughterhouse workers (
