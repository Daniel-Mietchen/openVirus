<p>Group level variation in the final models was examined to assess the importance of the homestead/slaughterhouse in explaining individual risk of RVFV seropositivity. The Median Odds Ratio (MOR) was calculated for the final models. The MOR expresses the between group variance on the odds ratio scale, and therefore provides a measure of the between group variability in individual risk for an outcome that can be interpreted on the same scale that risk factors are interpreted [
