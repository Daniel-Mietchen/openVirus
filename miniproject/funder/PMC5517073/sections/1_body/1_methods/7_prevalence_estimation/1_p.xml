<p>Confidence intervals (CI) around apparent prevalence estimates were calculated using the

 <italic>prev</italic> function in the 
 <italic>EpiR</italic> package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] of the R environment for statistical computing, version 3.0.2 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>). To account for the hierarchical nature of surveys in both the community and in slaughterhouse workers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], design-based adjustment was implemented using the 
 <italic>svydesign</italic> procedure in the 
 <italic>Survey</italic> package in R [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Sampling weights were calculated for the community sample by dividing the number of people per division (from the Kenyan Human Population Census of 2009) by the number of people sampled in each division. Sampling weights for slaughterhouse were calculated by dividing the total number of workers by the number sampled in each slaughterhouse. Homestead and slaughterhouse were included as clustering variables in the community and slaughterhouse samples, respectively. The true prevalence estimate accounting for the RVFV IgG ELISA sensitivity and specificity, but without accounting for the complex survey design, were calculated using the 
 <italic>truePrev</italic> function in the 
 <italic>prevalence</italic> package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] of R. The sensitivity and specificity of the test have been reported to be 100% and 95.3â€“100% respectively [
