<p>A kernel smoothing approach was used to map the intensity of positive homesteads and slaughterhouses using the 
 <italic>sparr</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] package in R with a fixed bandwidth of 5km and correction for edge effects. A bandwidth of 5km was chosen because it is the approximate diameter of sublocations in the study area. The kernel intensity of seropositive homesteads/slaughterhouses was divided by the kernel intensity of the all homesteads/slaughterhouses in the study area creating a “risk” surface. This technique is not a test for clustering but produces spatially smooth risk maps that allow areas with the greatest risk for seropositivity to be identified.
