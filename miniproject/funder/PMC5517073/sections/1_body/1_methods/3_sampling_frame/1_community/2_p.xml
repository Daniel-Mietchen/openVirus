<p>Homesteads were randomly selected using a two-stage cluster design. The study area was divided into 143 sub-locations, which is the smallest administrative unit in Kenya. The number of homesteads selected from each sub-location was proportional to the cattle density i.e. more homesteads were sampled in sub-locations with more livestock. The information on livestock population density was obtained from the Divisional Livestock Production Office (DPLO) and based upon a 2005 livestock census inflated by 10% per year. The cattle population of the study site was estimated to be 557,418 cattle. The number of homesteads sampled per sub-location varied from 1 to 8. The human sample size was the number of individuals living in the selected homesteads.</p>
