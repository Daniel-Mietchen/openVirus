A handheld Global Positioning System (GPS Garmin eTrex), was used in the field to locate each point. The nearest homestead within 300 metres of the point was recruited into the study. If there were no homesteads in the area or the homestead head refused to participate then a backup point was used. The homestead head was advised of the study aims and objectives and recruited into the study, and an appointment made for data collection and sampling the following week.
