<p>The study population included every ruminant slaughterhouse worker in the study area. The location of slaughterhouses in the study area was obtained from the former District Veterinary Officers (now County Directors of Veterinary Services) who had oversight over meat inspection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005731.g001">Fig 1</xref>). There were 88 ruminant slaughterhouses identified in the study area. Inclusion criteria specified all workers, aged over 18 years and present at the slaughterhouse on the day of sampling. Due to the time required to process the samples on the day of collection, the number of workers recruited from each slaughterhouse was limited to 12. The mean number of workers in the slaughterhouses was 9 and the mean number of animals slaughtered per week was 21. In slaughterhouses with 12 workers or less, all willing participants were recruited. In slaughterhouses with greater than 12 workers, a random selection of 12 willing participants from the workers present on the day was sampled. On the day of sampling workers were assigned a number. This was written on a piece of paper and placed in a container. Numbers were selected from the container until twelve participants were chosen.
