<p>Sera from study participants were tested by indirect ELISA for presence of anti-RVFV IgG antibodies at Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Seropositive or seronegative results were compared to plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)-confirmed positive and negative controls for RVFV. The cut-off values used to determine positive readings were calculated by dividing the average positive control optical density (OD) value on each plate by two. Cut-off values used to determine negative readings were calculated by multiplying the average negative control OD value on each plate by two.
