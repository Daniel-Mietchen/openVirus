<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting livestock and people in Africa and the Arabian peninsula [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Epidemics of Rift Valley fever (RVF) are associated with greater than average rainfall, and are characterised by abortion in livestock and febrile illness in people [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RVFV outbreaks have not previously been reported in western Kenya since the initial discovery of the virus in the Rift Valley in 1931, although epidemics have occurred in neighboring regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has been suggested that the virus can be maintained in animal populations between epidemics and potentially spread to new areas through animal movement [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previous work has documented low-levels of RVFV exposure in western Kenya, compared to high-levels in north-eastern populations, but exposure to RVFV in high-risk occupations in western Kenya has not been examined [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The climate of western Kenya is sub-tropical with consistently high temperatures and humidity, and predictable rain/dry season cycles. The study area is semi-humid to humid with greater than 1200mm annual rainfall. This differs from the semi-arid rangelands that cover the majority of Kenya [
