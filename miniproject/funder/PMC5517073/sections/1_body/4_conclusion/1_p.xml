<p>This study investigated the epidemiology of RVFV in people in western Kenya. The study area was distinctly different from the regions of Kenya where RVFV outbreaks have been reported and where previous investigations have shown inter-epidemic transmission of RVFV. This study reported a low seroprevalence in the community and highlighted several previously identified risk factors in people including contact with animals and animal products. The study demonstrated that slaughterhouse workers are at a higher risk for exposure to RVFV and might be a sentinel for disease emergence. Methods to control infected animals being slaughtered such as antemortem meat inspection and education of workers should be implemented. The results suggest that RVFV virus is circulating in western Kenya. Improved surveillance in low risk areas is recommended particularly during countrywide outbreaks, to more accurately determine RVF burden.</p>
