<p>There have been two Rift Valley Fever epidemics in East Africa in the past 20 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In both outbreaks there were no human cases recorded in western Kenya. Research efforts focusing on the inter-epidemic transmission of RVFV have reported the seroprevalence in people in high-risk areas to range from 6% (95% CI 2.7–11.8) to 20% (95% CI 14.0–29.2) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In locations believed unaffected by RVFV outbreaks, the seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (95% CI 0–3.03%) to 3% (95% CI 0.94–6.78%) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The apparent seroprevalence for RVFV in the community in this study was 0.8% (95% CI 0.5–1.3). This is consistent with a previous report from Kabobo in the western highlands of Kenya (1%; 95% CI 0.03–5.45) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The study area presented here is a semi-humid environment with high average annual rainfall (&gt;1200 mm per annum) similar to that of Kabobo [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. LaBeaud et al (2007) theorised that the different climatic conditions across regions would account for the difference in seroprevalence estimates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Semi-arid regions with seasonal flooding events allow annual RVFV transmission resulting in high seroprevalence in contrast to semi-humid climates where only extensive rainfall allow RVFV transmission and hence low seropositivity [
