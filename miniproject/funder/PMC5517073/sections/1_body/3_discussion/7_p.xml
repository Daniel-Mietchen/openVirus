<p>The ELISA conducted in this study has been used in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The sensitivity has been described to be 100% where confirmatory testing was carried out and the reported specificity ranged between 95.3â€“100% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It was not possible to perform plaque neutralization confirmatory testing in this study. The true prevalence rates in both the community and slaughterhouse sample were substantially reduced when accounting for the vagaries of the diagnostic test, with the 95% confidence interval including zero. Genus-specific cross-reactivity is a known limitation with ELISAs. Although ELISAs are effective for general surveillance, the sensitivity and specificity are less than those for PRNT [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Participant exposure to other bunyaviruses, may have elicited a cross-reactive seropositive result, despite using antigenic proteins specifically derived from RVFV as a coating antigen. As a result, a fraction of our subjects may have been misclassified in terms of RVFV exposure. PRNTs were not performed to determine the species-specific origin of the IgG antibodies detected by ELISA, yet serum pools derived from samples confirmed as seropositive and seronegative for anti-RVFV IgG by PRNT were used as controls. Given the low risk of exposure to other

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], in the Busia region, we are confident that the results from this study are representative of RVFV exposure only.
