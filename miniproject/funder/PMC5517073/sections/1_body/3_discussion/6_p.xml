<p>The slaughterman who is directly responsible for slitting the animal’s throat is previously reported to be at risk for RVFV seropositivity in regions where epizootics occur [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is likely that aerosolization of blood at slaughter is a means for transmission of RVFV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The odds of being RVFV seropositive was significantly higher in slaughtermen (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.0–12.1, p = 0.047) compared to other roles in the slaughterhouse demonstrating that this is a high-risk position. Animals with RVF can present with abortion, hemorrhage, dyspnea, coughing, bloody discharges, anorexia, weakness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and it is possible that they might be removed from slaughter through antemortem inspection in order to protect workers from exposure. The impact of antemortem inspection on reducing RVFV exposure could not be determined from this study but should be considered for future investigations.
