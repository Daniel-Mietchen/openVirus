<p>The risk map demonstrated the highest risk for RVFV seropositivity in the community is in the south west of the study area bordering Lake Victoria. In addition there was a significant clustering of seropositive homesteads in this area (p &lt;0.001). Previous studies have demonstrated an association between RVFV seropositivity in ruminants and proximity to water bodies [
