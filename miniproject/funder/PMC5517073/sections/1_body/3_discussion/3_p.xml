<p>RVFV seropositivity in the community examined in this study was associated with increasing age (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.4, p&lt;0.001). This is consistent with findings by other researchers investigating risk factors for RVFV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] this is potentially the result of older people having more time to be exposed to infected materials and vectors since IgG antibodies for RVFV are considered to be lifelong [

The youngest seropositive individual was between 10–14 years (more accurate age data was not collected) and was potentially exposed to RVFV between 1998 and 2012. There was a countrywide outbreak in 2006–2007, however western Kenya was considered free of the disease at that time [
