<p>The apparent seroprevalence of RVFV in slaughterhouse workers was 2.5% (95%CI 1.5â€“4.2). These results are comparable to other studies that have been conducted in RVFV endemic areas. For example, in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, RVFV seroprevalence in slaughterhouse workers was 2% and 0.72% respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in slaughterhouse workers (2.5%) was higher than in the community population over 20 years old (1.6%), supporting the hypothesis that slaughterhouse workers are at higher risk for exposure to RVFV and that they may act as sentinels for RVFV, even in areas with low transmission [

The area with the highest spatial risk is in slaughterhouses located in the central region of the study area, along the main road networks into the study area, further indicating the possibility that animal cases may be imported from areas outside the study area. This highlights a difference in the risk profile between the community and slaughterhouse workers in this area suggesting that slaughterhouse workers risk is related to the movement of animals and not proximity to water. This hypothesis requires further investigation.
