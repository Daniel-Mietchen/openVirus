<p>Our ability to explore a range of predictors of seropositivity was limited by the small numbers of RVFV seropositive individuals. The self reported questionnaire was focused on risk factors for zoonotic disease associated with animal contact and did not include questions related to mosquito exposure and clinical data relevant to RVFV. In addition recall bias may have influenced responses regarding exposures. Conclusions cannot be made about when and where the individuals encountered the virus since antibodies to RVFV are likely to be life-long [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005731.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is possible that the seropositive people were infected with RVFV during travel outside the study area. It was not possible to test this hypothesis with the data available from this study. However, this is unlikely considering the clustered nature of the community sample and the plausibility of the identified risk factors.
