<p>Most clinical studies of TB vaccines have not studied the role that antibodies may play in contributing to prevention of TB. Accordingly, little thought has gone into defining vaccine-induced antibody target product profiles (TPPs). In creating an antibody TPP for TB vaccines, it is important to recall that antibodies do much more than recognizing and blocking infection via pathogen neutralization. By binding to antigens on the surface of infected cells, antibodies play crucial role in stimulating a broader and more effective immune response, including the inducement of cytokine secretion to recruit cells such as dendritic cells and T-cells involved in mediating CMI, inducing autophagy in infected cells, and prompting innate immune responses including the recruitment of neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and phagocytes.</p>
