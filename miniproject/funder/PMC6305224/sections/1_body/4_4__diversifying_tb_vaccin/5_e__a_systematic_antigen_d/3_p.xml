<p>An emerging hypothesis in defining optimal antigens to include in a TB vaccine is to identify 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens expressed during infection in the lungs of susceptible individuals

  <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>– 
  <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 </sup>. To identify such antigens, an unbiased, genome-wide antigen discovery approach was taken, utilizing 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> RNA isolated from the lungs of four different mouse strains, ranging from hyper-susceptible to TB (C3H/FeJ mice, the sst1 strain) to genetically resistant (C57Bl6 mice). Utilizing a genome wide qRT-PCR platform developed at Stanford University, 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> genes were selected that were persistently and highly expressed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> ( 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> expressed – IVE-TB – genes) at multiple time points following AE 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. 194 IVE-TB highly expressed genes were identified and 50 further selected based on ranking in the top 15% during infection; hyperconservation with wide HLA coverage and/or homology with 
 <italic>Mycobacterium leprae.</italic> Many of these IVE-TB antigens were found to induce strong CD4+ T central memory and CD8+ T-cell responses in PBMCs from long-term, latently 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infected individuals, and were recognized by both T- and B- cells
