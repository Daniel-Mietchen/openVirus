<p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines represent a non-viral delivery system of vaccine antigens that offers the potential of stimulating both the innate and adaptive immune systems in a manner that provides a balanced cellular and humoral antigen-specific response

 </sup>. Factors spurring interest in mRNA vaccines include their ability to express complex membrane proteins, induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses (unlike many protein antigens), permit efficient re-dosing given the absence of anti-vector immunity and their non-cell based manufacturing platform, allowing more rapid production than for vaccines requiring cell culture-based manufacturing processes. Potential cons to utilizing mRNA vaccines include the reactogenicity of the delivery systems currently in use which limits the mRNA dose and antigen multiplicity, and cost-of-goods considerations given target price points for a TB vaccine.
