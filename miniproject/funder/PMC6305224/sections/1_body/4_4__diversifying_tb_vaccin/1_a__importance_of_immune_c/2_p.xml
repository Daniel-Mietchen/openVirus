<p>Many of the more diverse immune responses likely to be important in controlling TB in humans may not occur in small animal models, or even in non-human primates. Accordingly, “experimental medicine” studies, involving 20–30 people and designed to gain a better understanding of a vaccine’s ability to generate the types of immune responses that may be critical in controlling TB, particularly those occurring in lung parenchyma, in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, and in the pulmonary mucosa, will be important to conduct. It also remains important to engage in parallel, more empirical vaccine efficacy and safety studies designed to inform immune mechanisms of protection. Collection of biospecimens in clinical studies in support of planned or future immunological studies, using the best technology available, is critical to permit retrospective analyses of correlates of protection once clinical protection is demonstrated by a vaccine under development.</p>
