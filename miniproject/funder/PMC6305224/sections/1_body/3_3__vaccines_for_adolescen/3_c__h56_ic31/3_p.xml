<p>Phase 1 and phase 2 studies of safety, immunogenicity and dose finding have been completed in IGRA+ and IGRA- adults, IGRA- adolescents, and in adults completing treatment for active TB. Thus far, the vaccine has demonstrated no safety concerns. Immunogenicity studies demonstrate a strong induction of ESAT-6 responses both in IGRA+ persons and in those completing treatment for active TB

 </sup>. Antibody responses also were noted in a proportion of vaccinees. Along the therapeutic track, an ongoing, open label phase 2a trial in Norway is assessing the safety and immunogenicity of H56:IC31 given three months into active TB treatment as adjunctive immunotherapy with and without additional COX2-inhibition (NCT02503839). A major phase 2 PoR trial of H56:IC31 is being planned and will enroll 900 persons being treated for pulmonary TB; 450 receiving vaccine and 450 administered a placebo (NCT03512249). The primary objective of this trial is to accelerate the development of H56:IC31 toward a possible phase 3 PoR trial and licensure for this indication. Capacity building and studies of mechanisms of reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy also represent important components of this trial.
