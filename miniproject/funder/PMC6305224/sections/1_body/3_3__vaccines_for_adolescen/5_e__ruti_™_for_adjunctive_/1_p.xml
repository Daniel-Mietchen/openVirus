<p>RUTI is being developed as an immunotherapeutic agent for adults, intended to improve the efficacy and shorten the duration of drug treatment for cases of active TB, including drug-resistant TB 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
 </sup>. RUTI is made of cell wall fragments of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> formulated in a liposome suspension and is administered subcutaneously (SQ) in a single dose. Preclinical experiments demonstrate an added effect compared to 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> drug treatment in reducing 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> colony counts in mice, a reduction in regrowth rate as far out as week 28 following 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> challenge in guinea pigs, and a diminished TB relapse rate in a paucibacilli murine model of TB.
