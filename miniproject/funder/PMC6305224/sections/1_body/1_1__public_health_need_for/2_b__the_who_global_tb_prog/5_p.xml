<p>Currently, a U.S. $2.3 billion annual research gap exists in efforts to develop new tools to control TB, including better diagnostics and drugs, as well as TB vaccines

 </sup> a figure that may represent a conservative estimate of the actual funding shortfall, particularly considering the need to invest in efforts that will result in the development of an effective vaccine by 2025 for the targets to be reached. The ongoing United Nations (UN)–led efforts to prioritize action against TB is illustrated by a series of high-level political meetings. Top-level political engagement was demonstrated in Russia in November 2017 at the gathering of 194 ministers of health, research and finance, alongside the WHO Director General and the President of the UN General Assembly. This was followed by an interactive civil society meeting, attended by more than 250 representatives from civil society, academia, NGOs, and the private sector, setting the stage for the first ever UN General Assembly high level meeting (HLM) on TB in New York in September 2018. The HLM aims to deliver an ambitious political declaration on TB endorsed by Heads of State, which will strengthen action and investments to end TB. Issues to be discussed include the increase in drug-resistant TB strains, the need to provide adequate resources to control the epidemic, and to create a universal monitoring program to track the epidemic and the world’s response to it, will be highlighted. Accelerating development of a vaccine for TB will be a critical component in the future of TB prevention and care, therefore urgently requires increased resource allocation and political support in upcoming years.
