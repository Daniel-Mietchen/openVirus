 </sup>. The End TB Strategy relies on a number of priorities in the global response to the TB epidemic. These priorities include improving approaches to identifying cases of TB, addressing MDR-TB as a true public health crisis, and accelerating strategies to better prevent, identify and treat TB in HIV-infected individuals. A three-pillared approach to the TB epidemic is being implemented: 1) to advocate for integrated, patient-centered TB care and prevention; 2) to support the creation of bold policies and supportive systems to curb the spread of TB; and 3) to support intensive research and innovation to create the new tools needed to prevent and treat control TB, including better diagnostics and drugs, and a new vaccine capable of preventing TB disease.
