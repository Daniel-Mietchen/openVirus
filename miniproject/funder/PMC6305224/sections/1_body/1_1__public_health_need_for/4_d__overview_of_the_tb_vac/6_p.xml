<p>Unlike a PoR endpoint, however, it is unclear whether a PoI endpoint could serve as an indication for licensing for two reasons: 1) only approximately 10% of 
 <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected individuals ultimately develop active TB, so it is theoretically possible that infection prevention, should it be demonstrated, is only occurring in persons who would otherwise control their 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> even without vaccination and not develop TB disease; and 2) the prevention of infection endpoint depends on assessments such as the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) whose specificity and sensitivity are not 100%.
