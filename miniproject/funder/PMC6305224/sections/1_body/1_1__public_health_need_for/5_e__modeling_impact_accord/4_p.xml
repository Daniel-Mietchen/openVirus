<p>Modeling suggests that, before 2050, a PoD vaccine would have a greater and faster effect on controlling

Even if a 100% efficacious PoI vaccine were to be developed and made available by 2025, the target date for TB vaccine introduction set by the WHO End TB Strategy, a PoD vaccine also would need to be utilized if the 2035 End TB Strategy targets were to be met. The body of available mathematical modelling literature is at equipoise as to whether the effect of a PoD vaccine would be greater if administered to persons who are not yet infected with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> as compared to those who are latently infected, with three models predicting that a pre-infection vaccine would provide the greatest impact, while four suggest that a post-infection vaccine would have a greater effect on TB control. More recent modelling evidence, specifically exploring this issue suggests that in aging, reactivation driven epidemics like China, because over the modelled vaccination time frame most TB disease is predicted to occur among the elderly population, a PoD vaccine administered to persons latently infected with 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> would have greatest and most rapid impact
