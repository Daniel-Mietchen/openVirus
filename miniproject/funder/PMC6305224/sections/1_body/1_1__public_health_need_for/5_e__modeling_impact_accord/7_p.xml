<p>In summary, mathematical models of TB vaccine effect suggest that, for maximum impact before 2050, the optimal new TB vaccine would prevent 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> disease (although in transmission-driven epidemics a vaccine preventing infection would be useful), would be targeted for use in adolescents and adults, and would have a duration of effect of at least five years. Modeling also emphasizes that optimal vaccine strategies to control TB may differ between countries based upon the segment of the population that is driving the epidemic and so should be tailored accordingly. Future modeling exercises are needed to explore the effect of a PoR vaccine, to get a clearer picture of optimum vaccine strategies in other high burden countries such as India and South Africa, to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccines on controlling the spread of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), to gauge the impact of new vaccines in combination with the scale up of other interventions, and to assess the impact of TB vaccine administered as immunotherapeutic agents in persons being treated for active TB.
