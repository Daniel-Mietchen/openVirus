<p>VPM1002 is a recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine being developed both as a replacement for BCG vaccination in infants and as a TB vaccine in adolescents and adults

 </sup>. In VPM1002, a listeriolysin gene has been added to the BCG genome and a urease gene has been deleted, permitting the rBCG to escape the macrophage lysosome, which occurs in 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> infection but not with BCG. Processing VPM1002 antigens in the cytosol results in activation of the AIM2 inflammasome, inducing autophagy of the VPM1002-infected macrophage and stimulating innate immunity in a manner not seen with BCG. The manufacturing process for VPM1002 also offers the prospect of avoiding the frequent, global shortages of BCG, as it is manufactured using fermentation media, with a 50-liter batch yielding approximately 5 million doses.
