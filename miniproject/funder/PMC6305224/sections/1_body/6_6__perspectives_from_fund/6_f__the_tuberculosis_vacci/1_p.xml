<p>The TuBerculosis Vaccine Initiative (TBVI) is a non-profit foundation that facilitates the discovery and development of new, safe and effective TB vaccines that are accessible and affordable for all people. As a Product Development Partnership (PDP), TBVI integrates, translates and prioritises R&amp;D efforts to discover and develop new TB vaccines and biomarkers for global use. TBVI provides essential services that support the R&amp;D efforts of its consortium partnersâ€”50 partners from academia, research institutes and private industry in the TB vaccine field. A realistic strategy for TB vaccine development includes support for both upstream research and downstream clinical trials. It is imperative that a robust, healthy pipeline of TB vaccine concepts and candidates be maintained if the field is to move forward. The stage gating initiative, designed to encourage optimal management of the global TB vaccine portfolio, represents an important initiative in furthering this goal.</p>
