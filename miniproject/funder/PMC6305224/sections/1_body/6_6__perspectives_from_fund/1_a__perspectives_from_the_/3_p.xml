<p>2. To develop new vaccine concepts that exploit immunological diversity: The focus is on vaccination approaches that target unconventional (non-Th1) immunity

 </sup>. In addition to delineating immunity that occurs in the natural infection setting, induction of “unnatural immunity,” will also be explored, i.e., immune responses not induced during natural infection and disease. An example of a vaccine that fits this strategy is the CMV-vectored TB vaccine, being developed by Louis Picker and colleagues at the Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU), with major support from the BMGF
