 </sup>. Stage gates B and C include calls for exploration of safety, immunogenicity and protection in small animal species. In this context, protection is defined as being reproducibly and statistically better at preventing TB disease than BCG or a relevant benchmark. Ultimately, it will be important to determine the extent to which vaccine protection demonstrated in small animal
