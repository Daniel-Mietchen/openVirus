<p>An inhaled TB vaccine makes intuitive and logistical sense for a number of reasons

  <xref rid="ref-125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>
 </sup>. Primarily, an inhaled vaccine mimics the route of

Additionally, BCG, administered through the universally used ID route does not reliably protect against pulmonary TB. From a logistical perspective, inhalation represents a common route of drug delivery which is safe, feasible, needle-free and pain-free.
