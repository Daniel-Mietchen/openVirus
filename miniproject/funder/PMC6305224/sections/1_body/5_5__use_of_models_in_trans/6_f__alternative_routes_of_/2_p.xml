<p>Live, attenuated vaccines are an attractive vaccine strategy when targeting infections that are comprised of thousands of potential antigens and whose control depends on an effective and persistent T-cell response at tissue sites, such as malaria, leishmania and tuberculosis. Accordingly, live attenuated vaccines are an effective approach for generating T-cell responses of high magnitude and antigenic breadth compared to other vaccine platforms. Additionally, live or live-attenuated vaccines can stimulate T-cell responses in locations critical to inducing protection depending on the route of administration, thereby providing a rapid immune response at the time of infection. For malaria, intravenous but not subcutaneous immunization of a live, attenuated whole sporozoite vaccine was shown to induce a high frequency of antigen specific T-cells in the livers of NHPs. Also, attenuated sporozoites administered IV but not SC could protect humans against experimental controlled challenge
