<p>In summary, work is ongoing to develop an attenuated, labelled 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> strain for use in a human challenge study. An 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> CHIM is approximately 3â€“5 years away from clinical use, and regulatory discussions regarding its development are ongoing. Work is progressing on ID and AE BCG challenge models. Overall, a CHIM to assess TB vaccine candidates is considered feasible. Ultimately, however, any CHIM developed for this purpose will require validation against field efficacy trials.
