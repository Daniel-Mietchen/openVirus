<p>Efforts are currently underway to develop a human AE BCG challenge model. Key issues in this effort are the safety and tolerability of BCG administered via AE and the ability to recover BCG in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). No safety concerns have been reported from the study to date. Early assessments suggest that the extent to which BCG can be recovered in BALF appears to be low, which may indicate the need to administer higher BCG doses.</p>
