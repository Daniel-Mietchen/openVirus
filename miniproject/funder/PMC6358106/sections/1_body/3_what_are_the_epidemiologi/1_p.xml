<p>The possibility for simultaneous co-transmission of multiple arboviruses between 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and human hosts presents another unsolved question: Can coinfections resulting from single transmission events contribute to a significantly higher burden of coinfection? The exact role that co-transmission plays in the epidemiology of coinfection will depend on arbovirus transmission dynamics between 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and humans, whether cross-protective immunity between viruses reduces the probability of sequential transmission, and the extent to which epidemics of different pathogens coincide in space and time.
