<p>The rapid and continuous emergence of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) presents a serious challenge to public health. Multiple factors, such as urbanization, increased travel, and climate change, are fueling local outbreaks and global spread [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000130.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As a result, the annual burden of dengue virus has soared to an estimated 390 million infections [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000130.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The emergence of chikungunya and Zika viruses in dengue-endemic regions creates intriguing, and potentially alarming, scenarios. In urban settings, all three viruses share common hosts (humans) and mosquito vectors (primarily
