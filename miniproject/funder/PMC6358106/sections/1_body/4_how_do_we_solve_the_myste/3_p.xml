<p>Finally, because of extreme environmental changes that are occurring in the tropics, the selective environment faced by

 <italic>aegypti</italic>-borne viruses appears to be fundamentally different from what existed previously. It may be that these changes, including the rise of a much more complex set of viruses that can coinfect both mosquitoes and people, will alter the rates of arbovirus evolution, as well as the evolution of virulence [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000130.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Experimental investigations of within-host competition and selection during virus coinfection are needed to uncover the extent to which these rare but potentially abrupt events may shape arbovirus evolutionary dynamics (i.e., the theory of punctuated equilibria).
