<p>Taken together, based on evidence from laboratory studies, we can conclude that 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes may become simultaneously or sequentially coinfected in the field and that they are able to transmit multiple viruses during one bite. Currently available data on 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> suggest that simultaneous coinfection does not seem to have profound effects on transmission of individual viruses and, thus, there does not seem to be strong interference between viruses inside the mosquito or enhancement of one virus by another. However, sequential coinfection and additional mosquitoâ€“virus systems require further investigation.
