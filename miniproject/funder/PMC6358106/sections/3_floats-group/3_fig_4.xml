  <title>Model-predicted prevalence over time of two sequentially invading arboviruses.</title>
  <p>The transmission parameters of the viruses are identical, and virus Y invades one month after virus X in a population of 1,000,000. The top row shows the overall prevalence of both viruses and coinfection, and the bottom row shows coinfections only, delineated by the cause of the coinfection. The columns represent different scenarios of transmission from coinfected mosquitoes: no co-transmission on the left, 50% co-transmission in the middle, and 100% co-transmission on the right.</p>
