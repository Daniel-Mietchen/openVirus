  <title>Effects of coinfection on clinical disease in humans and virus transmission by mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Clinical outcomes were obtained from studies providing sufficient information for both single infected and coinfected patients [

Hemorrhagic fever includes all patients with clear signs of hemorrhage ranging from mild to severe, and dengue shock syndrome includes patients with hypotension, ascites, and pleural effusion. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Data on mosquito transmission were compiled from studies that made a direct comparison between mosquitoes exposed to a single or multiple viruses [

   <xref rid="pbio.3000130.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Transmission of coexposed mosquitoes was calculated relative to single exposed mosquitoes, with relative transmission being defined as transmission rate of virus X in mosquitoes coexposed to virus X and Y divided by transmission rate of virus X in single exposed mosquitoes. Transmission is expressed as the percentage of mosquitoes with virus in their saliva out of the total number of exposed mosquitoes. Relative transmission of 1 indicates that no difference was observed between transmission rates of single exposed or coexposed mosquitoes. Vertical black bars indicate the median. Data used to calculate relative co-transmission are available at
