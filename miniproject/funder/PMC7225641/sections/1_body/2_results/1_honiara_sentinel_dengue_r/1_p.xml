<p id="Par32">The sentinel clinic data for DLI reported for Honiara, which covered the period from 2013 to 2016, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The graph shows that two outbreaks with very similar outbreak patterns occurred within 3 years, i.e., in 2013 and 2016. The outbreaks involved a sharp increase in the number of DLI cases in the first month and peaked in the subsequent 3 months. The 2016 sentinel data represented 45% of all DLI syndromic cases, as reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The 2016 outbreak differed from the previous outbreak in that it started in August rather than in January. Furthermore, the continuous persistent occurrence of DLI was seen before the spike in August 2016.
