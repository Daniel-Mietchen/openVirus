<p id="Par42">The Solomon Island sequences were isolated from 2012 to 2016 and included 5 isolates from our study in April. The sequences in the tree were classed under DENV serotype 3, genotype-1. The PICT lineage, which included isolates from Solomon Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa, and Nauru, shared a bootstrap value of 84 and circulated the region. They shared a common linkage with isolates from PNG (KT758738/2011 and KT758776/2014). An ancestral link with a bootstrap value of 95 to an isolate dating back to 2007 (KY794787/2007) was shared by all isolates found in PNG, Australia, and the PICTs. They also shared ancestral links with the isolates that had been circulating from 1989 to1996. The ancestral links also showed that SE Asia played an important role in the evolution of DF and its introduction to the PICTs.</p>
