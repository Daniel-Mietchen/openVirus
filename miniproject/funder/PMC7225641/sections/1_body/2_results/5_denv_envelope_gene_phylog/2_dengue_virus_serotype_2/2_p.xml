<p id="Par44">They were all classified as DENV-2, genotype-cosmopolitan. There were two distinct DENV-2 lineages circulating the Pacific region in 2016. The Solomon Island samples were all very similar and had a very strong bootstrap value of 99, which indicated that the virus was introduced at a single point and was circulating for a very short period of time. The lineage shared an ancestral link with a bootstrap value of 99 with the PNG/Australia lineages (2013–2016). The other PICT lineage, which had a bootstrap value of 96, circulated in Fiji, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu from 2014 to 2017 and shared an ancestral link with a bootstrap value of 99 with sequences from PNG/Australia (2010–2013). The geographical distribution of the virus, which included the northern Pacific region (FSM 2011 and Palau 2016), suggested that there were multiple entry routes, possibly including the Philippines (2015–2016). Only the Solomon Island lineage (2016) shared common ancestry with a virus that was previously circulating the Pacific region (1996–1999).</p>
