<p id="Par49">The phylogenetic tree analysis and the serotype-specific qPCR results indicated that there was a single DENV-3 serotype in circulation from 2012 to 2016 in Solomon Islands. The newly introduced DENV-2 serotype in 2016 was responsible for the spike in cases seen in the latter part of 2016. This successful introduction was unique, as it was the first time that two serotypes were found to be co-circulating in the country. The co-circulation of multiple serotypes is a feature of endemic settings and was also recently reported in neighboring PNG [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], suggesting that such co-circulation is a potential threat in the region.
