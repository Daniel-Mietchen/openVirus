<p id="Par50">The presence of two lineages of the DENV-2 cosmopolitan serotype circulating the Pacific region in 2016 confirmed the heterogeneous nature of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and the importance of monitoring the outbreak potential of different lineages. It also highlighted the importance of performing molecular sequencing analysis to identify genotype and subgenotype lineages. The DENV has probably been introduced into the PICTs multiple times from multiple sources. Our study, however, seemed to highlight ancestral linkages to PNG where the circulation of multiple serotypes and the formation of local lineages had been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Better molecular surveillance in PNG will enable more accurate prediction of DENV outbreaks in the Pacific region.
