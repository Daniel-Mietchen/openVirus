<p id="Par47">The high qPCR-based DENV detection rate seen in our DENV-immune study population pointed to a high secondary DENV infection rate during the 2016 outbreak. Secondary infections involve heterologous DENV infections and are associated with an increased risk of severe DF [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The DENV responsible for the new infection will trigger antibody production from pre-existing plasma cells, but these antibodies will not be able to neutralize the newly introduced serotype. The non-neutralizing binding of the antibodies to the virus results in the formation of a complex that binds to the FcÎ³ receptor, which is expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, to facilitate antibody-dependent enhancement [
