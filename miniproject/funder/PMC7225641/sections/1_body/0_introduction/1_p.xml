 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The complex interactions between the virus and the human population have resulted in an unpredictable disease evolution and variable clinical outcomes associated with the infection. The majority of infections are mild and self-limiting, but a small number progress to severe clinical manifestations, which can lead to severe organ complications and even death [

 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Its RNA genome is approximately 11-kb long and contains an open reading frame, which codes for three structural and five non-structural proteins. The virus has four distinct antigenic serotypes and several genotypes, which produce different outcomes during outbreaks [
