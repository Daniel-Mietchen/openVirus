<p>The Pearson product-moment correlation analysis between the mean library size and one-standard deviation of Gaussian distribution was performed in R v3.3. The mean library size of the sample was computed using Picard-tools. The average one-standard deviation of Gaussian distribution per bait (&gt;95% identity), was calculated by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the genome coverage in a window of 480nt around the bait. Quickfold from the mfold [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] package was used to find the Gibbs free energy for DNA bait secondary structure formation at temperature 65Â°C, 1 mM Na and 0 mM Mg. The principle component analysis between the GC content, melting temperature, identity and mean coverage at the region where the bait hybridizes with the genome was carried out in R.
