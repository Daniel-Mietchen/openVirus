<p>Although we have currently only tested our methodology with Illumina sequencing, we foresee extending this methodology onto other sequencing platforms. Indeed, this methodology may have an even larger impact for the so called ‘third generation’ sequencing platforms (Pacbio and Nanopore) where average library sizes are far longer than Illumina but do not yield as many reads per run. Increasing the average library size would presumably translate to an even smaller number of baits required to capture full or near full genome coverage of the target virus as our results have shown strong positive correlation between library size and breadth of genome coverage (
