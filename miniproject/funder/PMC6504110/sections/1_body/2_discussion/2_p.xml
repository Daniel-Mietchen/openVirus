<p>Full-genome sequencing of DENV1-4, ZIKV and CHIKV directly from clinical samples is not a routine practice in clinical, or even research, settings due to the costs associated with labor, reagents and time. Additionally, given the low success rate of current methodologies, loss of precious samples is a strong deterrent. Other groups have utilized a tiling approach wherein baits are designed to cover the entire length of a limited number of target genomes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although effective, we show here that this strategy represents an over-allocation of baits and is unnecessary to obtain full genome coverage of the target virus. Our BaitMaker program designs a minimal number of baits for viral capture that are non-overlapping and has the ability to capture the known variation in viral strains. Our approach significantly reduces the overall number of baits necessary to capture the diversity in these viruses which in turn minimizes the cost incurred and should assist in the broader implementation of this methodology.
