<p>In this study, we have applied this methodology to a febrile cohort (n = 170) collected during a severe dengue outbreak in Sri Lanka and to a cohort (n = 162) collected during the 2016 Zika outbreak in Singapore. We were able to obtain full or nearly full genomes for the target viruses down to the limit of detection by qPCR. Importantly, we have combined bait panels for all four DENVs, ZIKV and CHIKV into a single assay and have detected a co-infection in a patient sample. Given the relatively small number of samples we have tested here and the overlapping clinical presentation of these viruses, the detection of a DENV/ZIKV co-infection indicates that the global prevalence of ZIKV and CHIKV could be higher than current estimates. Clinical management for DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV is largely supportive in nature with the vast majority of cases treated as outpatients and left to convalesce outside a clinical setting. Whether co-infection with these viruses is a predicator of adverse clinical outcome is largely understudied but it is a significant question that could potentially change clinical management and outcome for some of these patients [

Whether this result is due to differential viral kinetics, viral interference or temporal differences in the acquisition of each virus is an interesting question and is a subject of ongoing work.
