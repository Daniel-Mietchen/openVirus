<p>Finally, we believe that application of the approach employed here for bait selection would potentially improve upon the large, pan-viral enrichment panels such as those recently published by Briese et al, 2017 and Wylie et al, 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; with fewer baits required to achieve full genome coverage, more baits could be allocated to capture the known diversity in the targeted viral families. Increasing the amount of diversity in these panels would in turn increase the likelihood of capturing novel viruses in clinical and environmental samples.
