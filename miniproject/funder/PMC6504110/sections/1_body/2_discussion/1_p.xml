<p>DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV together represent the most significant arboviral threats to humans today with hundreds of millions of infections annually. These viruses are predominantly transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> species of mosquitoes whose global distribution has exploded in recent years, placing an estimated two-thirds of the worldâ€™s population at risk from contracting these diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Calculating the true burden of disease for each of these viruses is complicated by not only overlapping clinical presentations but importantly by the fact that they co-circulate [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Given the commonality of the arthropod vectors these viruses employ for their transmission, the contribution of co-infection with these viruses to morbidity and mortality is poorly understood.
