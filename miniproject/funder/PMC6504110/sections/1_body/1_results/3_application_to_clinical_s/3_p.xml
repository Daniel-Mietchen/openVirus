<p>To further examine the assumptions made by our method BaitMaker to generate baits, we investigated the baits’ features such as GC content, melting temperature, Gibbs free energy and sequence identity of the bait with the target genome and its effects on bait and target genome hybridization. We tested whether the baits’ features affected the baits’ pull-down efficiency, which is measured by the distribution of sequencing reads mapped to the genome around the bait. Based on the principal component analysis on the baits’ features and pull-down efficiency (

 </bold>), we observed that only sequence identity had an influence on pull-down efficiency and this efficiency decreases as the sequence identity between bait and target genome decreases. We next tested the effect of library size on the genome enrichment of the samples in both DENV and ZIKV cohorts (

 </bold>). We found that when the library size exceeds 300 nt, there is no further increase in coverage and this is expected as the baits were designed for library size of 300 nt. This further suggests that for larger library size, we can increase the bait design interval and thus only a smaller number of baits would be required to capture complete genomes. Thus, BaitMaker can efficiently design a set of minimal number of baits which is required to capture a complete genome.
