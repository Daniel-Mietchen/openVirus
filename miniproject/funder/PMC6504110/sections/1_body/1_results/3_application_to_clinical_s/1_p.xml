<p>To measure the efficacy of the bait panel in clinical samples, we first tested the protocol on clinical samples representative of each of the different serotypes of DENV. These four samples were collected from DENV-infected patients who were enrolled in the early dengue infection and outcome (EDEN) study in Singapore [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and from the DengueTools study in Sri Lanka [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The proportion of DENV reads relative to the host genome for different samples varied from 0.10% to 90.7%. After enrichment, the proportion of DENV-specific reads was between 94% and 99.6% for all serotypes tested. [
