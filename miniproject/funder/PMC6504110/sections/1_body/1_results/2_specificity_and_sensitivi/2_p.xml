<p>In order to assess the sensitivity of the assay, a 1:4 serial dilution of total RNA extracted from ZIKV infected Vero cells was prepared. In order to keep the level of host RNA constant, RNA extracted from uninfected Vero cells was used as the diluent. An approximate increase of two Ct values for each successive dilution with a range from 29.79 to 41.08 was observed for threshold detection. Libraries from these dilutions were then enriched and sequenced (

 </bold>. Our results indicate that as the Ct value increases, the depth of coverage decreases with respect to the breadth of genome coverage (

In the next dilution (31.57 Ct), this decreases to an average coverage of ~1000x reads per genomic position. Importantly, genome coverage at these depths is generally sufficient to assess inter/intra-host diversity in the virus population [

 </bold>). At further dilutions (Ct values 33.45 and above), the average depth of coverage which covers 90% of the genome drops below ~100x. Although this level of coverage is generally considered to be insufficient for the estimation of viral subpopulations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], consensus genomes can still be constructed and used for phylogenetic analyses.
