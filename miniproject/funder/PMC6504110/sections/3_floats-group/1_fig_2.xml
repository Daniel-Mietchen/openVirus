  <title>Genome coverage plots of unenriched and enriched samples of DENV1, ZIKV and CHIKV.</title>
  <p>The top panel (A, C, E) are unenriched samples whereas the bottom panel (B, D, F) are matched enriched samples with baits. From the outermost circle, each plot reads as the viral genes in the genome, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) detected, depth of coverage at each position in log scale shown in red and the baits hybridizing to the genome with varying sequence identity (80–85% identity in blue, 85–90% in dark blue, 90–95% in green and 95–100% in dark green). The number within the circle indicates the percentage of sequencing reads mapped to the genome.</p>
