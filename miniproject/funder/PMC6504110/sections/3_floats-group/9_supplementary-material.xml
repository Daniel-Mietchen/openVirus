  <title>Effect of library size on genome enrichment by the baits panel.</title>
  <p>The x-axis is the mean library size of the samples and y-axis represents the genome coverage distribution given by 1-SD (standard deviation) of the sequencing reads distribution enriched around the bait. The range of library sizes for DENV1, DENV4, and ZIKV cohort samples are between 80–374 nt (median 203), 38–379 nt (median 175) and 101–800 nt (median 329) respectively. The number of samples in each cohort is indicated by n. For each virus group (DENV1, DENV4 and ZIKV), the Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient is calculated and denoted by r and confidence interval around the correlation coefficient is represented by CI. For DENV1 and DENV4 samples, there is a very strong positive Pearson correlation between coverage distribution and library size as their library sizes were below 300 nt. In contrast, there is a weak positive correlation in the Singapore ZIKV outbreak cohort samples due to the larger library size and number of baits targeting ZIKV is relatively higher (at &gt;85% identity, DENV1 = 22, DENV4 = 20, ZIKV = 50). The black line represents the LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) fitted to all the cohort samples. When the library size exceeds 300 nt, there is no further increase in coverage. This is expected as the baits were designed for sample library of 300 nt. This further suggests that larger the library size, we can increase the bait design interval and thus only a smaller number of baits will be required to capture full viral genomes efficiently.</p>
