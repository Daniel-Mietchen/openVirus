Infections by these viruses present with similar clinical manifestations making them challenging to diagnose; this is especially difficult in regions of the world hyperendemic for these viruses. In this study, we present a targeted-enrichment methodology to simultaneously sequence the complete viral genomes for each of these viruses directly from clinical samples. Additionally, we have also developed a customized computational tool (BaitMaker) to design these enrichment baits. This methodology is robust in its ability to capture diverse sequences and is amenable to large-scale epidemiological studies. We have applied this methodology to two large cohorts: a febrile study based in Colombo, Sri Lanka taken during the 2009&#x02013;2015 dengue epidemic (n = 170) and another taken during the 2016 outbreak of Zika virus in Singapore (n = 162). Results from these studies indicate that we were able to cover an average of 97.04% &#x000b1; 0.67% of the full viral genome from samples in these cohorts. We also show detection of one DENV3/ZIKV co-infected patient where we recovered full genomes for both viruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Dengue viruses 1&#x02013;4 (DENV1-4), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are tropical and subtropical viruses that share a common arthropod vector, and have very similar clinical presentations that are difficult to distinguish. With the recent outbreaks of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV globally, a single methodology able to simultaneously distinguish these viruses and provide full-genome information would greatly increase our capacity to rapidly characterize outbreaks.

DENV and ZIKV are flaviviruses with positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes of ~11 kb that encode for a single polyprotein, which is then post-translationally cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are four different DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) that share 60&#x02013;75% identity at the amino acid level. Collectively, DENV1-4 are responsible for an estimated 390 million infections yearly [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Evidence suggests that the geographic distribution of DENV is increasing [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and poses a threat to travelers visiting affected regions [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].There is a single serotype of ZIKV that can be further broken down into two primary lineages, the African and the Asian/American. At the time of writing, ZIKV had spread to 86 countries [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and is a documented cause of microcephaly in infants when transmitted vertically from an infected mother during pregnancy [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CHIKV is an alphavirus with three major lineages, all of which comprise a single serotype [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The genome of CHIKV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~11.6 kb that is post-translationally cleaved into four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4) and five structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6k and E1) [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CHIKV has seen resurgence in the tropical and subtropical world with several notable epidemics in recent years [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Clinical presentation of infection with any of these six viruses is often similar; undifferentiated fever, headache, nausea/vomiting, persistent myalgia/arthralgia, and rash [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although PCR assays that can discriminate between these viruses exist, they are often not used in conjunction and are reliant on short primer sequences designed to target relatively conserved regions of the viral genomes [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As these viruses all share a common replication strategy dependent on error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, rapid mutation necessitates the constant optimization of molecular diagnostic protocols for their accurate detection [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further, these methodologies are limited in that they provide no information on the particular strain infecting the individual [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that polymorphisms in the viral genome can have profound effects on the pathogenicity and epidemic potential of the virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In response to these shortcomings, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly being used as a tool to obtain the full genome sequence of viruses in clinical samples [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the principle drawback to this methodology is the often-overwhelming amount of host material present in a clinical sample relative to the virus. In order to produce sufficient data for full viral genome assembly from these clinical samples, only a small number of samples can typically be run per lane of sequencing making this approach prohibitively expensive for many laboratories. To overcome the inherent limitations of this direct sequencing approach, a targeted enrichment approach to increase the sensitivity and efficiency of whole genome sequencing has been described for several pathogens of clinical importance [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One limitation of this approach is the high upfront cost associated with the enrichment baits. In the current study, we present a novel computation method, BaitMaker, to design baits that target the conserved and variable regions of a viral genome. The delineation of the conserved and variable regions is made possible by employing a computationally efficient k-mer based clustering approach on the available genetic information for DENV1-4, ZIKV and CHIKV in the NCBI database. We have then applied our methodology to two large cohorts: a collection of blood samples from the 2012&#x02013;2015 DENV epidemic in Sri Lanka (n = 170) and samples collected during the 2016 outbreak of ZIKV in Singapore (n = 162) [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>BaitMaker: An algorithm to design minimal baits for targeted enrichment method</title><p>Targeted viral genome enrichment followed by high-throughput sequencing is an approach to enrich viral genomes present in meager quantities in clinical samples. The targeted-enrichment methodology uses biotinylated DNA baits, 120 nucleotides (nt) in length that are complementary to the viral genome. Commonly used algorithms to design baits generate tiled, overlapping baits across conserved genomic regions selected by multiple sequence alignment [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While effective, these methodologies can generate redundant and overlapping baits, which serves to increase the cost of the methodology in practice. In order to minimize the number of baits necessary to capture a target viral genome, we developed a new computational method called BaitMaker. BaitMaker generates non-overlapping baits at an interval of 500 nt in the viral genome. This interval was chosen under the assumption that an average deep sequencing library size ~300 nt and one bait can pull down two overlapping 300 nt DNA fragments. Hence, our approach differs from similar methodologies where placements of baits are tiled across the target genome [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and allows for far fewer baits to be designed for each virus. In order to ameliorate the potential impact of reducing the number of baits available for capturing a targeted viral genome, BaitMaker incorporates a k-mer based pattern search and clustering strategy against a viral strain database (e.g. NCBI) to identify both conserved and diverse regions in the viral genome. BaitMaker then utilizes this information in one of two modes to design baits: (i) In &#x02018;Conserved mode&#x02019;, BaitMaker designs baits targeted to the species-level conserved regions whereas in (ii) &#x02018;Exhaustive mode&#x02019;, BaitMaker designs baits for both the conserved regions as well as regions with strain level variations.

(i) Conserved Mode: To generate conserved baits, complete or nearly complete viral genomes sequences were download from NCBI database. The mode generates baits for virus species at the region that is most conserved at species-level and present across the different strains. These conserved baits were identified by k-mer based search and clustering algorithm (PriMux) with the allowed number of six mismatches for bait hybridization. The baits were prioritized if the bait can target at least 70% of the sequences from NCBI. Assuming the sequencing library size is 300 nt, the overlapping baits within 500 nt were removed to get non-redundant conserved baits. For DENV, 65 conserved baits were generated. (ii) Exhaustive Mode: To generate exhaustive baits, viral sequences greater than 1000 nt were download from NCBI database. This mode generates all possible baits targeting all the sequences in the viral database and thus contains baits targeting all the different viral strains. Similar to the conserved mode, the overlapping baits and baits within 500 nt were removed. Then iteratively new baits were designed for the regions with no baits giving an exhaustive list of baits targeting all the genomic variation across different strains.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0007184.g001"/></fig><p>For DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, there were more than 11,000 genome sequences available in the NCBI database (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007184.s006">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Using BaitMaker-Conserved mode we generated conserved baits for each DENV serotype (65 baits total).

To assess whether we could effectively capture the targeted viral genomes in the context of high host background, we infected HuH7 cells with DENV1, 2, 3 or 4, Vero cells with ZIKV and BHK-21 cells with CHIKV. To simulate a higher level of host contamination that would potentially be found in clinical samples, the supernatant was discarded from these cultures and total RNA was extracted from the infected cell monolayers and Illumina libraries were constructed from the total RNA. These libraries were then divided in half where the first half was sequenced directly, and the second half was enriched with our bait panel prior to sequencing.

Based on the principal component analysis on the baits&#x02019; features and pull-down efficiency (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007184.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>) and effects of sequence identity on pull-down efficiency (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007184.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>), we observed that only sequence identity had an influence on pull-down efficiency and this efficiency decreases as the sequence identity between bait and target genome decreases. We next tested the effect of library size on the genome enrichment of the samples in both DENV and ZIKV cohorts (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007184.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). We found that when the library size exceeds 300 nt, there is no further increase in coverage and this is expected as the baits were designed for library size of 300 nt. This further suggests that for larger library size, we can increase the bait design interval and thus only a smaller number of baits would be required to capture complete genomes. Thus, BaitMaker can efficiently design a set of minimal number of baits which is required to capture a complete genome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec006"><title>Discussion</title><p>DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV together represent the most significant arboviral threats to humans today with hundreds of millions of infections annually. These viruses are predominantly transmitted to humans by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> species of mosquitoes whose global distribution has exploded in recent years, placing an estimated two-thirds of the world&#x02019;s population at risk from contracting these diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Calculating the true burden of disease for each of these viruses is complicated by not only overlapping clinical presentations but importantly by the fact that they co-circulate [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Given the commonality of the arthropod vectors these viruses employ for their transmission, the contribution of co-infection with these viruses to morbidity and mortality is poorly understood.</p><p>Full-genome sequencing of DENV1-4, ZIKV and CHIKV directly from clinical samples is not a routine practice in clinical, or even research, settings due to the costs associated with labor, reagents and time. Additionally, given the low success rate of current methodologies, loss of precious samples is a strong deterrent. Other groups have utilized a tiling approach wherein baits are designed to cover the entire length of a limited number of target genomes [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although effective, we show here that this strategy represents an over-allocation of baits and is unnecessary to obtain full genome coverage of the target virus. Our BaitMaker program designs a minimal number of baits for viral capture that are non-overlapping and has the ability to capture the known variation in viral strains. Our approach significantly reduces the overall number of baits necessary to capture the diversity in these viruses which in turn minimizes the cost incurred and should assist in the broader implementation of this methodology.</p><p>Although we have currently only tested our methodology with Illumina sequencing, we foresee extending this methodology onto other sequencing platforms. Indeed, this methodology may have an even larger impact for the so called &#x02018;third generation&#x02019; sequencing platforms (Pacbio and Nanopore) where average library sizes are far longer than Illumina but do not yield as many reads per run. Increasing the average library size would presumably translate to an even smaller number of baits required to capture full or near full genome coverage of the target virus as our results have shown strong positive correlation between library size and breadth of genome coverage (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007184.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>).</p><p>One particularly important benefit of utilizing a targeted enrichment approach over a Sanger sequencing or an unbiased metagenomic approach, is the number of reads specific to the viral genome are substantially increased and thus allows for assessment of intra-host genetic diversity. These data are particularly important for the analysis of low-frequency variants that may represent precursors to a change in overall pathogenicity [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As vaccines for these viruses are now in various stages of development, in-depth analysis of viral sub-populations will be critical to monitor vaccine escape mutants as they develop.</p><p>In this study, we have applied this methodology to a febrile cohort (n = 170) collected during a severe dengue outbreak in Sri Lanka and to a cohort (n = 162) collected during the 2016 Zika outbreak in Singapore. We were able to obtain full or nearly full genomes for the target viruses down to the limit of detection by qPCR. Importantly, we have combined bait panels for all four DENVs, ZIKV and CHIKV into a single assay and have detected a co-infection in a patient sample. Given the relatively small number of samples we have tested here and the overlapping clinical presentation of these viruses, the detection of a DENV/ZIKV co-infection indicates that the global prevalence of ZIKV and CHIKV could be higher than current estimates. Clinical management for DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV is largely supportive in nature with the vast majority of cases treated as outpatients and left to convalesce outside a clinical setting. Whether co-infection with these viruses is a predicator of adverse clinical outcome is largely understudied but it is a significant question that could potentially change clinical management and outcome for some of these patients [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the one sample where we identified co-infection, the amount of DENV3 was much greater than ZIKV. Whether this result is due to differential viral kinetics, viral interference or temporal differences in the acquisition of each virus is an interesting question and is a subject of ongoing work.</p><p>Finally, we believe that application of the approach employed here for bait selection would potentially improve upon the large, pan-viral enrichment panels such as those recently published by Briese et al, 2017 and Wylie et al, 2015 [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; with fewer baits required to achieve full genome coverage, more baits could be allocated to capture the known diversity in the targeted viral families. Increasing the amount of diversity in these panels would in turn increase the likelihood of capturing novel viruses in clinical and environmental samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Investigations described for the Zika samples were conducted as part of outbreak response operations by the Ministry of Health, Singapore to control the spread of Zika.

As the hybridization takes place at 65&#x000b0;C, we designed baits such that they had a melting temperature greater than this. The baits in our panel had melting temperature ranging from 69 to 87&#x000b0;C and GC content from 31 to 66%. We developed two modes to design baits (i) Conserved mode, to design baits at the species-level conserved regions and (ii) Exhaustive baits, to design baits for both conserved regions as well as regions with strain level variations.</p><sec id="sec010"><title>Conserved mode</title><p>We downloaded available DENV1-4 sequences using the keyword search "txid12637 [Organism:exp] AND 1000:12000 [slen] NOT clone NOT cloning NOT vector NOT chimeric" and retrieved 11,152 sequences from NCBI. In order to retrieve full or nearly full genomes, we sub-selected the sequences with sequence length greater than 3/4<sup>th</sup> of the maximum sequence length found for DENV in NCBI database. Some of the sequences deposited in NCBI are redundant and this may lead to overrepresentation of a specific sequence in our sub selected dataset. Hence, in order to get a diverse set of sequences representing DENV, we selected the sequences with at least two different values out of the seven metadata terms (sequence length, host, strain name, collection date, isolate name, country, strain taxonomic ID) to design baits. We then designed baits targeting the conserved regions using the PriMux software [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], a k-mer based search and clustering method to generate all possible overlapping 120 mers with a one nucleotide sliding window for the set of sequences within each DENV serotype. This k-mer approach ensures that for identical 120 mers present in different genome sequences, these 120 mers are grouped and a common 120 nt bait is designed to target them. As the hybridization process between the bait and viral DNA fragment is tolerant to mismatches, we permitted six mismatches out of 120 nt in the bait&#x02019;s design. In NCBI, sequences less than full-genome length represent most of the known virus diversity, therefore, we prioritized the selection of the k-mers if it could target at least 70% of the NCBI sequences with at most six mismatches (95% identity). To further reduce redundancy in our bait design, we removed the 120 mers that overlapped or were within a 500 nt distance. This is based on the assumption that with an average library size of 300&#x02013;500 nt, a 120 nt bait would be able to pull down at least two fragments of length 300 nt overhanging the 120 nt bait (300 nt + 300 nt -120 nt = 480 nt). Thereby, we designed 14 conserved baits for DENV1, 16 for DENV2, 19 for DENV3 and 16 for DENV4. However, few regions in DENV genome were highly variable, and therefore we designed 22 baits explicitly targeting a selected reference genome from South East Asian DENV cohort.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Exhaustive mode</title><p>To capture regions of greater diversity in the viral strains that cannot be captured by conserved baits, we developed &#x0201c;Exhaustive mode&#x0201d; to design baits targeting all the sequences in NCBI. We used the virus name and a minimum sequence length of 1000 nt to extract sequences from NCBI. In addition, we also removed sequence with these terms (clone, cloning, vector or chimeric) in the sequences&#x02019; metadata to ensure that the baits are not designed against vector sequence. For CHIKV and ZIKV, we designed baits such that they would capture all the known variations present in the viral strains, inclusive of partial genome sequences deposited in NCBI. The Exhaustive mode of BaitMaker is an iterative process; first, 120 nt baits complementary to genome spaced at a distance of 500 nt for each NCBI sequence are generated. After the initial baits are designed, CD-HIT [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], is employed to cluster and remove redundant baits. As hybridization remains efficient with even with a degree of mismatching between the bait and target sequences, we clustered the baits within a mismatch threshold of 18 nucleotides (85% identity) and 12 nucleotides (90% identity) for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively. For remaining regions with no baits, the process was iteratively repeated until all regions within each target sequence was covered. A final pass of CD-HIT is then run to remove any redundancy in the bait panel.</p><p>In the last step of the algorithm, the baits are then checked for potential cross-hybridization with human, bacterial and mouse genomes using Blast. Any baits that are predicted to bind to host genomes were removed, and a new bait is selected for this region.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Viral culture and clinical sample preparation</title><p>DENV1-4 and ZIKV were cultured in 2x10<sup>5</sup> HuH7 and Vero cells, respectively, for 48 h or until cytopathic effects were observed.

FastQC [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] was used to confirm the quality of the reads generated, and Trim Galore [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] was used to trim and filter the reads with a minimum quality cutoff of 20 and a minimum read length of 35 nt. As the viral species and strain is unknown in most of the cases, it is necessary to identify the nearest species and the strain present in the sample. Therefore, Blast toolkit [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] was used to search the nearest hit in the NCBI nucleotide database for every read using the megablast option. A metagenomic analysis software MEGAN [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] was used to cluster reads at the species level to visualize. As Blast analysis is time-consuming, only a portion of the reads were used to identify the species and strain. The species cluster with the maximum number of reads assigned was selected as the initial reference strain and used to generate a consensus genome. The consensus genome was generated by using bam2cons_iter.sh script from the ViPR pipeline [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The bam2cons_iter.sh uses BWA [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] to perform iterative mapping of the reads to the reference genome and a consensus is generated based on the maximum frequency of a nucleotide at a given position. From the obtained consensus genome, the nearest NCBI hit is found and used as a reference genome to rerun the bam2cons_iter.sh script with default parameters. This iterative consensus genome generation approach enables generation of a full genome consensus for the virus present in the sample. For final mapping with BWA mem v0.7.5 aligner was used to map the reads to the consensus reference genome and picard tools v1.95 [<xref rid="pntd.0007184.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] were used to mark PCR duplicates.

Hence, for the 80&#x02013;85% identity group, which includes the DENV2 genomic region enriched by zika_bait-43, has a skew towards the neighboring bait (Bait-018-D2) as it has higher binding identity. It should be noted however, that although the ZIKV bait binds at a lower efficiency, it is contributing to the coverage of DENV.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007184.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007184.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Effect of library size on genome enrichment by the baits panel.</title><p>The x-axis is the mean library size of the samples and y-axis represents the genome coverage distribution given by 1-SD (standard deviation) of the sequencing reads distribution enriched around the bait. The range of library sizes for DENV1, DENV4, and ZIKV cohort samples are between 80&#x02013;374 nt (median 203), 38&#x02013;379 nt (median 175) and 101&#x02013;800 nt (median 329) respectively. The number of samples in each cohort is indicated by n. For each virus group (DENV1, DENV4 and ZIKV), the Pearson&#x02019;s product-moment correlation coefficient is calculated and denoted by r and confidence interval around the correlation coefficient is represented by CI. For DENV1 and DENV4 samples, there is a very strong positive Pearson correlation between coverage distribution and library size as their library sizes were below 300 nt. In contrast, there is a weak positive correlation in the Singapore ZIKV outbreak cohort samples due to the larger library size and number of baits targeting ZIKV is relatively higher (at &#x0003e;85% identity, DENV1 = 22, DENV4 = 20, ZIKV = 50). The black line represents the LOWESS (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) fitted to all the cohort samples. When the library size exceeds 300 nt, there is no further increase in coverage. This is expected as the baits were designed for sample library of 300 nt. This further suggests that larger the library size, we can increase the bait design interval and thus only a smaller number of baits will be required to capture full viral genomes efficiently.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007184.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007184.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Genomic sequences extracted from NCBI used to design baits.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007184.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007184.s007"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Properties of baits used in the experiments.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007184.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007184.s008"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Sequencing information in detail for unenriched and enriched experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007184.g001">Fig 1</xref>), the ZIKV dilution series experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007184.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and a DENV2 dilution series experiment (Figure not shown).</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007184.s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007184.s009"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Enrichment protocol used in experiments.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007184.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the individuals at the Singapore Ministry of Health, the Genome Institute of Singapore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the Environmental Health Institute of Singapore, the Saw See Hock School of Public Health, the Bioinformatics Institute of Singapore, the National Public Health Laboratory of Singapore, and the Epidemiology Unit and Medical Research Institute of the Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka for facilitating the provision of the clinical samples in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0007184.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wilder-Smith</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gubler</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Monath</surname><given-names>TP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Heymann</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2017</year>) <article-title>Epidemic arboviral diseases: priorities for research and public health</article-title>. <source>Lancet Infect Dis</source>
