  <title>Methodology/principal findings</title>
  <p>92 acute phase serum samples from patients with a PCR-confirmed DENV infection collected in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) in 2013 and 2015 were analyzed with the SD Bioline Dengue Duo test. A subset of 74 samples was additionally tested with the Platelia NS1 antigen test, the Panbio DENV μ-capture ELISA and the Panbio DENV IgG ELISA. IgM seroconversion was assayed using follow-up samples of 35 patients collected in the convalescent phase. 57.6%, 22.8% and 44.6% of acute phase serum samples tested positive in the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1, IgM, and IgG test, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test strongly correlated with viral load, decreased rapidly over the acute phase of the disease, and was significantly reduced in presence of high anti-DENV IgG antibody titers resulting from secondary DENV infection. While a good concordance (Cohen’s kappa 0.78) was found between the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test and the Platelia NS1 antigen ELISA, both the SD Bioline Dengue Duo IgM and IgG test displayed a significantly lower sensitivity than the corresponding ELISA tests.</p>

  <title>Conclusions/significance</title>
  <p>The SD Bioline Dengue Duo test is a valuable tool for diagnosis of DENV infections especially when analyzing early acute phase samples with high viral load. Nevertheless, in endemic areas, where secondary flavivirus infections are common, diagnostic sensitivity of the NS1 and IgM test components may be compromised.</p>
