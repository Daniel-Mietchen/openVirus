<p>Transmission of the four genetically distinct DENV serotypes mainly occurs by the bite of infected 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, limited vectorial capacity of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has also been shown [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As in other flavivirus infections, asymptomatic or sub-clinical infection is frequent. In an estimated 25% of infected individuals, a sudden onset of high-grade fever occurs after an incubation period of 4–7 days, often accompanied by other unspecific disease symptoms like headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, and rash. During this febrile phase, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are frequently observed; this finding (as the occurrence of petechiae and/or a positive tourniquet test) can support differentiation of DF from other febrile illnesses [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Upon defeverescence, usually occurring between days 3–7 of illness, most patients start to recover from the disease. Nevertheless, some patients develop severe symptoms caused by increased vascular permeability, plasma leakage and intravascular volume depletion that can be lethal if left untreated.
