<p>The SD Bioline Dengue Duo rapid test results for NS1 antigen and IgM/IgG antibodies were compared to corresponding commercially available ELISA tests. As was reported previously for a sample panel originating from French Guiana [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test results were in good concordance with the PLATELIA
 <bold>™</bold> Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA. In contrast, significantly fewer samples were classified as positive in the SD Bioline Dengue Duo IgM test than in the Panbio
 <bold>®</bold> Dengue IgM Capture ELISA, resulting in low Cohen’s kappa value of 0.3. Similarly, an only moderate agreement (Cohen’s kappa = 0.53) was found between the SD Bioline Dengue Duo IgM test and another commercial DENV IgM ELISA (Dengue Fever IgM Capture DxSelect
 <bold>™,</bold> Focus Diagnostics) by Simonnet 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The analytical sensitivity of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo IgM test was found to be particularly low in comparison to the Panbio DENV IgM capture ELISA when serum samples from patients with high anti-DENV IgG titers were analyzed. Thus, the difference may be caused by a potential supplementation of the ELISA kit’s sample diluent with an IgG pre-absorbing reagent not explicitly commented on in the Instructions For Use.
