<p>Patient sera were collected between 2013 and 2015 at Savannakhet Provincial Hospital in southern Lao PDR. On-site routine diagnostic testing was performed for all febrile patients enrolled in the study in 2013 using the FTD tropical fever core multiplex real-time PCR kit simultaneously testing for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, west nile virus, 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp.,

 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp.. Although co-circulation/co-infection of dengue and chikungunya virus was detected in samples originating from Champasak province during the 2013 DF outbreak in southern Lao PDR [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], no co-infections with CHIKV were observed in the DF patients enrolled in our study. During the 2013 study period, only one out of 172 febrile patients admitted to Savannakhet Provincial Hospital was found to be CHIKV PCR-positive. Interestingly, this patient reported to have recently returned from a travel to Champasak province. Collected before the first autochthonous ZIKV case in Lao PDR had been reported to the WHO in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], samples were not tested on-site for ZIKV (co-)infection. A retrospective analysis of acute phase serum samples archived in 2012â€“2013 from Laotian patients with suspected dengue fever revealed the presence of ZIKV in 18 (1.3%) of 1353 tested samples [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, ZIKV (co-)infections cannot be ruled out completely, but their abundance is presumably low.
