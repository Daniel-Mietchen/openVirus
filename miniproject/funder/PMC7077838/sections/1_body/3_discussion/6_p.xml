<p>Immune complex formation between circulating antigens and antigen-specific antibodies has already been recognized as a factor negatively influencing diagnostic antigen detection in a variety of different disease conditions including HIV infection [

Nevertheless, the DENV IgG assays applied in this work either employ native virus particles displaying all antigens (DENV IgG IIFT) or a recombinant DENV envelope protein E (SD Bioline Dengue Duo IgG rapid test); the antigen used in the Panbio DENV Indirect IgG ELISA has not been specified in the instructions for use. Therefore, these test results do not allow conclusions about the anti-NS1 IgG titers in the respective samples. Indeed, the anti-DENV IgG response is largely dominated by antibodies against structural antigens E and prM [

 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and both anti-NS1 titers and recognized epitopes correlate with disease severity [
