 </bold>) Therefore, a positive result of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo IgG test in an acute phase sample is strongly indicative of a secondary DENV infection. Although a good agreement (Cohen’s kappa = 0.75) was found between the in-house DENV IgG IIFT and the Panbio DENV IgG ELISA, seven samples generating a weak to medium high signal in the ELISA were classified as DENV IgG negative by the in-house DENV IgG IIFT. This divergence may either be caused by false positive ELISA results or a reduced capacity of the DENV2-based IgG IIFT to detect low levels of IgG antibodies resulting from a previous infection with a different serotype. Notably, an optical density at the upper limit of the detection range was obtained for the majority of tested samples with the Panbio DENV IgG ELISA indicating a saturation of the obtained signals. Therefore, the commonly used categorization of samples according to IgM/IgG index ratios to analyze the patients’ infection status (primary vs. secondary infection) [
