 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we observed a significantly reduced diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test in secondary DENV infections. By stratifying the samples according to viral load and sampling day, a direct influence of the presence of DENV-specific IgG antibodies on the diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test could be shown. Thus, the low diagnostic sensitivity of NS1 antigen testing in patients of our study collective with a detectable DENV IgG antibody titer in the acute phase sample is most likely caused by both a reduced viral load leading to lower NS1 serum levels and by the formation of NS1/IgG immune complexes that are not detectable due to masking of epitopes and/or sterical hindrance [
