Although historically, the Asia-Pacific region has remained free of YFV, the risk of introduction has never been higher due to the increasing influx of people from endemic regions and the recent outbreaks in Africa and South America. Singapore is a global hub for trade and tourism and therefore at high risk for YFV introduction. Effective control of the main domestic mosquito vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in Singapore has failed to prevent re-emergence of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in the last two decades, raising suspicions that peridomestic mosquito species untargeted by domestic vector control measures may contribute to arbovirus transmission. Here, we provide empirical evidence that the peridomestic mosquito <italic>Aedes malayensis</italic> found in Singapore can transmit YFV. Our laboratory mosquito colony recently derived from wild <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> in Singapore was experimentally competent for YFV to a similar level as <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> controls. In addition, we captured <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> females in one human-baited trap during three days of collection, providing preliminary evidence that host-vector contact may occur in field conditions. Finally, we detected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> eggs in traps deployed in high-rise building areas of Singapore. We conclude that <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> is a competent vector of YFV and re-emphasize that vector control methods should be extended to target peridomestic vector species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Yellow fever is a dreadful disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus circulating in Africa and South America.

Briefly, eight-day-old females deprived of sucrose for 24 hours were offered an artificial infectious blood meal in 3 rounds of 15 min using a Hemotek membrane feeding apparatus with porcine intestine as the membrane.

The current study reports that in 2018, the National Vector Surveillance program in Singapore detected the presence of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> in Gravitraps [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] outside the urban parks of the island.

The well-known peridomestic mosquito <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>, which was highly abundant in our human-baited trap survey, significantly increases the risk of arbovirus transmission in Singapore [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Control of peridomestic mosquitoes is a challenge because in addition to artificial breeding sites, less accessible natural sites such as tree holes need to be targeted as well [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Although we did not measure other parameters that influence the vectorial capacity of a mosquito species, such as adult density and survival, and the duration of the virus extrinsic incubation period [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], vector competence and attraction to humans make <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> a potential vector of YFV and other arboviruses that deserves increased attention from public health authorities. The level of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> vector competence for YFV that we observed was in the same range as our <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> controls from Laos, and as Brazilian <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> that were orally challenged with the same virus isolate in a previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is worth noting, however, that vector competence results cannot be readily compared if they did not use the same oral infectious dose, or if other factors such as virus strain and detection assays were different. The dose-response curves that we generated in the present study will be useful for future comparisons because they provide absolute estimates of vector competence indices, such as the OID<sub>50</sub>. Moreover, two vector species or populations may have a similar level of vector competence at a given infectious dose, but vary at a different dose. For example, the DENV type 2 susceptibility of two field-derived populations of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> in Thailand were similar at a medium dose, but different at a low dose [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This example indicates that the minimal threshold for infection may differ between mosquito populations. Likewise, in the present study, we observed similar YFV OID<sub>50</sub> values for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> but <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> had a lower YFV OID<sub>10</sub> value. In natural conditions, the oral infectious dose is the primary driver of successful human-to-mosquito transmission of arboviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Despite an efficient vaccine, YFV still remains an important public health concern in Africa and South America. YFV is maintained in sylvatic cycles between non-human primates and arboreal mosquitoes, and human outbreaks occur when the virus is introduced into an urban cycle mediated by <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although there is no evidence of a sylvatic cycle of YFV in the Asia-Pacific region, the risk of spillover transmission exists. The lack of YFV outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region to date could be due to cross-protective immunity conferred by other widespread flaviviruses such as DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus, but it could also reflect relatively fewer opportunities for YFV introduction until now. Rampant globalization now puts the Asia-Pacific region at an unprecedented risk of YFV introduction [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Billions of immunologically na&#x000ef;ve people, together with competent <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> populations [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], create a dangerous set of conditions that are theoretically favorable to a massive YFV epidemic. On the other hand, a scenario whereby YFV would establish a novel sylvatic cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] seems unlikely in Singapore given the small size of resident non-human primate populations. Clearly, places with high densities of the domestic vector <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> are most at risk of spillover transmission, but we emphasize that in the absence of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, ancillary vectors should not be overlooked. Competent mosquito species such as <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> could facilitate introduction of YFV into the Asia-Pacific region. In Singapore, strict and sustained vector control measures have achieved low densities of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but this has failed to prevent arbovirus outbreaks in the last two decades [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Following a previous study on the ability of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>malayensis</italic> from Singapore to transmit DENV and CHIKV [<xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we reiterate the need to account for peridomestic species in the management of mosquito vector populations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Catherine Lallemand for assistance with mosquito rearing and three anonymous reviewers for constructive comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

The authors conducted a rigorous experimental study of vector competence with an Aedes aegypti control, and a field study to ascertain human attraction. It is the latter that is tripping me up a little, in that no unbaited traps were used to determine the number of Ae. malayensis that might have entered the net in the course of daily movement. Can the authors specify what the "other" mosquitoes captured via this method were? Were any of them species well known to not be attracted to humans?</p><p>Reviewer #2: Methods were appropriate and carefully described.</p><p>Reviewer #3: For the most part with the vector competence experiments. However, the host-seeking behavior study does not fulfil this criteria. Refer to attached document for full information.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Results</p><p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p><p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p><p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p><p>Reviewer #1: Statistical analyses are rigorous but I would ask that the authors delete text referring to "marginally insignificant" results and remove symbols to denote "P </p><p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p><p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p><p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p><p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p><p>Reviewer #1: I am somewhat concerned about drawing strong conclusions about human attraction from the field data without an unbaited control; the authors could allay this concern if there are studies in the literature showing a clear difference. </p><p>Also, the authors should discuss the capture of a large number of Ae. albopictus in this urban park. This species has also been shown to be competent for YFV and to my mind poses the larger risk here.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Conclusions are supported by data, namely that Aedes malayensis is a component vector of yellow fever virus (YFV). YFV infection and dissemination rates in Ae. malayensis and Ae. aegypti were similar.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Refer to attached document</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</p><p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend &#x0201c;Minor Revision&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Accept&#x0201d;. </p><p>Reviewer #1: Throughout, including title: Change to "Occurrence of a peridomestic Aedes malayensis population..." It is not the global existence of Ae. malayensis that exacerbates risk in Singapore, it is the occurrence of this species IN Singapore that exacerbates risk there.</p><p>Line 30: Higher than what? Clarify</p><p>Line 38: Change "a" to "one" and indicate 3 trap days- this was a very limited study and that should be made more clear.</p><p>Line 50: move "was" before "Ae. malayensis"</p><p>Line 51: move "experimentally" after "to"- infinitives may be split when necessary for clarity!</p><p>Summary: reconsider what has actually been demonstrated about human attraction based on comments above</p><p>Line 66: delete "largely"</p><p>Line 122: Change thereafter to hereafter</p><p>Line 177: In future, please provide volunteers with a motorized aspirator to enhance safety</p><p>Throughout: the term "insignificant" is not standard; please change to "not significant"</p><p>Line 271-272: move "were" to after "only"</p><p>Table 1: Please reformat to improve legibility (font is variable and some of it tiny); remove annotation of P</p><p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #1: This study highlights a very important risk factor for the spread of yellow fever into Asia. The experimental analysis of vector competence is very well done. The field study is both small scale and lacks a control-these limitations must be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Arbovirologists, epidemiologists and public health experts have long pondered, &#x0201c;why yellow fever has never appeared in Asia?&#x0201d; Certainly there were multiple opportunities in the past when Chinese explorers sailed to Africa and during the European colonial period when British, French, Dutch and ships of other nations (full of Ae. aegypti) made frequent journeys from Africa and tropical America to southeast Asia, India and the Pacific Islands. But, to our knowledge, yellow fever virus (YFV) never appeared or caused epidemics there, as happened periodically in Europe and the Americas. </p><p>Experimental studies have shown that Asian Ae. aegypti are similar to African and New World Ae. aegypti in their susceptibility and vector competence for YFV. Also humans and non-human primates of Asia origin are also susceptible. The most plausible explanation seems to be that most people living in Asia in the past and now have heterologous flavivirus antibodies due to natural or vaccine-induced infection with other flaviviruses like dengue and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Animal studies indicate that hamsters infected previously with JE and other flaviviruses have lower levels of viremia and modest liver pathology, when subsequently infected with YFV. </p><p>In this excellent study, the investigators have demonstrated that Ae. malayensis, an anthpophilic mosquito in Singapore, is a competent vector of YFV. Ae. malayensis occurs in some urban habitats that are not currently targeted in Ae. aegypti control programs, and they may contribute to &#x0201c;cryptic&#x0201d; arbovirus (DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV) transmission. But these findings do not increase the risk of YFV transmission in Singapore. </p><p>Ae. malayensis was first described in Singapore in 1962 and has subsequently been reported in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Taiwan. It probably occurs throughout southeastern Asia. So it is not a new introduction and has probably been in the region for thousands of years. Given that history and the multiple opportunities for introduction of YFV into the region in the past, is Singapore now at greater risk of a yellow fever outbreak that it was 200 or 400 years ago? If Ae. aegypti populations are maintained at a low level in Singapore, it may actually be at a lower risk, regardless of the presence of Ae. malayensis. </p><p>In the opinion of this reviewer, a more appropriate title for this article would be something like this:</p><p>&#x0201c;Aedes malayensis, a peridomestic mosquito in Singapore, is a competent vector of yellow fever virus.&#x0201d; In the discussion, the authors could speculate that this finding might facilitate the introduction of YFV into Singapore or other countries in the region where Ae. malayensis occurs.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Refer to attached document</p><p>--------------------</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (what does this mean?).
