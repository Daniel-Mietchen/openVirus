<p>In two separate experiments (referred to as experiments 1 and 2 hereafter), mosquitoes were orally challenged with YFV as previously described for DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, eight-day-old females deprived of sucrose for 24 hours were offered an artificial infectious blood meal in 3 rounds of 15 min using a Hemotek membrane feeding apparatus with porcine intestine as the membrane. Blood meals consisted of a 2:1 mix of washed human erythrocytes and virus suspension. Adenosine triphosphate (Merck) was added as a phagostimulant [

 <sup>6</sup> focus-forming units (FFUs)/mL, 2.1 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFUs/mL, or 1.8 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFUs/mL of YFV. In experiment 2, they were exposed to 8.1 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> FFUs/mL, 5.4 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFUs/mL, or 3.6 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFUs/mL of YFV. Fully engorged females were sorted on wet ice, transferred into 0.5-L cardboard containers and maintained in a climatic chamber (28°C, 70% relative humidity, 12:12 hour light cycle) with permanent access to 10% sucrose solution. At 10 and 14 days post blood meal, mosquitoes were cold anesthetized (experiment 1) or paralyzed with triethylamine (experiment 2) to perform

In experiment 2, the heads were removed and stored at -80°C after the salivation assay. The proboscis of each female was inserted into a 20-μL pipet tip containing 5 μL of fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 30 min of salivation, the body remainders were stored dry at -80°C. The saliva-containing FBS was mixed with 45 μL of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium and immediately inoculated onto C6/36 cells for titration by FFA, as described above, without subsequent dilution.
