<p>Adult mosquito sampling was conducted in a forested area in the northern part of Singapore (Sembawang; 1.456493, 103.825983) in March 2019. Host-vector contact was evaluated using a human-baited double net trap as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, a human volunteer was resting on a long chair inside a small, untreated bed-net protected from mosquitoes during daylight hours (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.). A larger bed-net covered the smaller one with a 30-cm opening at the bottom allowing mosquitoes to enter the 20-cm space between bed-nets. A large plastic sheet was placed above the bed-nets as a protection. Every 10 min, the human volunteer collected mosquitoes trapped between bed-nets using a mouth aspirator. Aspirated mosquitoes were transferred into holding cups, killed and grouped per 1-hour interval. Back in the laboratory, mosquitoes were morphologically identified and stored at -80Â°C.
