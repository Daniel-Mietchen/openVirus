<p>Bodies were homogenized individually in 300 μL of lysis buffer (Tris 10 mM, NaCl 50 mM, EDTA 1.27 mM with a final pH adjusted to 8.2) supplemented with proteinase K (1 μL for 55.5 μL of buffer). Body homogenates were centrifuged and 100 μL of supernatant was incubated for 5 min at 56°C then 10 min at 98°C to extract viral RNA. Detection of YFV RNA was performed using a two-step RT-PCR reaction to generate a 192-bp amplicon located in a conserved region of the 
 <italic>NS3</italic> gene of YFV. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with random hexamers using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the following program: 10 min at 25°C, 50 min at 37°C and 15 min at 70°C. The cDNA was subsequently amplified using DreamTaq DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher Scientific). The 20-μL reaction volume contained 1x of reaction mix and 10 μM of primers (forward: 5’-GCGTAAGGCTGGAAAGAGTG-3’; reverse: 5’-CTTCCTCCCTTCATCCACAA-3’; [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). The thermocycling program was 2 min at 95°C, 35 cycles of 30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 60°C, and 30 sec at 72°C with a final extension step of 7 min at 72°C. Amplicons were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Mosquito wings/legs and heads were homogenized in 300 μL of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 2% FBS, centrifuged, and titrated by FFA as described above.
