<p>Our study indicates that peridomestic 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> mosquitoes can contribute to YFV transmission in Singapore based on two lines of evidence. First, our laboratory mosquito colony recently derived from a wild 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> population in Singapore was experimentally competent for YFV, to a level that was not statistically different from that of the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> controls. Adding to earlier data demonstrating vector competence of this colony for DENV and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], our results are the first experimental evidence, to our knowledge, that peridomestic 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> from Singapore can potentially transmit YFV acquired from an infectious blood meal. Second, we captured 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> females in a human-baited trap. Although our host-seeking experiment lacked a non-baited control trap, it provided preliminary evidence that this peridomestic 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> population in Singapore may engage in human-biting behavior, as was already observed for other populations of the species in South-East Asia [
