It is worth noting, however, that vector competence results cannot be readily compared if they did not use the same oral infectious dose, or if other factors such as virus strain and detection assays were different. The dose-response curves that we generated in the present study will be useful for future comparisons because they provide absolute estimates of vector competence indices, such as the OID
 <sub>50</sub>. Moreover, two vector species or populations may have a similar level of vector competence at a given infectious dose, but vary at a different dose. For example, the DENV type 2 susceptibility of two field-derived populations of
