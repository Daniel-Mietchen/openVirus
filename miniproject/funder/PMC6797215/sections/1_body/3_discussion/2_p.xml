 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> was found prevalent in numerous urban parks of Singapore [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Not only were 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> eggs collected in the forested areas of the parks but they were also found in some open-air areas frequented by humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The current study reports that in 2018, the National Vector Surveillance program in Singapore detected the presence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> in Gravitraps [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] outside the urban parks of the island. Although the majority of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes found in public apartment blocks were 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> was detected in Gravitraps deployed in high-rise building areas, underlining the potential of this mosquito species to colonize urban habitats. It was recently hypothesized that peridomestic mosquito species, such as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic>, which escape vector control measures targeting domestic vector species, may have contributed to the (re-)emergence of arboviruses in Singapore in the last two decades [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The well-known peridomestic mosquito 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, which was highly abundant in our human-baited trap survey, significantly increases the risk of arbovirus transmission in Singapore [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Control of peridomestic mosquitoes is a challenge because in addition to artificial breeding sites, less accessible natural sites such as tree holes need to be targeted as well [
