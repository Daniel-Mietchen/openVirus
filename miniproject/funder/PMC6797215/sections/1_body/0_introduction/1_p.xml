<p>The case-fatality rate of yellow fever virus (YFV) ranges from 15% to 50% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is one of the highest among arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). YFV is endemic in 47 countries in Africa and South America, with an estimated annual incidence of around 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite an efficient vaccine against YFV, the past few years have seen a growing number of YFV outbreaks (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Uganda, Brazil and most recently Nigeria) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During such outbreaks, increasing numbers of unvaccinated travelers who become infected and return to non-endemic countries have raised the risk of YFV introduction to unprecedented levels [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The Asia-Pacific region has remained free of YFV until now but the risk of introduction has never been higher [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007783.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In 2016, eleven Chinese workers infected with YFV in Angola who returned to China were the first cases of YFV diagnosed in travelers to Asia [
