  <title>Log likelihood of inferred times of exposure as a function of true time since exposure.</title>
  <p>The log likelihood values plotted are conditional on test data generated assuming that the individual was exposed to whooping cough (top row) or bluetongue (bottom row) at the true time. Both the X and Y axes are on a log scale. Each pixel represents the value of the likelihood at a time of exposure given by the Y axis, given 10 test results, generated assuming a time since exposure given by the X axis. The colour of the pixel indicates the likelihood for an estimated time, given the sample data, with dark red being most likely, and pale yellow being least likely. A clear, dark red diagonal indicates that the time since exposure is easily recoverable, while a more diffuse diagonal indicates higher levels of uncertainty (see the 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">results</xref> section for details). The first column shows results based only on data from the antibody test relevant to the disease in question, the middle column results based on an appropriate nucleic acid test, and the right hand column shows the results based on both tests. (See text for details.)
