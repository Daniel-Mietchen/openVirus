<p>Adding missing information on the time of exposure of detected cases would allow for a better awareness of the early development of an epidemic and would help inform evaluations of the potential risks posed by an outbreak, leading to a more proportionate response than would be the case when waiting for the epidemic trends to be revealed by subsequent real-time monitoring. In the current study, we introduce a novel statistical approach to infer the timing of exposure events for individuals by combining knowledge of the dynamic characteristics of multiple diagnostic tests. This approach could be integrated into any model of a disease epidemic to replace missing information on case exposure times. In this paper, we demonstrate its usefulness by recovering population-level trends of exposure from cross-sectional data collected from a single point in time. Here we refer to the process of recovering such trends as “hindcasting”, following terminology established in other papers [
