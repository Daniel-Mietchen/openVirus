<p>Infectious disease surveillance is the first line of detection and defence against infectious pathogens and therefore crucial to maintaining animal and public health. However, the current state of disease surveillance has been characterised as deficient in terms of both coverage and reporting speed for both humans [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The challenge is to use the data generated by this often sparse and biased surveillance to decide on an appropriate response to disease outbreaks. This is dependent on the extent of 
 <italic>situational awareness</italic>, which can be defined as “Knowledge and understanding of the current situation which promotes timely, relevant, and accurate assessment … in order to facilitate decision making.” (taken from [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], p 171). Such situational awareness is necessary in order to balance the social and economic consequences of the adopted control strategy with the social and economic risks posed by the outbreak [
