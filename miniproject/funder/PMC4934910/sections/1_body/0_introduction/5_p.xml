<p>Several papers have recovered limited historical characteristics of epidemics from cross-sectional data using a single diagnostic test, e.g. an antibody test. For example, Giorgi et al. estimated the time of the start of an HIV outbreak under assumptions of exponential growth of viral load [

Others have exploited information on diagnostic test kinetics, i.e., the pattern of diagnostic test values during the course of infection, to estimate average incidence rates. Examples include the use of antibody test kinetics to estimate sero-incidence rates for influenza [

 <italic>Salmonella</italic> in humans [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. One challenge in these kinds of studies is that the relationship between the magnitude of signals from diagnostic tests and time since exposure is usually not monotonic; they tend to increase and then decrease. This means that the inverse problem of estimating time since exposure given a test value is non-unique, and although this can be framed as a statistical problem the resulting inference is highly uncertain [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], limiting what can be estimated from test data. However, there are often several diagnostic tests available that target different aspects of the multi-faceted dynamic interaction between host and pathogen, and thus exhibit different test kinetics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. That is, the profile of test responses, as a function of time since exposure, will differ depending on the underlying diagnostic used and the immune-pathogenesis of the disease. Thus, in principle we can generate a unique signal for a given time since exposure by combining results of diagnostic tests that respond on different time scales. Here, we exploit this fact to develop a more robust statistical approach for analysing cross-sectional field data from multiple diagnostic tests. To do so we make use of empirical infection models that characterise test kinetics to infer the time since exposure for each individual. While there is considerable uncertainty in the estimated exposure time for each individual, the combined estimates from multiple individuals can be used to describe the overall population-level distribution of infection times and estimate the shape of the overall epidemic trend with a high level of confidence.
