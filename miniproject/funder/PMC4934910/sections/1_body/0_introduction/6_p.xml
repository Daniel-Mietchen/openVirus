<p>A detailed description of the hindcasting framework and implementation of the evaluation scenarios can be found in the methods section. We demonstrate the hindcasting of epidemic trends by applying the framework developed here to case studies of real outbreaks of two contrasting diseases, whooping cough in humans and bluetongue in cattle (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For each disease, we investigate two scenarios representing detection during either the increasing or the decreasing phase of the epidemic. We conclude that when combined with knowledge of the temporal characteristics of two (or more) appropriate diagnostic tests, our methods allow historical epidemic trends to be recovered from cross-sectional sample data. Moreover, for the example diseases considered suitable diagnostic tests and data describing their temporal characteristics already exist.
