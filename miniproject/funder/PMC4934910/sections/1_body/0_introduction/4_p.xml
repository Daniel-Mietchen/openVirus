<p>Disease surveillance has been described [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] as improving the situational awareness in relation to a disease outbreak on three levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Projection. Perception refers to the collection of data that allows us to monitor disease; Comprehension to extracting information from this raw data that places the current disease situation in a context that allows us to understand its characteristics; and Projection to statistical models as well as more holistic approaches that aim to describe what is likely to happen in the future. Research focused on improving the collection of surveillance data [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], on risk-based surveillance [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or the extensive literature focusing on the early detection of statistical deviations in surveillance data to outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], can be seen as improving the Perception stage. Approaches such as phylodynamics contribute to the Comprehension stage by modelling the genetic change of the pathogen, e.g. using this to estimate the epidemiological parameters governing an outbreak such as the recent Ebola outbreak [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Models that use current information to predict the future [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] instead focus on improving the situational awareness at the Projection stage. From this perspective, hindcasting contributes to the Comprehension stage by leveraging quantitative diagnostic test results (using the statistical methods described in this paper) to add a temporal dimension to data for which the times of exposure of cases are missing, thus improving the understanding of unfolding epidemics.
