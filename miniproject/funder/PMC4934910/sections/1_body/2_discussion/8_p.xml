<p>Since hindcasting exploits knowledge of the host-pathogen interaction, it relies on previously conducted longitudinal studies of such interactions, and requires that the test response after initial pathogen exposure has been described. Our results demonstrate one of the many ways in which experimental infection studies can provide substantial additional benefits to disease control and research. Currently, only a fraction of pathogen tests have published information on how time since exposure affects test response; this has limited which pathogens we could usefully simulate. Similarly, data sets of infectious diseases often only record whether a test has been positive or not. Presentation of the underlying continuous test response is rareâ€”and it is rarer still to find such results for paired diagnostic tests.</p>
