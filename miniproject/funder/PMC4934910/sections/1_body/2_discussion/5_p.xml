<p>We make use of the lognormal distribution as a parsimonious parameterization of the epidemic trend. This is suitable for epidemics where a single peak is expected, allowing fast model fitting whilst capturing the time span and general direction of the trend. The trade-off is that more complex aspects of trends in the epidemic are omitted. A second limitation is that the lognormal distribution requires the trend to decline to zero after any peak. Should either of these limitations pose a problem, more complex parameterizations of the epidemic trend—with multiple peaks and stages, or even compartmental SEIR-type models—could be used, though such models are likely to come at substantially higher computational cost.</p>
