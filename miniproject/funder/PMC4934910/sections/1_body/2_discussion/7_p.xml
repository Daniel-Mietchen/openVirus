<p>The hindcasting approach make use of knowledge of the within-host development of test markers. Phylodynamics, on the other hand, leverages information about how the genetics of the pathogen change as it spreads through the population to estimate between-host transmission events, and use this to e.g. reconstruct the transmission network of outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, phylodynamics requires sequenced samples of genetic material, and that the pathogen of interest is mutating quickly enough that the dynamics of the epidemic can be resolved. In contrast, the hindcasting approach relies on test kinetics and measures within-host times since infection. Recent papers [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] discuss ways to integrate epidemiological and genetic information when modelling disease epidemics; given the complementary nature of phylodynamics and hindcasting, a natural future step would be to combine the two sources of information into a single framework.
