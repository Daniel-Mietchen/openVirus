<p>We have shown how to recover epidemic trends of both human and animal pathogens from cross-sectional data collected at a single point in time. We were able to recover this temporal information using a novel statistical framework which combines paired diagnostic test measurements made on collected samples with known temporal kinetics of diagnostics test measurements over the course of infection.</p>
