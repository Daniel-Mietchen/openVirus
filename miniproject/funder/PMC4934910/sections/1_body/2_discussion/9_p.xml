<p>It is hoped that the method introduced here can give some further motivation to record continuous test responses from more than one diagnostic test, and that it can also serve as an argument for conducting further studies on test kinetics. The results regarding the impact of combining diagnostic tests indicate that combining diagnostic tests increases the robustness of the hindcasting procedure. The bluetongue scenarios exhibited severely degraded convergence behaviour with two identical tests, while the whooping cough scenarios converged, but produced posterior estimates that did not match the true trend.</p>
