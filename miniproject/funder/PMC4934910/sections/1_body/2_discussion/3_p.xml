<p>The implementation of the framework used in this paper combines surveillance data with information on the test kinetics using a simplified model. For example, individual variation in the test response is modelled as variation around a common mean test curve, rather than as variation in the shape of the curve itself. Variations in the two tests are considered independent, and the error distribution is assumed to be log normal. This limits the pattern and range of variation our model can capture, but facilitates model specification and estimation. We also assume that the test variability is known. While this is partly owing to technical limitations (models with unknown variance parameters tended to converge to degenerate solutions by maximising the variance), it is a realistic assumption since the reliance on test kinetics require that the diagnostic test has been studied in depth. More detailed modelling of the individual and population level processes (including the effect of various covariates such as age or gender) in order to tailor the model to a particular disease is entirely consistent with the statistical framework introduced and would increase the real-world validity and predictive power beyond what has been demonstrated here.</p>
