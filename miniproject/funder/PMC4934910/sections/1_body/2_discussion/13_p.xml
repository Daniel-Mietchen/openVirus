<p>We have described a new framework for hindcasting the temporal patterns of epidemics, using two example host-pathogen systems and the pairing of antibody tests with pathogen load. The framework demonstrates the potential to utilise the information inherent in the increasing variety of diagnostic tests. We were able to estimate both increasing and declining epidemic trends under the assumption that all individuals were being tested at a single point in time, implying its usefulness for cross-sectional surveillance data as well as in less restrictive settings. Recovering temporal incidence trends using multiple tests on cross-sectional field data has the potential to be of considerable value, and is a key determinant of introducing proportionate responses to ongoing disease outbreaks.</p>
