<p>The inferential framework introduced here allow us to extract rich temporal information from collected diagnostic samples. Here we focused on purely cross-sectional samples, but the methods are applicable to longitudinal data and data sets combing both longitudinal and cross-sectional samples. We were able to estimate the trends of both increasing epidemics and decreasing epidemics, as well as estimate the approximate pace of increase or decrease. Such information would improve situational awareness during outbreaks, enabling appropriate management decisions to be implemented immediately when an outbreak has been detected, without the need to observe its subsequent spread to estimate the trend.</p>
