<p>The current implementation of the framework does not include a sampling process component, and so the generated posterior distribution does not currently take sampling uncertainty into account. If the samples are randomly drawn from a larger population of infected individuals, the estimated trend will be an unbiased estimator of the wider population trend. A potential avenue for future research would be to integrate hindcasting into a wider framework describing the sampling process in detail; such an approach might also allow for simultaneously estimating potential sampling bias.</p>
