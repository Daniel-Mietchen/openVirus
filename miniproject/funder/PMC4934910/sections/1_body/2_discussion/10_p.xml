<p>Further research is required to characterise how combinations of tests interact to affect hindcasting. In general, however, the diagnostic tests used in disease surveillance should be chosen to complement each other. By combining early responding tests with later responders, it becomes possible to create a joint test signature that combines the best features of both tests. In terms of the method presented here, the best combination of tests is likely that which provides a unique and precise signature along the timeline of infection for an individual.</p>
