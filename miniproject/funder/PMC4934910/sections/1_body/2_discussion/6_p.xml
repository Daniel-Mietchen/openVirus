<p>The hindcasting framework introduced here estimates epidemic trends by combining observed data with information on how test responses develop after exposure. Woolhouse and Matthews [

Our methodology improves on earlier studies incorporating test kinetics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in three ways: by incorporating information from more than one diagnostic test; by considering their joint kinetic pattern; and by modelling non-constant incidence. It could be further extended to model other aspects of the disease system such as population demography, contact networks, or the spatial distribution of cases.
