<p>Our method assumes test data 
 <italic>y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ik</italic>
 </sub> from multiple disease diagnostics indexed by 
 <italic>k</italic> = 1, …, 
 <italic>K</italic> on individuals 
 <italic>i</italic> = 1, …, 
 <italic>N</italic>. We assume that each individual is tested at some time 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, after having been exposed to the pathogen at some earlier time 
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. We further assume that these individuals are chosen in an unbiased, random manner from a larger population. Each diagnostic test is assumed to return a value in the form of a continuous ‘level’, which might, for example, be the highest dilution at which antibodies are detected in a serological test. Without loss of generality we assume that these levels are scaled to the unit interval [0,1].
