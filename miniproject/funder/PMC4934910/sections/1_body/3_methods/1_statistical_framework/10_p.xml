<p>In both cases above the normalisation factor 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <bold>
  <italic>Y</italic>
 </bold>, 
 <bold>
  <italic>T</italic>
 </bold>) is typically unknown and computationally expensive to calculate. However, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods circumvent this problem and are able to generate samples from the posterior even though the normalisation is unknown. The results presented in this paper are generated from an MCMC sampler implemented with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in JAGS [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] using Gibbs sampling [
