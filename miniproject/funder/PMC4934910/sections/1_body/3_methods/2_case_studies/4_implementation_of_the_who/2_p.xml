<p>We investigated two hypothetical scenarios for when the outbreak could have been first detected and cases tested. We simulated one scenario where we assumed that a random subset was selected from all cases that had occurred between the start of the epidemic and 25 weeks after the first observed case. The selected cases were assumed to be sampled and samples tested at the 25 week time point. At this time point, the first wave had passed, and the second sharp increase in incidence had been going on for about a month. 126 cases had been reported by this time in the actual outbreak. The second scenario assumed that cases were selected from the 230 cases from the full whooping cough epidemic up until week 36, and that samples were taken and tested at that time. This time point marks the end of the epidemic, with no later cases reported.</p>
