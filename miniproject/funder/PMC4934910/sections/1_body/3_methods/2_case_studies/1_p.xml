<p>Whooping cough is a human disease caused by the bacteria 
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, causing prolonged spasmodic coughing. Despite widespread vaccination coverage there has been a resurgence of cases in several countries. In the Netherlands there has been a steady increase in the incidence since 1996; and in California, USA, in 2011, there was a widespread outbreak with 9000 cases and ten deaths [

 <italic>pertussis</italic> by vaccinated individuals [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. After an early cluster of cases in a high school in early May 2003, there was a large outbreak of whooping cough throughout the county starting from October. After some time, this outbreak was contained, and the final cases occurred in February 2004. The upper part of
