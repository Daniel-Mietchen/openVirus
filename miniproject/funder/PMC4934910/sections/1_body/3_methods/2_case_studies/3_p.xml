<p>In order to assess our methodology, we consider two scenarios for each pathogen outbreak. In the “increasing” scenarios we assume the epidemic is recognised early and explore test results from samples taken at a time early on in the outbreak (when the outbreak is increasing, see e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In contrast in the “decreasing” scenarios we use test results assumed to be obtained from individuals exposed during the entire outbreak, with samples collected at a relatively late stage in the outbreak (i.e. when it is in decline). The goal was to see how well hindcasting could distinguish between increasing scenarios and scenarios where the epidemic is in decline. We were also interested to see if it was possible to estimate the approximate time span of the epidemics.
