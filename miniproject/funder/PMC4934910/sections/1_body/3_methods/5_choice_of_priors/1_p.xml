<p>We followed the recommendations of Gelman et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004901.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and used vague priors for the parameters. Such priors incorporate information about what parameter values are nonsensical in a given problem setting, but without using any previously collected data. The means for the lognormal distribution describing the epidemic trends were themselves given lognormal priors. These priors were set to indicate the timescale of relevance for the epidemics in question. This translated to setting the prior means for the for the increasing whooping cough to 100 days, and prior means for the decreasing whooping cough scenario to 200 days. The corresponding values for bluetongue were 10 days and 100 days, respectively. The standard deviations for the prior distributions were chosen as log(10) corresponding to 99% confidence intervals of (mean/100,mean*100). This standard deviation was chosen to model that any peak time more than a factor 100 different from the time scale of interest was nonsensical.
