<p>In the process of developing this work, we also explored the use of uninformative priors with nearly flat distributions, such as the standard gamma distribution, and uniform priors with very wide support; however, these were found to lead to very slow mixing and a high rate of convergence failure of the MCMC algorithm. Changing the specific values of the priors did not influence the posterior estimates noticeably. See the supplementary information for MCMC traceplots, details of convergence evaluation and sensitivity analysis of the priors.</p>
