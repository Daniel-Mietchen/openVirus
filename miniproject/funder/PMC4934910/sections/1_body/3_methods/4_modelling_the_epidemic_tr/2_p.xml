<p>In this case, we exploit the ability of the lognormal to model extreme skewness to capture both increasing and decreasing epidemics using only two parameters. Note that the implementation of the lognormal distribution as an epidemic trend must be conducted in such a way as to allow the sampler to jump between tails of the distribution for the individual times since infection. Details for how to do this can also be found in the supplementary information.</p>
