<p>We further investigated how the hindcasting framework would be affected by different combinations of test kinetics. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the mean likelihood surface of true vs. posterior times of exposure when using antibody-based tests, nucleic-based tests, or a combination, for the whooping cough and bluetongue exemplar diseases. For the hindcasting framework the ideal combination of diagnostic tests would have a likelihood surface with a single narrow diagonal representing a maximum likelihood coinciding with the true exposure time given observed data. A likelihood surface with a more diffuse diagonal implies a wider posterior distribution. A likelihood surface where there is an “X” of high-likelihood regions implies that the true exposure times are not uniquely identifiable.
