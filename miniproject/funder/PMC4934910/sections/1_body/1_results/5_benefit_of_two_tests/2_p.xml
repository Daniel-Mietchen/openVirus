<p>Each pixel represents the average likelihood of 10 observations from the distribution of test measurements at a time since exposure given by the X axis, calculated at a time of exposure given by the Y axis. Areas in dark red indicate regions of higher likelihood. The times shown are times since exposure, with low numbers indicating more recent exposure, where the test response is changing rapidly. Looking at 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g005">Fig 5a</xref>, during the first 20 days the probable exposure times (red pixels), given the data, are centred on the diagonal (i.e. the true exposure times) with a narrow band of high-probability red pixels. For times since exposure of greater than 20 days, when the kinetics of the antibody test are developing at a slower pace, the diagonal of red pixels becomes more diffuse, indicating a greater variation around the true times since exposure. Furthermore, we can see that there are two different diagonals crossing at 25 days. This corresponds to the peak of the diagnostic response curve, with the two diagonals indicating the possibility that a given test result could have been the result of testing an individual during either the increasing or the decreasing phase of the response curve. Estimation of the time since exposure is more precise when the true time since exposure corresponds to phases where the response is changing rapidly, and is more difficult to infer when the test response levels out (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g005">Fig 5b and 5d</xref>). For diagnostic tests with a peaking response, estimating the time of exposure can be precise but not unique, with two different regions of probable exposure times for a given test response (
