<p>To further evaluate the gain from utilizing two different tests, we ran simulations against the four parameterizations of a lognormal epidemic mentioned above, using two diagnostic tests and starting with respectively whooping cough and bluetongue test kinetics. The kinetics were then modified to be increasingly similar to each other (full details and results in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004901.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We found that for the bluetongue scenarios, the level of similarity of the tests did not seem to noticeably affect the accuracy (as measured with R
 <sup>2</sup>/RMSEP) of the estimated trends, while for the whooping cough scenarios when recovering Epi3 and Epi4 scenarios, performance degraded gradually, with a very low R
 <sup>2</sup> when using two identical tests. bluetongue test kinetics, the MCMC sampler converged well for the unmodified test configuration (as measured using Gelmans R statistic), but the convergence behaviour then degraded as the tests became increasingly similar. It completely failed to converge in the limit when the two tests were identical (either identical NA tests, or identical antibody based tests). For the whooping cough scenarios the sampler converged for all combinations of diagnostic tests, no matter how similar.
