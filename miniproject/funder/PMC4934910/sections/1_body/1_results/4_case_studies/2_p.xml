<p>The results show that the recovered epidemic trends provided a representative picture for both increasing and decreasing scenarios, in both whooping cough and bluetongue outbreaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For the increasing whooping cough epidemic, when assuming a sample of all 122 cases that had occurred between the start of the epidemic up to week 25, the R
 <sup>2</sup> between underlying case counts (smoothed by a 7-day moving average) and the estimated epidemic trends was 0.74, with a 95% confidence interval of [0.69–0.78]. The corresponding RMSEP was 0.0017[0.0015–0.0018] When sampling 230 cases from the full whooping cough epidemic up until week 36, after it had declined, the curve fit was somewhat better, with R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.82[0.68–0.94] (RMSEP 0.0013[0.0008–0.0017]).
