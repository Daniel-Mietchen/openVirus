<p>We also applied the hindcasting framework to two case studies based on a recorded outbreak of whooping cough in humans, and a bluetongue outbreak in cattle (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g001">Fig 1</xref>). See the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">methods</xref> section for details. For each outbreak we simulated two scenarios, firstly where a random subset of all individuals exposed thus far was sampled and tested at a single time, midway through the outbreak (increasing epidemic trend/early detection), and in a second scenario where a random subset of all exposed cases were sampled and tested at a time point at the end of the outbreak (decreasing epidemic trend/late detection). We assumed that no information about the time since exposure was available, nor any other information about the epidemic trend. Based on published temporal characteristics of real diagnostics, test results were then simulated for these samples (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Methods</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g004">Fig 4</xref>). For each disease (whooping cough and bluetongue) and each scenario (increasing and decreasing outbreaks) the hindcasting framework was applied to the corresponding test results to assess performance in recovering early increasing phases and late decreasing phases of outbreaks.
