<p>The results from hindcasting the bluetongue outbreak indicated that when assuming that a sample of the 26 animals had occurred during the increasing phase, the fitted curve was nearly perfect, with an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.9[0.86–0.92] (RMSEP 0.0019[0.0018–0.002]). However, for the corresponding decreasing scenario, assuming a sample of the 61 animal cases that had occurred up to week seven, the hindcast trend could not fully capture the erratic nature of the underlying case count data, as indicated by R
 <sup>2</sup> values of 0.21[0.15–0.27]). The trend did indicate an elevated incidence over the stretch of time when the majority of cases occurred, thus capturing the approximate time that had elapsed between the start of the epidemic and the time of sampling. This aspect is also captured by the RMSEP, which is more sensitive to shifts in locations, and less sensitive to upward- and downward trends, and which slightly improved to 0.0016[0.0015–0.0016].
