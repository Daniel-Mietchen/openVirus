<p>When reducing the sample size, the hindcasting technique was still able to recover both increasing and decreasing phase for the whooping cough scenarios. The good fit was maintained with sample sizes as low as 20 individuals, with R
 <sup>2</sup> values of 0.77[0.27–0.83] (RMSEP 0.0064[0.0055–0.0124]), for the increasing and 0.67[0.09–0.86] (RMSEP 0.0038[0.0022–0.0069]) for the decreasing scenario. The performance was also maintained for the increasing bluetongue scenario, also assuming 20 samples, with an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.91[0.87–0.93]) (RMSEP 0.042[0.034–0.051]). However, the full bluetongue scenario performed substantially worse with the reduced sample size with an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.12[0.07–0.36] (RMSEP 0.014[0.013–0.015]).
