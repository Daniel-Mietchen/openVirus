<p>In order to evaluate the robustness of the hindcasting framework, we explored a range of testing errors from 1.1 up to 2.0 (multiplicative standard deviation). We found that that the width of the credible intervals increased moderately with increasing variability, but that the recovered parameters exhibited similar levels of bias regardless of the level of test variability. This was true even for testing errors of as high as 2.0, far beyond the reported variability of the examined diagnostic tests for bluetongue and whooping cough. (See
