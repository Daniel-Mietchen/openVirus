<p>We evaluated the hindcasting framework by applying it to simulated data sets, and comparing the recovered trend with the known underlying distribution. We first generated collections of exposure times from lognormal probability distributions with different sets of parameters. Using published test kinetics for whooping cough, we then generated diagnostic test data based on these infection times and an assumed cross-sectional sampling time. The hindcasting framework was applied to these generated test data, and the estimated posterior distribution for the epidemic trends was compared to the known simulated epidemic trend. In order to explore the real-world applicability of this approach, we also simulated diagnostic test data using published test kinetics and published distributions of case reporting times, from an outbreak of bluetongue in the UK in 2007, and from an outbreak of whooping cough in Wisconsin in 2003.</p>
