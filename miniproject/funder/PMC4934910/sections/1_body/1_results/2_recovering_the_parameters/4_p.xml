<p>Turning to summary statistics of the epidemic fit across these sets of posterior mean trends, the median R
 <sup>2</sup> (and root mean squared error of prediction—RMSEP) for the Epi1 parameterisation was 0.71, with a 95% inter-quantile range (IQR) of 0.19–0.97 (RMSEP of 0.054[0.021–0.109]), a median of 0.85 with a 95% IQR of 0.48–0.99 (RMSEP of 0.019[0.005–0.041]) for the Epi2 parameterisation, a median of 0.96 with a 95%IQR of 0.64–0.998 (RMSEP of 0.005[0.01–0.020]) for the Epi3 parameterisation, and a median R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.97 with a 95% IQR of 0.69–0.999 (RMSEP 0.002[0–0.007]) for the Epi4 parameterisation.
