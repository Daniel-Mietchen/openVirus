 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the relationship between sample size and estimation performance. As can be seen, increasing the sample size improved the performance as measured with R
 <sup>2</sup> for all of the parameterizations except Epi1 (fitting Epi1 was limited by the time resolution of the diagnostic test kinetics used). The posterior credible intervals for the parameters of the epidemic also shrunk in width, as would be expected. The performance when hindcasting using sample sizes of 10 was not very reliable; however, for sample sizes of 30 or more, the recovered trends reliably represented the true trend, with R
 <sup>2</sup> values of 0.75 or more for all parameterizations except Epi1.
