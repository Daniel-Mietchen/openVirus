 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004901.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the hindcasted trends for 320 simulations that were conducted with a sample size of between 30 and 100, with a test variability of 1.3, evenly split across the four parameterizations. As can be seen, these trends all manage to adequately capture the timing and duration of the true epidemic, with a clear separation between the estimates for different sets of true parameter values.
