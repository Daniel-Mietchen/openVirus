<p>A significant increase in TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression has also been observed in human monocytes and macrophages during infection with EBOV

 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], were significantly higher in human fatal cases in comparison to patients who survived EVD. A recent study demonstrated that survivors of the EBOV epidemic in West Africa exhibited significantly reduced levels of the overall inflammatory response compared to non-survivors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; hence, the key to improving the outcome following EVD may require timely administration of global immunosuppressive agents. In support of this prediction, our recent study demonstrated that administration of Eritoran, a Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist, significantly reduced the global inflammatory response and modified, but did not necessarily reduce the innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to increased survival in murine models of EVD and the disease caused by the closely related Marburg virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Depletion studies in nonhuman primates demonstrated the involvement of T cells, B cells, and antibodies in vaccine-mediated protection against EBOV [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], indirectly indicating their role in the natural protection against EBOV. Therefore, successful treatment of EBOV infections requires suppression of the pro-inflammatory component of the immune response without significantly sacrificing the quality and magnitude of both the innate and adaptive immune responses.
