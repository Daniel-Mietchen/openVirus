<p>Recent reports have indicated the EBOV infection results in a substantial immune activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Under more “normal” circumstances, such as infection with influenza virus, a significant contraction and depletion of activated cells is typically observed, with only a modest percentage of activated cells transitioning into effector memory T cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although yet to be demonstrated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, it is likely that the deficient T-cell response and lymphopenia in EBOV-infected patients or animal models of EVD are caused by a partial depletion of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and/or deficient signaling events needed to initiate and maintain the transition into memory cells. This hypothesis is supported by previous findings demonstrating that the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP) masks its own epitopes as well as cellular surface proteins such as β1 integrin and MHC-I through steric shielding following GP expression on the plasma membrane of infected APCs [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006932.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Furthermore, recent findings have demonstrated that EBOV-infected dendritic cells (DCs) have an impaired ability to activate T cells and exhibit a limited capacity to transmit survival signals to T lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006932.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Indeed, mechanistic studies demonstrated that biological effects of IFN-inhibiting domains (IIDs) located in EBOV proteins VP35 and VP24 lead to inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction following contact between EBOV-infected DCs and T cells, as disruption of IIDs by point mutations restored the transduction. Specifically, the VP35 and VP24 IIDs were found to cause deficient maturation of DCs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which, upon contact with T cells, did not induce phosphorylation of TCR complex–associated adapter molecules ZAP70, PLCγ1, and SLP76, resulting in impaired downstream signaling [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The IIDs were also found to inhibit differentiation and activation of human B cells contacting with EBOV-infected APCs. In particular, the rate of B cell differentiation from naïve to plasma cells was significantly increased in mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures infected with EBOV that was carrying mutated VP35 IID as compared to wild-type (WT) EBOV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Surprisingly, the effect extended beyond T and B lymphocytes as the mutation also had a profound effect on human natural killer (NK) cell activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This can possibly be explained by some kind of interaction of NK cells with infected DCs, as antigen-specific memory-NK cells were recently identified in rhesus macaques [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While disabling of VP35 IID leads to EBOV attenuation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the available data do not distinguish between the roles of IFN antagonism from the IID-mediated suppression of cell-mediated response in this attenuation. These 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> findings provide initial evidence demonstrating the role of EBOV IIDs in the deficient cell-mediated response, although further studies are required to demonstrate the relative importance of IID-mediated suppression of cell-mediated response for attenuation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
