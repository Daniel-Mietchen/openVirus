<p>All current EBOV vaccines use GP as the sole antigen, which induces protective immune response. Immunization with the vaccine based on the vesicular stomatitis virus–(VSV) based vector during the EBOV epidemic in Guinea in 2015 demonstrated 100% protective efficacy [

However, a well-controlled clinical study of the VSV-vectored vaccine in Europe demonstrated adverse effects, including arthritis, vasculitis, and dermatitis, which were not observed in the control group of vaccine recipients that received an empty VSV vector, resulting in halting of the trials involving the doses expected to be minimally sufficient for protection (1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> and 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU) [
