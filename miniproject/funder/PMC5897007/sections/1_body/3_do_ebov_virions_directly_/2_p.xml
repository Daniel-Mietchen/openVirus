<p>As a multitude of enveloped viruses have been shown to incorporate PtdSer into their viral membranes as a means of apoptotic mimicry [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which serves to enhance infectivity, broaden tropism, and promote immune evasion, it is likely that binding of virion-associated PtdSer to Tim-1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of a broad range of viruses. This prospect is supported by findings showing that targeting PtdSer in guinea pigs infected with Lassa virus protects animals from death [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, infection of Tim-1-knockout mice with EBOV results in a significant survival not observed in WT control mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Further investigation into the mechanism of PtdSer incorporation into budding EBOV virions and the feasibility of targeting PtdSerâ€“Tim-1 interactions may result in development of treatments.
