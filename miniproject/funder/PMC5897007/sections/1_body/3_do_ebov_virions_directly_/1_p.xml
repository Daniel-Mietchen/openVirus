<p>Although the addition of EBOV to isolated T lymphocytes does not result in a productive infection, EBOV virions have recently been shown to directly bind to and activate CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Binding and activation of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were shown to occur through at least two identified interactions: between GP with TLR4 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which is consistent with previous studies showing interaction of envelope proteins of a number of viruses with pattern recognition receptors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006932.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and between the viral membraneâ€“associated phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and T-cell immunoglobulin-like protein 1 (Tim-1) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006932.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). In both cases, the direct binding of EBOV virions to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells was shown to result in a burst in cytokine production and ultimately to lead to increased cell death in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The findings suggest that EBOV induces activation of T cells regardless of antigenic specificity of their receptors, which is consistent with recent findings in EBOV-infected patients [
