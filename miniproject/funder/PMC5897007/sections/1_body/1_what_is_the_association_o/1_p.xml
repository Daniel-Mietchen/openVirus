<p>One of the identified links between survival and fatalities following EBOV infection is T-cell death resulting in their reduction in the peripheral blood. This condition, which is clinically known as lymphopenia, significantly impairs the body’s ability to fight infection, as T cells are critical to the development of a virus-specific, adaptive immune response. Lymphopenia and its occurrence in fatalities have been observed in mouse and nonhuman primate models of EVD in addition to humans with EVD [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells are directly infected, both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells remain refractory to direct infection by EBOV; however, the absolute number of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood perceptibly drops, particularly in patients who succumb to EVD. Patients who survived EBOV infection are able to maintain T lymphocytes throughout the course of infection [

Below, we summarize the previously established mechanisms contributing to the onset of lymphopenia and highlight recent findings that further demonstrate the multifaceted causes that either directly or indirectly leads to T-cell depletion during EBOV infection.
