<p>The lethality of the Ebola virus (EBOV) and its risk for public health came to the forefront during the 2013â€“2016 epidemic in West Africa. By the end of the epidemic, 28,616 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of EBOV infection, including 11,310 fatalities, had been recorded [

For the first time, EBOV reached urban populations and demonstrated its full potential to spread rapidly and cause havoc before an effective containment response could be initiated. In this regard, EBOV can no longer be characterized as a virus that causes small sporadic outbreaks whose lethality limits the potential for larger epidemics. Furthermore, the continued growth of populations and urbanization within endemic regions may result in increased rates of EBOV outbreaks. Although several advancements have led to a basic understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the highly pathogenic nature of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), a specific treatment for EBOV infection has yet to be approved.
