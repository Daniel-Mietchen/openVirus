<p>It has become clear that pronounced lymphopenia is intimately linked with fatalities caused by EBOV as well as a broad range of pathogens. Notably, this occurrence is a common characteristic of some of the most lethal human diseases: viral hemorrhagic fevers, infections with highly pathogenic influenza viruses, and bacterial sepsis [

Furthermore, it is likely that several of the mechanisms that lead to lymphopenia during these conditions are also at play during the acute phase of chronic infections, causing transient lymphopenia as a result of bystander-mediated cell death (e.g., acute phase of HIV infection). Hence, continually expanding our knowledge of the mechanisms by which viruses cause lymphopenia in the absence of direct infection of lymphocytes may greatly aid in the development of future broad-acting therapeutics that limit or prevent premature lymphocyte death. Such therapies would putatively increase the chances of mounting an antigen-specific adaptive immune response, which would lead to better patient outcome.
