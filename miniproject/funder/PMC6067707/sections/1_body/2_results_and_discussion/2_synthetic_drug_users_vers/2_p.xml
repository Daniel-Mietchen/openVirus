<p>A comparison of these two groups is presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0200816.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A greater proportion of synthetic drug users were young (&lt;30 years, χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 60.4, p&lt;0.001), single (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 55.3, p&lt;0.001), and had at least some college education (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 20.9, p&lt;0.001), compared to non-users. A greater proportion of synthetic drug users reported having engaged in male-male sexual behavior more than once per week (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 19.9, p&lt;0.001), having had more than one male sexual partner (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 54.5, p&lt;0.001), having participated in male group sex (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 27.8, p&lt;0.001), and having had penetrative sexual behavior durations of ≥20 minutes (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 56.1, p&lt;0.001), and having consistently used condoms with male partners (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 4.2, p = 0.04), compared to non-users. Finally, compared to non-users, a greater proportion of synthetic users had an HIV-positive serostatus (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 21.3, p&lt;0.001).
