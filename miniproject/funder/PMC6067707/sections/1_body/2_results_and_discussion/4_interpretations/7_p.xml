A small survey conducted in 2016 among MSM in Tianjin found prevalence of recent (last 6 months) substance use to be approximately 100%, with recent popper use at 98%. Among popper users, more than 85% reported increased sexual desire and pleasure after using and nearly 60% reported prolonged duration of sexual activity after using [
