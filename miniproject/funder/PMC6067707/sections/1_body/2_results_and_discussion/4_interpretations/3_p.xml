<p>We found that inhaled alkyl nitrites, or poppers, was by far the most commonly used synthetic drug among the participants in our study (96% of users reported popper use). This puts prevalence of lifetime poppers use in our study at 38%, similar to the 47% lifetime popper use prevalence among MSM in Beijing observed in a 2012 study [

However, it has also been attributed to the relaxation effect poppers have on rectal muscle, which reduces pain during sex. Thus, poppers provide the stimulant and sexual effects of other synthetic drugs (i.e., euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced libido, arousal, pleasure), and more, all for less money, added convenience, and no legal risk [

 <xref rid="pone.0200816.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Finally, since poppers are legal, heavily marketed with colorful packaging, and are not labeled like drugs, carrying no visible warnings about their risks, users do not consider them dangerous.
