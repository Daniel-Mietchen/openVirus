<p>Our finding of nearly 40% prevalence of lifetime synthetic drug use was higher than the 23% observed in a 2011 study in Shenyang,[

However, our study, using more recent data from a larger sample and a broader geography, may have produced both a more representative and generalizable estimate. Furthermore, other studies published to date have examined only recent synthetic drug use (in the prior 3, 6, or 12 months) [
