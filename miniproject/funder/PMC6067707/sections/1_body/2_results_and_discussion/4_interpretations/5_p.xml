<p>Similarly, our finding of higher HIV prevalence among synthetic drug users (10.6% compared to 6.0% among non-users) and 2-fold greater odds of HIV infection among synthetic drug users is also supported by the existing literature. A 2009 study among MSM in Changsha (n = 826) found HIV prevalence of 19% among users versus 11% among non-users and 2-fold greater odds of HIV infection among users [
