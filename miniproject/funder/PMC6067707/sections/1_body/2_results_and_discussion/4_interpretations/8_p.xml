<p>So, how do we meet the challenge of HIV prevention among the synthetic drug-using MSM population? Modeling work suggests that substantial modification of high-risk sexual behavior among MSM is insufficient to drive a meaningful reduction in HIV transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0200816.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This is supported by a recent meta-analysis of studies among MSM in China, which found that although education and behavioral interventions had improved consistent condom use, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and testing uptake, it had not been enough to reduce HIV prevalence [
 <xref rid="pone.0200816.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Instead, due to already-high HIV prevalence in MSM communities, high transmission probability, and force of infection, biological interventions that successfully reduce infectiousness are far more likely to curb the growth of the HIV epidemic in this population [
 <xref rid="pone.0200816.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), frequent testing (including self-testing), as well as immediate ART for infected individuals with counseling and adherence support should be implemented along with increased or improved programs targeting education and behavior. However, careful implementation of these interventions will be critical since the details of how these interventions are implemented are necessarily highly contextual [
