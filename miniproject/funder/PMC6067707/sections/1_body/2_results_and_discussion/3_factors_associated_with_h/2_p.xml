<p>After controlling for possible confounding factors, multivariate regression analysis revealed two factors associated with higher odds of HIV-positive serostatus: inconsistent condom use with male partners (adjusted OR = 2.18, CI = 1.64–2.91) and lifetime synthetic drug use (adjusted OR = 2.04, CI = 1.56–2.70).
