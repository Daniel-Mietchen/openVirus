<p>Our study had some limitations. First, causal relationships cannot be assessed because of the cross-sectional study design. Second, the study only recruited among those who attended study CBOs to receive HIV counseling and testing services thus subjecting it to selection bias. Third, since poppers are legal in China, it is possible that their use relative to other synthetic drugs was overestimated due to social desirability and miss-classification bias. Fourth, there may have been other, unmeasured factors (e.g., alcohol and/or tobacco use) that contributed to the association between HIV infection and synthetic drug use in our study population. Lastly, there remains substantial stigma in China toward MSM and toward drug users and therefore, other participant responses may have also been subject to social desirability bias. However, considerable effort was made to prevent this by involving MSM CBO staff members in recruitment and interviewing, conducting interviews privately, assuring participants of data confidentiality, and ensuring that the questionnaire was well designed and interviewers well trained.</p>
