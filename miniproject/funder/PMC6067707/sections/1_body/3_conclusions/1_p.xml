<p>In conclusion, our findings of synthetic drug use prevalence of nearly 40% among urban Chinese MSM, and a 2-fold greater probability of HIV-positive serostatus for this group, provide strong evidence of the pressing need of a carefully-designed and well-implemented package of biological prevention measures for this key, dual-risk population in China. Furthermore, there is now a wealth of observational evidence supporting these findings. Hence, prospective study intended to gain an understanding causality is now very much needed. Prevalence of HIV among urban Chinese MSM is already known to be on the rise [
