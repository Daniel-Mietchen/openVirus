<p>In China, both the drug use and HIV epidemics have continued to grow at a rapid rate. The number of drug users registered with the Chinese Government doubled from 2010, to nearly 3 million in 2014. However, the actual number was estimated to be more than 14 million in 2014. The variety of drugs used is also expanding from the traditional opium and heroin to amphetamine-type stimulants (e.g., methamphetamine) and new psychoactive substances (e.g., poppers). The prevalence of synthetic drug use among registered drug users in China exceeded that of heroin and opium use for the first time in 2014[

As for China’s HIV epidemic, in 2015, a total of 574,000 people had been diagnosed with HIV infection, yet an additional 275,000 people were estimated to have HIV infection but still be unaware of it. The numbers of new infections are rising, with over 115,000 newly-diagnosed infections in 2015 alone [
