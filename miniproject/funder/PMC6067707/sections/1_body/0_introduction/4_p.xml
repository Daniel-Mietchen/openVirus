 <xref rid="pone.0200816.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but most have been limited by their small sample sizes and/or geographical settings. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of synthetic drug use, to describe the characteristics of people who use synthetic drugs, and to investigate whether synthetic drug use was associated with HIV infection among a large sample of MSM across 16 cities in China. For the purposes of this study, we defined synthetic drugs as including ecstasy; ketamine; methamphetamine; Magu, which is a mix of methamphetamine and caffeine; and alkyl nitrite inhalants, also known as poppers. This group of drugs is often referred to by other terms such as “recreational drugs” or “club drugs.”
