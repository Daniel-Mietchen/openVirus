<p>All variables were included in the univariate analysis. Variables found to have significance in the univariate analysis were included in the multiple logistic regression. In addition, variables not found to have significance in the univariate analysis, but were believed to be important were also included in the final multivariate logistic regression model. A stepwise algorithm was used to select variables to enter and remain in the model, where the SLENTRY = 0.05 (i.e., only variables being significant at the 0.05 level can be added to the model) and the SLSTAY = 0.15 (i.e., variables being significant at the 0.15 level can remain in the model).</p>
