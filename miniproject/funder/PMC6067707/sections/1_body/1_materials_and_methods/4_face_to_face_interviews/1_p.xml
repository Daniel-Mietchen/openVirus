<p>All interviews were conducted face-to-face in a private room at CBO offices by trained CBO staff members using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was intended to collect information from participants on demographic, sexual behavior (in the prior 3 months), and drug use behavior (lifetime) characteristics. The term synthetic drugs was defined for participants as including ecstasy, ketamine, methamphetamine, Magu, and “poppers.” Participants were allowed to respond freely to all demographic, sexual behavior history, and drug use behavior history questions. No pre-determined answer choices were offered, and answers were not independently verified. After each interview was completed, interviewers coded responses into categories for each variable.</p>
