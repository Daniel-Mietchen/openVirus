<p>Attendees of study CBOs were screened for study participation. Eligibility criteria were: (1) being male, (2) being &gt;18 years of age, and (3) having had anal sex with at least one male partner in the 3 months prior. Potential participants who met these criteria, but who had a known HIV-positive serostatus were excluded from the study. Individuals with diagnosed HIV infection were excluded from the study because awareness of HIV-positive serostatus may have influenced their HIV-related risk behavior, confounding our ability to investigate whether synthetic drug use was associated with HIV infection.</p>
