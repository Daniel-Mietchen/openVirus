  <title>Measurement of virus-binding capacity of Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 using CLEIA.</title>
  <p>The virus-binding capacities of Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 were measured by separately binding to several types of HAdV, IFV, RSV, CVA16, and EV71. PBS was used as a blank control. The photons of light emitted were measured as RLU. Each virus was tested in duplicate, and the results represent the mean Â± SD of three measurements. The average RLU of Fab 2A6 that reacted with HAdV-B35 was higher than those of the Fab that reacted with IFV, RSV, CVA16, and EV71. A similar result was found with Fab 4E2.</p>
