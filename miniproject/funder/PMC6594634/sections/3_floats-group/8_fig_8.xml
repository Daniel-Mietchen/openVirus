  <title>3D structure of the HAdV-E4 knob protein and the predicted linear epitope.</title>
  <p>The predicted linear epitope region on the HAdV-E4 knob protein is located in the neck region on the side of the 3D model. The predicted linear epitope region is highlighted in red on the model in both top (A) and side (B) views. The amino acid sequence of the predicted linear epitope is highlighted in red in the sequence of HAdV-E4 knob protein.</p>
