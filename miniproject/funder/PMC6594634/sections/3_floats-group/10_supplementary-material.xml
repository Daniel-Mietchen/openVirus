  <title>Measurement of the neutralization of Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 by microneutralization assay.</title>
  <p>To measure neutralization, 165 μL purified Fabs (0.2 mg/mL) were individually mixed with an equal volume of HAdV-E4 stock containing 200 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/100 μL, and then the virus-serum mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the virus-Fab mixtures were separately inoculated in triplicate onto 96-well plates containing a culture of A549 cell monolayers at 80% confluence. Two hours later, cells were washed thrice with DMEM/F-12 and then maintained in DMEM/F-12 at 37 °C in 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>. Control wells containing only uninfected cells or virus were included. After 3 days, the cells were observed to evaluate the appearance of CPE. The cells were observed by a microscope (100×). Cell cultures with obvious CPE were visualized in wells with either Fab.
