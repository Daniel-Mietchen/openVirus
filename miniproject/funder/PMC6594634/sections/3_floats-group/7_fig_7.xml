  <title>Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of the knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 and mutant knob protein.</title>
  <p>The multiple alignment results showed that, compared with the sequences outside of the boxed region, the amino acid sequence (residues 71–91) of HAdV-E4 was found to be more similar to that of HAdV-B3 (residues 69–89) than to that of HAdV-C5 (residues 70–90) within the boxed region. The amino acid fragment of the HvdA-E4 knob protein within the boxed region was predicted to be the linear epitope. The mutant knob protein was designed by replacing the amino acid sequence of the HAdV-C5 knob protein within the boxed region with the amino acid sequence of the predicted linear epitope.</p>
