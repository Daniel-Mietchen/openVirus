  <title>SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified Fabs.</title>
  <p>Purified Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 were preheated and then individually resolved by SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions. The heterodimer was dissociated into the light chain (28 kDa) and the Fd fragment (32 kDa). Lane M represents the protein marker.</p>
