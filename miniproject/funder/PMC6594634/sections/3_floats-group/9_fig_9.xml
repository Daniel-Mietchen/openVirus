  <title>Western blot analysis of Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 binding to knob proteins under denaturing and reducing conditions.</title>
  <p>Note that Fabs 2A6 (A) and 4E2 (B) bind to the knob proteins of HAdV-B3 and E4 with molecular masses of about 23 kDa and 18 kDa, respectively, with preheating. However, both Fabs did not recognize the HAdV-C5 knob protein with preheating. In addition, a band around 20 kDa, which is the predicted molecular weight of the mutant knob (mknob) protein with preheating, was detected with both Fabs. Two non-specific bands appeared below the knob proteins of HAdV-B3 and E4, but these were not found with SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the concentrations were low. These non-specific proteins could be purified by Ni-NTA resin and recognized by Fab, suggesting that they contained the 6Ã—His tag and the linear epitope. We inferred that these non-specific proteins were produced as partially expressed knob proteins that were degraded in
