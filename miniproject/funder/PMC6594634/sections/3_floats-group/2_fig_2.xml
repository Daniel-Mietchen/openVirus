  <title>SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified knob proteins.</title>
  <p>The purified knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 and the mutant knob protein with and without preheating (lanes 1 and 2, respectively) were individually analyzed by SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions. Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the purified knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4 and C5 and the mutant knob protein with preheating revealed bands corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the monomeric proteins (23 kDa, 18 kDa, 20 kDa and 20 kDa, respectively). The purified knob proteins of HAdV-E4 and C5 without preheating were revealed in polymeric form, while the purified knob protein of HAdV-B3 and the mutant knob protein without preheating were revealed in monomeric form. Lane M represents the protein marker.</p>
