  <title>Measurement of knob protein-binding capacity of Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 using CLEIA.</title>
  <p>The knob protein-binding capacities of Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 were measured by binding to the knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 (negative control). PBS was used as a blank control. The photons of light emitted were measured as RLU. Each knob protein was tested in duplicate, and the result represents the mean Â± SD of three measurements.</p>
