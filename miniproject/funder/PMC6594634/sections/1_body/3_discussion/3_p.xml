<p>Two different Fabs recognized the same epitope, suggesting that the epitope caused the body to produce at least two kinds of antibodies. Our findings are very important for the development of IFA to detect HAdV. Both Fabs exhibited no neutralization activity against the HAdVs listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219091.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These results were unexpected, demonstrating that both Fabs bind to the epitope that plays no role in the neutralization of HAdV.
