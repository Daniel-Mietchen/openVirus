<p>Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 were able to bind to several types of HAdV in species B and E, as assessed by CLEIA and IFA. We had recently reported that three broadly neutralizing mAbs were identified with specific reactivity to a conformational neutralization epitope in the knob proteins of several types of HAdV in species B[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 (negative control) were expressed to examine whether both Fabs also bind to the knob protein. Unfortunately, CLEIA determined that the binding of both Fabs to knob proteins was less specific. This may result from the structure of the native knob protein expressed by

 <italic>coli</italic> differing from that of the natural knob protein of HAdV. However, it seems that both Fabs bind to the purified knob protein of HAdV-B3, which was revealed by SDS-PAGE in monomeric form under denaturing and reducing conditions. Therefore, the binding ability of both Fabs to the knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 (negative control) in monomeric form was further examined. In western blot, both Fabs detected the knob proteins of HAdV-B3 and E4 with preheating, but they did not react with the knob protein of HAdV-C5 with preheating under denaturing and reducing conditions. This suggested that the Fabs recognized a conserved linear epitope that was similar between HAdV-B3 and HAdV-E4, but differed from that of HAdV-C5. An epitope region meeting the above condition and predicted to be exposed on the surface of the HAdV-E4 knob protein was selected as the potential site based on the results of sequence alignment and molecular modeling. To test this prediction, a mutant knob protein was constructed by replacing the amino acid fragment of the HAdV-C5 knob protein (residues 70–90) with that of HAdV-E4 (residues 71–91). In further analyses, both Fabs reacted with the mutant knob protein with preheating under denaturing and reducing conditions in western blot analysis, demonstrating that the binding epitope was mapped to the amino acid fragment of the HAdV-E4 knob protein (residues 71–91). Based on the sequence alignment results, the amino acid sequence of the epitope of HAdV-E4 is relatively conserved with that of HAdV-B3 in the same region, and 10 of 21 amino acids are identical with 47.62% homology.
