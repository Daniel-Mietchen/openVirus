<p>In order to identify the amino acid sequence of the linear epitope that was shared between HAdV-B3 and HAdV-E4 but differed from HAdV-C5, multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of knob proteins of the indicated types was performed using the ClustalX software (version 2.1)[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with the following parameters: gap opening, 10; gap extension, 0.2; delay divergent sequences, 30%. The Gonnet series was used for the protein weight matrix.
