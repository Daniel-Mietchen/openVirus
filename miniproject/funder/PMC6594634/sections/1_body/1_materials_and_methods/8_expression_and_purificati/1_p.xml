<p>The codon-optimized genes of the knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 and a mutant knob protein containing the amino acid fragment (residues 70–90) of the HAdV-C5 knob protein replaced by that of HAdV-E4 (residues 71–91) were individually synthesized and subcloned into the vector pQE-30. After confirmation by sequencing, the correct plasmid was transformed into 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> M15 cells. Bacteria were inoculated into 1 L LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and incubated with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm at 37 °C. When the OD
 <sub>600</sub> reached around 0.6, expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the culture was further incubated with shaking (250 rpm) at 18 °C overnight. Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was re-suspended in non-denaturing lysis buffer containing 1 mg/mL lysozyme. 
 <italic>ProteinSafe</italic> Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, EDTA-free (Transgen, Beijing, China) was added to the suspension at 1:1000 dilution. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the suspension was sonicated on ice. The sonicated product was centrifuged at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the clear extract, which was filtered through a membrane filter with a 0.22 μm pore size before being purified. The filtered extract was further purified with the BeyoGold His-tag Purification Resin (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The knob protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
