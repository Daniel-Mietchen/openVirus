<p>The binding capacity of each Fab to knob proteins was determined by western blot. Ten micrograms of purified knob proteins were preheated (100 °C for 10 min) and then separated and analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions, and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were then blocked with QuickBlock Blocking Buffer for Western Blot (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) overnight. After washing again with PBS, Fab (5 μg/mL) in QuickBlock Primary Antibody Dilution Buffer for Western Blot (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was added and incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. After washing thrice with 0.05% PBST, bound Fab was detected by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-HA tag mouse mAb (Abbkin, Redlands, CA, USA) in QuickBlock Secondary Antibody Dilution Buffer for Western Blot (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) at 25 °C for 1 h, and washed thrice in 0.05% PBST. The blot was developed by the ECL Detection System (UVP Chemstudio, Analytik Jena AG, Thuringia, Germany).</p>
