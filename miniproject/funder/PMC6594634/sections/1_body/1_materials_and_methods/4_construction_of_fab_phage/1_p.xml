<p>Fab phage display libraries were constructed using the pComb3X vector expression system based on a well-established protocol (Protocol 9.1: Human Fab Libraries)[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from fresh whole blood within 2 h after collection using the Lymphocyte Separation Medium (TBDsciences, Tianjin, China). Total RNA was extracted from PBMC using the 
 <italic>EasyPure</italic> RNA Kit (Transgen, Beijing, China), and cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA sample using the 
 <italic>TransScript</italic> II All-in-One First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for PCR (Transgen, Beijing, China). To generate Fab gene segments, a three-step PCR method was performed using PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase with GC Buffer (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan). The resultant Fab gene segments were digested with restriction enzyme 
 <italic>Sfi</italic> I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and ligated into the phagemid pComb3XSS that had been cut with the same restriction enzyme using T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent

 <italic>coli</italic>) TG1 cells by electroporation (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
