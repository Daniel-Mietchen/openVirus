<p>Supernatant screening was performed based on the protocol described previously, except chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) was used in place of ELISA[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For supernatant CLEIA, immunoassay microplates (Cat. no. 463201, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were prepared by coating with purified HAdV-B3 in 1× ELISA coating buffer at 4 °C overnight. Coated plates were then washed thrice with 0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate buffered solution (PBST) (Solarbio, Beijing, China). After blocking with 2% nonfat milk in PBS (MPBS) at 25 °C for 2 h, supernatants diluted in 2% MPBS (1:2 dilution) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 6 washes with 0.05% PBST. Bound Fabs were detected by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Protein L (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 2% MPBS at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 6 washes with 0.05% PBST. A solution of enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate (Transgen, Beijing, China) was added, and samples were assessed by a microplate luminometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The photons of light emitted were measured as relative light units (RLU). The phagemid construct was isolated from the clone showing maximum binding, and the nucleotide sequences of the variable regions were determined by sequencing.
