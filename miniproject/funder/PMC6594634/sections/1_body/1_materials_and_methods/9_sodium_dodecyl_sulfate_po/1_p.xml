<p>Purified Fabs were preheated at 100 °C for 10 min and were separated and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions. Purified knob proteins with and without preheating (100 °C for 10 min) were separated and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions. Staining was performed using BeyoBlue Coomassie Blue Super Fast Staining Solution (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for 1 h, and the reaction mixture was destained in distilled water overnight. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze the purity of Fabs and knob proteins.</p>
