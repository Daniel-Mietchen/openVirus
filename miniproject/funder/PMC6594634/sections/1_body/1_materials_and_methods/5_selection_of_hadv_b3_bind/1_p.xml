<p>Library biopanning procedures were carried out as described previously[

 <italic>coli</italic> TG1 cells harboring the phagemid libraries were cultured to produce phage particles, which were rescued with helper phage M13KO7 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Amplified phage particles were subjected to three rounds of panning using immunotubes (Cat. no. 444202, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which were prepared by coating with purified HAdV-B3 in 1× enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) coating buffer (Solarbio, Beijing, China) at 4 °C overnight. Eluted phage particles from the final round of panning were used to re-infect 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> HB2151 cells, and the cells were then plated on agar plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Single bacterial colonies were picked randomly and placed in 100 μL 2× TY medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 100 μg/mL ampicillin in U-bottom 96-well plates, which were incubated with shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C overnight. A small inocula (about 2 μL) from the above plates were separately transferred to a second set of U-bottom 96-well plates containing 200 μL 2× TY supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 100 μg/mL ampicillin per well. These were grown with shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C until the optical density of the culture at 600 nm (OD
 <sub>600</sub>) was approximately 0.9 (about 3 h). Then, 25 μL 2× TY supplemented with 9 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and 100 μg/mL ampicillin were added separately, and the cultures were further incubated with shaking (250 rpm) at 30 °C overnight. Supernatants (about 50 μL) used for screening were harvested separately by centrifugation at 1,800 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 10 min.
