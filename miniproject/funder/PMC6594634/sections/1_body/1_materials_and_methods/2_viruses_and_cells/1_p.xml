Different types of HAdV were separately purified using the ViraTrap Adenovirus Mini Purification Kit (Biomiga, San Diego, CA, USA), and the others viruses were separately purified using the ViraTrap Virus Mini Purification Kit (Biomiga, San Diego, CA, USA). A549 cells and AD293 cells were separately cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium: nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin) (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37 °C in 5% CO
