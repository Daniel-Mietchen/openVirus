 <italic>coli</italic> HB2151 cells selected by supernatant CLEIA were separated and further processed for Fab expression. Bacteria were inoculated in 1 L 2× TY medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 100 μg/mL ampicillin with shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C until the culture reached an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of approximately 1.0–1.2. Then, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 25 °C for 20 min, and the pellet was re-suspended in 1 L super broth medium containing 0.1 mM IPTG and 100 μg/mL ampicillin with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm. After expression was allowed overnight at 25 °C, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a membrane filter with a 0.22 μm pore size before being purified. The Fab in the filtered supernatant was purified using Protein L Resin (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, a column containing 2 mL Protein L Resin was equilibrated with 20 mL binding buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, pH 8.0). The filtered supernatant was allowed to pass through the column at a flow speed of 1 mL/min. The column was washed thoroughly with 120 mL of wash buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, pH 8.0) with a flow speed of 2 mL/min, and the bound Fab was eluted by 40 mL elution buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5). The purified Fab solution was further concentrated, and buffer exchange was conducted with PBS by ultrafiltration through a 30 kDa cutoff Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), The Fab concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
