<p>Generated Fabs found to react with several types of HAdV following CLEIA were separately used in immunofluorescence studies with different types of HAdV-infected cells. Each type of HAdV stock containing 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/100 μL was separately inoculated in triplicate onto 96-well plates containing a culture of cell monolayers at 80% confluence. Two hours after infection, the cells were washed thrice with DMEM/F-12, and then maintained in DMEM/F-12 at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 2 days, when cytopathic effects (CPE) appeared, the cells were fixed in Immunol Staining Fix Solution (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) at 25 °C for 1 h. After washing in PBS, the cells were permeabilized and blocked in QuickBlock Blocking Buffer for Immunol Staining (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) at 25 °C for 1 h, and then incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with Fab diluted in QuickBlock Primary Antibody Dilution Buffer for Immunol Staining (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) (0.01 mg/mL). After washing in 0.05% PBST, the cells were incubated for an additional hour with a 1:100 dilution of FITC-labeled anti-6×His tag antibody (Cat. no. ab1206, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) in QuickBlock Secondary Antibody Dilution Buffer for Immunofluorescence (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), and then washed again in 0.05% PBST. The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Uninfected cells were used as a blank control.
