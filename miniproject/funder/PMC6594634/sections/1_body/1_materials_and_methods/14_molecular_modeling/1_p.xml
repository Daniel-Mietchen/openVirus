<p>The SWISS-MODEL workspace was used to model the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the knob protein of HAdV-E4[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The amino acid sequence of the HAdV-E4 knob protein was submitted to build a 3D model using the automated mode. Template selection, alignment and model building are completely automated by the server. The epitope region that was predicted to be exposed on the surface of the knob protein was selected as the potential site recognized by Fab.
