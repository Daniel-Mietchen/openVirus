<p>The binding capacity of each Fab to viruses and knob proteins was determined by CLEIA. Immunoassay microplates (Cat. no. 463201, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were prepared by coating with purified viruses (10 μg/mL) and native knob proteins (2 μg/mL) of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 (negative control) separately in 1× ELISA coating buffer at 4 °C overnight. After washing thrice with 0.05% PBST, coated plates were blocked with blocking buffer (BSA) (Sangon, Shanghai, China) at 25 °C for 2 h. Fab in general antibody dilution buffer (Sangon, Shanghai, China) (0.01 mg/mL) was separately incubated in triplicate in wells coated with viruses and knob proteins at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by 6 washes with 0.05% PBST. Wells containing a blank control (PBS) were included. Binding Fabs were detected by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated Protein L (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by 6 washes with 0.05% PBST. A solution of enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescent substrate was added, and samples were assessed by microplate luminometer. The photons of light emitted were measured as RLU.</p>
