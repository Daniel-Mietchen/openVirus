<p>After sequence alignment, the sequence of an amino acid fragment (residues 71–91) of HAdV-E4 was found to be more similar to the sequence in the same region (residues 69–89) of the HAdV-B3 knob protein with 47.62% homology than to that (residues 70–90) of HAdV-C5 with 38.1% homology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g007">Fig 7</xref>). A model of the HAdV-E4 knob protein was successfully built based on the best template of the HAdV-C2 knob protein (PDB: 1qhv.1.A) with 65.26% homology (

In further analyses, because this amino acid fragment (residues 71–91) was located outside of the 3D model, it was selected as the predicted linear epitope that could be recognized by Fab. Both Fabs detected the knob proteins of HAdV-B3 and E4 with preheating under denaturing and reducing conditions in western blot analysis, but neither Fab reacted with the knob protein of HAdV-C5 under the same conditions (
