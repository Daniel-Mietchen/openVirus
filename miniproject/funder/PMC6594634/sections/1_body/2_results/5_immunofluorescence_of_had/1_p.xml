<p>When tested by IFA, Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 recognized cells infected with HAdV-B3, B7, B11, B14, B55, and E4 (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g005">5</xref>). No fluorescence was observed in cells infected with HAdV-B35, C1, C2, C5, F40, and F41 (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g005">5</xref>). As expected, both Fabs showed stronger fluorescence with A549 cells infected with HAdV-E4 than with other HAdVs (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g005">5</xref>). In immunofluorescence stained infected cells, both Fabs featured a clear cytoplasmic pattern against infected cells. The infected cells individually stained with Fabs showed that Fab 2A6 displays stronger fluorescence than Fab 4E2 under the same experimental conditions.
