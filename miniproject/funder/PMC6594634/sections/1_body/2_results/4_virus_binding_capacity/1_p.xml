<p>Compared with the other viruses, all RLU averages of Fab 2A6 that reacted with HAdVs were high (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g003">Fig 3</xref>). All RLU averages of Fab 2A6 that reacted with HAdVs in species B and E were higher than those of the Fab that reacted with those in species C and F, except HAdV-B35 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g003">Fig 3</xref>). A higher average RLU of Fab 2A6 that reacted with HAdV-E4 was found (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219091.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, the results showed that Fab 2A6 displays a higher RLU than Fab 4E2 under the same experimental conditions (
