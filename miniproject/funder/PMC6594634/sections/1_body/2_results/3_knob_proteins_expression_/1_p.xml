<p>Purified knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 and the purified mutant knob protein were individually analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under denaturing and reducing conditions. Purified knob proteins that were preheated and separated by SDS-PAGE gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, revealing bands corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the monomeric proteins (

Under denaturing and reducing conditions, the knob proteins of HAdV-E4 and C5 that were purified without preheating were shown in polymeric form, but the purified HAdV-B3 knob protein and the mutant knob protein without preheating were in monomeric form (
