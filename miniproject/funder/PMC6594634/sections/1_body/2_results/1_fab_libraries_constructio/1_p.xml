<p>Two phage display libraries, named Fab
 <sub>Kappa</sub> and Fab
 <sub>Lambda</sub>, were constructed successfully with capacities of 1.4×10
 <sup>7</sup> and 2.45×10
 <sup>7</sup>, respectively. After three rounds of panning of the combined phage display Fab library, 384 individual clones were picked randomly and used to produce Fab, which was tested for binding to purified HAdV-B3 using supernatant CLEIA. Among those selected, four representative clones, which had supernatants that individually displayed the highest RLU in each 96-well immunoassay microplate, were analyzed by sequencing and BLAST analysis. The BLAST results showed that all clones originated from the Fab
 <sub>Kappa</sub> library, and three of the four clones were identical. Finally, two unique clones, named 2A6 and 4E2, were selected.
