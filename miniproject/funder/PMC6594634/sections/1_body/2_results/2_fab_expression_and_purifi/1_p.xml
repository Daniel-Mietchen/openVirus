<p>Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 were separately purified from the supernatants of bacterial cultures using protein L affinity purification. For both Fabs, 1 L of the bacterial culture typically yielded approximately 1 mg of the finial purified Fab product. The purified Fabs were individually verified by SDS-PAGE, which showed two bands corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the light chain and the Fd fragment, respectively (
