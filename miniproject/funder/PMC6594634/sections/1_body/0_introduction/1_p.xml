<p>Human adenovirus (HAdV) is a non-enveloped virus with an icosahedral shaped capsid that consists of three major proteins (fiber, hexon, and penton base proteins) and four minor proteins[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The fiber, hexon, and penton base proteins of HAdV have been shown to be the antigens that cause the body to produce antibodies[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The fiber protein is a trimeric complex composed of three domains: an N-terminus tail, a rod-like shaft, and a globular knob at the C-terminus[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The knob domain is responsible for specific high-affinity binding of HAdV to the cell receptor and determines HAdV infection and tissue tropism[

 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. HAdVs are common pathogens that cause a variety of clinical diseases, such as acute respiratory disease (ARD), cystitis, gastroenteritis, and keratoconjunctivitis[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among HAdVs associated with ARD, type 1 to type 7 HAdVs have been identified in epidemics globally and are recognized as the main pathogens involved[
