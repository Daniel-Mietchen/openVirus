<p>The diagnosis of HAdV infection has mainly been determind using culture-based techniques, antigen detection by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and real-time PCR[

 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HAdV grows readily in cell culture, but culture-based techniques may require weeks to deliver definitive results[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IFA and real-time PCR offer advantages in terms of speed, and the diagnosis of HAdV infection can be completed within 2 h[

 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Detection of HAdVs in nasopharyngeal swab samples by IFA is well-established and commonly used[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) employed by IFA to detect HAdVs should ideally target highly conserved epitope types. A mAb found to be reactive against HAdVs in species C by binding with the hexon protein was reported for application in immunofluorescence, but the epitope was not further identified[
 <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we describe the development of two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), named 2A6 and 4E2, with specific reactivity to HAdV using phage antibody library technology. We discuss the application of both Fabs in immunofluorescence techniques. In addition, epitope mapping showed that both Fabs recognized a conserved linear epitope among several types of HAdV.
