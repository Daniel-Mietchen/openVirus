which is a leading cause of severe respiratory tract disease, and will help in curbing the spread of HAdV. Monoclonal antibodies employed in IFA for HAdV detection should ideally target highly conserved epitope types. Here, we describe the development of two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) with specific reactivity to HAdV using phage antibody library technology. When tested with IFA, both Fabs recognized cells infected with several types of HAdV, some of which have been identified in epidemics globally, or associated with outbreaks of severe or fatal acute respiratory diseases. The specificity and cross-reactivity of both Fabs to HAdVs indicated that the generated Fabs could be applied in the development of IFAs to detect HAdVs. Both Fabs bound to the knob proteins, as shown by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay and western blot. In addition, epitope mapping showed that both Fabs recognized a conserved linear epitope among several types of HAdV. Two different Fabs recognized the same epitope, suggesting that the epitope triggered the production of at least two kinds of antibodies in the body. The generated Fabs exerted no neutralization against HAdVs. The results demonstrate that both Fabs bind to an epitope that plays no role in neutralization of HAdV.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Science and Technology Major Project of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2017ZX10103011-003, 2018ZX10102001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31570163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004000</institution-id><institution>Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201803040004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Rong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the National Science and Technology Major Project of China (2017ZX10103011-003, 2018ZX10102001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31570163) and Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects (201803040004).

The fiber, hexon, and penton base proteins of HAdV have been shown to be the antigens that cause the body to produce antibodies[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The fiber protein is a trimeric complex composed of three domains: an N-terminus tail, a rod-like shaft, and a globular knob at the C-terminus[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The knob domain is responsible for specific high-affinity binding of HAdV to the cell receptor and determines HAdV infection and tissue tropism[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since HAdV was first isolated by Rown <italic>et al</italic>. in 1953, 90 types have been identified so far (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/">http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/</ext-link>), including candidates from HAdV type 53 (HAdV-53) to HAdV-90, and these are classified into seven species (from A to G) on the basis of serology, whole-genome sequencing, and phylogenomics[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. HAdVs are common pathogens that cause a variety of clinical diseases, such as acute respiratory disease (ARD), cystitis, gastroenteritis, and keratoconjunctivitis[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among HAdVs associated with ARD, type 1 to type 7 HAdVs have been identified in epidemics globally and are recognized as the main pathogens involved[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Numerous outbreaks of severe or even fatal ARD caused by re-emergent HAdV-14 in species B (HAdV-B14) and HAdV-B55 have been reported in many countries over the last decade[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The diagnosis of HAdV infection has mainly been determind using culture-based techniques, antigen detection by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and real-time PCR[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HAdV grows readily in cell culture, but culture-based techniques may require weeks to deliver definitive results[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IFA and real-time PCR offer advantages in terms of speed, and the diagnosis of HAdV infection can be completed within 2 h[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Detection of HAdVs in nasopharyngeal swab samples by IFA is well-established and commonly used[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) employed by IFA to detect HAdVs should ideally target highly conserved epitope types. A mAb found to be reactive against HAdVs in species C by binding with the hexon protein was reported for application in immunofluorescence, but the epitope was not further identified[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we describe the development of two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), named 2A6 and 4E2, with specific reactivity to HAdV using phage antibody library technology. We discuss the application of both Fabs in immunofluorescence techniques. In addition, epitope mapping showed that both Fabs recognized a conserved linear epitope among several types of HAdV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The research was approved by the Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University.

However, both Fabs did not recognize the HAdV-C5 knob protein with preheating. In addition, a band around 20 kDa, which is the predicted molecular weight of the mutant knob (mknob) protein with preheating, was detected with both Fabs. Two non-specific bands appeared below the knob proteins of HAdV-B3 and E4, but these were not found with SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the concentrations were low. These non-specific proteins could be purified by Ni-NTA resin and recognized by Fab, suggesting that they contained the 6&#x000d7;His tag and the linear epitope. We inferred that these non-specific proteins were produced as partially expressed knob proteins that were degraded in <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0219091.g009"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since there are many types of HAdV, mAbs employed in diagnostic reagents for HAdV detection should ideally target highly conserved epitope types in order to minimize the risk of failure in detecting new emergent types, as recombination is an accepted feature of HAdV evolution. In this study, Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 with specific reactivity to HAdV were developed using phage antibody library technology and evaluated for their applicability in developing IFA for HAdV detection. Both Fabs were expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> at a relatively high level, and purified Fabs could be obtained in only 3 days. Compared with other expression systems, the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expression system is more economical and straightforward for protein production. Based on the design of the vector pComb3XSS, the fusion tags 6&#x000d7;His and HA allow for purification and detection of Fab. In addition to these tags, both Fabs also can be purified and detected by Protein L. We investigated the cross-reactivity of both Fabs to different types of HAdV using CLEIA and IFA, and the results demonstrated that both Fabs strongly reacted with HAdV-B3, B7, B11, B14, B55, and E4. The results of CLEIA and IFA differed between both Fabs, indicating that the HAdV-binding capacity of Fab 2A6 was stronger than that of Fab 4E2. The specificity was examined by CLEIA using other respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus (IFV) and RSV. We found no cross-reactivity between either Fab and IFV or RSV. The specificity and cross-reactivity of both Fabs to HAdVs indicated that the generated Fabs could be applied in the development of diagnostic tests for HAdV. When the generated Fabs are used to detect antigens in nasopharyngeal swab samples, they are specific to HAdV and will not recognize other viruses, ensuring that the results are reliable. Some mAbs with specificity to HAdV have been reported, but they recognize only one or several types within a single species[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219091.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this study, the generated Fabs recognized several types within species B and HAdV-E4. So far, no mAbs have been reported that recognize all known types of HAdV. The number of HAdV types that are recognized by a diagnostic reagent can be increased using a pool of two or more noncompeting antibodies. The number of mAbs used in the development of a diagnostic reagent for HAdV detection can be decreased using the generated Fabs, as both Fabs recognized at least six types of HAdV.</p><p>Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 were able to bind to several types of HAdV in species B and E, as assessed by CLEIA and IFA. We had recently reported that three broadly neutralizing mAbs were identified with specific reactivity to a conformational neutralization epitope in the knob proteins of several types of HAdV in species B[<xref rid="pone.0219091.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 (negative control) were expressed to examine whether both Fabs also bind to the knob protein. Unfortunately, CLEIA determined that the binding of both Fabs to knob proteins was less specific. This may result from the structure of the native knob protein expressed by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> differing from that of the natural knob protein of HAdV. However, it seems that both Fabs bind to the purified knob protein of HAdV-B3, which was revealed by SDS-PAGE in monomeric form under denaturing and reducing conditions. Therefore, the binding ability of both Fabs to the knob proteins of HAdV-B3, E4, and C5 (negative control) in monomeric form was further examined. In western blot, both Fabs detected the knob proteins of HAdV-B3 and E4 with preheating, but they did not react with the knob protein of HAdV-C5 with preheating under denaturing and reducing conditions. This suggested that the Fabs recognized a conserved linear epitope that was similar between HAdV-B3 and HAdV-E4, but differed from that of HAdV-C5. An epitope region meeting the above condition and predicted to be exposed on the surface of the HAdV-E4 knob protein was selected as the potential site based on the results of sequence alignment and molecular modeling. To test this prediction, a mutant knob protein was constructed by replacing the amino acid fragment of the HAdV-C5 knob protein (residues 70&#x02013;90) with that of HAdV-E4 (residues 71&#x02013;91). In further analyses, both Fabs reacted with the mutant knob protein with preheating under denaturing and reducing conditions in western blot analysis, demonstrating that the binding epitope was mapped to the amino acid fragment of the HAdV-E4 knob protein (residues 71&#x02013;91). Based on the sequence alignment results, the amino acid sequence of the epitope of HAdV-E4 is relatively conserved with that of HAdV-B3 in the same region, and 10 of 21 amino acids are identical with 47.62% homology.</p><p>Two different Fabs recognized the same epitope, suggesting that the epitope caused the body to produce at least two kinds of antibodies. Our findings are very important for the development of IFA to detect HAdV. Both Fabs exhibited no neutralization activity against the HAdVs listed in <xref rid="pone.0219091.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219091.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These results were unexpected, demonstrating that both Fabs bind to the epitope that plays no role in the neutralization of HAdV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219091.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Measurement of the neutralization of Fabs 2A6 and 4E2 by microneutralization assay.</title><p>To measure neutralization, 165 &#x003bc;L purified Fabs (0.2 mg/mL) were individually mixed with an equal volume of HAdV-E4 stock containing 200 TCID<sub>50</sub>/100 &#x003bc;L, and then the virus-serum mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
