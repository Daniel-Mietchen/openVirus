<p id="Par12">In the three toxigenic

 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 isolates, we detected the VSP-1 element integrated on the larger chromosome between genes 
 <italic>VC_0173</italic> and 
 <italic>VC_0187</italic>, as found in N16961
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, we also observed a sequence of DNA on the smaller chromosome of each of the toxigenic isolates, integrated between 
 <italic>VC_A0695</italic> and 
 <italic>VC_A0696</italic>, that was 99% identical to VSP-1 (
 <italic>VC_0175</italic> to 
 <italic>VC_</italic>
 <italic>0186</italic>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). This suggested that a second copy of the VSP-1 element was present on the second chromosome in each of these genomes. We mapped the previously-published Illumina reads for these genomes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> to the N16961 reference genome and plotted the read depth for VSP-1 relative to the surrounding genome (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>), which further supported the conclusion that these genomes contain a second copy of VSP-1.
