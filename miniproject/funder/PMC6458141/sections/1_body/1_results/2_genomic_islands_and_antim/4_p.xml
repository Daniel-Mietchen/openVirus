<p id="Par14">We also compared the genomic island complement of these four sequences with that of MO10. MO10 harbours a kappa prophage (GI-11
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>), which is absent from N16961 and also absent from the four sequences in this study (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Likewise, MO10 harbours the 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> VSK prophage (GI-16
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>), which is absent from both N16961 and the O139 sequences in this study (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). MO10 does not appear to harbour the second VSP-1 copy on chromosome 2 which we identified in the three toxigenic isolates. The SXT variant harboured by MO10 is expanded relative to that found in these strains (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>), and this expansion includes genes conferring resistance to the antimicrobials streptomycin (
 <italic>strAB</italic>), sulfamethoxazole (
 <italic>sul2</italic>), trimethoprim (
 <italic>dfr18</italic>), and chloramphenicol (
 <italic>floR</italic>). We scanned the assemblies for the four O139 genomes for antimicrobial resistance genes. The non-toxigenic 48853_F01 genome does not harbour any known antimicrobial resistance genes. The three toxigenic O139 genomes also do not contain any antimicrobial resistance genes, though they do harbour a 
 <italic>catB9</italic> gene that is known not to confer antibiotic resistance

 </sup>. These data are concordant with the original antimicrobial sensitivity testing of these isolates, which found that they were resistant only to nalidixic acid
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. We confirmed that these four isolates harbour an S83I mutation in GyrA, and that 48853_F01 also contains an A171S mutation in GyrA and a S85L mutation in ParC. All of these mutations are associated with nalidixic acid resistance in
