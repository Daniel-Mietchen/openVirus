 </sup>, difficulty in assembling these repetitive regions with short-read sequencing data meant that these repeats were not identified in our original sequencing of these isolates
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. We mapped the short-read data to the long-read assemblies for each of these genomes, and to the N16961 reference, to confirm that short reads mapped to both the 
 <italic>ctxB4</italic> and 
 <italic>ctxB5</italic> variant CTXφ regions, and that when mapped to N16961, the coverage of the CTXφ region was approximately double that of the surrounding chromosome (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Manual inspection of these mapping data showed that reads from both 
 <italic>ctxB</italic> alleles mapped to the N16961 
 <italic>ctxB</italic> locus.
