<p id="Par16">The previous report of these genome sequences, obtained using short-read technology alone, examined the structure of the capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis loci. These analyses were performed using incompletely-assembled genome sequences
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. We used the closed sequences obtained in this project to compare these loci across the strains in this study to N16961 and MO10 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). We confirmed that the three toxigenic strains contain O139 LPS operons that strongly resemble that found in MO10 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The equivalent region in the non-toxigenic isolate 48853_F01 is less similar, although this strain exhibits a strong O139-positive phenotype using the rapid dipstick assay and slide agglutination tests

 <italic>cholerae</italic> isolates from 2010 and a Mexican isolate from 1991 for which there are no serotype data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). We found that, although these three non-O1 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> share capsule biosynthesis genes with 48853_F01, they do not harbour the same LPS operon (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). These Haitian and Mexican isolates therefore are unlikely to be
