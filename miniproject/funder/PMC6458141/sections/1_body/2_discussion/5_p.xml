<p id="Par21">Here, by sequencing 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 using long-read technology, we have highlighted genomic features that emphasise the genetic distinctions between 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 and 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O1. We have identified differences between these recent strains, N16961, and MO10, the 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 strain used for previous comparative analyses. We have also described unusual phenomena in 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 genome biology â€“ namely, the co-existence of more than one 
 <italic>ctxB</italic> allele, and the cross-chromosome duplication of VSP-1. There also appears to have been genetic changes within 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 that has occurred since its first identification in 1992, typified by the MO10 isolate. Given that 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 is a member of 7PET, has several characteristics of a sublineage with the potential to cause pandemic disease, and continues to be isolated in recent years, research into this serogroup should continue. These reference sequences enable such research, and as well as providing interesting insights into the genome structure of recent 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139, these sequences are an important resource for future genomic studies of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> as a pathogen and as a species.
