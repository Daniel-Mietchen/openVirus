<p id="Par18">Many of the observations in this study could only be made because of the resolution offered by long-read sequencing. For example, the observation that several 
 <italic>ctxB</italic> alleles can co-exist in a single genome is striking. The co-existence of several CTXφ sequences in tandem has been reported before, such as in the O395 classical reference sequence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup> and in the PA1849 second-pandemic classical isolate
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. However, in PA1849, the tandem bacteriophages are of the same 
 <italic>ctxB</italic> allele, and in O395, the CTXφ array on the larger chromosome consists of one intact CTXφ and one partial prophage sequence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup>. Although these 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 had been sequenced previously, it had not been possible to assemble these genomes fully with the short-read Illumina technology used at the time. Consequently, in all three assemblies, CTXφ was not assembled into a single contig, and only one of the two 
 <italic>ctxB</italic> genes was identifiable (our Illumina assemblies for 48853_G01 and 48853_H01 contain a 
 <italic>ctxB4</italic> allele in a small contig, and 48853_A02 contains 
 <italic>ctxB5</italic> in a larger contig). In future studies of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O139, mapping sequencing reads against these reference sequences will address this problem, which will not be resolved if data are exclusively mapped to N16961 or related sequences.
