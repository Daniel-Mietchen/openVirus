  <p>Phylogenetic analysis. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A total of 168,476 variable sites from a core-gene alignment of 2,103 genes from 65 genomes were used to generate a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the 
   <italic>V</italic>. 
   <italic>cholerae</italic> species, rooted on 
   <italic>Vibrio metoecus</italic> and 
   <italic>Vibrio sp</italic>. RC586. Two genomes that are representative of the 7PET lineage were included. The non-toxigenic isolate 48853_F01 clustered together with other non-toxigenic, non-O1/O139 
   <italic>V</italic>. 
   <italic>cholerae</italic>. (
   <bold>B</bold>) A maximum-likelihood phylogeny of the 7PET lineage constructed using 1,629 non-recombinant variable sites across 117 
   <italic>V</italic>. 
   <italic>cholerae</italic> genomes, rooted on M66-2. The three toxigenic samples in this study clustered together with other toxigenic O139 genome sequences, all of which form a discrete sub-lineage within 7PET. Hatch marks denote branches that were shortened artificially for illustrative purposes; an unedited tree is presented in Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>. Trees were also computed using an ascertainment bias correction model (see Methods). These are presented in Supplementary Fig.
