  <p>BLAST atlas comparing the genomes used in this study and MO10 to the N16961 reference genome. The presence of VPI-1, VSP-1, and VSP-2 in the three toxigenic 
   <italic>V</italic>. 
   <italic>cholerae</italic> O139 assemblies, as well as the truncation of VPI-2, is indicated. The non-toxigenic strain did not harbour VSP-1, VSP-2, or VPI-2 (indicated), although a region homologous to part of VPI-1 (
   <italic>VC_0809</italic> to 
   <italic>VC_0816</italic>) was detected on the larger chromosome. The sequences of both 
   <italic>V</italic>. 
   <italic>cholerae</italic> chromosomes were concatenated to generate this figure; the boundary between the chromosomes is denoted.
