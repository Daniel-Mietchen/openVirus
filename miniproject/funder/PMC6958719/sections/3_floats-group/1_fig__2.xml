  <p>Neutralizing activity and cross-reaction testing of 6B211
   <bold>. a</bold> 6B211 has potent neutralizing activity against C-strain; ST cells were incubated with CSFV C-strain virus (100 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) and two-fold serial dilutions (1:320 to 1:5120) of mAb 6B211 (1 mg/ml) or WH303 (1 mg/ml); 3 days post infection (DPI); no green fluorescent signal means 100% inhibition of C-strain virus; 
   <bold>b</bold> 6B211 lacks cross-reactivity to BVDVs tested by IFA. Cells: MDBK; inoculated viruses: BVDV-32 (genotype 1, BVD-1), BVDV-0427 (BVD-1), BVDV-AV6 (BVD-1), and BVDV-125 (Genotype 2, BVD-2); 3 DPI; no green fluorescent signal means without reaction with BVDVs
