  <p>Analysis of purified C-strain E2 protein and monoclonal antibody 6B211. 
   <bold>a</bold> Purified C-strain E2 protein mainly exists in its native dimeric conformation. After purification steps, the purified insect cell expressed C-strain E2 protein were treated without (Native) or with Î²-mercaptoethanol (Reduced) and separated by SDS-PAGE in a Mini-Protean TGX Gel (Bio-Rad, CA, USA); 
   <bold>b</bold> 6B211 only react with the native C-strain proteins. Purified E2 proteins (native or reduced) were loaded on Mini-Protean TGX Gel. The proteins were then transferred to PVDF membrane and the membrane were blocked and incubated with 6B211
