<p id="Par36">The reproducibility of the cELISA was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) of the percent of inhibition (PI) values by testing 20 C-strain VNT negative pig serum samples and 20 C-strain VNT positive pig serum samples. The intra-assay CVs of the C-strain VNT positive samples ranged from 0.02 to 1.68%. The inter-assay CVs of those same samples ranged from 1.02 to 8.66%. The intra-assay and inter-assay of the C-strain VNT negative samples also exhibited excellent repeatability, showing 0.01–0.35% and 0.66–4.29%, respectively (Table
