<p id="Par37">A total of 139 pig serum samples were tested using the established cELISA and VNT in parallel. Results (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) showed that cELISA and VNT had an excellent agreement (Kappa = 0.957) in identifying positive (from pigs vaccinated with C-strain vaccine) and negative samples. McNemar’s test revealed that there was no significant difference in the results between the cELISA and VNT (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the inhibition rate in 6B211 based cELISA and titers in VNT was calculated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) based on testing results of the 139 samples. The inhibition rate is highly correlated with VNT titers for these samples (
