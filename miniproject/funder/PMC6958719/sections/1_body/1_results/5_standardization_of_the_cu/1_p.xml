<p id="Par38">A total of 515 pig serum samples were used to standardize the cut-off value of the established cELISA. Among them, 445 samples were C-strain VNT negative and 70 samples were C-strain VNT positive (21 to 56 days post vaccination, DPV). After testing these samples by the established cELISA, distributions of the cELISA PI values showing the frequency of positive and negative samples are calculated and shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The mean PI value (x-axis) of the negative sera detected by cELISA was − 0.59%. When mean PI of negative sera plus two standard deviation (SD, 4.03%) was used as threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the cELISA were 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.87 to 100%) and 98.43% (95% confidence interval: 96.79 to 99.37%), respectively. When mean PI of negative sera plus three SD (6.19%) was used as threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the cELISA were 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.87 to 100%) and 100% (95% confidence interval: 100 to 100%), respectively.
