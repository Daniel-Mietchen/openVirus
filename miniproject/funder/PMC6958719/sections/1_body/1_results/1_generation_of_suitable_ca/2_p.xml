<p id="Par34">To generate suitable mAb for the cELISA, purified C-strain E2 protein was used as immunogen for mAb production using Balb/c mice. All mice maintained good physical health and no adverse event happened during the experiments. Spleen cells from one mouse with the highest anti-E2 antibody titer were collected for fusion. One panel of more than 5 mAbs against C-strain E2 protein was generated. After assessment by VNT, mAb 6B211 (IgG1 and kappa chain) showed the most potent neutralizing activity against C-strain CSFV. 6B211 only react with homodimer of E2 protein and cannot recognize the reduced proteins, which indicate that it recognize the conformational epitope of C-strain E2 protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The neutralization titer (neutralization doses 50%, ND
 <sub>50</sub>) of its purified supernatant (1 mg/ml with 1920 ND
 <sub>50</sub>) is much higher than that of the commercial neutralizing E2 monoclonal antibody WH303 (1 mg/ml with 480 ND
 <sub>50</sub>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In addition, 6B211 lacks cross-reaction with other viruses in genus 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> such as Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Fig.
