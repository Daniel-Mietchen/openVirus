<p id="Par35">Optimal concentrations of capture protein (C-strain E2) and competitive mAb (horseradish peroxidase conjugated 6B211, HRP-6B211) were determined by a systematic checkerboard procedure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). A concentration of 0.625 μg/ml of C-strain E2 protein and a concentration of 1.25 μg/ml of HRP-6B211 were chosen as they consistently produced an OD
 <sub>450</sub> value around 1.7 and at a point in the linear range in the standard curve. 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) was chosen as the optimal blocking buffer as it consistently outperformed other blocking solutions (non-fat dry milk and BSA) in terms of high signal to noise ratio. To minimize the volume of serum required and background noise, serum dilution of 1:5 was chosen as the preferred dilution over lower dilutions that performed only slightly better (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). These conditions were used in all subsequent cELISA experiments.
