<p id="Par39">Serial serum samples (0 to 56 DPV at every 7 days) derived from two pigs vaccinated with C-strain were tested by the established cELISA. The C-strain antibody could be tested in both pigs as early as 7 DPV with inhibition values 24 and 56%, respectively. Significant increase of inhibition was observed between 7 DPV and 28 DPV. The levels of antibody titer kept relatively stable from 28 DPV to 56 DPV with inhibition values ranging from 68 to 86% (Fig.
