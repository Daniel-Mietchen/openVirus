<p id="Par43">Through the aforementioned experiments and analysis, we concluded that the mAb 6B211 based cELISA showed excellent agreement and high correlation with the VNT. This cELISA is a reliable, rapid, simple, safe, and cost-effective tool for sero-monitoring of C-strain vaccination at a population level. We believe that the cELISA presented in this study could be used to assist in CSF control and eradication.</p>
