<p id="Par53">Inter-assay and intra-assay reproducibility for the established cELISA was evaluated by testing CSFV antibody negative (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20) serum samples and C-strain VNT positive pig serum samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). For the intra-assay reproducibility, each serum sample (in duplicate) was detected by the same batch of pre-coated ELISA plates. For the inter-assay reproducibility, each serum sample was detected by three batches of pre-coated ELISA plates. Sensitivity and specificity analysis were carried out by the web-based MedCalc statistical software (

Statistical analysis of reproducibility was carried out by calculate the mean PI value and coefficient of variation (CV) of replications of each test. Statistical analysis of the degree of agreement (Kappa value) and correlation between the established cELISA and VNT were carried out by McNemar’s test and Pearson correlation coefficient analysis in SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25.0 (IBM Crop, NY, USA). Differences were considered statistically significant when
