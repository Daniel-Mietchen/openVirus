<p id="Par50">The systematic checkerboard procedure was used to optimize the concentration of capture antigen and HRP-6B211. The optimal dilution of serum and blocking solution were determined experimentally. The established cELISA was performed in Corning® 96 Well Clear Flat Bottom Polystyrene High Bind Microplate (Corning, NY, USA). Briefly, plates were coated overnight with C-strain E2 (0.625 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in PBS (without calcium and magnesium, pH 7.4, Thermo Scientific, NJ, USA) at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBST, the plates were blocked with blocking buffer by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h; after washing, 50 μl of diluted serum samples and 50 μl of diluted HRP-6B211 were added to each well and mixed well by pipetting. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing five times, 100 μl of room-temperature TMB Stabilized Chromogen (Invitrogen, CA, USA) were added and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min; after adding 100 μl/well of 2 N Sulfuric Acid (Ricca Chemical Company, TX, USA), the absorbance at 450 nm were obtained using SpectraMAX microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The OD
 <sub>450</sub> of the samples were converted to a percent inhibition (PI) value using the following formulation: PI (%) = (OD
 <sub>450</sub> value of negative controls − OD
 <sub>450</sub> value of sample)/OD
 <sub>450</sub> value of negative controls × 100%.
