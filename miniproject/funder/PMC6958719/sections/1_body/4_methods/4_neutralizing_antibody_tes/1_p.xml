<p id="Par48">Purified mAbs 6B211 (1 mg/ml) and WH303 (1 mg/ml, Animal and Plant Health Laboratories Agency, Wey Bridge, United Kingdom) were first diluted five-fold and then serially diluted two-fold. The diluted samples (in duplicate) were incubated with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infective dose) of CSFV C-strain in DMEM with 10% FBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Residual virus infectivity was determined by adding 1.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> ST cells to each well with serum-virus mixture in 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. The cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining with E2-specific mAb WH303 and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Life Technologies, MA, USA). Neutralizing antibody titers (NAT) were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that caused 50% neutralization.
