<p id="Par47">The reactivity of mAb with different BVDVs was tested by IFA as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, MDBK cells (bovine kidney cells, ATCC, CCL22) grown in 96-well plate were infected with BVDVs (BVDV-32 strain, genotype 1; BVDV-0427 strain, genotype 1; BVDV-AV6 strain, genotype 1; BVDV-125 strain, genotype 2) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 3 days. Cells were fixed in cold acetone and washed two times with PBST. Supernatant of hybridomas (1:50 diluted) was added and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (hr). Plates were washed three times with PBST and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Life Technologies, MA, USA) was added at 1:200 dilution to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, the plate was washed three times with PBST and examined under a fluorescence microscope.
