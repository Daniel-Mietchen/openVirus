<p id="Par46">For mAb production, 50 μl (1 μg/μl) purified E2 protein plus equal volume of 2% Alhydrogel (Invitrogen, CA, USA) was used as an immunogen to inject each of the Balb/c mice via intraperitoneal injection. Three booster immunizations with same dose were conducted at 2 week intervals. Three days after the final booster injection, one mouse with the highest anti-E2 antibody titer was humanely euthanized using carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) in euthanasia chambers and sprayed with 70% ethanol. Spleen cells were collected and fused with the mouse myeloma partner SP2/0-Ag14 (ATCC, MD, USA) by using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim, IN, USA) at a ratio of 10:1. The hybridoma cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco, NY, USA) with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, UT, USA). Supernatants from growing hybridomas were screened by an ELISA for reactivity to E2 protein as previously described [

Characterization of these monoclonal antibodies will be published elsewhere. One mAb, designated 6B211 was used in this study. Its isotype was classified with an antibody-isotyping kit (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, IN, USA). The reaction of 6B211 with native and β-mercaptoethanol treated C-strain E2 protein was analyzed by western blot as we described previously [
