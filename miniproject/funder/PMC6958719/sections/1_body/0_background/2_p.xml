<p id="Par31">The etiologic agent of CSF, classical swine fever virus (CSFV), is one member of the genus 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. CSFV genome is comprised of a single large open reading frame (ORF) coding for a polyprotein encompassing all the viral proteins: four structural (C, E
 <sup>rns</sup>, E1, and E2) and eight nonstructural viral proteins (N
 <sup>pro</sup>, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The envelope glycoprotein E2 is responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies which are protective against virulent CSF virus and is also the target antigen for development of CSF vaccines, molecular and serological tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. High sequence variability has been found in E2 protein among CSFVs. Based on the full-length E2 gene sequences, CSFV isolates could be divided into three genotypes (1, 2, and 3) as well as 11 subgenotypes (1.1–1.4, 2.1a, 2.1b, 2.1c, 2.1d, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.4) [
