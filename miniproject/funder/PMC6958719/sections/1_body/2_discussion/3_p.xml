<p id="Par42">By testing the pig sera in parallel and using mean PI of negative sera plus three SD as the threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the cELISA were 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.87 to 100%) and 100% (95% confidence interval: 100 to 100%), respectively. The C-strain antibody can be tested in pigs as early as 7 DPV with the cELISA. The excellent agreement (Kappa = 0.957, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) between cELISA and VNT, and the high correlation VNT (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.903) between inhibition rate in cELISA and VNT titers of tested samples indicate that the 6B211 based cELISA can replace the VNT for C-strain post–vaccination monitoring. In addition, the intra-assay CVs and the inter-assay CVs of the 6B211 based cELISA (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) are lower than 10% when tested with the negative and E2 antibody positive pig serum samples, which indicate that the established cELISA is repeatable with acceptable variations.
