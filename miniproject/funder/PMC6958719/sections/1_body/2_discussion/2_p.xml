<p id="Par41">The mAb 6B211 showed potent neutralizing activity against C-strain CSFV and bound to a specific conformational epitope on C-strain E2 protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b &amp; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In addition, it showed very high sensitivity when tested by IFA (mouse ascites of 6B211 produced a strong positive fluorescence signal at dilution 1:16,000, data not shown). To test the hypothesis that neutralizing 6B211 can compete with C-strain induced neutralizing antibodies in pig serum to bind the capture antigen (C-strain E2), 445 C-strain VNT negative pig serum samples and 70 C-strain VNT positive pig serum samples were tested by the 6B211 based cELISA. The 6B211 based cELISA can effectively differentiate the C-strain VNT positive and C-strain VNT negative samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which indicate that 6B211 can compete with C-strain induced neutralizing antibodies from pigs and can be used as the competitive antibody for cELISA.
