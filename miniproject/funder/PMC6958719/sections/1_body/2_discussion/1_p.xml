<p id="Par40">In this study, we developed a neutralizing mAb based cELISA with the emphasis on the replacement of VNT for C-strain post–vaccination monitoring. Several monoclonal antibody-based cELISAs have been developed for detection and titration of antibodies against different viruses. One study developed a cELISA based on a mAb to a neutralizing epitope of hemagglutinin protein of 
 <italic>peste des petits ruminants virus</italic> (PPRV). Efficacy of the cELISA compared very well with VNT having high relative specificity (98.4%) and sensitivity (92.4%). Findings suggest that the cELISA test developed can easily replace VNT for sero-surveillance, sero-monitoring, diagnosis from paired sera samples and end-point titration of PPRV antibodies [

Another study developed a cELISA for detecting antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV) and phocine distemper virus (PDV) in sera from dogs and various species of marine mammals. The authors suggested that as cELISA proved to be nearly as sensitive and specific as the VNT while being simpler and more rapid, it would be an adequate screening test for CDV or PDV cases [
