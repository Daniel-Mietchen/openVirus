However, VNT is a time consuming procedure that requires cell culture and live virus manipulation. C-strain CSF vaccine is the most frequently used vaccine for CSF control and prevention. In this study, we presented a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) with the emphasis on the replacement of VNT for C-strain post&#x02013;vaccination monitoring.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">One monoclonal antibody (6B211) which has potent neutralizing activity against C-strain was generated. A novel cELISA was established and optimized based on the strategy that 6B211 can compete with C-strain induced neutralizing antibodies in pig serum to bind capture antigen C-strain E2. By testing C-strain VNT negative pig sera (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;445) and C-strain VNT positive pig sera (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;70), the 6B211 based cELISA showed 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval: 94.87 to 100%) and 100% specificity (95% confidence interval: 100 to 100%). The C-strain antibody can be tested in pigs as early as 7&#x02009;days post vaccination with the cELISA.

Several monoclonal antibody-based cELISAs have been developed for detection and titration of antibodies against different viruses. One study developed a cELISA based on a mAb to a neutralizing epitope of hemagglutinin protein of <italic>peste des petits ruminants virus</italic> (PPRV). Efficacy of the cELISA compared very well with VNT having high relative specificity (98.4%) and sensitivity (92.4%). Findings suggest that the cELISA test developed can easily replace VNT for sero-surveillance, sero-monitoring, diagnosis from paired sera samples and end-point titration of PPRV antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Another study developed a cELISA for detecting antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV) and phocine distemper virus (PDV) in sera from dogs and various species of marine mammals. The authors suggested that as cELISA proved to be nearly as sensitive and specific as the VNT while being simpler and more rapid, it would be an adequate screening test for CDV or PDV cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The glycoprotein E2 exposed on the outer surface of CSFV is the major immuno-protective antigen of C-strain vaccine that is responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies and eliciting protective immunity against CSFV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprising that E2 protein has been successfully used to develop ELISAs to measure anti-CSFV antibody response in pigs after vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, the purified insect cell expressed C-strain envelope glycoprotein E2 was used as the capture antigen. The insect cell expressed E2 provides proper refolding, post-translational modification, and oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which guaranteed the immunodominant epitopes of E2 protein exposed in their native state.</p><p id="Par41">The mAb 6B211 showed potent neutralizing activity against C-strain CSFV and bound to a specific conformational epitope on C-strain E2 protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b &#x00026; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). In addition, it showed very high sensitivity when tested by IFA (mouse ascites of 6B211 produced a strong positive fluorescence signal at dilution 1:16,000, data not shown). To test the hypothesis that neutralizing 6B211 can compete with C-strain induced neutralizing antibodies in pig serum to bind the capture antigen (C-strain E2), 445 C-strain VNT negative pig serum samples and 70 C-strain VNT positive pig serum samples were tested by the 6B211 based cELISA. The 6B211 based cELISA can effectively differentiate the C-strain VNT positive and C-strain VNT negative samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which indicate that 6B211 can compete with C-strain induced neutralizing antibodies from pigs and can be used as the competitive antibody for cELISA.</p><p id="Par42">By testing the pig sera in parallel and using mean PI of negative sera plus three SD as the threshold, the sensitivity and specificity of the cELISA were 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.87 to 100%) and 100% (95% confidence interval: 100 to 100%), respectively. The C-strain antibody can be tested in pigs as early as 7 DPV with the cELISA. The excellent agreement (Kappa&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.957, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) between cELISA and VNT, and the high correlation VNT (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.903) between inhibition rate in cELISA and VNT titers of tested samples indicate that the 6B211 based cELISA can replace the VNT for C-strain post&#x02013;vaccination monitoring. In addition, the intra-assay CVs and the inter-assay CVs of the 6B211 based cELISA (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) are lower than 10% when tested with the negative and E2 antibody positive pig serum samples, which indicate that the established cELISA is repeatable with acceptable variations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">Through the aforementioned experiments and analysis, we concluded that the mAb 6B211 based cELISA showed excellent agreement and high correlation with the VNT. This cELISA is a reliable, rapid, simple, safe, and cost-effective tool for sero-monitoring of C-strain vaccination at a population level. We believe that the cELISA presented in this study could be used to assist in CSF control and eradication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par44">Five female Balb/c mice (6&#x02009;weeks old) weighing between 22 and 25&#x02009;g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc.
