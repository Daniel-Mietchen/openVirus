  <title>Comparison of the temperature dependencies of sialidase activities of three influenza virus strains.</title>
  <p>The temperature dependencies of sialidase activities of three influenza virus strains were compared. Viruses and BTP3-Neu5Ac were diluted in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub>. An equal volume of virus suspension and 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac were mixed in a microtube followed by incubation at 37 to 70°C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate and fluorescence intensity was read with a microplate reader. Sialidase activity (%) was expressed as a percentage of the activity in the experiment conducted at 37°C. Each value is the mean and standard deviation from at least three independent measurements. Open circles, open triangles, and open squares represent A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, A/Memphis/1/1971, and B/Lee/1940, respectively.
