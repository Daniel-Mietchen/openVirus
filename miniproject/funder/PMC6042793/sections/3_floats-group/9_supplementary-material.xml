  <title>Evaluation of long storage stability of BTP3 fluorescence.</title>
  <p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was diluted with 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub> to prepare a suspension of 2
   <sup>4</sup> HAU and the sialidase activity was visualized by the BTP3-based filter method. Membranes of virus-loaded or blank samples were kept in the dark for 28 days. BTP3 fluorescence just after (Day 0) and 28 days after the BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction was visually compared under UV irradiation with a handheld UV flashlight at 375 nm.
