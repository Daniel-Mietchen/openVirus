  <title>Effect of calcium ion on viral sialidase activity and its enzymatic thermostability.</title>
  <p>(A) A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (open circles), A/Memphis/1/1971 (open triangles), B/Lee/1940 (open squares), and BTP3-Neu5Ac were diluted in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0) supplemented with 1.0 to 500 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub>. An equal volume of virus suspension and 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac were mixed in a microtube followed by incubation at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate and fluorescence intensity was read with a microplate reader. Sialidase activity (%) was expressed as a percentage of the activity in the sample with 1.0 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub>. Each value is the mean and standard deviation from at least three independent measurements. (B) Thermostability of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 sialidase was assessed in the presence of 1.0, 25, or 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub>. A virus suspension was reacted with BTP3-Neu5Ac as in (A) except for the setting of reaction temperature at 37, 50, or 60°C. Sialidase activity (%) is expressed as a percentage of the activity in the experiment conducted at 37°C. Each value is the mean and standard deviation from at least three independent measurements. Open circles, closed circles, and open rhombuses represent 1.0, 25, and 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub>, respectively.
