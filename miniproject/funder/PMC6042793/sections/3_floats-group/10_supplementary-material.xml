  <title>Viral sialidase activity after ultrafiltration with molecular weight cut-off filters.</title>
  <p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was diluted with 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub> to prepare a suspension of 2
   <sup>3</sup> HAU. BTP3-Neu5Ac was diluted in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub> to give a concentration of 200 μM. One hundred microliters of the virus suspension was loaded onto centrifugal filter units with different pore sizes (Nanosep® 30K Centrifugal Filter Device, Nanosep® 100K Centrifugal Filter Device, and Nanosep® 300K Centrifugal Filter Device, PALL Co., NY, USA), followed by centrifugation at 2,000 
   <italic>g</italic> for 1 min with the benchtop centrifuge. After centrifugation, an equal volume of flow-through and 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub> were mixed in the microtube and incubated at 56°C for 15 min with the dry heat block. One hundred microliters of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate, and fluorescence from sialidase reaction was quantified by the microplate reader. Sialidase activity (%) in the flow-through samples was expressed as a percentage of the enzymatic activity of 2
   <sup>3</sup> HAU A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1).
