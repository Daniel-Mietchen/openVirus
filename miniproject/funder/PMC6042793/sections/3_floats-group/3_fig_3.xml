  <title>Time course study and comparison of detection sensitivities in two experimental conditions.</title>
  <p>(A) A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 was incubated with 100 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac under two different experimental conditions: one is the original experimental protocol based on our previous reports (37°C incubation in the presence of 1.0 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub> at pH 6.0, closed circles) and the other is the optimized conditions (56°C incubation in the presence of 50 mM CaCl
   <sub>2</sub> at pH 6.5, open circles). Fluorescence of the sialidase product, BTP3, was expressed as RFU and plotted against incubation time. Each value is the mean and standard deviation from at least three independent measurements. (B) A two-fold serial dilution of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 was prepared and reacted with BTP3-Neu5Ac under the two different conditions described in (A) in microtubes. Fluorescent images of BTP3 were observed under UV irradiation at 365 nm. Samples were collected and transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate and fluorescence intensity was read with a microplate reader. RFU are indicated below the images of microtubes. Among the reaction mixtures, RFU of &gt;200 after blank subtraction were considered to be positive results. HAU of the maximum dilution at which the sample was positive was defined as the lower limit of detection. Red letters indicate HAU of positive results. (-) indicates BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction in the absence of a virus and was used as a blank.
