  <title>Sialidase inhibition assay of NAIs.</title>
  <p>Four clinical isolates, A/Shizuoka/17/2016 (H1N1pdm), A/Shizuoka/19/2016 (H1N1pdm), A/Shizuoka/30/2014 (H1N1pdm) and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 (H1N1pdm), were standardized to give equivalent sialidase activities. Forty microliters of the virus suspension in PBS was mixed with 5 μL of ten-fold dilutions of NAIs or distilled water alone on a 96-well microtitre plate. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. Five microliters of 1 mM 4MU-Neu5Ac was added on ice and then incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Enzymatic reaction for 4MU-Neu5Ac was stopped by 50 μL of 100 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 10.7). Fluorescence from sialidase reaction was quantified by the microplate reader with wavelengths of excitation and emission at 355 nm/460 nm for 4-metylumbelliferone. The concentration of NAI that reduced viral sialidase activity by 50% relative to a control mixture without NAI was determined as IC
   <sub>50</sub>. Percent inhibition of the sialidase activity at respective NAI was plotted against NAI concentration, and IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of NAIs were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). OV, PV, ZV, and LV represent oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir, respectively.
