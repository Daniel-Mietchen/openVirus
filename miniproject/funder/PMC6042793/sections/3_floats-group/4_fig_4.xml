  <title>Assay principle and detection sensitivity of the BTP3-based filter method.</title>
  <p>(A) A virus solution was loaded onto filter units followed by centrifugation (STEP 1). Then BTP3-Neu5Ac was directly added onto the filter membrane and the filter units were incubated at 56Â°C for 15 min with a dry heat block (STEP 2). After the reaction, crystalline BTP3 released from BTP3-Neu5Ac by viral sialidase activity was deposited on the membrane. Fluorescent images of BTP3 were visualized under UV irradiation with a handheld UV flashlight (STEP 3). (B) Two-fold serial dilution of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 was assayed by the BTP3 method and fluorescence intensity on the membrane was scanned with a microplate reader. RFU of &gt;2,000 were considered to be positive results. HAU of the maximum dilution at which the sample was positive was defined as the lower limit of detection. Red letters indicate HAU of positive results. Virus (-) indicates BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction in the absence of a virus and was used as a blank.</p>
