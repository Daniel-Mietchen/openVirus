<p>In the present study, we established a BTP3-based filter method that enables detection of influenza viruses and their NAI resistances in an easy, rapid, and sensitive manner. Using centrifugal filter units, virus concentration and sialidase fluorescence imaging can be done on a single membrane with simple two-step processes. Water-insoluble fluorescent BTP3, which is a sialidase reaction product of BTP3-Neu5Ac, is readily deposited on the surface of the virus-loaded membrane. Without the need for any dedicated apparatuses, green fluorescent images of BTP3 were easily observed by the eye under UV irradiation with a handheld UV flashlight (
