<p>Results obtained from the reaction at pH 4.0 that are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> seem to be useful as a negative control for influenza detection and a proof for the presence of false-positives in a sample. However, it is considered that pH 4.0 is not suitable for a negative control in detecting pandemic IAV or avian IAV because all the pandemic IAVs and almost all the avian IAVs maintained their sialidase activity at pH 4.0, while almost all of the seasonal IAVs and IBVs lost their sialidase activity irreversibly at pH 4.0 [

Under a pH 4.0 condition, an increase in the blank value occurs since the chemical binding between BTP3 and Neu5Ac is gradually cleaved and then fluorescent BTP3 is produced. If pH 4.0 is applied to the BTP3-based filter method, cleaved BTP3 would be deposited on a filter membrane and fluorescence could be observed even in the negative controls where viruses or
