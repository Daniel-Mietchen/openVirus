On the other hand, in the BTP3-based filter method, only cell wall-associated NanA activity could be detected on the filter membrane because secreted NanA, the molecular size of which is about 100 kDa, can easily permeate 300-kDa molecular weight cut-off filters. In our preliminary experiments, almost all of the sialidase activity (98.7%) was detected in a flow-through sample of
