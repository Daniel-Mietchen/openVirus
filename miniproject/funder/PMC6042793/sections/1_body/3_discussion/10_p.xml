<p>Commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits have been widely used in clinical practice for early diagnosis of influenza virus infection as POCT, providing results in 1 to 15 min [

Differential typing of IAV and IBV is possible in immunochromatographic kits. However, the clinical importance of IAV and IBV typing is unclear since NAIs are effective for both IAV and IBV. Although immunochromatographic kits are ready-to-use and involve an easy assay procedure without dedicated apparatuses, they have no ability to show viruses with resistance against NAIs. Besides, immunochromatographic kits are not suitable for high-throughput screening assays because the test device cannot handle a number of samples at the same time. The BTP3-based filter method would enable multiple sample handling and simultaneous detection of IAV and IBV with a single resistance against each NAI and double resistances against OV and PV or ZV and LV (
