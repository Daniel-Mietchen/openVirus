<p>ZV- and LV-resistant influenza viruses rarely emerge in nature. MuV and

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, which have no susceptibility to ZV and LV, can be discriminated from prevalent influenza viruses that are sensitive to ZN and LV. If a ZV- and LV-resistant influenza virus emerges in the future, such a mutant virus could also be differentiated from MuV and

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> by both susceptibilities of OV and PV. In such a situation, the BTP3-based filter method can be a useful tool for detection of influenza viruses with OV and PV resistances or ZV and LV resistances. However, ZV- and LV-resistant mutation can be accompanied by PV resistance. In the case of an influenza virus resistant against three NAIs (PV, ZV, and LV) or all four NAIs, the BTP3-based filter method cannot differentiate these influenza viruses from
