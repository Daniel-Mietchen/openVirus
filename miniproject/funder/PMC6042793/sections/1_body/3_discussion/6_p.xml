<p>When human specimens are tested in the BTP3-based filter method, sialidase activities of MuV, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, or HPIV-1 are predicted to be the main causes of false-positives for influenza virus detection. HPIV-1 is not a problem because of loss of its sialidase activity in the condition of pH 6.5 (

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> actually can become false-positive causes in the method. To discriminate influenza viruses from MuV and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, we compared NAI inhibition patterns in the method among influenza virus, MuV, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). MuV exhibited fluorescence for all of the NAIs, which showed no inhibitory effect on MuV. This might be due to the structural differences between influenza neuraminidase protein and MuV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein in accommodation of NAIs into the active sites. Together with such an MuV pattern in the BTP3-based filter method, the characteristic symptom of parotid swelling in MuV patients and epidemic information on MuV can also contribute to easy clinical diagnosis on MuV infection. 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> was susceptible only to OV and fluorescence was observed in the presence of the other three NAIs. This could be explained by the fact that glutamate residues that interact with a guanidinium group in PV, ZV, and LV structures are not conserved in NanA, the prime neuraminidase of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. In addition, the positively charged arginine residue at the 351 position of NanA extends further into the active site, thereby reducing the space available for the bulky guanidinium group [

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> sialidase activity. Since epidemics of a multi-drug-resistant influenza virus against all four NAIs or an influenza virus sensitive only to OV have not been reported in nature, for detection of currently prevalent influenza viruses, false-positives of MuV and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> can be ruled out by NAI inhibition patterns in the BTP3-based filter method. Abstracts of the interpretation of test results from the BTP3-based filter method are summarized in
