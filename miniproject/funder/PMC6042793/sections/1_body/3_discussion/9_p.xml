<p>To make sialidase detection with the BTP3-based filter method more specific to influenza virus, it is important to modify the Neu5Ac chemical structure to one that only an influenza sialidase can recognize. Introduction of a 4-guanidino group into Neu5Ac provides substrates with a highly specific property against influenza virus, and such a modification should also contribute to enhancement of the influenza specificity of the BTP3-based filter method. This has been confirmed by zanamivir, which is an Neu5Ac analogue with a 4-guanidino group. Indeed, ZstatFluÂ®-II, an influenza diagnostic kit that detects influenza sialidase activity, contains a 4,7-dimethoxy group in Neu5Ac of the substrate structure to improve influenza specificity [

We considered that modification of Neu5Ac in the BTP3-Neu5Ac structure is one of the effective means to achieve high specificity for influenza in the BTP3-based filter method. From this point of view, we have been studying another BTP3-based sialidase substrate with chemically modified Neu5Ac that is suitable for specific detection of influenza virus.
