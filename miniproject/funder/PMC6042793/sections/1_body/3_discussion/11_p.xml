<p>BTP3 fluorescence on the filter membrane is stable for a long time, making it possible to confirm test results of virus detection even several hours or days after termination of the sialidase reaction (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200761.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). By directly visualizing viral sialidase activity, the BTP3-based filter method is expected to make contributions to the detection of drug-resistant viruses with unknown mutations and to the decision of what types of NAI would best respond to such mutants without the need to optimize specific antibodies or primers required for immunochromatographic kits or RT-PCR. In a pandemic of an influenza virus with novel drug-resistant mutations, reactivity of antibodies in immunochromatographic kits may not be guaranteed and acquisition of drug resistance cannot be determined by RT-PCR due to the lack of information on drug-resistant viruses except for N1 and N2 influenza subtypes. In the future, even if drug-resistant viruses with unknown mutations become prevalent, their NAI susceptibility profiles can soon be analyzed by the BTP3-based filter method and then appropriate therapeutic intervention can be taken at the early stage of a pandemic or epidemic. Simultaneous diagnosis of drug resistance and determination of antiviral strategies should aid in the establishment of selection criteria for truly effective therapeutic drugs.
