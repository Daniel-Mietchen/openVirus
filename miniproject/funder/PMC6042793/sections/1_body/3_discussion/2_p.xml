<p>The activity and thermostability of influenza virus sialidase is known to be dependent on the presence of calcium ions [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As described in previous reports [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we confirmed a calcium ion concentration-dependent increase in sialidase activity of both IAV (H1N1, H3N2) and IBV. The temperature-activity profile of the viral sialidase revealed that in the presence of calcium ions, influenza sialidase was greatly activated at a high temperature of 56째C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Sialidase activities of MuV and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> were also detected at 56째C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This is the first report showing that native sialidase on the viral surface is thermostable at a temperature of 56째C and that the temperature invoking its maximum enzymatic activity is much higher than 37째C, which is generally thought to be the optimal temperature for mammalian enzymes.
