<p>In the BTP3-based filter method, OV-resistant strains, A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, showed highly fluorescent images in the presence of both OV and PV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). As expected, we were able to determine PV resistance in addition to OV resistance in these strains. Cross resistance against OV and PV was in good agreement with the results of a previous study showing that H275Y substitution neighboring the active site of IAV neuraminidase affects the interaction between the active site and a hydrophobic pentyl group commonly shared in OV and PV chemical structures [

PV-resistant viruses can also show resistance against ZV and LV because these NAIs have a guanidinium group that forms a strong salt bridge with glutamate residues at the 119 and 227 positions (based on amino acid numbering of human IAV N1 neuraminidase protein) [

 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Amino acid substitutions of these glutamates in combination with H275Y can confer a multi-drug resistance phenotype in IAV, but such cases are considered to be uncommon [

 <sub>50</sub> values of OV and PV for A/Shizuoka/30/2014 were 1.7- and 1.9-fold higher than those for A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200761.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Slightly stronger fluorescence of A/Shizuoka/30/2014 than that of A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 in the BTP3-based filter method with OV and PV seemed to be in agreement with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of OV and PV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating that the florescence image directly reflected the extent of drug resistance. Thus, the BTP3-based filter method can be used not only for screening of drug-resistant viruses but also for relative evaluation of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values among drug-resistant viruses.
