<p>RT-PCR is generally the most sensitive and specific method for detection of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive influenza viruses. Although RT-PCR offers valuable insights into the known genome sequence of drug resistance, this approach is not suitable for detection of drug-resistant viruses with unknown mutations and is limited to a genome sequence of interest targeted by specific primers. Moreover, differences in the degree of NAI susceptibility cannot be identified by RT-PCR if multiple mutations have accumulated within one influenza virus strain. As an alternative approach to assess influenza virus sensitivity to NAIs, the synthetic sialidase substrates 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-

 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-linked chemical binding in the substrate structure to release fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and chromogenic products from 4MU-Neu5Ac, NA-Star®, and X-Neu5Ac, respectively. Since sialidase activity of drug-resistant viruses hydrolyzes the substrates even in the presence of NAIs, the use of such synthetic substrates enables assessment of drug resistance and susceptibility. The use of sialidase substrates is more advantageous than RT-PCR because a sialidase activity-based reaction can be applied to almost all strains of influenza viruses and known/unknown drug-resistant mutations regardless of major antigenic changes or genomic mutations. However, enzymatic reaction processes require a long incubation period before the test results are obtained for all of the three substrates. The sensitivity of X-Neu5Ac is much lower than that of 4MU-Neu5Ac, NA-Star® and NA-XTD
 <sup>TM</sup>. Sialidase measurement with these substrates requires a dedicated apparatus for detecting fluorescence and chemiluminescence. In addition, fluorescence reaction of X-Neu5Ac with FastRed Violet LB is less efficient at pH of more than 5, which is the commonly used pH range for measurement of influenza sialidase activity [
