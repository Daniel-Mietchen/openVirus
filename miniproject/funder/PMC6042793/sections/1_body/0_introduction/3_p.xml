<p>Over the past fifteen years, multiple cases of mutant IAV and IBV that have acquired resistance against NAIs have been reported worldwide [

 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Sustained monitoring of drug-resistant mutants and providing updated surveillance information on drug resistance to medical professionals are crucial measures for appropriate use of NAIs. Assay methods capable of detecting drug-resistant mutants will be beneficial for determination of effective antiviral drugs in clinical settings, especially in countries where the emergence of mutants is a concern due to the widespread use of NAIs for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza infection. At present, although commercial immunochromatographic kits are used as a first-choice diagnostic for influenza infection, these kits cannot show if the detected virus strains have acquired drug resistance against NAIs.
