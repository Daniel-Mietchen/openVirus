<p>In a previous report, we described a new assay method for selective detection and isolation of an NAI-resistant IAV from live infected cells by reaction with BTP3-Neu5Ac in the presence of NAIs [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The time, work, and dedicated apparatus involved in this cell culture-based assay make it difficult for application of BTP3-Neu5Ac to a POCT kit for detecting NAI-resistant viruses in clinical practice and in hygiene surveys. However, it is expected that visualization of sialidase activity blotted on filter membranes with BTP3-Neu5Ac can be utilized as such a POCT kit. For the purpose of developing a BTP3-based POCT procedure to detect NAI-resistant viruses, we aimed to improve the sensitivity for detection of IAV and IBV by concentration of the virus by ultrafiltration with filter membranes and optimization of sialidase reaction conditions and to simplify the detection procedure, which would also shorten the measurement time. In the present study, we established an easy, rapid, and sensitive assay method that is suitable for a POCT kit for detection of NAI-resistant viruses. For two subtypes of IAV (H1N1pdm and H3N2) and two lineages of IBV (Yamagata and Victoria lineages) that have caused recent seasonal influenza epidemics, in addition to NAI-resistant IAV, detection sensitivity of the assay method was compared with that of commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits.
