<p>We have developed a novel sialidase substrate, BTP3-Neu5Ac, that enables an easy and rapid assay for sialidase detection [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. By sialidase reaction, water-soluble BTP3-Neu5Ac produces BTP3, which is a crystalline, water-insoluble, acid-resistant, and fluorescently stable compound (Ex/Em = 372 nm/526 nm). Although BTP3-Neu5Ac itself is not fluorescent, BTP3 is readily deposited in a location of sialidase activity, enabling fluorescent imaging of dot-blotted virus and virus-infected cells. BTP3-Neu5Ac can visualize sialidase activity blotted on filter papers or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes since water-insoluble BTP3 is easily concentrated on the membranes after sialidase reaction [
