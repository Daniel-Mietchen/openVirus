<p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was suspended in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0 or 6.5) supplemented with 1.0 or 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to adjust HAU of each virus to 2
 <sup>4</sup>. BTP3-Neu5Ac was diluted in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0 or 6.5) supplemented with 1.0 or 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to give a concentration of 200 μM. An equal volume of virus suspension and 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac were mixed in the microtube followed by incubation at 37°C for 10 min (pH 6.0) or 56°C for 15 min (pH 6.5) with the dry heat block. Fluorescent images of BTP3 were observed using a UV Transilluminator (UV BOX-W, NATURAL IMMUNITY, Tokyo, Japan) at 365 nm. One hundred microliters of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate, and fluorescence from sialidase reaction was quantified by the microplate reader. HAU of the maximum dilution at which the sample showed RFU (relative fluorescence units) of &gt;200 after blank subtraction were defined as the lower limit of detection.
