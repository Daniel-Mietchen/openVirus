<p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), A/Memphis/1/1971 (H3N2), and B/Lee/1940 were suspended in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0) supplemented with 1.0 to 500 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to adjust HAU of each virus to 2
 <sup>4</sup>. BTP3-Neu5Ac was diluted in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0) supplemented with 1.0 to 500 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to give a concentration of 200 μM. An equal volume of virus suspension and 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac were mixed in a microtube (0.2 ml PCR Tube with Flat Cap, Neptune Scientific, CA, USA) followed by incubation at 37, 50, or 60°C for 10 min with a dry heat block (MyMiniBLOCK, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). One hundred microliters of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate (Nunclon Delta Surface, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA), and fluorescence from sialidase reaction was quantified by a microplate reader (Infinite 200 multi-mode reader, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) with wavelengths of excitation and emission at 372 nm/526 nm for BTP3.
