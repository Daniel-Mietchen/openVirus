 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> were standardized as described in the ‘Effect of pH on viral and bacterial sialidase activities’ section. OV, PV, ZV, and LV were each diluted with 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to give a concentration of 2.0 μM. NAI-supplemented BTP3-Neu5Ac was prepared by mixing 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac and 2.0 μM of each NAI at a ratio of 1:1. One hundred microliters of the virus suspension or

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> suspension was loaded onto centrifugal filter units and centrifuged at 2,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min with the benchtop centrifuge. After centrifugation, 50 μL of NAI-supplemented BTP3-Neu5Ac or 100 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac was directly dropped onto the filter membranes. Then the filter units were incubated at 56°C for 15 min with the dry heat block. BTP3 deposited on the membrane was observed by the eye under UV irradiation with the handheld UV flashlight at 375 nm.
