<p>Viruses and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> were each suspended in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>. To give an equivalent sialidase activity between influenza viruses at pH 5.0, HAU of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), A/Memphis/1/1971 (H3N2), and B/Lee/1940 were adjusted to 2
 <sup>4</sup>. Under a pH 4.0 condition, the amounts of MuV, HPIV-1, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> were standardized to make sialidase activity equal to that of 2
 <sup>4</sup> HAU influenza viruses which was determined at pH 5.0. Then HAU of MuV and HPIV-1 were set at 2
 <sup>0</sup> and 2
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively. 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> was diluted to give 1.38 x 10
 <sup>7</sup> colony-forming units (cfu)/mL. BTP3-Neu5Ac was diluted in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to give a concentration of 200 μM. Equal volumes of samples and 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac were mixed in the microtube followed by incubation at 56°C for 15 min with the dry heat block. One hundred microliters of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate, and fluorescence from sialidase reaction was quantified by the microplate reader. For MuV, HPIV-1, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, sialidase activity (%) was indicated as a percentage of the enzymatic activity at pH 4.0. For IAV and IBV, sialidase activity at pH 5.0 was defined as 100%.
