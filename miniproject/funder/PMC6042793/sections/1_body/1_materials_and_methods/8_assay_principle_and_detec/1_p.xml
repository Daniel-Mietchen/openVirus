<p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was serially diluted with 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 100 μL of the virus suspension was loaded onto centrifugal filter units (Nanosep® 300K Centrifugal Filter Device, PALL Co., NY, USA) followed by centrifugation at 2,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min with a benchtop centrifuge (Micro Six, AS ONE, Osaka, Japan). After centrifugation, 50 μL of 100 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> was directly added onto the filter membrane and the filter unit was incubated at 56°C for 15 min with the dry heat block (BTP3-based filter method). After the reaction, BTP3 deposited on the membrane was observed by the eye under UV irradiation with a handheld UV flashlight (PW-UV343H-03L, KONTEC Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at 375 nm. Filter membranes were removed from the centrifugal units and inserted into a 96-well microtitre plate. Fluorescence intensity of BTP3 on of the membrane was quantified by a microplate reader (SpectraMax Gemini XS, Molecular Device, CA, USA) with wavelengths of excitation and emission at 372 nm/526 nm for BTP3. Upon reading, the multiple-point well scanning function (Pattern: Fill, Density: 3, Spacing: 1.1 mm, Total Points: 9) was activated and the average of RFU from nine different measurement points was calculated. HAU of the maximum dilution at which the sample showed RFU of &gt;2,000 were defined as the lower limit of detection.
