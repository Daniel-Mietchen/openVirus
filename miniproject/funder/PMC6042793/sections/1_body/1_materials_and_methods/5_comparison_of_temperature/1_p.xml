<p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), A/Memphis/1/1971 (H3N2), and B/Lee/1940 were suspended in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to adjust HAU of each virus to 2
 <sup>4</sup>. BTP3-Neu5Ac was diluted in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.0) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> to give a concentration of 200 μM. An equal volume of virus suspension and 200 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac were mixed in the microtube followed by incubation at 37, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, and 70°C for 10 min with the dry heat block. One hundred microliters of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtitre plate, and fluorescence from sialidase reaction was quantified by the microplate reader.
