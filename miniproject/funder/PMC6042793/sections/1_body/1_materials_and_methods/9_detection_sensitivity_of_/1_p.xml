<p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was serially diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and detected with 16 commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits according to the instructions of the manufacturer in order to compare detection sensitivities among these kits. Since ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N has been shown to be one of the most sensitive immunochromatographic kits for A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) detection, we selected ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N as evaluation criteria of detection sensitivity. Nine virus strains, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), A/Shizuoka/17/2016 (H1N1pdm), A/Shizuoka/19/2016 (H1N1pdm), A/Shizuoka/30/2014 (H1N1pdm), A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 (H1N1pdm), A/Memphis/1/1971 (H3N2), B/Lee/1940, B/Shizuoka/7/2014 (Victoria lineage), and B/Shizuoka/95/2013 (Yamagata lineage), were serially diluted with 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and assayed by the BTP3-based filter method. Fluorescence intensity of BTP3 on the membrane was quantified by a microplate reader (SpectraMax Gemini XS), and the maximum dilution at which the sample showed RFU of &gt;2,000 was defined as the lower limit of detection for the BTP3-based filter method. For ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N, viruses were diluted with extraction buffer of the kit. Twenty microliters of the sample was spotted on the test device and left for 15 min at room temperature. Test results were evaluated by the naked eye according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The maximum dilution required for a positive reaction was determined as the lower limit of detection for ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N. Detection sensitivity of each virus strain in the BTP3-based filter method was compared as relative ratio (fold change) of that of each virus with ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N.
