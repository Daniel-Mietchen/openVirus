<p>Cells were obtained from ATCC. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC-CCL-34) were grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). African green monkey kidney Vero cells (ATCC-CCL-81) were maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS. LLC-MK
 <sub>2</sub> cells (ATCC-CCL-7) were maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% FBS. IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was propagated in the allantoic sacs of 10-day-old embryonated eggs and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. IAV strain A/Memphis/1/1971 (H3N2) and IBV strain B/Lee/1940 were grown in MDCK cells. Mumps virus (MuV) was propagated in Vero cells. Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV-1) was propagated in LLC-MK
 <sub>2</sub> cells. Hemagglutination units (HAU) of the viruses were determined as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. HAU were expressed as the highest dilution of the virus suspension giving complete agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes. The IAV strains A/Shizuoka/17/2016 (H1N1pdm), A/Shizuoka/19/2016 (H1N1pdm), A/Shizuoka/30/2014 (H1N1pdm), and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 (H1N1pdm) and the IBV strains B/Shizuoka/7/2014 (Victoria lineage) and B/Shizuoka/95/2013 (Yamagata lineage) were provided by Shizuoka Institute of Environment and Hygiene. Both A/Shizuoka/30/2014 (H1N1pdm) and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 (H1N1pdm) strains have a hystidine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 275 (H275Y, based on amino acid numbering of human IAV N1 neuraminidase) in the neuraminidase.
