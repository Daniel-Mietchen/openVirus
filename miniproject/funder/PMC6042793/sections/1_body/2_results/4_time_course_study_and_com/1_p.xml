<p>We performed a time course study to determine the appropriate incubation time for BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Sialidase activity of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 produced BTP3 from BTP3-Neu5Ac in a time-dependent manner until 60 min of the reaction end point to reach maximum fluorescent intensity of BTP3. Since long testing turnaround time is not preferred in rapid laboratory diagnostics treating numerous samples and since almost all commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits generally set the testing period within 15 min, we decided to choose 15 min for BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction to provide a rapid assay procedure that is comparable to that of the immunochromatographic kits. In the present optimized experimental protocol with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (pH 6.5) for 15 min at 56°C, the sialidase activity (871 RFU) was 5.7-times higher than that (153 RFU) in the previous experimental protocol with 1.0 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (pH 6.0) for 10 min at 37°C. To visually assess detection sensitivity in the optimized conditions, two-fold serial dilutions of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 were incubated with BTP3-Neu5Ac at 56°C for 15 min. Fluorescence images were observed under UV irradiation and fluorescence intensity of each reaction was quantified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). HAU of the maximum dilution at which the sample showed RFU of &gt;200 after blank subtraction were defined as the lower limit of detection. The lower limits of detection in the present optimized protocol and the previous protocol were 2
 <sup>2</sup> HAU and 2
 <sup>5</sup> HAU, respectively. Detection sensitivity in the present optimized protocol became 8-fold higher than that in the previous protocol. However, we considered that detection sensitivity of 2
 <sup>2</sup> HAU was not a sufficient level because some commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits were able to detect HAU of less than 2
 <sup>−2</sup> for the same IAV (data not shown). Further improvement in detection sensitivity is required to achieve performance equivalent to that of commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits.
