<p>We investigated the optimal reaction conditions for sialidase activity to improve detection sensitivity of the BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction. Among divalent cations, calcium ion is essential for influenza sialidase activity and is responsible for thermostability of the enzymatic activity [

 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Optimization of the concentration of calcium ion and incubation temperature should increase the detection sensitivity of sialidase activity with BTP3-Neu5Ac. In order to examine the optimal concentration of calcium ion and the optimal temperature for BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction, we incubated IAV or IBV with 100 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac under varying conditions of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature. Sialidase activity was compared with that in the original experimental condition, 37°C incubation for 10 min in the presence of 1.0 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, as described in our previous reports [

 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Viral sialidase activity was increased up to 1.3 fold at 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To evaluate the thermostabilizing effect of calcium ion, we performed BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction at 37, 50, or 60°C in the presence of 1.0, 25, or 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>. Viral sialidase activity of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 markedly increased even under the condition of 60°C in a dose-dependent manner of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The results indicated that 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> was an optimal concentration for BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction and that a high incubation temperature was an important factor to achieve maximum enzymatic activity.
