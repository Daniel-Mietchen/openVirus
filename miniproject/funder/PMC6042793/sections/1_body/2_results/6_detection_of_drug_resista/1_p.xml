<p>Drug-resistant viruses can retain sialidase activity even with the amount of an NAI that inhibits sialidase activity of drug-sensitive viruses. We have reported selective detection and selective isolation of drug-resistant viruses at the levels of virus culture and infected cells by BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction in the presence of NAIs [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is expected that the BTP3-based filter method will also be able to detect such resistant viruses. Six IAV strains (including two OV-resistant strains) and one IBV strain were tested in the BTP3-based filter method (

NAI concentration in BTP3-Neu5Ac solution was set at 1.0 Î¼M because that concentration completely inhibited sialidase activity of drug-sensitive strains tested. In the presence of each NAI (OV, PV, ZV and LV), BTP3 fluorescence on the membrane was not observed without exception for A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, A/Memphis/1/1971, A/Shizuoka/17/2016, A/Shizuoka/19/2016, and B/Lee/1940. Conversely, A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 with the most prevalent OV-resistant H275Y substitution (based on amino acid numbering of human IAV N1 neuraminidase protein) exhibited strong fluorescence even in the presence of OV and PV during BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction (dashed red line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Indeed, the BTP3-based filter method was able to detect OV and PV resistances of OV-resistant IAV strains with H275Y substitution. These results suggest that in combination with NAIs, the BTP3-based filter method is able to clearly discriminate drug-resistant strains from drug-sensitive strains for respective NAIs.
