<p>As new NAI resistance of A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, PV resistance was detected in the BTP3-based filter method. We tried to confirm NAI resistances of these strains by 4MU-Neu5Ac used in the conventional method for NAI susceptibility. For A(H1N1pdm) clinical isolates, A/Shizuoka/17/2016, A/Shizuoka/19/2016, A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, the concentration of the four NAIs that reduced viral sialidase activity by 50% relative to a control mixture without NAIs was determined as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) (

 <sub>50</sub> values of &lt;1.0 nM for all of the NAIs. Two drug-resistant strains, A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, showed greatly increased IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for both OV and PV, which means 820 to 9730-fold reduced inhibition compared to the drug-sensitive strains.
