<p>It is expected that false-positives caused by HPIV-1 can be circumvented because of loss of its sialidase activity at pH 6.5. However, MuV and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> can be detected as false-positive because their sialidase activities can be detected under pH 6.5 (
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To distinguish between positive and false-positive reactions by NAI inhibition patterns, we investigated NAI susceptibility of MuV and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> in the BTP3-based filter method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). MuV was not susceptible to the four NAIs and showed fluorescence in the presence of all of the NAIs. Unexpectedly, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> was susceptible only to OV and showed fluorescence in the presence of PV, ZV, and LV. As expected for HPIV-1, there was no fluorescence in the presence of any of the NAIs and BTP3-Neu5Ac.
