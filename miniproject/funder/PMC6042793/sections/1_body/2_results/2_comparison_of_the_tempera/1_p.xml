<p>Although a high incubation temperature of 60°C contributed to a marked increase in sialidase activity and improved detection sensitivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), it has been reported that there were differences in the temperature-activity profile and thermostability between sialidase activities of IAV and IBV [
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Increased sialidase activity in a high temperature condition needs to be confirmed for IAV (H3N2) and IBV, as well as A/Puerto Rico/8/1934. In order to examine the optimal incubation temperature for BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction, we incubated IAV and IBV with 100 μM BTP3-Neu5Ac in the temperature range from 37 to 70°C in the presence of 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> for 10 min. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g002">Fig 2</xref>, within the range of 37 to 60°C, sialidase activity of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 was temperature-dependently increased, being consistent with the data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. On the other hand, for A/Memphis/1/1971 and B/Lee/1940, the sialidase activities were greatly decreased at a temperature higher than 58°C. These results suggested that 56°C, but not 60°C, was the most appropriate temperature to enable sialidase detection of both IAVs (H1N1 and H3N2) and IBV.
