<p>To improve detection sensitivity of the BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction, we aimed to establish a BTP3-based filter method in which molecular cut-off ultrafiltration membranes are used for virus concentration and on-membrane virus is detected with BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction. To select an appropriate filter pore size that can efficiently trap influenza virus particles, a A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 suspension was centrifuged with 30 kDa, 100 kDa, and 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off filters, followed by measurement of viral sialidase activity in the flow-through (

The absence of enzymatic activity in the flow-through after ultrafiltration indicates that almost all of the influenza virus particles were trapped on the filter membranes. For the BTP3-based filter method, the largest pore size of 300 kDa was selected due to efficient filterability of virus samples.
