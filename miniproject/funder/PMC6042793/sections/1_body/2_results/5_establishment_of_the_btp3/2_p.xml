<p>A detailed outline of the BTP3-based filter method is as follows. A virus solution was concentrated by 1-min centrifugation using the centrifugal filter unit with a 300 kDa molecular cut-off membrane, and the virus particles were trapped on the surface of the membrane. BTP3-Neu5Ac in 100 mM acetate buffer supplemented with 50 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (pH 6.5) was directly dropped onto the virus-trapped membrane followed by incubation at 56°C for 15 min with the dry heat block. Then water-insoluble BTP3 deposited on the membrane was visualized under UV irradiation with the handheld UV flashlight at 375 nm and fluorescent images were observed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. After the BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction, the filter membranes were removed from the centrifugal units and inserted into a 96-well microtitre plate. Fluorescence intensity of BTP3 on the membrane was quantified by the microplate reader. HAU of the maximum dilution at which the sample showed RFU of &gt;2,000 were defined as the lower limit of detection. The BTP3-based filter method successfully detected a 2
 <sup>−1</sup> HAU sample, which was hardly detectable in the experiment for which results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g003">Fig 3B</xref>. The minimum HAU detected in the BTP3-based filter method were proved to be 2
 <sup>−3</sup>. For A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, detection sensitivity in the BTP3-based filter method was 32-times higher than that in the present optimized protocol without centrifugal filter treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Next, we evaluated the detection sensitivity of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 by sixteen influenza immunochromatographic kits commercially available in Japan that do not need dedicated apparatuses. Among the kits tested, we singled out ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N, which was shown to be one of the most sensitive kits for A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 detection (data not shown). We compared the lower limits of detection of ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N and the BTP3-based filter method for IAV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and four H1N1pdm clinical isolates from the 2009–2016 influenza season) and IBV strains including Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Two-fold serial dilutions of the viruses were subjected to both ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N and the BTP3-based filter method. Both methods took 15 min for incubation. The lowest detectable dilution rate of the viruses for each method was measured and expressed as fold change compared to ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N (
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The lowest detectable dilution rate was 0.5 to 8-fold higher in the BTP3-based filter method than in ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N. Detection sensitivity in the BTP3-based filter method was equal to or higher than that in ESPLINE® Influenza A&amp;B-N for all of the strains tested regardless of IAV, IBV, virus subtypes, and lineages.
