<p>As the reaction pH was increased, sialidase activities of IAV, IBV, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> were elevated, while the sialidase activity of HPIV-1 was completely lost. MuV also showed a pH-dependent decrease in its sialidase activity, although it was still active at pH 6.5. These results indicated that false-positive reactions that might be caused by HPIV-1 could be avoided by selecting reaction pH of 6.5 without interfering with influenza sialidase activity.
