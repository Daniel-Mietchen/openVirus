<p>In addition to influenza virus, some paramyxoviruses and bacteria are known to possess sialidase activity. Among them, MuV, HPIV-1, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, all of which are human pathogens, express proteins with sialidase activity to facilitate budding of the infectious virions or infection to host cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0200761.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. MuV and HPIV-1 are known to coinfect with IAV, and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> is the most frequent coinfecting bacterium that causes morbidity and mortality in influenza patients [

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> can be causes of false-positive at diagnosis of influenza virus based on BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction. To discriminate influenza virus from possible false-positives in terms of reaction pH, we evaluated pH profiles of viral and bacterial sialidases (
 <xref rid="pone.0200761.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For MuV and HPIV-1, the pH value at which sialidase activity was maximum was 4.0 and the sialidase activities decreased in a pH-dependent manner. Conversely, for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, the sialidase activity exhibited 3-fold greater activation at pH 6.5 than that at pH 4.0. For IAV and IBV, the sialidase activities also increased in a pH-dependent manner.
