Immunochromatographic kits are useful for differential typing of influenza A and influenza B but cannot show if the detected virus strains have acquired drug resistance against neuraminidase inhibitors that target sialidase activity of viral neuraminidase. Although RT-PCR enables determination of drug-resistant mutants, its efficacy is limited to viruses carrying a known substitution in their neuraminidase genome sequence. In the present study, an easy, rapid and sensitive method for detection of drug-resistant influenza viruses regardless of major antigenic changes or genomic mutations was developed. By using the method in combination with virus-concentrated membranes in centrifugal filter units and a sialidase imaging probe, 2-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-bromophenyl-<italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (BTP3-Neu5Ac), sialidase activity of influenza neuraminidase was visualized on membranes by the green fluorescence of produced hydrophobic BTP3 under UV irradiation with a handheld UV flashlight. Fluorescence images in the presence or absence of neuraminidase inhibitors clearly discriminated drug-resistant influenza viruses from drug-sensitive ones. The assay can be done within 15 min. The detection sensitivity was shown to be equal to or higher than the sensitivities of commercial immunochromatographic kits. The assay will be a powerful tool for screening and monitoring of emerging drug-resistant influenza viruses and would help clinicians decide effective antiviral treatment strategies when such mutants have become prevalent.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Japan Antibiotics Research

Complications of influenza virus infection can result in viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, encephalopathy in infants, or sinusitis, which may lead to increased mortality, especially among people in high-risk groups [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Global spread of influenza virus affects up to 10% of the world&#x02019;s population annually and accounts for more than 15 million cases of infection. There are about 15,000 hospitalizations in one influenza season in Japan alone [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Seasonal influenza epidemics that are attributed to influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes of H1N1pdm (new H1N1 that emerged during the influenza pandemic of 2009) and H3N2 in addition to influenza B virus (IBV) occur every year despite the global availability of influenza vaccines. There is a possibility that a new subtype of influenza virus will infect humans and trigger a pandemic that may cause serious health problems with social and economic impacts. Since the first reported case of human infection with avian IAV (H7N9) in 2013, the number of patients with H7N9 infection has been increasing, especially in China [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This suggests the pandemic potential of new subtypes of human IAV that originated in avian IAV. Furthermore, if a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus spreads throughout the world, it could cause catastrophic pandemics due to its high mortality rate of approximately 60% [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, disease control with anti-influenza agents is of great importance for the prevention of potential pandemics. On the other hand, epidemic influenza infection, which is highly contagious, show rapid progression of symptoms, and has the potential to induce encephalopathy, especially in infants, should also be diagnosed at an early stage of disease onset and then appropriate medication with anti-influenza agents should be initiated as soon as possible [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Three classes of antiviral drugs have been shown to be effective against influenza virus infection: M2 ion channel blocker, neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI), and viral RNA polymerase inhibitor [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) exhibit antiviral activity against IAV alone by inhibiting proton channel activity of viral M2 protein that is essential for the uncoating process of viral internal proteins during viral cell entry [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since the majority of seasonal influenza viruses have already acquired resistance against M2 ion channel blockers, the use of these drugs for treatment of current IAV is no longer recommended [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. NAIs target sialidase activity of viral neuraminidase, which plays an essential role at the release stage of progeny virus from the cellular surface. NAIs suppress virus replication by inhibiting sialidase activity of neuraminidase proteins of both IAV and IBV [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Four NAIs, oseltamivir (OV), peramivir (PV), zanamivir (ZV), and laninamivir (LV), have been developed and their efficacy against influenza infection has been evaluated [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The first influenza viral RNA polymerase inhibitor, favipiravir, has been found to have potent and selective inhibitory activity against influenza virus through direct interference in replication of the viral RNA genome [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Japan, favipiravir has already been approved, but its use is permitted only when pandemic influenza viruses that are resistant to all of the conventional antiviral drugs have become prevalent. In the USA and Europe, favipiravir has been undergoing phase 3 clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, NAIs are <italic>de facto</italic> standard anti-influenza drugs for treatment of influenza patients.</p><p>Over the past fifteen years, multiple cases of mutant IAV and IBV that have acquired resistance against NAIs have been reported worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Sustained monitoring of drug-resistant mutants and providing updated surveillance information on drug resistance to medical professionals are crucial measures for appropriate use of NAIs. Assay methods capable of detecting drug-resistant mutants will be beneficial for determination of effective antiviral drugs in clinical settings, especially in countries where the emergence of mutants is a concern due to the widespread use of NAIs for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza infection. At present, although commercial immunochromatographic kits are used as a first-choice diagnostic for influenza infection, these kits cannot show if the detected virus strains have acquired drug resistance against NAIs.</p><p>RT-PCR is generally the most sensitive and specific method for detection of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive influenza viruses. Although RT-PCR offers valuable insights into the known genome sequence of drug resistance, this approach is not suitable for detection of drug-resistant viruses with unknown mutations and is limited to a genome sequence of interest targeted by specific primers. Moreover, differences in the degree of NAI susceptibility cannot be identified by RT-PCR if multiple mutations have accumulated within one influenza virus strain. As an alternative approach to assess influenza virus sensitivity to NAIs, the synthetic sialidase substrates 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (4MU-Neu5Ac) and 1,2-dioxetane derivatives (NA-Star&#x000ae; and NA-XTD<sup>TM</sup>) have been widely used in laboratory experiments [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For analysis of sialidase localization mainly in mammalian cells, the synthetic sialidase substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (X-Neu5Ac) and its fluorescing agent FastRed Violet LB (a fluorescing agent of X-Neu5Ac) have been used. Sialidase hydrolyzes <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-linked chemical binding in the substrate structure to release fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and chromogenic products from 4MU-Neu5Ac, NA-Star&#x000ae;, and X-Neu5Ac, respectively. Since sialidase activity of drug-resistant viruses hydrolyzes the substrates even in the presence of NAIs, the use of such synthetic substrates enables assessment of drug resistance and susceptibility. The use of sialidase substrates is more advantageous than RT-PCR because a sialidase activity-based reaction can be applied to almost all strains of influenza viruses and known/unknown drug-resistant mutations regardless of major antigenic changes or genomic mutations. However, enzymatic reaction processes require a long incubation period before the test results are obtained for all of the three substrates. The sensitivity of X-Neu5Ac is much lower than that of 4MU-Neu5Ac, NA-Star&#x000ae; and NA-XTD<sup>TM</sup>. Sialidase measurement with these substrates requires a dedicated apparatus for detecting fluorescence and chemiluminescence. In addition, fluorescence reaction of X-Neu5Ac with FastRed Violet LB is less efficient at pH of more than 5, which is the commonly used pH range for measurement of influenza sialidase activity [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Because of such characteristics, assays based on the synthetic substrates have not been used in point-of-care testing (POCT) kits.</p><p>We have developed a novel sialidase substrate, BTP3-Neu5Ac, that enables an easy and rapid assay for sialidase detection [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. By sialidase reaction, water-soluble BTP3-Neu5Ac produces BTP3, which is a crystalline, water-insoluble, acid-resistant, and fluorescently stable compound (Ex/Em = 372 nm/526 nm). Although BTP3-Neu5Ac itself is not fluorescent, BTP3 is readily deposited in a location of sialidase activity, enabling fluorescent imaging of dot-blotted virus and virus-infected cells. BTP3-Neu5Ac can visualize sialidase activity blotted on filter papers or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes since water-insoluble BTP3 is easily concentrated on the membranes after sialidase reaction [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. BTP3-Neu5Ac is applicable to sialidase-carrying viruses such as IAV, IBV, Newcastle disease virus, Sendai virus, human parainfluenza virus, and mumps virus [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>In a previous report, we described a new assay method for selective detection and isolation of an NAI-resistant IAV from live infected cells by reaction with BTP3-Neu5Ac in the presence of NAIs [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The time, work, and dedicated apparatus involved in this cell culture-based assay make it difficult for application of BTP3-Neu5Ac to a POCT kit for detecting NAI-resistant viruses in clinical practice and in hygiene surveys. However, it is expected that visualization of sialidase activity blotted on filter membranes with BTP3-Neu5Ac can be utilized as such a POCT kit. For the purpose of developing a BTP3-based POCT procedure to detect NAI-resistant viruses, we aimed to improve the sensitivity for detection of IAV and IBV by concentration of the virus by ultrafiltration with filter membranes and optimization of sialidase reaction conditions and to simplify the detection procedure, which would also shorten the measurement time. In the present study, we established an easy, rapid, and sensitive assay method that is suitable for a POCT kit for detection of NAI-resistant viruses. For two subtypes of IAV (H1N1pdm and H3N2) and two lineages of IBV (Yamagata and Victoria lineages) that have caused recent seasonal influenza epidemics, in addition to NAI-resistant IAV, detection sensitivity of the assay method was compared with that of commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Chemicals</title><p>BTP3-Neu5Ac was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan.

Sialidase activity of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 produced BTP3 from BTP3-Neu5Ac in a time-dependent manner until 60 min of the reaction end point to reach maximum fluorescent intensity of BTP3. Since long testing turnaround time is not preferred in rapid laboratory diagnostics treating numerous samples and since almost all commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits generally set the testing period within 15 min, we decided to choose 15 min for BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction to provide a rapid assay procedure that is comparable to that of the immunochromatographic kits.

We have reported selective detection and selective isolation of drug-resistant viruses at the levels of virus culture and infected cells by BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction in the presence of NAIs [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is expected that the BTP3-based filter method will also be able to detect such resistant viruses. Six IAV strains (including two OV-resistant strains) and one IBV strain were tested in the BTP3-based filter method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). NAI concentration in BTP3-Neu5Ac solution was set at 1.0 &#x003bc;M because that concentration completely inhibited sialidase activity of drug-sensitive strains tested. In the presence of each NAI (OV, PV, ZV and LV), BTP3 fluorescence on the membrane was not observed without exception for A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, A/Memphis/1/1971, A/Shizuoka/17/2016, A/Shizuoka/19/2016, and B/Lee/1940. Conversely, A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 with the most prevalent OV-resistant H275Y substitution (based on amino acid numbering of human IAV N1 neuraminidase protein) exhibited strong fluorescence even in the presence of OV and PV during BTP3-Neu5Ac reaction (dashed red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Indeed, the BTP3-based filter method was able to detect OV and PV resistances of OV-resistant IAV strains with H275Y substitution. These results suggest that in combination with NAIs, the BTP3-based filter method is able to clearly discriminate drug-resistant strains from drug-sensitive strains for respective NAIs.</p><fig id="pone.0200761.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0200761.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Detection of drug-resistant viruses in the BTP3-based filter method.</title><p>(A) 100 &#x003bc;M BTP3-Neu5Ac supplemented with or without 10 &#x003bc;M NAIs was added directly onto the influenza virus-loaded filter membranes.

For A(H1N1pdm) clinical isolates, A/Shizuoka/17/2016, A/Shizuoka/19/2016, A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, the concentration of the four NAIs that reduced viral sialidase activity by 50% relative to a control mixture without NAIs was determined as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200761.s003">S2 Table</xref>).

BTP3 fluorescence was stably maintained even after 28 days with no increase in background fluorescence.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we established a BTP3-based filter method that enables detection of influenza viruses and their NAI resistances in an easy, rapid, and sensitive manner. Using centrifugal filter units, virus concentration and sialidase fluorescence imaging can be done on a single membrane with simple two-step processes. Water-insoluble fluorescent BTP3, which is a sialidase reaction product of BTP3-Neu5Ac, is readily deposited on the surface of the virus-loaded membrane. Without the need for any dedicated apparatuses, green fluorescent images of BTP3 were easily observed by the eye under UV irradiation with a handheld UV flashlight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The BTP3-based filter method enabled influenza virus detection with a sensitivity equivalent to or higher than the sensitivities of commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits (<xref rid="pone.0200761.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and enabled simultaneous assessment of virus susceptibility to four NAIs.</p><p>The activity and thermostability of influenza virus sialidase is known to be dependent on the presence of calcium ions [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As described in previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we confirmed a calcium ion concentration-dependent increase in sialidase activity of both IAV (H1N1, H3N2) and IBV. The temperature-activity profile of the viral sialidase revealed that in the presence of calcium ions, influenza sialidase was greatly activated at a high temperature of 56&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Sialidase activities of MuV and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> were also detected at 56&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This is the first report showing that native sialidase on the viral surface is thermostable at a temperature of 56&#x000b0;C and that the temperature invoking its maximum enzymatic activity is much higher than 37&#x000b0;C, which is generally thought to be the optimal temperature for mammalian enzymes.</p><p>Sialidase activities of influenza virus strains are also known to have differences in low-pH stability in an acidic environment (pH 4.0&#x02013;5.0) [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and A/Memphis/1/1971 lost sialidase activity in an acidic condition of pH 4.0, while the activity of these two strains was stable even at 56&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g002">Fig 2</xref>). It is speculated that the steric structure of the influenza neuraminidase protein is affected by different mechanisms in low-pH and high-temperature conditions.</p><p>Results obtained from the reaction at pH 4.0 that are shown in <xref rid="pone.0200761.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> seem to be useful as a negative control for influenza detection and a proof for the presence of false-positives in a sample. However, it is considered that pH 4.0 is not suitable for a negative control in detecting pandemic IAV or avian IAV because all the pandemic IAVs and almost all the avian IAVs maintained their sialidase activity at pH 4.0, while almost all of the seasonal IAVs and IBVs lost their sialidase activity irreversibly at pH 4.0 [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Substrate stability in an acidic environment can be another problem. Under a pH 4.0 condition, an increase in the blank value occurs since the chemical binding between BTP3 and Neu5Ac is gradually cleaved and then fluorescent BTP3 is produced. If pH 4.0 is applied to the BTP3-based filter method, cleaved BTP3 would be deposited on a filter membrane and fluorescence could be observed even in the negative controls where viruses or <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> are not present. For the above reasons, we considered that pH 4.0 is not suitable as a negative control for the detection of influenza viruses and as a confirmation of all of the false-positives in this method.</p><p>In the BTP3-based filter method, OV-resistant strains, A/Shizuoka/30/2014 and A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, showed highly fluorescent images in the presence of both OV and PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). As expected, we were able to determine PV resistance in addition to OV resistance in these strains. Cross resistance against OV and PV was in good agreement with the results of a previous study showing that H275Y substitution neighboring the active site of IAV neuraminidase affects the interaction between the active site and a hydrophobic pentyl group commonly shared in OV and PV chemical structures [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. PV-resistant viruses can also show resistance against ZV and LV because these NAIs have a guanidinium group that forms a strong salt bridge with glutamate residues at the 119 and 227 positions (based on amino acid numbering of human IAV N1 neuraminidase protein) [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Amino acid substitutions of these glutamates in combination with H275Y can confer a multi-drug resistance phenotype in IAV, but such cases are considered to be uncommon [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The IC<sub>50</sub> values of OV and PV for A/Shizuoka/30/2014 were 1.7- and 1.9-fold higher than those for A/Shizuoka/1573/2009, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200761.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Slightly stronger fluorescence of A/Shizuoka/30/2014 than that of A/Shizuoka/1573/2009 in the BTP3-based filter method with OV and PV seemed to be in agreement with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of OV and PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating that the florescence image directly reflected the extent of drug resistance. Thus, the BTP3-based filter method can be used not only for screening of drug-resistant viruses but also for relative evaluation of IC<sub>50</sub> values among drug-resistant viruses.</p><p>When human specimens are tested in the BTP3-based filter method, sialidase activities of MuV, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, or HPIV-1 are predicted to be the main causes of false-positives for influenza virus detection. HPIV-1 is not a problem because of loss of its sialidase activity in the condition of pH 6.5 (<xref rid="pone.0200761.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, MuV and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> actually can become false-positive causes in the method. To discriminate influenza viruses from MuV and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, we compared NAI inhibition patterns in the method among influenza virus, MuV, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200761.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). MuV exhibited fluorescence for all of the NAIs, which showed no inhibitory effect on MuV. This might be due to the structural differences between influenza neuraminidase protein and MuV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein in accommodation of NAIs into the active sites. Together with such an MuV pattern in the BTP3-based filter method, the characteristic symptom of parotid swelling in MuV patients and epidemic information on MuV can also contribute to easy clinical diagnosis on MuV infection. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> was susceptible only to OV and fluorescence was observed in the presence of the other three NAIs. This could be explained by the fact that glutamate residues that interact with a guanidinium group in PV, ZV, and LV structures are not conserved in NanA, the prime neuraminidase of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. In addition, the positively charged arginine residue at the 351 position of NanA extends further into the active site, thereby reducing the space available for the bulky guanidinium group [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These are the reasons why only OV inhibited <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> sialidase activity. Since epidemics of a multi-drug-resistant influenza virus against all four NAIs or an influenza virus sensitive only to OV have not been reported in nature, for detection of currently prevalent influenza viruses, false-positives of MuV and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> can be ruled out by NAI inhibition patterns in the BTP3-based filter method.

ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the pH optimization experiment (<xref rid="pone.0200761.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), both the activities of cell wall-associated and secreted forms of NanA proteins could be quantified by mixing an <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> suspension with a BTP3-Neu5Ac solution in a microtube. On the other hand, in the BTP3-based filter method, only cell wall-associated NanA activity could be detected on the filter membrane because secreted NanA, the molecular size of which is about 100 kDa, can easily permeate 300-kDa molecular weight cut-off filters. In our preliminary experiments, almost all of the sialidase activity (98.7%) was detected in a flow-through sample of <italic>S</italic>.<italic>pneumoniae</italic> after 300-kDa molecular weight cut-off filtration. This means that only a small amount of cell wall-associated NanA was trapped on the filter membrane, which caused less efficient concentration of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> sialidase and resulted in a significant loss of fluorescence on the surface of the filter membrane.</p><p>ZV- and LV-resistant influenza viruses rarely emerge in nature. MuV and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, which have no susceptibility to ZV and LV, can be discriminated from prevalent influenza viruses that are sensitive to ZN and LV. If a ZV- and LV-resistant influenza virus emerges in the future, such a mutant virus could also be differentiated from MuV and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> by both susceptibilities of OV and PV. In such a situation, the BTP3-based filter method can be a useful tool for detection of influenza viruses with OV and PV resistances or ZV and LV resistances. However, ZV- and LV-resistant mutation can be accompanied by PV resistance. In the case of an influenza virus resistant against three NAIs (PV, ZV, and LV) or all four NAIs, the BTP3-based filter method cannot differentiate these influenza viruses from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> or MuV.</p><p>To make sialidase detection with the BTP3-based filter method more specific to influenza virus, it is important to modify the Neu5Ac chemical structure to one that only an influenza sialidase can recognize. Introduction of a 4-guanidino group into Neu5Ac provides substrates with a highly specific property against influenza virus, and such a modification should also contribute to enhancement of the influenza specificity of the BTP3-based filter method. This has been confirmed by zanamivir, which is an Neu5Ac analogue with a 4-guanidino group. Indeed, ZstatFlu&#x000ae;-II, an influenza diagnostic kit that detects influenza sialidase activity, contains a 4,7-dimethoxy group in Neu5Ac of the substrate structure to improve influenza specificity [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We considered that modification of Neu5Ac in the BTP3-Neu5Ac structure is one of the effective means to achieve high specificity for influenza in the BTP3-based filter method. From this point of view, we have been studying another BTP3-based sialidase substrate with chemically modified Neu5Ac that is suitable for specific detection of influenza virus.</p><p>Commercial influenza immunochromatographic kits have been widely used in clinical practice for early diagnosis of influenza virus infection as POCT, providing results in 1 to 15 min [<xref rid="pone.0200761.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The BTP3-based filter method can also provide test results within 15 min. Differential typing of IAV and IBV is possible in immunochromatographic kits. However, the clinical importance of IAV and IBV typing is unclear since NAIs are effective for both IAV and IBV. Although immunochromatographic kits are ready-to-use and involve an easy assay procedure without dedicated apparatuses, they have no ability to show viruses with resistance against NAIs. Besides, immunochromatographic kits are not suitable for high-throughput screening assays because the test device cannot handle a number of samples at the same time. The BTP3-based filter method would enable multiple sample handling and simultaneous detection of IAV and IBV with a single resistance against each NAI and double resistances against OV and PV or ZV and LV (<xref rid="pone.0200761.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0200761.t004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0200761.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the BTP3-based filter method and a commercial influenza immunochromatographic kit.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0200761.t004g" xlink:href="pone.0200761.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameter</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BTP3-based<break/>filter method</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Commercial influenza<break/>immunochromatographic kit</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Detection target</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sialidase</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral<break/>nucleoprotein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reaction time</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 min</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x02013;15 min</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of samples that can be<break/>tested simultaneously</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiple</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Detection of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive influenza viruses</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Differential typing of<break/>influenza A and influenza B</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>BTP3 fluorescence on the filter membrane is stable for a long time, making it possible to confirm test results of virus detection even several hours or days after termination of the sialidase reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200761.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). By directly visualizing viral sialidase activity, the BTP3-based filter method is expected to make contributions to the detection of drug-resistant viruses with unknown mutations and to the decision of what types of NAI would best respond to such mutants without the need to optimize specific antibodies or primers required for immunochromatographic kits or RT-PCR. In a pandemic of an influenza virus with novel drug-resistant mutations, reactivity of antibodies in immunochromatographic kits may not be guaranteed and acquisition of drug resistance cannot be determined by RT-PCR due to the lack of information on drug-resistant viruses except for N1 and N2 influenza subtypes. In the future, even if drug-resistant viruses with unknown mutations become prevalent, their NAI susceptibility profiles can soon be analyzed by the BTP3-based filter method and then appropriate therapeutic intervention can be taken at the early stage of a pandemic or epidemic. Simultaneous diagnosis of drug resistance and determination of antiviral strategies should aid in the establishment of selection criteria for truly effective therapeutic drugs.</p><p>The BTP3-based filter method involves neither expensive equipment nor advanced technological skill and can contribute to low-cost detection of influenza viruses with different NAI susceptibilities in a short laboratory turnaround time. In addition, this method is suitable for efficient analysis of numerous samples and is expected to be utilized in clinical and hygiene laboratories to differentiate and screen drug-resistant influenza viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0200761.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Evaluation of long storage stability of BTP3 fluorescence.</title><p>A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) was diluted with 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 6.5) supplemented with 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to prepare a suspension of 2<sup>4</sup> HAU and the sialidase activity was visualized by the BTP3-based filter method.
