It is important to follow up on these data in the future and analyze this aspect in more depth. Influenza vaccination as a preventive measure for all children from 6 months of age and, especially, for the youngest children, is a key measure that may benefit individuals and the whole population and has been shown to be a strategy with a good cost-effectiveness ratio

 </sup>. Currently, there seem to be no studies supporting the administration of influenza vaccine or antiviral treatment in children aged &lt;6 months, due to poor immunogenicity. Therefore, in these cases, to avoid maternal disease, women should be vaccinated during pregnancy, since this may transmit antibodies that protect newborns during the first months of life. Thus, it is essential to increase vaccination coverages in this group
