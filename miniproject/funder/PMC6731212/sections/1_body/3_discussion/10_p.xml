<p id="Par30">This study, like all descriptive studies, had strengths and limitations. The results provide a detailed summary of characteristics of children hospitalized with severe infection. The main limitation is that it is a retrospective study and it was not possible to collect more specific information about the clinical cases, such as fever, cough, wheezing, runny nose, odynophagia, malaise, vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
