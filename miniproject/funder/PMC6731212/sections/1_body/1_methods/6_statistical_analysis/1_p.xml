<p id="Par9">A bivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the type of influenza virus (A or B). Associations between clinical and epidemiological characteristics and influenza type were determined by calculating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusting by the population of each season. The differences between influenza A subtypes and influenza B were assessed using the Chi-square test. The statistical analysis was made using the SPSS version 24.0 statistical package and the R v3.5.0 statistical software.</p>
