Based on mouse transmission experiments, a proposed mechanism for immune evasion consists of increased avidity to host cellular receptors, mediated by electrostatic charge interactions with negatively charged cell surfaces. In support of this, the HA charge of the globally circulating H3N2 has increased over time since its pandemic. However, the same trend was not seen in H1N1 HA sequences. This is counter-intuitive, since immune escape due to increased avidity (due itself to an increase in charge) was determined experimentally. Here, we explore whether patterns of local charge of H1N1 HA can explain this discrepancy and thus further associate electrostatic charge with immune escape and viral evolutionary dynamics. Measures of site-wise functional selection and expected charge computed from deep mutational scan data on an early H1N1 HA yield a striking division of residues into three groups, separated by charge. We then explored evolutionary dynamics of these groups from 1918 to 2008. In particular, one group increases in net charge over time and consists of sites that are evolving the fastest, that are closest to the receptor binding site (RBS), and that are exposed to solvent (i.e., on the surface). By contrast, another group decreases in net charge and consists of sites that are further away from the RBS and evolving slower, but also exposed to solvent. The last group consists of those sites in the HA core, with no change in net charge and that evolve very slowly. Thus, there is a group of residues that follows the same trend as seen for the entire H3N2 HA. It is possible that the H1N1 HA is under other biophysical constraints that result in compensatory decreases in charge elsewhere on the protein. Our results implicate localized charge in HA interactions with host cells, and highlight how deep mutational scan data can inform evolutionary hypotheses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein of influenza A viruses evolves rapidly to evade host immunity, leading to sizable yearly epidemics in human populations. Previous transmission experiments with H1N1 in mice have tied immune escape to an increase in HA avidity for cellular receptors, mediated by electrostatic charge. Furthermore, retrospective sequence analyses from a previous study confirmed that the HA of circulating global H3N2 has increased in net charge, yet surprisingly, that of H1N1 has not varied significantly. How is a stable net charge related to local patterns of H1N1 HA charge in response to selection? To elucidate the role of local electrostatic charge in host-virus interactions, we investigate characteristics of local charge on the H1N1 HA using functional data from deep mutational scan experiments. Combining measures of functional selection and expected charge at each site on DMS data from a 1933 H1N1 HA yields a striking visual pattern that identifies three groups of sites that have different biophysical properties and that prove to have distinct evolutionary patterns in natural human sequences. Essentially, we find evidence for an increase in charge near the receptor binding site and for compensatory changes elsewhere on the protein. Thus, our findings may reconcile disparate results from transmission experiments and natural sequence analyses, and highlight the importance of local properties of the HA protein. Overall, our findings further support the hypothesis of immune escape due to increased HA avidity to cellular receptors mediated by electrostatic charge. More generally, our work illustrates a novel method of leveraging deep mutational scans in conjunction with natural sequences to shed light on virus-host interactions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1091919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grenfell</surname><given-names>Bryan T.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

IAVs are segmented RNA viruses, generally characterized by the two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Much of the acquired humoral host immune response to IAVs acts against the HA, which is responsible for cell entry. The HA consists of two subunits, HA1 and HA2, the former containing the receptor binding site (RBS) and exhibiting greater variation, while the latter is more antigenically conserved. Phylogenetically, HAs of IAVs form two monophyletic clades, known as group 1 and 2, and each group contains multiple subtypes, including the HA of H1N1 and H3N2, respectively [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These viruses evolve via two mechanisms. Strong selective pressures from the host immune system, combined with error-prone RNA polymerases, lead to seasonal variants of a given subtype emerging through &#x0201c;drift&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These yearly epidemics contrast to pandemics caused by a &#x0201c;shift&#x0201d; that occurs when IAVs of different animal species reassort, resulting in viruses with antigens to which the human population has little prior immunity [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>As antigenic drift is driven by selection pressures exerted by previously infected hosts, characterizing HA-antibody interactions is crucial to understand successful immune escape. Caton and coauthors [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] experimentally determined the regions on the H1N1 HA onto which antibodies bind, and grouped these residues into the Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb antigenic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Individual host immune responses to IAV infections are guided by infection history [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A key question is to determine the regions on the HA that are most targeted by antibodies. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays can establish an immunodominance hierarchy, indicating which sites are most strongly targeted by host antibodies. With the PR8 H1N1 strain in mice, Angeletti and colleagues [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] found this hierarchy to be Sb (highest), Sa, Cb, Ca2, and Ca1 (lowest). In humans and with the A/Michigan/45/2015 H1N1 strain, Liu and coauthors [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] concluded that Sb was the most immunodominant, followed by Sa, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb; Sb and Sa were significantly immunodominant in contrast to Ca1, Ca2, and Cb. In yet another study, Koel and colleagues [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used viruses with HA mutants to determine if single amino acid changes could lead to immune escape. These experiments identified sites near the RBS responsible for the strongest reduction in HI titers for H1N1 (before 2009). Furthermore, these results tie to statistical findings with H3N2 data which showed that, in contrast to known epitope designations, two residue-specific covariates were most important to explain dN/dS scores: These factors are a residue&#x02019;s distance to the RBS, in addition to its relative solvent accessibility which distinguishes surface versus internal residues [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi.1007892.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007892.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematic of host-virus interactions at the hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein.</title><p>(<italic>A</italic>) The structure of the H1N1 HA.

However, the role of molecular characteristics such as glycosylation and electrostatic charge in evolutionary dynamics have yet to be fully resolved [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Glycosylation is known to be involved in IAV evolution [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Kobayashi and Suzuki [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] examined net charge in the context of N-linked glycosylation patterns over time. Mechanistically, electrostatic charge may play an important role in biomolecular interactions between virions, host cells, and antibodies. Local charge could also be involved in HA interactions with host immunity. As the cell surface is negatively charged, an increase in net charge is posited to aid the HA in binding to the cell surface, and thereby lead to successful immune escape due to more efficient viral entry [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hensley and colleagues [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] illustrated the importance of HA avidity to the RBS in immune escape, and tied this to electrostatic charge by examining mutations leading to escape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the actual number of charged amino acids in H3 was shown to be greatest in the dominant epitope [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By considering the five charged amino acids and summing across IAV sequences, Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] found that the net charge of the H3N2 HA increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, no such increase was found for the H1N1 HA [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition to starkly contrasting with the results from natural sequence analyses with H3N2 HAs, these findings are particularly puzzling since the transmission experiments in mice by Hensley and coauthors [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] were with H1N1 viruses. Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] proposed other explanations to account for their findings: in particular, they highlighted the possibility that the observed trends are covariates of other, more important factors, or that immune escape could also be the result of other mechanisms.</p><p>Could patterns of localized electrostatic charge within the HA reconcile these findings? Perhaps the simplest explanation for the discrepancy between H1N1 and H3N2 HA net charge over time is that the H1N1 HA could be less tolerant to an overly positive net charge, and thus an increase in charge must be accompanied by a decrease elsewhere to keep the net charge relatively constant and preserve proper protein folding and function (more generally, for a discussion of charge and protein stability, see, e.g. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Here, &#x0201c;function&#x0201d; refers to cell entry and viral replication in the absence of immune selection. Therefore, this hypothesis would posit that while certain regions are under strong immune selection to become more positive (in agreement with the immune escape model of Hensley and coauthors [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), an additional selective pressure acts elsewhere to keep the net H1N1 HA charge constant (thus reflecting the pattern observed by Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). To investigate this hypothesis, local patterns in the HA charge must be examined. Yet, selection for immune escape may modulate residues independent of charge due to function. Thus, while it would be possible to simply group residues based on individual distance to the receptor binding site and to examine their local charge, such an approach would not appropriately account for the functional constraints (on individual residues) that were present from early on in H1N1 HA evolution. Here, we aim to separate local changes in charge due to protein function versus evolutionary pressures from host immune systems, and this requires estimates of local functional selection on the HA protein.</p><p>Recent developments in sequencing technologies have led to data-rich experimental studies examining protein evolution. To uncover the fitness landscapes of HA proteins in the absence of immune selection, deep mutational scans (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Araya and colleagues [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Doud and Bloom [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) can interrogate HA functional constraints in a site-wise fashion, yielding probability distributions for residue preference at each site, <italic>e.g.</italic>, for the HA of a particular H1N1 strain. Essentially, all possible &#x0223c;10,000 point-wise mutations of the HA protein of a particular background strain are constructed, and viruses with these HAs are then passaged in MDCK-SIAT1 cells at low multiplicity of infection [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Subsequently, the resulting samples are sequenced, and those viruses that were capable of cell entry and replication are over-enriched, whereas others that were not are depleted. Essentially, these data reveal mutational constraints of HA in a specific background strain, and can aid in discovering regions that are conserved in natural sequences due to viral function, instead of apparent conservation simply due to evolutionary history.</p><p><italic>What is the role of localized electrostatic charge on the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1 HA? Furthermore, can the characteristics of local charge explain the lack of increase in the HA net charge and thus give further evidence for immune escape due to increased HA avidity to cellular receptors?</italic> In this paper, we make use of deep mutational scan data on H1N1 1933/WSN to identify three groups of sites on the HA protein of H1N1: this classification reflects functional constraints (<italic>i.e.</italic>, purifying selection) in conjunction with the expected charge at each residue. While functional constraints on the H1N1 HA may shift over time, we identify groups of residues based on measures of per-site functional selection and expected charge on an early H1N1 strain, and examine how the charge of these groups has changed over time. We show that in natural sequences from 1918 to 2008, these three groups present different trends of net charge, with the notable finding that the group that is generally closer to the RBS, more accessible to solvent, and evolves the fastest, is increasing in charge. These results possibly implicate a role for the net charge of specific regions on the HA of H1N1 IAVs in evolutionary dynamics, particularly in the context of viral binding to the host cell surface.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Functional HA branches and net charge evolution</title><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2</xref> explores how functional selection and expected charge are related, and explores whether these measures can identify distinct groups of residues. By examining the relationship between functional selection and expected charge across the whole protein (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>), we identified three groups of sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). The first set, hereafter named the &#x0201c;negative branch&#x0201d;, exhibits a negative linear relationship between expected charge and functional selection (yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The second set, hereafter named the &#x0201c;positive branch&#x0201d;, mirrors the negative branch by having a positive linear relationship between expected charge and functional selection (light blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The last set, hereafter named the &#x0201c;zero branch&#x0201d;, has functional selection independent of expected charge which is clustered around zero charge (dark blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Thus, we have now grouped residues on the HA protein based on their functional constraints and charge implications, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2</xref> illustrates that the distribution of these groups are elaborate. These groupings thus serve as the basis for our further investigations into other properties of the residues in each group (<italic>e.g.</italic>

In particular, are there any distinct evolutionary patterns that could signal pressures exerted by host immune systems? Using available H1N1 sequences, we computed the net charge of these groups and examined their patterns over time (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>). From 1918 to 2008, the net charge of the negative branch has significantly increased over time (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). In contrast, the net charge of the positive branch has significantly decreased over time (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). The charge of zero branch does not appear to be changing substantially, though the very slight increase is significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0162) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This positive trend in the zero branch is likely due to two factors that are probably heavily tilting the linear regressions. First, there is an abundance of sequences in certain years compared to others, and second, the net charge on the zero branch is very close to zero and thus heavily influenced by single charged residues. In an effort to remove this source of bias, we performed the same analyses with yearly means, <italic>i.e.</italic>, net charge averaged for each year, and we found that the change in charge of the zero branch was not significant with yearly means (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0976) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we obtained analogous results for the positive and negative branches with yearly means (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s002">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Therefore, the evolution of net charge on the functional branches exhibits stark differences.</p><p>The sequence of the HA1 &#x0201c;head&#x0201d; subunit of the HA varies more than the conserved HA2 &#x0201c;stem&#x0201d;. In fact, the HA head is immunodominant and under stronger natural selection due to host immune pressures [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Examining per residue functional selection and expected charge for sites in each HA1 and HA2 reveal similar patterns, with HA1 exhibiting more pronounced division into functional branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>). Thus, we investigated the analogous patterns for these functional branches on the immunodominant HA head. Restricting our analysis to sites that belong to the HA1 subunit, the net charges of the negative and positive branches have significantly increased and decreased over time, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), just as when considering all HA residues. Also, a linear regression reveals a significant increase in the net charge over time for the HA1 sites in the zero branch, which is clearly increasing from a net charge of about 0 to about 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s003">S2C Fig</xref>). As before, we accounted for factors that are possibly affecting the regression by averaging sequences within each year. For these yearly means, the net charge of the HA1 zero branch does not vary over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s004">S3C Fig</xref>), whereas those for the HA1 negative and positive branches have significant trends matching our previous results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s004">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). As our sequences date from 1918 (compared to 1977 in Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]), we verified that there is no positive trend in net charge over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) and in fact found a slightly negative trend, but this trend is likely due to uneven sampling over time as it disappeared once yearly means were considered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi.1007892.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007892.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Characteristics of conservation and distance to RBS in each HA subunit.</title><p>(<italic>A</italic>) Conservation scores (labelled rate of evolution) per HA subunit, overlaid on the functional selection-expected charge plot.

Meyer and Wilke [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used statistical models of H3N2 HA data to show that distances to the RBS and relative solvent accessibilities (RSAs) of residues explained a significant fraction of the variance seen in evolutionary rates. On a coarse scale, our H1N1 HA analyses largely agree with these findings. With respect to distances of each residue&#x02019;s centroid to the centroid of the RBS, the negative branch has a significantly different distribution than either the positive or the zero branch (<italic>D</italic> = 0.28228 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001638, <italic>D</italic> = 0.24011 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.000219, respectively), but the zero and positive branch are not significantly different (<italic>D</italic> = 0.10263 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.3347) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), and these results also hold when only HA1 sites are considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g004">Fig 4B and 4F</xref>). For RSAs, the distribution of the zero branch differs significantly from the other two (<italic>D</italic> = 0.5672 for negative branch and <italic>D</italic> = 0.52792 for positive branch, giving <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> in both cases), and the distributions of the positive and negative branches are also significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g003">Fig 3E and 4F</xref>, <italic>D</italic> = 0.18629 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.03846).

The sites on the positive branch are generally further away from the RBS, but are also on the protein surface. Lastly, the sites on the zero branch are further away from the RBS, and are more likely to be internal residues. As a form of control to our study, we performed the same analyses with TEM-1 beta-lactamase (<italic>i.e.</italic>, not under similar immune selection), to see if the three branches due to functional selection and expected charge are conserved on such a different protein. Importantly, the underlying shape of the data mapped on the functional selection and expected charge axes is quite different from that of the H1N1 HA. Indeed, beta-lactamase appears to possess a very different pattern from that of H1N1 HA, with a clear absence of positive or negative branches.

Using unscaled selection coefficients and expected charge values at each residue, we used Ward&#x02019;s method [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in R [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] but with Euclidean distance (between residues on the selection&#x02013;charge plane) instead of its square as a distance measure. Among all possibilities, we used this clustering method since it accurately discriminates the three branches that are visually striking. Murtagh and Legendre [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] show that this distance metric is distinct from that described by Ward [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but nevertheless it is better at detecting the three branches here, and so we used it to investigate the characteristics on the branches and to show robustness of our results with an alternative to visual grouping. The separation into the three branches is largely consistent with our initial classification. However, the positive branch contains most of the sites that are at the base of the three branches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). Detailed analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s010">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s011">S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s012">S11</xref> Figs. In essence, we found a similar clustering to our more subjective methods. There are subtle differences, but these do not affect the qualitative results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>Discussion</title><p>Transmission studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and natural sequence analyses [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] for H1N1 HA give seemingly contrasting evidence on the role of electrostatic charge on IAV evolution. Indeed, Hensley and colleagues [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] demonstrated that successful immune escape was driven by increased HA H1N1 avidity and mediated by increases in electrostatic charge. Yet, Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] found that the H3N2 HA has increased in net charge since 1968, whereas the H1N1 HA has had no appreciable change. To reconcile the very different H1N1 and H3N2 charge trajectories, we investigated the hypothesis that local charge is more germane than global charge for evolutionary dynamics. Moreover, this hypothesis would imply that differences in global patterns of H1N1 and H3N2 HA simply reflect disparities in net charge constraints, instead of contrasting evolutionary pressures. Local charge in natural sequences reflects a combination of functional constraints and evolutionary pressures from host immunity. To isolate these confounding factors and remove bias due to functional constraints, partitioning of residues into functional patches requires per-residue selection experiments in the absence of immune selection on an early H1N1 strain. Constraints of functional relevance for the H1N1 HA are quantified in DMS data for an H1N1 HA from 1933 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By leveraging these data, we found patches on the HA with distinct evolutionary patterns in natural sequences. It should be noted that, due to evolution, similar functional experiments with more recent H1N1 HAs could reveal different groups of residues. However, our analyses require an early H1N1 HA to properly characterize the starting landscape and enable us to appropriately determine the net charge patterns of these patches afterwards.</p><p>What are the characteristics of localized electrostatic charge in the H1N1 HA protein evolutionary patterns? Through measures of site-wise functional selection and expected charge obtained from DMS data, we identified three distinct branches of residues. On these &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;zero&#x0201d; branches, functional selection and expected charge are positively correlated, negatively correlated, and independent of each other, respectively. The negative branch consists of residues that are the closest to the RBS, have high RSAs, and evolve the fastest. The positive branch has residues that are similarly surface exposed, but are further from the RBS and evolve slower. Lastly, the residues in the zero branch are those that are buried in the core of the protein, are also far from the RBS, and evolve the slowest. Intriguingly, the net charge of the negative branch has been increasing over time, whereas that of the positive and zero branches have been decreasing and constant, respectively. Importantly, multinomial logistic regression models for the dynamics of individual residue charge reveal that individual sites in the positive and negative branches are not each evolving toward an intermediate &#x0201c;zero&#x0201d; charge.</p><p>Why are there contrasting net charge patterns for each branch over time, in conjunction with differing rates of evolution? These results could imply the following: as the positive branch evolves more slowly than its negative counterpart, it is possible that the decrease in net charge over time seen in the positive branch is in response to an increase in net charge over time of the negative branch. Our results also indicate that the sites in the zero branch are highly conserved on average, that their net charge does not vary significantly over time, and that their site-wise fitted observed charge is generally zero.</p><p>In the context that the overall net charge of the HA for H1N1 viruses in humans has not increased over time [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], these results indicate that more localized charge may also be important in viral evolution. In fact, by considering those sites in the negative branch and thus closer to the RBS, the increase in net charge over time is likely due in part to the negative charge of the cell surface. An increase in net charge for this group that is nearest to the RBS could facilitate HA interactions with the negatively charged host cell surface. Furthermore, since the negative branch contains more sites that are evolving rapidly, this branch is probably immunodominant in comparison with the other two branches. Therefore, there is an apparent asymmetry between the positive and negative branches that is not revealed by functional selection experiments. This asymmetry could be possibly explained either by an intrinsic molecular property of the HA, or could result from host interactions. Indeed, it is thus possible that charge imposes constraints on these evolving viruses, or immune selection could impose such an asymmetry.</p><p>Perhaps the discrepancy between H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in the net charge patterns of HAs is simply a reflection of different constraints on HA biophysical factors such as stability, instead of a fundamental difference in the role of electrostatic charge in virion-host cell interactions between these two subtypes. In particular, it may be that the H1N1 HA is less tolerant to charge imbalances than the H3N2 HA, and therefore if a set of sites in the H1N1 HA is under pressure to become more positively charged, other sites must become more negatively charged in counterbalance. Deep mutational scans on H1N1 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and H3N2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] indicate that the H3N2 HA has a different mutational tolerance profile in comparison to the H1N1 HA. Further experiments should examine and quantify differences in tolerance to charge imbalance for H1N1 and H3N2 HAs to investigate the hypothesis of different tolerances to charge imbalance in these HAs. Furthermore, in natural sequences, H1N1 antigenic evolution is not as rapid as H3N2 antigenic evolution [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and could indicate some differing constraints.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the observed differences in H1N1 and H3N2 HAs is that H3N2 and H1N1 virions have different NAs. Specifically, it is possible that having an increasingly positive HA could make it more difficult for NA to cleave new viruses from the cell, and it could be that the H3N2 NA protein is more tolerant of this than the H1N1 NA. To investigate this possibility and quantify the co-evolution of HA and NA charge, a combination of experiments and analyses of natural sequences are required.</p><p>However, it is possible that the patterns we see are due to other processes, or are simply covariates of other variables that we did not examine. Our inferences from the patterns of charge over time is limited, due to the fact that our study is retrospective and relies upon collected natural sequences of H1N1. The remarkable separation of residues into three branches, based on functional selection and expected charge, should be examined further. With H3N2 data, the separation into three branches is not as clear, and could be due to different relative mutational tolerances in the HA [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, explorations of HA localized charge for this subtype are not as crucial, as the net charge of the whole H3N2 HA was found to increase over time [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Echoing Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], further experiments will be needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved in these processes, and to determine the role of electrostatic charge. Beyond H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, numerous subtypes of influenza circulate or have circulated among a variety of hosts. Analyses that examine the role of local charge could reveal unifying themes, with potential relevance for zoonosis and pandemic preparedness. Such analyses would require subtype-specific DMS data, in conjunction with temporally detailed natural sequences for specific hosts, and these analyses may become feasible with growing data availability.</p><p>Experiments to probe the mechanisms that give rise to patterns of charge could then guide informed decisions about vaccine design. The importance of these decisions, based on electrostatic interactions at the molecular level, would be especially relevant in the quest for broadly protective vaccines [<xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Preliminarily, our results might indicate that possible mechanisms for disease control could be to either limit the possibility of the negative branch increasing in charge, or, alternatively, limit the possibility of the positive branch decreasing in charge. Either of these options would require rational vaccine design, hopefully eliciting broadly cross-reactive antibodies.</p><p>Furthermore, understanding how functional selection and expected charge co-vary for different pathogens&#x02019; proteins under immune selection could help characterize, quantify, and generalize the role of charge in evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. Quantifying these properties for other proteins is also important, and we showed that beta-lactamase protein gives rise to different patterns than the H1N1 HA. Given this stark contrast, it is possible that the pattern seen for the H1N1 HA is the result of evolution due to immune selection. If this is the case, signatures of evolutionary pressures on other proteins could be detected by functional selection and charge. Thus, independent of the specifics of a particular protein, a &#x0201c;null&#x0201d; distribution of sites according to functional selection and expected charge would be quite valuable in principle. However, such a distribution would be very difficult to obtain. This would require understanding which random sequences of amino acids can properly fold, and with these, perform DMS experiments to quantify amino acid preferences at each site.</p><p>It is striking that simple measures of functional selection and expected charge are able to discriminate sites that have higher evolutionary rates, particularly when these measures are independent of antibody interactions and are based solely upon cell entry and viral replication. That these sites then show an increase in net charge over time is even more intriguing. Overall, our results possibly implicate localized charge on the HA protein in evolutionary dynamics, particularly in HA-cell host interactions. We could speculate that certain regions on the HA protein could be under pressure to gain charge in order to facilitate attachment to the cell surface, whereas others would be under pressure to decrease in charge in response to such an increase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Deep mutational scan (DMS) data</title><p>The DMS generates amino acid preferences for each site, which are normalized enrichment.
