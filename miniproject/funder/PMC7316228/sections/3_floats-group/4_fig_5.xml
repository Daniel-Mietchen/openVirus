  <title>Fitted observed charge in 1918, 1948, 1978, and 2008 computed from fitted per-site multinomial logistic regression models.</title>
  <p>These models were fitted using nnet [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in R [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>). All 1744 human HA H1N1 sequences between 1918 and 2008 from fludb [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] were used to fit these statistical models. The arrow is used to highlight sites in the negative branch that are transitioning to positive values.
