  <title>Characteristics of conservation and distance to RBS in each HA subunit.</title>
  <p>(
   <italic>A</italic>) Conservation scores (labelled rate of evolution) per HA subunit, overlaid on the functional selection-expected charge plot. These scores were obtained from the Rate4Site algorithm [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] using H1N1 sequences obtained from the IRD fludb database [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>). As in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, note that higher scores indicate higher rate of evolution. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Distances to the RBS per HA subunit, overlaid on the functional selection-expected charge plot. These distances were calculated using RBS annotations according to Gamblin and colleagues [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] using PyMOL [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>). (
   <italic>C) and (D) are as in (A) and (B), respectively, but for the HA2 subunit.</italic> (
   <italic>E</italic>) Empirical cumulative distribution of evolutionary rates of each branch separated by domain. (
   <italic>F</italic>) Empirical cumulative distribution of distance to RBS, separated by both branch and domain.
