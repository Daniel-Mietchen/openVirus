  <title>Evolutionary rates, relative solvent accessibility (RSA), and distances to receptor binding site (RBS) on functional branches.</title>
  <p>(
   <italic>A</italic>) Normalized conservation scores (labelled rate of evolution) per site overlaid on the functional selection-expected charge plot. These conservation scores were obtained from Rate4site [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with H1N1 sequences from the fludb database of the IRD [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A higher score indicates lower conservation and faster evolution. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Empirical cumulative distributions of conservation scores for each of the three branches. (
   <italic>C</italic>) Distances to the RBS overlaid on the functional selection-expected charge plot. These distances were calculated using PyMOL [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>) (
   <italic>D</italic>) Empirical cumulative distributions of the distance to the RBS for each of the three branches. (
   <italic>E</italic>) Relative solvent accessibility overlaid on the functional selection-expected charge plot. These scores were computed using dmstools2 [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (see
