  <title>Yearly means of net charge over time in negative (
   <italic>A</italic>), positive (
   <italic>B</italic>), and zero (
   <italic>C</italic>) branches.
  </title>
  <p>This figure is just as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A</xref> of the main text, but employing yearly means instead of all sequences. Here, yearly means are averages of the charge of all sequences in a given year, giving a single charge value for each year that at least one sequence is available. This approach minimizes any potential biases introduced due to uneven sampling in different years.
