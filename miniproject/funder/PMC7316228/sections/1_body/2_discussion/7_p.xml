<p>However, it is possible that the patterns we see are due to other processes, or are simply covariates of other variables that we did not examine. Our inferences from the patterns of charge over time is limited, due to the fact that our study is retrospective and relies upon collected natural sequences of H1N1. The remarkable separation of residues into three branches, based on functional selection and expected charge, should be examined further. With H3N2 data, the separation into three branches is not as clear, and could be due to different relative mutational tolerances in the HA [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, explorations of HA localized charge for this subtype are not as crucial, as the net charge of the whole H3N2 HA was found to increase over time [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], further experiments will be needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms involved in these processes, and to determine the role of electrostatic charge. Beyond H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, numerous subtypes of influenza circulate or have circulated among a variety of hosts. Analyses that examine the role of local charge could reveal unifying themes, with potential relevance for zoonosis and pandemic preparedness. Such analyses would require subtype-specific DMS data, in conjunction with temporally detailed natural sequences for specific hosts, and these analyses may become feasible with growing data availability.
