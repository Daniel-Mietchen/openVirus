<p>Another possible explanation for the observed differences in H1N1 and H3N2 HAs is that H3N2 and H1N1 virions have different NAs. Specifically, it is possible that having an increasingly positive HA could make it more difficult for NA to cleave new viruses from the cell, and it could be that the H3N2 NA protein is more tolerant of this than the H1N1 NA. To investigate this possibility and quantify the co-evolution of HA and NA charge, a combination of experiments and analyses of natural sequences are required.</p>
