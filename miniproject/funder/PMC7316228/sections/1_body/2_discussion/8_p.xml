<p>Experiments to probe the mechanisms that give rise to patterns of charge could then guide informed decisions about vaccine design. The importance of these decisions, based on electrostatic interactions at the molecular level, would be especially relevant in the quest for broadly protective vaccines [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Preliminarily, our results might indicate that possible mechanisms for disease control could be to either limit the possibility of the negative branch increasing in charge, or, alternatively, limit the possibility of the positive branch decreasing in charge. Either of these options would require rational vaccine design, hopefully eliciting broadly cross-reactive antibodies.
