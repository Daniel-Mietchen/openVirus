<p>What are the characteristics of localized electrostatic charge in the H1N1 HA protein evolutionary patterns? Through measures of site-wise functional selection and expected charge obtained from DMS data, we identified three distinct branches of residues. On these “negative”, “positive”, and “zero” branches, functional selection and expected charge are positively correlated, negatively correlated, and independent of each other, respectively. The negative branch consists of residues that are the closest to the RBS, have high RSAs, and evolve the fastest. The positive branch has residues that are similarly surface exposed, but are further from the RBS and evolve slower. Lastly, the residues in the zero branch are those that are buried in the core of the protein, are also far from the RBS, and evolve the slowest. Intriguingly, the net charge of the negative branch has been increasing over time, whereas that of the positive and zero branches have been decreasing and constant, respectively. Importantly, multinomial logistic regression models for the dynamics of individual residue charge reveal that individual sites in the positive and negative branches are not each evolving toward an intermediate “zero” charge.</p>
