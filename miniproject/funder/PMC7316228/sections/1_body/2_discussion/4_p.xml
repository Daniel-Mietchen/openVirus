<p>In the context that the overall net charge of the HA for H1N1 viruses in humans has not increased over time [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], these results indicate that more localized charge may also be important in viral evolution. In fact, by considering those sites in the negative branch and thus closer to the RBS, the increase in net charge over time is likely due in part to the negative charge of the cell surface. An increase in net charge for this group that is nearest to the RBS could facilitate HA interactions with the negatively charged host cell surface. Furthermore, since the negative branch contains more sites that are evolving rapidly, this branch is probably immunodominant in comparison with the other two branches. Therefore, there is an apparent asymmetry between the positive and negative branches that is not revealed by functional selection experiments. This asymmetry could be possibly explained either by an intrinsic molecular property of the HA, or could result from host interactions. Indeed, it is thus possible that charge imposes constraints on these evolving viruses, or immune selection could impose such an asymmetry.
