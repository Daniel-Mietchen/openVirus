<p>Furthermore, understanding how functional selection and expected charge co-vary for different pathogens’ proteins under immune selection could help characterize, quantify, and generalize the role of charge in evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. Quantifying these properties for other proteins is also important, and we showed that beta-lactamase protein gives rise to different patterns than the H1N1 HA. Given this stark contrast, it is possible that the pattern seen for the H1N1 HA is the result of evolution due to immune selection. If this is the case, signatures of evolutionary pressures on other proteins could be detected by functional selection and charge. Thus, independent of the specifics of a particular protein, a “null” distribution of sites according to functional selection and expected charge would be quite valuable in principle. However, such a distribution would be very difficult to obtain. This would require understanding which random sequences of amino acids can properly fold, and with these, perform DMS experiments to quantify amino acid preferences at each site.</p>
