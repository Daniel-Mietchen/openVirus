<p>For our sequence analyses with H1N1 between 1918 to 2008, we obtained all available 1744 H1 sequences in human hosts from 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fludb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.fludb.org</ext-link>, of the Influenza Research Database (IRD) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and aligned these using MUSCLE in fludb. For net charge computations, we again followed Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. That is, we summed the individual charges of amino acids across the alignments, where Arginine, Histidine, and Lysine have a charge of 1, Aspartic acid and Glutamic acid have a charge of âˆ’1, and all other amino acids have a charge of 0. Given ambiguous amino acids (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, X, B, Z) in a particular sequence, we assumed that the indicated respective choices of residues at that site were uniformly distributed and computed the expected charge at that site for that sequence. These temporal trends, along with other graphs, were visualized with the ggplot2 package [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] of R [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
