<p>Having identified these groups, we then explored how the charges of these branches individually evolve over time. In particular, are there any distinct evolutionary patterns that could signal pressures exerted by host immune systems? Using available H1N1 sequences, we computed the net charge of these groups and examined their patterns over time (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>). From 1918 to 2008, the net charge of the negative branch has significantly increased over time (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16</sup>). In contrast, the net charge of the positive branch has significantly decreased over time (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16</sup>). The charge of zero branch does not appear to be changing substantially, though the very slight increase is significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0162) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This positive trend in the zero branch is likely due to two factors that are probably heavily tilting the linear regressions. First, there is an abundance of sequences in certain years compared to others, and second, the net charge on the zero branch is very close to zero and thus heavily influenced by single charged residues. In an effort to remove this source of bias, we performed the same analyses with yearly means, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, net charge averaged for each year, and we found that the change in charge of the zero branch was not significant with yearly means (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0976) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s002">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Therefore, the evolution of net charge on the functional branches exhibits stark differences.
