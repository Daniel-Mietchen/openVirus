<p>The sequence of the HA1 “head” subunit of the HA varies more than the conserved HA2 “stem”. In fact, the HA head is immunodominant and under stronger natural selection due to host immune pressures [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Examining per residue functional selection and expected charge for sites in each HA1 and HA2 reveal similar patterns, with HA1 exhibiting more pronounced division into functional branches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g004">Fig 4A and 4C</xref>). Thus, we investigated the analogous patterns for these functional branches on the immunodominant HA head. Restricting our analysis to sites that belong to the HA1 subunit, the net charges of the negative and positive branches have significantly increased and decreased over time, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), just as when considering all HA residues. Also, a linear regression reveals a significant increase in the net charge over time for the HA1 sites in the zero branch, which is clearly increasing from a net charge of about 0 to about 2 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s003">S2C Fig</xref>). As before, we accounted for factors that are possibly affecting the regression by averaging sequences within each year. For these yearly means, the net charge of the HA1 zero branch does not vary over time (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s004">S3C Fig</xref>), whereas those for the HA1 negative and positive branches have significant trends matching our previous results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s004">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). As our sequences date from 1918 (compared to 1977 in Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]), we verified that there is no positive trend in net charge over time (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) and in fact found a slightly negative trend, but this trend is likely due to uneven sampling over time as it disappeared once yearly means were considered (
