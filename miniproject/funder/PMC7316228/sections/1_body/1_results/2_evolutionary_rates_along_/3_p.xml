<p>In summary, the sites that are on the negative branch evolve faster, are generally closer to the RBS, and are on the protein surface. The sites on the positive branch are generally further away from the RBS, but are also on the protein surface. Lastly, the sites on the zero branch are further away from the RBS, and are more likely to be internal residues. As a form of control to our study, we performed the same analyses with TEM-1 beta-lactamase (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, not under similar immune selection), to see if the three branches due to functional selection and expected charge are conserved on such a different protein. Importantly, the underlying shape of the data mapped on the functional selection and expected charge axes is quite different from that of the H1N1 HA. Indeed, beta-lactamase appears to possess a very different pattern from that of H1N1 HA, with a clear absence of positive or negative branches. Through further visual inspection, we found no patterns for the distributions of RSA or evolutionary rates as a function of functional selection and expected charge (
