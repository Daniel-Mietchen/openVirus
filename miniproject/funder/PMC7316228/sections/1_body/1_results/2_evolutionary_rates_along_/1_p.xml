<p>Rates of evolution, quantified as Rate4Site conservation scores, clearly show that the negative branch is evolving faster than the positive branch (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, where a higher score means a higher rate of evolution). Note that these scores are normalized across the whole protein, giving a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests reveal that the distributions of conservation scores among the three branches are all statistically different (
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.21221 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005356, 
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.27625 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 9.274 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>, 
 <italic>D</italic> = 0.36237 and 
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.926 × 10
 <sup>−10</sup> for comparisons between negative-positive, positive-zero, and negative-zero branches, respectively). Moreover, most of these rapidly evolving sites in the negative branch are in the HA1 subunit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) instead of the HA2 subunit (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Analyses with only HA1 sites reveal the same patterns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).
