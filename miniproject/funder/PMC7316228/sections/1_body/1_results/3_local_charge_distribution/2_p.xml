<p>We then investigated how other immunologically relevant biochemical properties such as glycosylation and receptor binding avidity tie in to our results. As glycosylation has been implicated in IAV dynamics (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> Altman and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), we computed the probabilities of glycosylation at each site from the deep mutational scan data assuming site independence (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007892.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). The assumption of site independence follows from DMS experiments which study functional fitness of single amino acid variants on a specific background strain. To relax this assumption, DMS data examining covariation of multiple residues would be required. Yet, glycosylation for the HA H1N1 is less pronounced than for H3N2 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and perhaps plays a less substantial role in H1N1 HA evolution. Hensley and coauthors [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] found certain sites that influence binding by changing the HA avidity to the receptor binding site. Examining the locations of these sites on the functional selection-expected charge plot, it is clear that they are found preferentially on the zero and negative branches (
