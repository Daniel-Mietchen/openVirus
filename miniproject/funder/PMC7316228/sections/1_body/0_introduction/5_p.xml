<p>Recent developments in sequencing technologies have led to data-rich experimental studies examining protein evolution. To uncover the fitness landscapes of HA proteins in the absence of immune selection, deep mutational scans (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) can interrogate HA functional constraints in a site-wise fashion, yielding probability distributions for residue preference at each site, 
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, for the HA of a particular H1N1 strain. Essentially, all possible âˆ¼10,000 point-wise mutations of the HA protein of a particular background strain are constructed, and viruses with these HAs are then passaged in MDCK-SIAT1 cells at low multiplicity of infection [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Subsequently, the resulting samples are sequenced, and those viruses that were capable of cell entry and replication are over-enriched, whereas others that were not are depleted. Essentially, these data reveal mutational constraints of HA in a specific background strain, and can aid in discovering regions that are conserved in natural sequences due to viral function, instead of apparent conservation simply due to evolutionary history.
