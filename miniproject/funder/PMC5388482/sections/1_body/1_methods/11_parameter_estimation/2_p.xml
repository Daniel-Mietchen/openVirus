<p>Of the approximately 50,000 fifteen year olds in Botswana, roughly 80% have debuted sexually, so that about 40,000 individuals enter the population in our model each year. We assume a 50:50 sex ratio. According to a recent study from Botswana [
 <xref rid="pone.0175297.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], half of the girls in the incoming population are choice disabled, and 5.6% of the choice-disabled girls are HIV positive. Furthermore, all of the choice enabled girls are HIV negative. None of the 15 year old boys are HIV positive, but 12% are choice disabled (all data from the same study).
