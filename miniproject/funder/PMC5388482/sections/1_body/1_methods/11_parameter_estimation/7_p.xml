<p>For sexual contacts between choice enabled women and choice disabled men, we assume condom use 65% of the time, but half of the non-condom contacts will be high-risk activities such as anal or dry sex. Then the transmission probabilities are 0.0014 from women to the men and 0.0041 from men to the women.</p>
