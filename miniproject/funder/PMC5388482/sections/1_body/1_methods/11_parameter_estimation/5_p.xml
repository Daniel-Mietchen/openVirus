<p>Boily et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0175297.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] conducted a systematic review of observational studies to estimate transmission probabilities of HIV per vaginal sex act. They found the probability of HIV transmission from male to female to be 0.0038 and from female to male to be 0.0030 in the absence of condom use. With condom use, these numbers decrease 20 fold [
 <xref rid="pone.0175297.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Typically, choice-enabled individuals seem to use condoms 65% of the time so that the total transmission probability from enabled men to women is 0.0015 and from women to men is 0.0011.
