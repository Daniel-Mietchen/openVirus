<p>The model is used to consider a structural intervention that moves a constant fraction of the choice-disabled population into the choice-enabled population every year. In the model, this fraction can range between 0 and 13%, depending on the strength of the intervention program. The corresponding rate parameter in the differential equation model ranges from 0 to 2 per year since exp(−2) ≈ 13%. Interpreted differently, these figures imply that individuals are on average choice enabled for at least 6 months before they benefit from intervention.</p>
