<p>A typical rate for sexual contacts in the literature is approximately 80 per year. For example, Gray et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0175297.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found that monogamous, heterosexual HIV-discordant couples in Uganda have intercourse 8-9 times per month. There are no studies on how this number changes for choice disabled individuals, but it could be considerably higher when transactional sex is an economic necessity. We will compare two scenarios, one in which all individuals make 80 contacts per year and one in which choice disabled individuals make three times as many contacts.
