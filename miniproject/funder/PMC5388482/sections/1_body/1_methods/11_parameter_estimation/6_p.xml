<p>Higher risk sexual behaviour increases transmission probabilities. For example, dry sex is very common in South Africa, especially in younger individuals with low education [
 <xref rid="pone.0175297.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and it increases the transmission by a factor of 5. Anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex and increases transmission probability by factors of 1.5 for the insertive partner and 5 for the receptive partner [
