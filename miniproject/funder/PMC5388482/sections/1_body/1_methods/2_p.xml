<p>The model focuses on heterosexual transmission of HIV between sexually active 15 to 29 year olds in Africa. The model identifies each individual in three categories: sex (male/female), disease status (susceptible/infectious), and choice status (enabled/disabled), producing eight subgroups. Mathematically, the model consists of a system of differential equations that track the number of individuals in each subgroup over time as individuals enter or leave the population, susceptible individuals become infectious, and individuals become choice-disabled or regain choice-enabled status through structural interventions. Each of these processes is described below and the model is summarized by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175297.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The equations for the model are discussed in detail in the mathematical details section below.
