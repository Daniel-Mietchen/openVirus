<p>As choice status is often associated with social or economic class we do not expect that individuals choose sexual partners independent of choice status. Instead, individuals of different choice classes participate in overlapping communities or social groups, such as those based on social and educational background. To describe the resulting mixing of individuals mathematically, we define 
 <italic>activity patterns</italic> that describe the number of sexual partners that an individual has from within each of these communities. We consider several possible activity patterns.
