<p>More insight about the influence that each mechanism and intervention has on HIV prevalence after a 15 year period is found in the sensitivity analysis summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175297.g004">Fig 4</xref>. The partial rank correlation coefficients between each of the parameters and the HIV prevalence for men and for women are displayed as bar graphs. A bar to the left indicates a negative correlation—increasing the parameter reduces HIV prevalence. A bar to the right indicates a positive correlation—increasing the parameter increases the annual incidence.
