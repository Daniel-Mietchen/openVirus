<p>The model estimates of annual HIV incidence for the sampled parameter set is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175297.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The box and whisker plots give the median, the first and third quartile, as well as the maximum and minimum values. When the number of sexual contacts per year is independent of choice class and no structural intervention is implemented, the annual HIV incidence rate has a median value of 2.67% (IQR 2.48% to 2.87%). When the maximum intervention is implemented this median drops to 0.57% (IQR 0.52% to 0.62%). The scenario where choice disabled individuals have more contacts results in higher estimated incidences: without intervention the median is 4.82% (IQR 4.76% to 4.87%), with maximum intervention the median drops to 0.88% (IQR 0.82% to 0.95%).
