<p>The model results suggest a promising role for structural programs that ameliorate the effects of choice disability in HIV transmission prevention. It seems likely that differently implemented intervention programs will have different results. The modelled simulations suggest that the best results are achieved when those who are HIV positive benefit along with their HIV negative peers. The benefits of these types of programs may be particularly pronounced when the choice disabled have more sexual contacts than the choice enabled.</p>
