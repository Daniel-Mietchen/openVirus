<p>There are several limitations to the current model. For simplicity, only two choice classes were considered: enabled and disabled. However, the literature shows that there are multiple levels of severity of choice disability that increase HIV risk farther. Two other factors that were also excluded to simplify the model are homosexual sexual activity and intravenous drug use. The extent to which these two factors contribute to transmission varies considerably with geographic region. Our simplification is consistent with a recent review study that showed that heterosexual transmission dominates in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas drug use and sex work contribute significantly in North Africa and the Middle East, and homosexual sexual activity is the greatest contributor in Latin America [
