  <title>Annual incidence rate in several scenarios.</title>
  <p>The box and whisker plots show the median annual incidence rates for the sampled parameter values in several cases. In A and B, the number of contacts made by an individual is independent of choice class while in C and D choice disabled individuals make three times as many contacts. Panels A and C have no structural intervention while B and D implement the maximum supportive intervention for the choice disabled.</p>
