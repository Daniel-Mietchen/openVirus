  <title>Sensitivity plot.</title>
  <p>The plot shows the partial rank correlation coefficients between model parameters and HIV prevalence in men (A) and women (B) after 15 years. The bottom eight bars refer to transmission probabilities between the various sex and choice classes. The middle four bars refer to the strength of the structural intervention. The top four bars refer to the number of contacts by each sex and choice class. In both plots, the intervention parameters are seen to be the most important as they show large negative rank correlations with HIV prevalence indicating that increasing the size of the intervention consistantly decreases HIV prevalence.</p>
