<p id="Par32">Program Science is an emerging field in public and population health. Through the country examples, this paper highlights some of the important scientific contributions that have developed over the past 5Â years. Program Science as a framework is unique among other research strategies because it systematically combines the program cycle with the research strategy by embedding research within programs and having programs set and drive the research agenda. This approach requires partnership between policy makers, program leaders, service providers, researchers and communities. This combined effort results in a focus on ensuring maximum population level benefit of a program through detailed understanding of the local needs and context. This strategy has the potential to close the gap between evidence, action and policy and may be applicable to many important public health areas globally.</p>
