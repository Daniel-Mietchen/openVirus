<p id="Par14">The three spheres of a program cycle include: (1) strategic planning; (2) program implementation; and (3) program management and evaluation (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and these form the basis for the application of Program Science. By encompassing these three spheres of a program cycle, Program Science, as both a program and research framework, is able to ensure that scientific enquiry is driven by these spheres, and the subsequent application of the knowledge generated from scientific enquiry, systematically addresses all three spheres.
