<p id="Par15">The strategic planning sphere of a program cycle centers on making informed decisions about program priorities and resource allocation. For example, heterogeneity in risk—through place or geographic location and social determinants—underpin HIV and STI epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, epidemic control requires a program aligned with local epidemic context in order to address this heterogeneity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The implementation phase of a program cycle centers on making informed decisions about ‘where’, ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘for whom’ to deliver interventions. Critical decisions for program implementation include the locations for implementation and the populations that will be focused on by the program, the specific combination of interventions to be implemented, as well as how best to deliver these services. Finally, program evaluation requires the generation of robust evidence as part of program management. It is an ongoing and iterative process that allows for the re-development and re-design of programs to respond to program indicators and outcomes and to evolving epidemics, structures and drivers of an epidemic. For example, as a public health program progresses, the knowledge on heterogeneity is then used to fine-tune decisions on the ‘where’, ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘for whom’ and program monitoring focuses on whether gaps, or inequities, in a program are improving. Program Science supports the generation of knowledge across these spheres in order to inform HIV/STI programs with some examples discussed below.
