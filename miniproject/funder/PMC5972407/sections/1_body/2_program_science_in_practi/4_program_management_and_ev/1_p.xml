<p id="Par25">Improving program efficiency requires an approach to identify and define existing opportunity gaps. The Program Science Initiative in Kenya, through a Technical Support Unit (TSU) to the National AIDS and STI Control Programme (NASCOP), developed innovative field level tools to capture data on HIV/STI prevention program indicators. HIV prevention programs in Kenya follow a combination prevention approach with a focus on biomedical, behavioural and structural interventions. The tools developed and used by these programs were developed to collect data on all aspects of the program covering all three of these intervention focus areas. Kenya, as many other countries do, has several funders of KP programs. As such, implementers were using many different reporting formats used by the many different funders. The TSU, with support from NASCOP, worked with all funders and implementing partners through the National Key Population Technical Working Group to develop standard data collection tools. A basic 15 indicator reporting tool was developed and all implementing partners were mandated to report to NASCOP on a quarterly basis on all 15 indicators [

The reports are compiled at the national level by TSU and NASCOP and county wise analysis is shared with the implementing partners, county governments and funders on a quarterly basis to: (1) examine data quality; (2) evaluate trends such as changes in HIV testing uptake over time and (3) assess program achievements as compared to national targets.
