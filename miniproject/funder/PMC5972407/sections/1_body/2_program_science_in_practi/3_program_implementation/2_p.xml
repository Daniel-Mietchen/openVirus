<p id="Par23">Avahan clearly demonstrated the need to combine behavioural, biomedical and structural interventions to achieve the maximum impact in reducing HIV and STI rates. Biological and behavioural surveys conducted among female sex workers (FSWs) revealed a decline in HIV, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea prevalence in most sex work sub-groups and most locations as a result of combination prevention interventions which included STI prevention and treatment [

The inclusion of these interventions was driven by needs voiced by community members (members of KPs) as well as a program aim to further reduce HIV and STI rates. The process of designing and implementing these structural interventions centered on comprehensively engaging with policy makers, police, lawyers, media and sex work communities. With the incorporation of these interventions into the existing multi-pronged prevention programs, reductions in reported violence and improved individual and collective mobilization and empowerment were also seen [
