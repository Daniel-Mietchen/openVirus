<p id="Par19">While programmatic mapping provides data on micro-level geographic concentration of risk, there has also been work to understand the macro-level 
 <italic>spatial distribution</italic> of the epidemic at the province/state/district level as highlighted in work led by Tanser et al. andÂ Abu-Raddad et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Tanser demonstrates that in regions where the HIV epidemic was traditionally felt to be a generalized epidemic, that in fact, there were important zones of high HIV transmission signifying the presence of concentrated sub-epidemics. Prioritizing finite resources by place (e.g. province or state) may be more efficient than universal distribution of resources across a country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to reduce HIV infections. Similarly, re-allocation of resources to better align service delivery with disease burden and disparities requires detailed mapping of health-states and services, including how individuals navigate health systems [
