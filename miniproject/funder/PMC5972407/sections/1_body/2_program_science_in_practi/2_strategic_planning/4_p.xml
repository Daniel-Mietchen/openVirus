<p id="Par20">Additional innovations have included approaches for characterizing HIV epidemics by understanding the causal pathway of 
 <italic>HIV transmission</italic> at a population-level rather than focusing on HIV acquisition at an individual level. For example, condomless sex acts in the context of sex work may lead to a small number of HIV infections in the short-term, but contribute to a large number of HIV infections over time through onward transmission [

Disentangling the causal pathways may require a more in depth understanding of the local context of sex partnerships, which in turn, leads to a better understanding of the sources of heterogeneity in risk of HIV transmission, and of acquisition. For example, the importance of transactional sex (sex in exchange for money/goods/resources wherein exchange was not explicitly negotiated prior to sex) leading to high proportion of HIV acquisition was recognized when a revised Modes of Transmission Model was parameterized to the local Nigerian context [
