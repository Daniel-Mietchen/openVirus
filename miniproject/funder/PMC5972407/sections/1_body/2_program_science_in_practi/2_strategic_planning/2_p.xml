 <italic>Programmatic Mapping</italic> involves a systematic approach to generating key information about the size and distribution of KPs within a defined geographic area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Other methods, including multiplier methods or capture-recapture techniques, provide overall size estimates but do not provide the granular information required for detailed program planning and implementation. For example, geographic mapping provide city-wide KP size estimates and also provide data on micro-level hotspot (places where KPs congregate to solicit sex/drug using partners) level KP size estimates, as well as generate information on the physical locations where KPs congregate and the characteristics of these locations, such as the typologies of sex work. The detailed population size data allow programs to set coverage goals and the location data enable programs to plan for outreach and concentrate resources in areas of greatest need. Programmatic mapping has been used by many countries in Asia and Africa [
