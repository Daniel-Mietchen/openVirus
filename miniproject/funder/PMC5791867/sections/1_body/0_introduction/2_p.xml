 </xref> We focus on five areas: (i) information for focused action, (ii) interventions for impact, (iii) delivering for equity, (iv) financing for sustainability and (v) innovation for acceleration. We highlight several accomplishments, as well as challenges, within these strategic areas. These may inform the planning and implementation of national hepatitis C control measures by other low- and middle-income countries, as well as the way forward to control the disease successfully within Rwanda.
