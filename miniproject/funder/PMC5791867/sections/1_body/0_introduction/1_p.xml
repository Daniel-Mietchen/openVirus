<p>Worldwide, an estimated 71 million people, 1% of the global population, are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV).

 </xref> The introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs have led to simplified treatment of hepatitis C and promising outcomes. Yet, the number of deaths from the disease is on the rise globally.

 </xref> For many low- to middle-income countries, the high cost of medication, alongside limited laboratory and health-system capacity, prevents many of them from accessing and rolling out treatment on a national scale.

 </xref> Voluntary licence agreements with manufacturers have allowed 101 countries, including Rwanda, to receive direct-acting antivirals at reduced prices. Nevertheless, the cost is still prohibitive for most patients in low- and middle-income countries.

 </xref> Due to the rapid advances in hepatitis C treatment, global bodies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), World Hepatitis Alliance and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are encouraging low- and middle-income countries to develop organized national responses to the disease.

 </xref> However, to date, few reports describe the process of planning or implementing responses to hepatitis C disease at the country level. Although 43 countries have reported completion of national viral hepatitis elimination plans, very few of these are from low- and middle-income countries and even fewer are from sub-Saharan Africa.
