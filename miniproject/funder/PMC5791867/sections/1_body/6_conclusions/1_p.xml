<p>In Rwanda, a robust programme for hepatitis C control has been developed, including key accomplishments in the areas of establishing national governance and planning, developing diagnostic capacity, approving the use of direct-acting antiviral treatment, training key personnel, generating political will and leadership from within the government and fostering key strategic partnerships for technical support (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, major challenges remain, with key next steps to be undertaken. The government will need to focus on developing a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework and tools for monitoring of viral hepatitis. Care needs to be further decentralized from referral and provincial hospitals to the district hospital level, with hepatitis C management integrated into routine clinical services to provide more equitable access to diagnosis and treatment. Procurement and distribution of rapid diagnostic tests are needed to increase coverage of diagnostic capacity and to facilitate easier and more efficient diagnosis of hepatitis C. Most importantly, there remain financial constraints on the care and treatment needed to control the epidemic effectively and limit direct out-of-pocket spending by the population. The government will need to increase both public sector investment as well as support from private and external funding sources. The successes and challenges learnt from Rwanda’s response to hepatitis C will be valuable as elimination efforts are developed and accelerated in low- and middle-income countries around the world.
