 </xref> This has resulted in a doubling of the budget earmarked for viral hepatitis from 2013 to 2016 and expanded targets in the forthcoming Rwanda health sector strategic plan 2018–2023. Further reductions in the price of generic pharmaceuticals, projected to reach US$ 100 per month (or US$ 300 per treatment) are anticipated to result in greater affordability of drugs. This would facilitate hepatitis C therapy for uninsured patients and those in the community-based insurance programme, which provides the financial coverage for care services for the majority of the Rwandan population. Irrespective of this development, financing for the hepatitis C response via both domestic and external mechanisms remains a major barrier in Rwanda as it has for other low- and middle-income countries globally.
