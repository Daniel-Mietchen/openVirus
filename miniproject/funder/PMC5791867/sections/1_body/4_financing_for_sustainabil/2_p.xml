<p>As part of the national operational plan, several different costing scenarios were calculated for the prevention, diagnosis and care of hepatitis B and C. In a full intervention scenario ‒ where all screening, diagnosis and treatment options are implemented ‒ the cost for HCV screening of 2.6 million people and treatment of 74 105 people annually was projected to be approximately US$ 128 million. If treatment were reserved for patients with HIV coinfection or advanced disease (aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index &gt; 1.0), then the total annual cost to implement the hepatitis C control programme was projected to be US$ 52 million. In comparison, the estimated annual expenditure for HIV care in Rwanda from 2013‒2018 is around US$ 207 million.
