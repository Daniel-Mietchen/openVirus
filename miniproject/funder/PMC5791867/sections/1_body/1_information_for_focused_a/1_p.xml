Whereas hepatitis C prevention efforts have been increasing, we found no existing surveys or qualitative data regarding attitudes, knowledge or beliefs towards viral hepatitis in the general population in Rwanda, reflecting an overall lack of published literature on this topic in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the causes of HCV transmission in Rwanda are largely unknown, but are assumed to include past traditional medical practices, unsafe injection practices during and before the 1970s, exposure to contaminated blood during the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and blood transfusions before 1999.
