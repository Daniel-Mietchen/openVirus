<p>In April 2016, a patient chart for hepatitis C care and treatment was developed and implemented in paper form at hospitals receiving HCV patients. This was to support clinical decision-making according to national guidelines and allow proper reporting of patient outcomes. The group also developed patient registers that were implemented to track the overall number of patients enrolled in clinical and laboratory services. As of October 2017, Rwanda Biomedical Centre started developing and reviewing national indicators for hepatitis C to be included in the integrated health management information system in Rwanda.</p>
