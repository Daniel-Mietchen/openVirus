 </xref> In 2013, the viral hepatitis technical working group was set up, comprising health ministry specialists, clinicians, academic researchers, laboratory experts, implementing partner organizations, United Nations agencies, and civil society and private sector representatives. The group began to meet regularly to provide technical advice for the design and implementation of the programme. At that time, a national policy on viral hepatitis prevention and management in Rwanda was developed and published to provide specific guidance to health-care providers and facilities on the implementation of the clinical guidelines.
