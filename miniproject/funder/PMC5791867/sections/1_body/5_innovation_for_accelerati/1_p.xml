<p>Several key elements have accelerated Rwanda’s success in building a comprehensive framework for the public health response to hepatitis C with resource constrains. Hepatitis C screening, diagnosis and treatment have been integrated into existing programmes and systems for HIV infection. These systems cover policy and guidelines development, laboratory equipment, specimen transport, clinic infrastructure, training platforms, medication supply chain and clinical training and mentorship. This strategy has allowed for rapid implementation of the hepatitis C response. Although a plan for rapid decentralization exists, challenges remain in training adequate numbers of health-care personnel and equipping laboratories to provide maximal access and equitable distribution of services. The involvement of community and hepatitis C patient networks, particularly in advocacy for approval and access to direct-acting antivirals, has been essential in Rwanda’s push to rapidly introduce new diagnostics and therapies. Such networks will continue to play an important role in public awareness efforts. Finally, under the technical working group framework and building on HIV control experiences, partnerships were established between the health ministry and several international organizations, including Stanford University, Maryland University, Duke University, Gilead Sciences, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Partners In Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO. These partnerships leverage technical, financial and operational expertise and experience with hepatitis C. The health ministry has been active in building the key partnerships required to develop a rapid, informed and sustainable approach to a national hepatitis C programme. The ministry involved international academic institutions in training and research, insurance companies in the financing of diagnostic testing and medications, pharmaceutical companies in rapid price reductions and procuring direct-acting antivirals, and nongovernmental organizations in securing donations and informing planning and policy.</p>
