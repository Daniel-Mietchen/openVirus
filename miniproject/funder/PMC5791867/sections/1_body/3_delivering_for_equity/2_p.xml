<p>The government has promoted the decentralization of health services to provide a more comprehensive package of health services at provincial hospitals, district hospitals, health centres and at the community level through community health workers. This process was pioneered through the response to the HIV epidemic. The HIV response resulted in 524 facilities providing antiretroviral therapy and 1068 physicians and nurses with the capacity to initiate and maintain patients on therapy.

 </xref> This network now serves as a platform for care delivery for other chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis B virus infection) and noncommunicable diseases (e.g. hypertension and diabetes). Since 2015, the health ministry, in collaboration with Duke University, provided 1-week advanced training in hepatitis C disease care and treatment to 20 internal medicine specialists, 72 general physicians and 48 specialist nurse mentors. General 5-day trainings on hepatitis C care and treatment were provided by Rwanda Biomedical Centre for 550 nurses, 24 laboratory technicians, 48 hospital pharmacists, 48 nutritionists and 47 data managers working in HIV services at both the district hospital and health centre level in all 30 districts. Clinical mentorship for viral hepatitis was integrated into the established clinical mentorship programme for HIV. This included routine visits by expert clinicians for theoretical and practical clinical teaching of physicians and nurses at health centres, after their general training in hepatitis. Despite these efforts, there remains a bias towards diagnosis and treatment of patients at urban referral hospitals, and care is largely limited to patients who are able to purchase diagnostics and treatments out of pocket or who are covered through various health insurance schemes.
