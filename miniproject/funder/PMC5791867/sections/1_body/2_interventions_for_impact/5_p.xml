<p>In August 2015, the health ministry officially authorized the use of sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with ledipasvir for treatment of hepatitis C in Rwanda. The government was given preferred pricing for these drugs via licensed manufacturers at a cost per 28 days of 300 United States dollars (US$) for sofosbuvir and US$ 400 for sofosbuvir with ledipasvir in 2015 (subsequently reduced to US$ 260 in 2017). A donation of daclatasvir (2000 treatment regimens) was also obtained through the Clinton Health Access Initiative Quick-Start programme. As of June 2017, over 2500 of an estimated 55 000 patients requiring medication

Medications are dispensed by three dispensaries in the capital city Kigali, licensed by the distributor: two at treatment referral centres and one at a centrally located private pharmacy. The hepatitis C national treatment selection committee, composed of senior clinicians appointed by the health ministry in February 2016, reviews all medical prescriptions. There are now 20 physicians approved to prescribe direct-acting antivirals at 10 districts, provincial and referral hospitals which provide treatment coverage for all five provinces in Rwanda. The plan for decentralization and scale-up of hepatitis C treatment includes the establishment of treatment capacity at all 48 district hospitals countrywide by 2020. However, this initiative is limited by diagnostic capacity, the availability of trained personnel and financial barriers to diagnostics and treatment.
