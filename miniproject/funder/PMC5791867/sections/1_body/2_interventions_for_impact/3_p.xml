<p>HCV testing guidelines in Rwanda include antibody testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a rapid diagnostic test, which is then confirmed with polymerase chain reaction-based viral load quantification. Currently, 11 hospitals nationwide have the capacity to perform ELISA-based testing for HCV. Although several rapid diagnostic tests have been validated in Rwanda, there is no consensus on product selection or procurement, and rapid diagnostic tests are not currently available in public health-care facilities. As part of the well-established health services for HIV, 10 hospitals have the capacity to conduct HCV viral load testing. Using current systems for HIV viral load testing, blood samples for HCV testing are collected at local health centres and district hospitals and delivered to one of the testing sites via a centrally organized transport system, which also delivers results back to the health facilities. Given the predominance of HCV genotypes 1 and 4 in Rwanda,
