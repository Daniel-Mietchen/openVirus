 </xref> The guidelines were updated in June 2015 to include detailed guidance for treatment with direct-acting antiviral drugs and avoidance of interferon-based therapy for treatment-naïve patients.

 </xref> The guidelines recommended sofosbuvir (400 mg) with ribavirin (1000–1200 mg) for 24 weeks; sofosbuvir (400 mg) with ledipasvir (90 mg) for 12 weeks; or sofosbuvir (400 mg) with daclatasvir (60 mg) for 12 weeks. The choice of regimen depends on clinical indications, as well as availability and affordability of the drugs to the patient. The guidelines recommended that, whereas all patients with chronic infection should be considered potential candidates for therapy, priority should be given to patients with advanced fibrosis (aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index &gt; 1.0, or symptoms of liver cirrhosis) and for patients co-infected with HIV subtype 1 who are at-risk of accelerated disease progression.
