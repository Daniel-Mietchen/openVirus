<p>The capacity for HCV testing for patients was first introduced in Rwanda in 2013 and was initially recommended for high-risk groups, including patients with HIV or HBV infection, intravenous drug users, infants of mothers with hepatitis C, individuals who received blood or organ transplants before 1999, individuals with occupational exposure and other patients as clinically indicated.

 </xref> National guidelines recommend one-time testing for all adults, followed by annual follow-up testing for cases of potential exposure. Higher-risk groups, such as intravenous and intranasal drug users and female sex workers, as well as health-care workers and community health workers, are recommended to undergo annual testing. Systematic testing of pregnant women is also recommended.

 </xref> Currently, targeted screening campaigns are underway for adults older than 45 years, health-care workers and laboratory technicians, men who have sex with men, commercial sex workers and prisoners. Of note, injection drug use is rare in Rwanda and is not considered a primary driver of bloodborne epidemics. The health ministry has conducted routine general training and education for health practitioners about risk reduction for iatrogenic exposure to hepatitis, including reduction of unnecessary injections and increased infection control measures at health facilities.
