<p>There was no clear seasonality of VF during STEMI; after correlating Danish viral exposure surveillance data with individual data on VF risk among first STEMI, no relationship was found between EV or influenza exposure and occurrence of VF. Even though we found that VF patients experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with the patients without VF, our data do not support the hypothesis that higher levels of EV and influenza are associated with high VF prevalence.</p>
