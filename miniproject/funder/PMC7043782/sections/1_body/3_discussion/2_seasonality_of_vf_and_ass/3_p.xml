<p>Although there is substantial evidence supporting the role of influenza in CVD mortality and SCA/SCD,[

 <xref rid="pone.0226936.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] we did not find an association between influenza and VF risk during STEMI. There are several possible reasons for this discrepancy in associations. First, many studies were designed to investigate overall influenza mortality or CVD mortality rather than SCA/SCD[
 <xref rid="pone.0226936.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Second, most studies included different cardiac causes of SCA and SCD with consequent etiological heterogeneity, and no study has specifically investigated VF in the setting of an acute first MI. The role of influenza infection may be different with different underlying cardiac causes of SCA/SCD. Lastly, some studies used SCA/SCD as a surrogate of VF, and thus some cases of sudden death due to bradyarrhythmic or noncardiac causes may have been misclassified.
