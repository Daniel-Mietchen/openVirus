<p>During the study period in the general population, 2,704 individuals were diagnosed with EV and 19,742 with influenza. Graphs of seasonal patterns of influenza and EV and number of VF cases in the setting of first STEMI over the study time are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226936.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Influenza showed strong winter and spring seasonality (week 40 to week 20), with a maximum observed during the first 10 weeks of the year. EV was detected year-round but tended to peak, as expected, during late summer and fall months. There was no clear seasonality of VF during STEMI.
