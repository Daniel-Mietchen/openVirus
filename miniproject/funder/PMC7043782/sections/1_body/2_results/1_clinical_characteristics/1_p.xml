<p>Between January 2010 and October 2016, there were 4,659 consecutively enrolled first STEMI patients (age 18â€“80 years) at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, of whom 581 (12%) had VF before PPCI. The clinical characteristics at the time of STEMI are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0226936.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Patients with VF were more likely to be men, be a current smoker, have a history of AF and experience no angina compared with STEMI patients without VF. Furthermore, the proportion on anticoagulant therapy was higher among patients with VF compared with patients without, likely due to the higher degree of AF (

 <xref rid="pone.0226936.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Patients with VF had shorter times from symptom onset to PPCI, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, were more likely to have anterior infarctions with left anterior descending artery occlusions, and had lower pre-PCI TIMI flow and higher Killip class.
