<p>Because we were not able to obtain the actual viral exposure on an individual level for the study population, we used monthly and weekly virus incidences at the national level as a proxy for the viral exposure. The virology data were obtained from 
 <italic>Statens Serum Institute</italic>, a Danish governmental public health and research institute operating within the Danish Ministry of Health. We utilized weekly and monthly surveillance data for EV and influenza from the Danish National Microbiology Database (2010â€“2016), which captures all positive laboratory test results conducted at hospital laboratories in Denmark.[

During the study period of 82 months, 2,704 individuals were diagnosed with EV in the general population. Due to higher incidence of influenza, we calculated the number of influenza events per week, and during the study period of 358 weeks, 19,742 individuals were diagnosed with influenza. The weekly and monthly viral exposure data were then combined and merged with the Eastern Danish Heart Registry using the date of PPCI (
