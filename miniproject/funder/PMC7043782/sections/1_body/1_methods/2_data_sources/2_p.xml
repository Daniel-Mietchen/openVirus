 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226936.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the data collection. We used data from the electronic Eastern Danish Heart Registry comprising detailed clinical data on all consecutive STEMI patients undergoing cardiac catherization and coronary revascularization in Eastern Denmark. The electronic Eastern Danish Heart Registry includes detailed clinical data on all patients undergoing coronary angiography, such as baseline demographics, angiographic findings, and procedure characteristics from the PPCI.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226936.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] All these data were routinely registered by the PCI operator and assistants in the catheterization laboratory during the PPCI. This registry was further linked to the following three nationwide administrative registries via the personal identification number. (1) The Danish Civil Registration System contains daily changes in the vital status of all residents, and no historical data are deleted.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226936.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (2) The Danish National Patient Registry holds information on all admissions to hospitals since 1978 and outpatient visits since 1995, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8 and ICD-10.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226936.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Information on date of admission, date of discharge, and diagnoses of comorbidities was recorded for every STEMI patient prior to index STEMI. (3) The Danish Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics, which registers all prescriptions dispensed from Danish pharmacies since 1995. Each drug is coded according to the international Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, and the registry includes data on type of drug, strength, quantity dispensed, and date of dispensing [
