<p>The study population consisted of all consecutive patients aged between 18â€“80 years with a first STEMI (n = 4,659) admitted to the invasive catheterization laboratory between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2016 at the Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet. Rigshospitalet covers all of eastern Denmark (2.6 million citizens), which corresponds to 45% of the entire Danish population. The STEMI patients were divided in two groups. The main outcome was if VF occurred within the first 12 hours of symptoms of STEMI before PPCI. We included both out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest with STEMI and VF (82% out-of-hospital and 17% during emergency care or in hospital (at arrival)). Patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were included on admission to the PCI center after resuscitation by trained emergency medical service personnel. VF had to occur before the guided catheter insertion for PPCI; all VF cases had ECG-documented VF. In addition, all medical reports (emergency and hospital records) and discharge summaries were reviewed to verify patients as VF cases. Patients who were non-Danish citizens (n = 180) were excluded.</p>
