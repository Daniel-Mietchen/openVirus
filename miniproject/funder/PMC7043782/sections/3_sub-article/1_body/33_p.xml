<p>Reviewer #1: The authors should be congratulated for this excellent work. Even if the results are negative, the tested hypothesis is of major importance and those findings will be helpful for appropriately guide future research in the field. In the study, the authors examine the influence of seasonality and association of increased enterovirus and influenza activity in the community with the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) during first ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Based on a large STEMI cohort and on individual-level linkage of data from Danish nationwide registries, they identified all consecutive STEMI patients admitted to acute angiography and Primary PCI (PPCI) at Rigs Hospitalet Copenhagen between January 2010 and October 2016. The cohort where linked to information on monthly/weekly surveillance data on entro - and influenza virus from the Danish National Microbiology Database. Of 4659 consecutively enrolled STEMI patients, 581 (12%) had VF before PPCI. The VF patients experienced more fatigue and flu-like symptoms 7 days prior to the STEMI event than the non-VF patients from the cohort, but no significant association between enterovirus, week-number and influenza virus exposure</p>
