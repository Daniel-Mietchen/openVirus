<p>Much progress has been achieved in recent years in reducing HIV incidence and AIDS-related deaths. In addition to the previously widely used metrics of incidence and mortality rates, additional metrics that show percentage reductions or that relate the number of new infections to either the total number of PLHIV or their all-cause mortality are useful to measure transitions in national or local epidemics. These metrics are now increasingly being used, including by UNAIDS and by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) [

The different metrics convey information about different aspects of the epidemic: metrics that focus on incidence reductions centre on curbing epidemic spread such that reductions in sickness, death, and fiscal burden will follow later; metrics that focus on reducing the death rate speak to whether there is an immediate reduction in sickness and death; and the metrics that relate to the size of the epidemic speak to whether the fiscal burden is immediately contracting (IMR) or whether the response is ‘on track’ to reduce the fiscal burden (IPR)
