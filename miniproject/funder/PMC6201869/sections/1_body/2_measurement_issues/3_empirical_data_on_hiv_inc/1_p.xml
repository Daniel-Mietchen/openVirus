<p>Empirical data on HIV incidence are increasingly available but remain rare. Cohort studies that measure the incidence rate directly are costly and time-consuming and may suffer from participation bias [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hence, only a few national cohort studies exist [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with other studies focused on entire populations or subpopulations in specific locations [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Recently, the cross-sectional population-based HIV impact assessment surveys [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have been used to generate estimates of HIV incidence (using algorithms that include assays to estimate the number of recent infections) at the national level, although not at the subnational level or among specific key populations. As are cohort studies, these surveys are also subject to participation bias. Separate cross-sectional surveys among key populations are now also recommended to include the measurement of incidence [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], although the body of empirical measurements is currently limited. For both national surveys and surveys among key populations, having a sample size that is large enough to estimate HIV incidence with precision is costly, and this will become even more so as the level of incidence falls to lower values in future years. Nevertheless, the assay-based methods for the measurement of incidence in cross-sectional surveys continue to be investigated and developed [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and when this information is combined (in models) with other data, the precision of model-based incidence estimates can be improved. Countries with well-developed case-reporting systems can use the annual number of new diagnoses to estimate HIV incidence taking into account other information on the time to diagnosis, underdiagnosis, and failure to report [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Efforts are ongoing in other countries (including those with the highest levels of prevalence) to develop case-based surveillance and patient-monitoring systems [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]â€”it is currently unclear whether such systems will allow for the estimation of incidence among key populations.
