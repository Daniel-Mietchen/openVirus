<p>Comprehensive empirical data on mortality among PLHIV are rare, especially in high-prevalence countries. In countries with well-developed case-reporting systems, data are recorded on all deaths among PLHIV who are diagnosed. In these systems, a proportion of these deaths are registered among people who were not previously known to be living with HIV. Data on all-cause mortality among key populations living with HIV are not available for most countries, although countries with well-developed case-reporting systems that include reporting of the assumed mode of transmission may be able to make estimates based on reported data [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, registers may contain the number of PLHIV who have died, but the vital status of individuals lost to follow-up may not be up to date. In countries with well-developed vital registration systems, the failure to correctly record AIDS-related deaths may be due to misdiagnosis of the cause of death [
