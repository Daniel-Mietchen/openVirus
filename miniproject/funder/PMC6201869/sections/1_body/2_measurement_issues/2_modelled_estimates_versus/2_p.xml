<p>Clearly, the quality of modelled estimates depends on the availability and validity of input data. Mathematical models that estimate HIV incidence and AIDS-related mortality may include, besides demographic data and assumptions, the following empirical data: sentinel surveillance prevalence among pregnant women, programmatic data on prevalence among pregnant women, national survey–derived HIV prevalence, numbers of people on ART, national survey–derived incidence, cohort-derived incidence among 15–49 year olds, case reports of new HIV diagnoses, case reports of AIDS-related deaths, and coverage and regimen distribution for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Data-informed assumptions are typically made about the survival probability of people receiving ART, the effectiveness of antiretroviral regimens to prevent MTCT, and other parameters [
