<p>There is a long history of countries developing modelled estimates of HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, AIDS-related mortality, and all-cause mortality among PLHIV. A major process is undertaken by UNAIDS and partners that involves soliciting expert advice about new model features, software development, capacity building in modelling, and annual country-level development of modelled estimates [

This results in the most widely available and consistent set of country-level estimates and time trends in the incidence and prevalence of HIV and HIV-related mortality. In addition, several academic groups are active in this field and publish topic- or country-specific models and estimates [
