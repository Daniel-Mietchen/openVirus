<p>The major challenge with model-based estimates is that they tend to be most uncertain (least precise) in recent years and are, by necessity, dependent on assumptions for which direct empirical data are lacking. When comparing, for example, incidence and mortality, two quantities are being compared, both of which are being modelled from a dataset that is predominantly informed by trends in HIV prevalence and ART coverage. This can be addressed by using the models to ‘test’ whether there is evidence of a particular target being reached or not, in which the uncertainty attendant in the methods is fully expressed. It may be the case that with current surveillance systems and data availability, one may not be able to make very precise statements regarding meeting particular thresholds as soon as we would like. However, new development in the availability of empirical data—especially measures of incidence and deaths—will bolster this ability.</p>
