<p>For the purpose of the Fast-Track modelling, which aimed to develop programmatic targets and resource needs estimates [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], ‘Ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat’ was interpreted as achieving an important reduction in incidence and mortality. Programmatic targets and effect estimates were included in the model for testing, treatment, and viral suppression; condom use; key populations (men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgender people, and prisoners) intervention packages; preexposure prophylaxis; voluntary male medical circumcision; and conditional cash transfers. Specifically, the percentage reduction target was set to a 90% reduction in the number of new HIV infections in the entire population between 2010 and 2030. The modelling of the impact resulting from reaching the different programmatic targets achieved a reduction by 2030 of nearly 90% [
