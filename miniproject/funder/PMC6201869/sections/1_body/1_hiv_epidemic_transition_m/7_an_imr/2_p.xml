<p>A target of IMR &lt; 1 on its own does not require a reduction of mortality. In fact, dropping below IMR &lt; 1 is possible with a high level of mortality. An additional target therefore needs to be considered in conjunction with the IMR target [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A possible target for a direct mortality reduction is that mortality among PLHIV should approach mortality among the HIV-negative population (which will be country and population specific). Indirect targets could relate to ART coverageâ€”for example, ART coverage &gt; 70% [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or ART coverage &gt; 81% by 2020 and &gt;86% by 2030 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
