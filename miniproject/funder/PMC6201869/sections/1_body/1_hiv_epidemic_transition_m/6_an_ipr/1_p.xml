<p>The IPR (incidence:prevalence ratio) is defined as the number of new infections occurring per year in a population divided by the number of persons living with HIV in that same population. When the IPR is below a certain threshold, the epidemic declines—if the IPR is held below that threshold for a long time, the epidemic will eventually be eliminated. The IPR is thus an indicator for the epidemic response ‘proceeding in the right way’, as opposed to it having achieved its goal of ending the AIDS epidemic. It was initially used by researchers in high-income countries [
