<p>A global benchmark value is obtained by considering the replacement level for the infection: for an epidemic to decline, on average, there should be fewer than one new infection per person living with HIV over the course of their infection. If we assume that newly infected persons survive for D years and there is an equal risk of transmission over this time and that it is the same for all people, then it follows that the benchmark value is equal to 1/D at equilibrium. Making further simplifying assumptions, we can say that D is approximately 33 years (the approximate survival time, accounting for the proportion of PLHIV that benefit from antiretroviral therapy [ART] under UNAIDS’ treatment targets) [

We note that this provides only a rough ‘rule of thumb’; a separate paper is in preparation for this collection to explore further the behaviour of the IPR. As the IPR contains elements related to incidence reduction as well as to extending survival, it conveys two major aims of the programmatic response.
