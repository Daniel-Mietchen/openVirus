<p>However, incidence rates are very different in different populations. A target incidence level for a country with high historical incidence, such as the countries in southern Africa, may not be relevant for a country with historically lower incidence. For example, the incidence in India, taken as a whole, was estimated to be 0.10 (0.08âˆ’0.14) / 1,000 py in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and it has never exceeded the 1/1,000 py proposed benchmark [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence, meaningful targets can only be set in countries and local jurisdictions.
