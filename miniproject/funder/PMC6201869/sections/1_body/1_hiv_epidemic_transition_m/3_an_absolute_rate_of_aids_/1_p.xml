<p>The level of AIDS-related mortality varies among countries, within countries, by age, and by population groups. AIDS-related mortality in South Africa, for example, peaked in 2006 when 42% of all deaths were attributable to HIV and the AIDS-related mortality rate was approximately 5/1,000 population [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002678.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While an AIDS-related mortality of less than 1/1,000 per year may be relevant for the high-prevalence countries in southern Africa, meaningful targets can only be set in countries and local jurisdictions. The proposed indicator for monitoring AIDS-related mortality is the number of AIDS-related deaths per 1,000 population. As above for the incidence metric, both the AIDS-related mortality rate and the number of AIDS-related deaths can be monitored. In the case of important population growth and a decline in mortality, the rate would decline faster than the number of AIDS-related deaths.
