<p>We consider six metrics: (1) an absolute rate of HIV incidence, (2) an absolute rate of AIDS-related deaths, (3) a percentage reduction in new HIV infections, (4) a percentage reduction in AIDS-related deaths [both 3 and 4 as compared to an agreed baseline date], (5) an incidence:prevalence ratio (IPR), and (6) an incidence:mortality ratio (IMR). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002678.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the changing values of the six metrics globally for the percentage reduction during 2010–2016 and for the other metrics during 1990–2016, based on UNAIDS estimates. Key characteristics of the metrics and their benchmark values are shown in
