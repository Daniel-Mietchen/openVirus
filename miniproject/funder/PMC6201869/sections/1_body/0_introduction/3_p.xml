<p>Metrics for tracking progress towards the end of the epidemic as a public health threat should relate to both technical and popular interpretations of the concept of a ‘public health threat’. HIV threatens affected populations in several ways. First, and most importantly, HIV causes sickness and death, which together contribute to a country’s burden of disease. Second, people living with HIV (PLHIV) and key populations at high risk of infection may be stigmatised, which may constitute an obstacle to effective implementation and warrants ongoing monitoring. Third, the epidemic reduces the size and the productivity of a country’s work force, imposing an indirect economic burden on the affected country. Finally, managing HIV demands health spending by patients, governments, private insurers, and funders, and, in the worst-affected lower-income countries, this fiscal burden can exceed all other health spending, with part of the cost borne by donor countries. Ending the epidemic as a public health threat depends on reducing mortality and incidence by expanding treatment and prevention services.</p>
