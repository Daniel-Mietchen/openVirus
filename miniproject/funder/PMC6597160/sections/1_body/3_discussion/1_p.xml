<p>In this cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of ART-na√Øve HIV/HCV co-infected Russians with heavy drinking, we did not detect an association between zinc deficiency and advanced liver fibrosis. Zinc deficiency at baseline was noted in one-third of the participants and advanced liver fibrosis was noted in approximately one-quarter of participants. Fibrosis was observed in a slightly higher proportion of zinc deficient patients (28%) as compared to those with normal zinc levels (23%).</p>
