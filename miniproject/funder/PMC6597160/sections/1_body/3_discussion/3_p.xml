<p>The present study’s findings differ from prior work. The present study’s findings differ from prior work. For example, the mean zinc level in our study was 0.9mg/L ± 0.30 mg/L. This is higher compared to an established cohort of HCV/HIV co-infected persons with and without advanced liver disease (0.62 mg/L ± 0.17 mg/L) [

 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our study differed from others as well with regard to demographic characteristics. For example, Omran et al found that lower zinc levels were associated with advanced liver fibrosis in an older cohort (mean age 52) of HCV mono-infected Egyptian patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The serum zinc level among those with &gt;F2 fibrosis was 0.52 mg/L ± 0.31 mg/L versus 0.63 ± 0.30 mg/L among those with ≤F2 fibrosis. Authors in that study used transient elastography and dichotomized patients with either mild to moderate fibrosis (≤F2, ≤7.3 kPa) or advanced fibrosis (&gt;F2, &gt;7.3 kPa), whereas we defined advanced liver fibrosis as FIB-4&gt;3.25 or APRI≥1.5 or elastography≥10.5kPa. The two studies also differed in key demographic characteristics. Aside from being conducted in two countries with ethnic differences, our cohort was younger (mean age 33 versus 52), majority male (76% versus 42%), and had a lower BMI (22 vs 30). All of these factors have the potential to produce discrepant results.
