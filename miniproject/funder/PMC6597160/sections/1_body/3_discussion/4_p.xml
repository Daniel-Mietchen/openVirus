<p>Additionally, Martinez et al found that lower plasma zinc concentrations were associated with increases in FIB-4 scores in a cohort of HIV mono-infected and HCV co-infected persons [

Their longitudinal study (n = 487) analyzed zinc levels and FIB-4 scores over a median follow up of 34 months in a predominantly older (mean age 47) African American male population. Most participants were on ART with an undetectable HIV viral load and did not have concomitant substance use disorders; no participants reported injection drug use. Their study highlights the potential impact of zinc deficiency on liver fibrosis in the absence of multiple other factors that contribute to the progression of fibrosis (i.e., untreated HIV infection, heavy alcohol use), which were prevalent in our population. Also, this Russian study did not include black participants. Previous research suggests that there may be a moderating effect of race on the progression of fibrosis [

 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Taken together, our results along with the findings of Martinez et al suggest that the protective effect of zinc is more prominent among persons without multiple risk factors for liver fibrosis and potentially in African Americans.
