<p>In conclusion, in this study of young ART-na√Øve HIV/HCV co-infected Russians most with heavy alcohol use, we did not detect an association between zinc deficiency and accelerated onset of advanced liver fibrosis. Future studies with larger sample sizes that examine the longitudinal association between chronic zinc deficiency and the rate of liver fibrosis progression among HCV-mono-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected persons would be of interest.</p>
