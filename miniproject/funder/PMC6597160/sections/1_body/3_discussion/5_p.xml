<p>Our study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. First, this is a cross sectional study so our knowledge of the duration of zinc deficiency is limited. For example, it is plausible that our participants did not have longstanding zinc deficiency so the effects of chronic deficiency would not have been captured. Future studies should longitudinally assess the “dose effect” that duration of zinc deficiency may have on liver fibrosis. Additionally, even if we had found an association between advanced fibrosis and zinc deficiency, the cross-sectional design limits our ability to establish a causal direction. Second, this patient population has many risk factors for liver fibrosis—untreated HIV, HCV, HBV, alcohol use and injection drug use—which are all the most important factors in the development of fibrosis. These other factors may limit our ability to detect a significant impact from zinc deficiency in this exploratory analysis. Nevertheless, the results can be useful in the design of future studies that are larger in scale. Third, as this is a younger study population, our results may not be generalizable to older individuals. Since older populations likely have a longer duration of HCV infection leading to an increased likelihood of advanced liver fibrosis [

 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], those with zinc deficiency may have even more pronounced fibrosis. Fourth, we used the FIB-4 scores coupled with elastography only when FIB-4 results were in the indeterminate range. FIB-4 may lower accuracy for detecting liver fibrosis in alcoholic liver disease compared to nonalcoholic liver disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, future studies may consider using more accurate noninvasive tests of fibrosis in this population. Fifth, this is a secondary data analysis that was not designed to evaluate the relationship between zinc deficiency and advanced liver fibrosis. Post-hoc power calculations indicate that with 23% of those with normal zinc levels having advanced liver fibrosis, our study would have approximately 80% power to detect an odds ratio as small as 2.6. It, therefore, appears that this study was underpowered to detect the magnitudes of association that were observed. It, therefore, appears that this study was underpowered to detect the magnitudes of association that were observed. To this end, even the associations with HCV, HIV, and HBV—all independent determinants of fibrosis—do not reach statistical significance, therefore it is difficult to detect the association with any other exposure for which the magnitude of the effect may be smaller. Thus, we view our study as exploratory in nature. Finally, we relied on self-reported history of alcohol use, time since HIV diagnosis, and other important covariates (e.g. cocaine use), which may be under reported but may have independent effects on either zinc concentration or liver fibrosis. This is a problem that others have encountered during studies of liver fibrosis and alcohol-induced liver disease among HCV/HIV-coinfected persons [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These limitations notwithstanding, this study serves to expand the existing literature on the effects of zinc, an essential nutrient, in a unique population.
