<p>Russia is currently experiencing converging epidemics of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and alcohol use disorder [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Liver disease in people living with HIV (PLWH) is a common source of morbidity and mortality in Russia [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Among Russians who are living with HIV and also use alcohol, liver-related causes are the second most common cause of death, following HIV-related diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While HIV directly contributes to liver fibrosis, this effect is mitigated by the use of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and much of the advanced fibrosis progression and liver-related death in this population is attributable to both alcohol as well as hepatotropic viruses such as HCV [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recent estimates of HCV prevalence in Russia suggest that 3–4% of the general population is infected [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Injection drug use accounts for most HIV and HCV co-infection in Russia. Approximately 20–25% of people who inject drugs (PWID) have HIV [

 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and more than two-thirds of PWID in Russia are infected with HCV [

 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As a result, HIV/HCV co-infected PWID in Russia, where alcohol use is also highly prevalent [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], are at substantial risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality.
