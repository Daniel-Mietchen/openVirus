<p>Additionally, an estimated 8% of the Russian population is zinc deficient [

Experimental studies suggest that this association may be a consequence of zinc’s effects on the activity and availability of proteins, including the enzymes needed for the production and destruction of collagen [

 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Since collagen is a necessary component in liver fibrosis, zinc deficiency may directly contribute to advancing fibrosis. Moreover, fibrosis progression is influenced by oxidative stress and lower antioxidants. As an antioxidant, zinc has the capacity to reduce oxidative stress and, thus, slow the rate of fibrosis progression. In fact, zinc supplementation was found to reduce the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with chronic HCV infection [
