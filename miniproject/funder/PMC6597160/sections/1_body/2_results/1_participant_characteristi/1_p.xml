<p>Among the 254 trial participants, 204 met inclusion criteria for the current study. Among the 204 participants included in the final analytic sample, 65 (32%) had a plasma zinc level &lt;0.75mg/L (
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among those with zinc deficiency, median zinc level was 0.6mg/L (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5–0.7) and among those with normal zinc levels, median was 1.0mg/L (IQR 0.9–1.2). Overall, participants had the following characteristics: median age of 33 years; 25% female; diagnosed with HIV for a mean of 7.5 years; mean log
 <sub>10</sub> HIV viral load of 4.3; and mean BMI of 22.9 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup>. Injection drug use was reported in the past 30 days by 42% and 88% met criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence in the past year. Zinc supplementation or multivitamin use at baseline was reported by 9% (19/204) of participants, almost all (17/19) endorsed multivitamin use without separate zinc supplements. Among those with and without zinc deficiency, the following were common and similar: past 30-day injection drug (41% vs. 42%, p = 1.0); heavy alcohol use (95% vs. 92%, p = 0.56); alcohol abuse or dependence (88% vs 89%, p = 0.82); and self-reported HBV positivity (32% vs 36%, p = 0.54).
