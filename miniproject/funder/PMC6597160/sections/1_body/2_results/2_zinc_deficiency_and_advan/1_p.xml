<p>The prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis was similar (27.7% vs. 23.0%, p = 0.47) among those with zinc deficiency compared to those with normal zinc levels. We did not detect an association between zinc deficiency and advanced liver fibrosis in either the partially adjusted model (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62–2.53, p = 0.54) or the fully adjusted final regression model (aOR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.62–2.61, p = 0.51) (

Furthermore, no significant association was found between zinc level categorized by tertiles and advanced liver fibrosis (lowest vs. highest zinc level tertile: aOR 1.32, 95% CI: 0.56–3.12, p = 0.52; middle vs. highest zinc level tertile: aOR 1.29, 95% CI: 0.55–3.04, p = 0.56) (

Among the covariates, only CD4 count &lt;350 cells/μl was significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis (aOR, 2.2, 95% CI: 1.05–4.62, p = 0.04) in the fully adjusted model. No significant association was found between continuous zinc level and FIB-4 score using either the partially (adjusted mean difference (AMD) in FIB-4 score per 1 unit increase in zinc level: -0.51, 95% CI: -3.20–2.18, p = 0.71) or fully adjusted linear regression models (AMD per 1 unit increase in zinc level: -0.55, 95% CI: -3.24–2.13, p = 0.29).
