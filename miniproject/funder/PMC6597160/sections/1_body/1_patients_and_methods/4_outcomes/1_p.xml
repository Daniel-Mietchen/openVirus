<p>Advanced liver fibrosis at baseline was the primary outcome of interest. This was defined using validated thresholds of Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and elastography (Fibroscan). FIB-4 is calculated using age, AST, aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), and platelet count. A FIB-4 score &gt;3.25 has positive predictive value of &gt;80% with a specificity of &gt;98% for predicting advanced fibrosis [

The final definition of the primary outcomes was FIB-4&gt;3.25 or APRI≥1.5 or elastography≥10.5kPa. A secondary analysis was conducted modeling FIB-4 as a continuous variable.
