<p>Secondary analyses were conducted with zinc level categorized into tertiles (lowest tertile: zinc concentration ≤0.7646 mg/L; middle tertile: zinc concentration &gt;0.7646 mg/L and ≤0.9754 mg/L; highest tertile: zinc concentration &gt;0.9754 mg/L) and the effect on advanced liver fibrosis was examined using the same approach described above. Lastly, we used generalized additive models (GAMs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218852.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to explore modeling zinc concentrations and liver fibrosis based on FIB-4 score as continuous variables. Based on the GAMs, we subsequently used multiple linear regression models to evaluate the relationship between zinc concentrations and FIB-4 scores. Two-tailed tests and an alpha level of 0.05 were used for all tests. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, NC, USA).
