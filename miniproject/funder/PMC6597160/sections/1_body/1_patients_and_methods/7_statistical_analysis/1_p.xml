<p>We used descriptive statistics to characterize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the analytic sample, overall and stratified by zinc deficiency. We compared groups using chi square and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and t-tests and Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables, as appropriate. We estimated the proportion with advanced fibrosis by zinc deficiency status (&lt;0.75 mg/L vs ≥0.75 mg/L). Correlations between independent variables and covariates were assessed using Spearman correlation and no pair of variables included in the regression models had a correlation &gt; 0.40. We constructed a series of multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the association between zinc level and the outcome of interest, advanced liver fibrosis, controlling for potential confounding factors. We first fit a partially adjusted model that included time since HIV diagnosis, alcohol abuse or dependence, log
 <sub>10</sub> HIV viral load, and CD4 count. We then fit a fully adjusted model that additionally included age, gender, hepatitis B co-infection, and body mass index. This fully adjusted model that included all potential confounders was considered the final model.
