<p>The primary independent variable was zinc deficiency at baseline from the larger randomized trial, therefore, data do not reflect the use of zinc supplementation or placebo in the larger trial. We defined zinc deficiency as plasma zinc concentration &lt;0.75 mg/L. This is consistent with previous studies that have assessed the impact of zinc deficiency on FIB-4 (23). In secondary analyses, we categorized zinc concentration into tertiles. We performed additional exploratory analyses in which zinc concentration was treated as a continuous variable.</p>
