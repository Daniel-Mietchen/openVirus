However, understanding the underlying pathogenesis of ZIKV congenital disease has been hampered by a lack of relevant <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental models. Here we present a candidate New World monkey model of ZIKV infection in pregnant marmosets that faithfully recapitulates human disease. ZIKV inoculation at the human-equivalent of early gestation caused an asymptomatic seroconversion, induction of type I/II interferon-associated genes and proinflammatory cytokines, and persistent viremia and viruria. Spontaneous pregnancy loss was observed 16&#x02013;18 days post-infection, with extensive active placental viral replication and fetal neurocellular disorganization similar to that seen in humans. These findings underscore the key role of the placenta as a conduit for fetal infection, and demonstrate the utility of marmosets as a highly relevant model for studying congenital ZIKV disease and pregnancy loss.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne (<italic>Aedes</italic> genus) arbovirus of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Originally discovered in Uganda in 1947<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, previous outbreaks of ZIKV were largely sporadic across Southeast Asia and the equatorial African belts, but later spread east resulting in an outbreak in Yap Island in 2007, followed by epidemics in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, the Cook Islands, and Easter Island in 2013 and 2014<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The virus emerged in the Caribbean and South America in late 2014, persisting currently across the Western Hemisphere as of 2017 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html</ext-link>). The virus is geographically spread as a result of human travel from endemic regions, alongside human-to-human transmission via sexual intercourse, with blood transfusions, and via vertical maternal-fetal transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In contrast to other flaviviruses, ZIKV causes fetal loss and malformations which serve as the phenotypic basis for human congenital Zika syndrome (CZS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although no other flavivirus is known to cause disseminated fetal neural malformations in humans, worldwide concern for latent viral disease was raised following several case reports demonstrating persistent ZIKV RNA in the amniotic fluid, placenta, and fetal neural tissue weeks to months after initial maternal infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. While 80% of human infections remain asymptomatic, a minority of patients experience a self-resolving acute illness characterized by fever, rash, and/or conjunctivitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. ZIKV has also been associated with acute neurological illnesses in children and adults, including meningoencephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis, as well as Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A number of animal models of ZIKV infection have been described to date. These include several murine models in which ZIKV-associated complications in pregnant females required the use of immunodeficient animals with defects in the interferon-related signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Rhesus, pigtail, and cynomolgus macaque and squirrel monkey models of ZIKV infection have also been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Acute ZIKV infection in these nonhuman primate (NHP) models early in the course of the pregnancy have been shown to result in an average spontaneous abortion rate of 38% (Dudley <italic>et al</italic>., under review), with one study in a single pigtailed macaque demonstrating impaired neurodevelopment associated with ZIKV infection of the fetal brain and neuroprogenitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, there are several limitations to existing NHP models of viral congenital infections, including long lengths of gestation, limited mating periods associated with long intervals of lactation-induced or seasonal ovulatory suppression between pregnancies, and a large body size that makes higher biocontainment housing and testing of limited-quantity vaccines or therapeutics challenging.</p><p id="Par5">In contrast, mounting evidence over the past decade has pointed to the common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus)</italic>, a rat-sized, neotropical primate, as a relevant and convenient model for investigating viral pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The common marmoset model has been shown to reproduce the human illnesses caused by Lassa virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, Ebola/Marburg virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and flavivirus (dengue virus and West Nile virus)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> infection. We also recently reported that the course of infection in ZIKV-infected male marmosets resembles that seen in acutely infected humans in many aspects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Specifically, viral illness was subclinical, the virus persisted in body fluids such as semen and saliva for longer periods of time than in serum, and there were neutralizing antibody as well as characteristic interferon-associated host responses. Encouraged by these initial studies demonstrating that viral illness in male marmosets is akin to the human condition, we sought to determine whether infection of marmoset dams would more faithfully recapitulate maternal infection and CZS in humans when compared to murine models and provide key opportunities not afforded by other NHP models. As a nonhuman primate, the marmoset has a hemomonochorial placental architecture that develops early in pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, a situation much more similar to humans than that of the chorioallantoic placental architecture of the mouse that is only mature relatively late in gestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Moreover, we hypothesized that crucial mechanistic insights pertaining to placental infection and vertical transmission could be reached as a result of the unusual but well described characteristics of trophoblast and embryonic development in the common marmoset. Marmosets have a delayed period of embryogenesis relative to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, resulting in the marmoset undergoing critical stages of neural development in association with a relatively far more mature placenta (both structurally and in terms of duration of the placenta as a functioning organ). Here we report the outcomes of experimental infection with ZIKV in two pregnant marmoset dams, and the resultant impact on the placenta and developing fetus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental ZIKV infection of pregnant marmosets</title><p id="Par6">We inoculated 2 pregnant marmosets (dams) with Brazil ZIKV strain SPH2015 (an Asian lineage strain first isolated in 2015) at estimated gestational days 79 (Dam 1) and 68 (dam 2) with a dose at 2.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU), followed by a second inoculation with the same dose 4 days later (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Both of the aborted fetuses were friable and each had a measured biparietal diameter (BPD) that were 50% of the expected values based on the ultrasounds performed 2 and 4 days earlier; however, this is most likely due to cranial collapse and dolicocephaly typical in fetal tissue after prolonged (&#x0003e;4&#x02013;6&#x02009;hours) demise.

Canonical pathway analysis showed that the interferon signaling pathway was the top pathway significantly up-regulated at both days 2 and 7 post-infection (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>). Most of the differentially up-regulated genes corresponded to the type I interferon pathway, although both type I and type II pathways were predicted to be activated (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

Here we show that ZIKV inoculation of pregnant marmosets causes a maternal asymptomatic infection and seroconversion similar to that seen in humans. This maternal infection is measured as prolonged viremia and viruria, and is accompanied by active viral replication in the placenta, with resultant fetal infection, a predominant neuropathology of the developing fetal brain and eye, and early demise. Although atypical for non-pregnant human cases, persistence of virus in serum and urine (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. viremia and viruria) beyond 14 days and as long as 8 months has been reported in ZIKV-infected pregnant women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and is felt to be due to permissive replication in the placenta and/or fetus functioning as a viral reservoir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

We also visualized direct infection of neural progenitor cells associated with disorganized migration. The most straightforward explanation for the measured 50% expected biparietal diameter of the fetuses from dam 1 is cranial collapse following intrauterine demise; however, we also cannot rule out this finding as an early predictor of microcephaly since it is temporally and spatially accompanied by aberrant migration patterns which are hallmarks of secondary microcephaly. In 1 of the 2 inoculations, a spontaneous <italic>de novo</italic> mutation, F252L, shared in common with a ZIKV genome from a human case of microcephaly, was identified. Finally, maternal interferon-associated host responses and increased activity of proinflammatory cytokines were demonstrated at early as day 2 post-inoculation. Collectively, these findings reveal several intriguing and novel mechanistic insights pertaining to the potential roles of placental replication, mutation-driven viral adaptation, and maternal responses in ZIKV-mediated fetal pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par17">The first trimester of pregnancy in both humans and marmosets is critical for appropriate development of the major organ systems, especially the brain and its associated neuroprogenitor cells. Gestational ages of 79&#x02013;83 days (dam 1) and 68&#x02013;72 days (dam 2) at the time of inoculation correspond to approximately 6.6&#x02013;8.6 weeks in humans (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and is a time of crucial placental development in the marmoset. Indeed, the marmoset spends a third of its entire 143-day gestation invested in placentation. When compared to the human, which completes organogenesis by day 56 of a 266-day gestation, the marmoset will not complete organogenesis until day 80 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Spontaneous abortion rates in the absence of congenital viral infections at this stage are hard to document, given the small sizes of the placental and fetal material being expelled; however, the available data indicate that two abortions in this gestational age range is an unexpected, spontaneous finding. For 2016&#x02013;17, the SNPRC non-infected marmoset colony documented two abortions with placental/fetal material indicating this gestational age range out of 103 pregnancies (1.9%). The most comprehensive data documenting loss rates at this stage of marmoset pregnancy come from hormonal verification of pregnancy and pregnancy loss in a large (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;596) number of marmoset pregnancies in a research colony in Berlin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The investigators documented a pregnancy loss rate during days 80&#x02013;142 of 4.4%; our finding of 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion is thus statistically significant (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.011 by Fisher&#x02019;s Exact Test). In comparison, the overall loss rate in experimentally ZIKV-infected macaques at a comparable stage of embryonic development is 38%, as compared to expected non-infected loss rates of approximately 4&#x02013;10% (Dudley <italic>et al</italic>., under review). In humans, documented rates of pregnancy loss due to ZIKV across all 3 stages at time of infection are estimated to be ~3%, with 8% of completed pregnancies following infection during the first trimester resulting in ZIKV-associated birth defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, due to inherent limitations in the studies of miscarriages, early and mid-gestation ZIKV-induced pregnancy loss has been likely underreported and largely limited to case reports and limited retrospective series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We speculate that our observation of uniform pregnancy loss in our marmoset model is a highly significant novel finding of potential translational significance and worthy of prioritized further human studies and re-analysis of existing epidemiologic data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">Only rodents rendered deficient of type I interferon through experimental manipulations are highly susceptible to maternal-fetal transmission and resultant congenital disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It is thus important to note that in ZIKV-infected pregnant marmoset dams, maximal RNA-seq differential expression between the infected and uninfected state and significant up-regulation of interferon-associated genes in peripheral blood were observed at day 2. This early IFN systemic burst in pregnant dams is in contrast to day 9 in a previous study of ZIKV-infected male marmosets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This may reflect the enhanced susceptibility of pregnant versus non-pregnant individuals to ZIKV infection, driving a more rapid host response and resulting in higher viral loads as well as persistence in body fluids and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, it may provide crucial insight into the role of the placenta as both reservoir and conduit. We found early (day 2) increases in the concentrations of several proinflammatory molecules, including IFN-&#x003b3;, which drives the type II interferon pathway. Interestingly, an antiviral response characterized by increased interferon and proinflammatory cytokine activity has been previously reported in association with ZIKV infection of primary human placental macrophages (Hofbauer) cells and cytotrophoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Further studies are needed to determine whether viral suppression of these highly expressed maternal placental genes plays a role in the spontaneous abortions and disrupted fetal neurodevelopment seen here in association with first-trimester ZIKV infection.</p><p id="Par20">An important point of consideration for applying our current findings to human congenital disease is an appreciation of the timeline of embryonic and placental development in marmoset monkeys versus humans. Marmosets have a delayed period of embryogenesis relative to humans (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), resulting in the marmoset undergoing critical stages of neural development in association with a relatively far more mature placenta (both structurally and in terms of duration of the placenta as a functioning organ). Our findings further suggest that marmosets may be particularly sensitive to fetal Zika infection with respect to fetal loss, perhaps related to the initial infection of a relatively mature placenta when considered against their human counterparts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Our findings herein summarily show that the marmoset model faithfully recapitulates key characteristics of CZS in humans that are not observed in other rodent nor NHP models. Notably, ZIKV-infected rhesus macaques exhibited no fetal CNS abnormalities with maternal infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Pigtail macaques exhibited neural injury with severe hypoplasia and asymmetry within the occipital-parietal lobes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, but did not manifest the diffuse effects on neuroprogenitor cells observed in both the marmoset and human cases. In contrast, neuronal disorganization in ZIKV-infected pregnant marmosets was observed during early gestation at the posterior and crown in what will later comprise the occipital&#x02013;parietal lobes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We speculate that the capacity for the marmoset to better recapitulate human infection is related to ongoing placental development and trophoblast renewal, whereby the virus is permissive to replication in both placental trophoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> without evidence of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.

Nevertheless, in fetuses from both dam 1 and dam 2, the virus appears to have caused injury to the neocortex documented by histopathological examination and neuronal disorganization in the absence of localized inflammation, as also seen in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and human cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">For both ZIKV-infected marmosets and humans, fetal infection appears to be established in the absence of localized fetal and placental inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.

It has long been supposed that shuttling of bloodborne ZIKV to the developing human fetus requires establishment of maternal blood in the intervillous space, which occurs approximately at 6&#x02013;8 weeks post-conception (mean of roughly 42 days) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), or 8&#x02013;10 weeks of pregnancy, corresponding to the late first trimester. However, epidemiologic observations reveal that both first and second trimester are highly vulnerable windows of CZS susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Taken together, these findings suggest that contemporary ZIKV strains are capable of both replicating in the placenta and migrating to the developing fetus despite robust antiviral maternal responses.

Thus, our studies in both humans and marmoset reveal that the placenta likely serves both as a conduit for fetal infection and a reservoir for ongoing replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Contemporary ZIKV strains may have evolved to acquire the capacity for placental replication and fetal neuropathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Notably, viral genome sequencing showed both viruses retained the S139N mutation in the pre-membane (prM) protein (associated with increased ZIKV infectivity of neural progenitor cells and more severe microcephaly in a mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>). Of note, the African strains used in the work of Bayer <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, where they failed to see robust ZIKV replication in primary human trophoblasts, did not demonstrate the S139N mutation. The virus from dam 2 had a further <italic>de novo</italic> F252L coding mutation shared in only 1 of 6 available microcephalic ZIKV genomes in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The serendipitous finding of a F252L coding mutation is unlikely to be coincidental, as the mutation was not seen in any of the other 603 ZIKV genomes sequenced to date not associated with microcephaly (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0135). Further investigation of the potential functional significance of the F252L mutation is warranted.</p><p id="Par25">We are enthused by both the potential relevance and significance of our findings employing pregnant marmosets. First, they show that the marmoset faithfully recapitulates all crucial aspects of human CZS and does not require the exogenous manipulation of interferons, necessary in murine models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Given the capacity for the marmoset to complete multifetal gestations in 143 days and undergo repeat pregnancy within 10 days, this is an efficient model whose reproductive capacity over short time intervals rivals most rodent models. Second, these studies underscore crucial mechanistic insights pertaining to the role of the placenta in modulating (or failing to modulate) congenital infection and maternal-to-fetal transmission. Understanding the role of placental permissiveness in this process is of utmost crucial importance and reinforces the emerging notion of the placenta not as a <italic>de facto</italic> barrier, but as an active conduit for maternal and fetal communication during gestation. Thus, the identification of drugs not only to treat or prevent ZIKV infection of the fetus but also to prevent placental infection and viral transport may be critical to prevent the irreversible neuronal damage associated with CZS. Third and of potential crucial clinical importance, our findings demonstrate a high rate of pregnancy loss with maternal ZIKV infection and placental and fetal transmission. These observations should prompt reexamination of human epidemiologic data and provide additional endpoints in prospective studies as ZIKV continues to emerge in newly endemic communities in Texas, Florida, and other at-risk regions of the Americas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Marmoset inoculation and sample collection</title><p id="Par26">Animal studies were conducted at the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC), an AAALAC-accredited program.
