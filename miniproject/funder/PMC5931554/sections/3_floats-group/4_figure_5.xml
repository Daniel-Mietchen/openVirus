  <p>Maternal ZIKV infection during placentation in the marmoset yields later limited active viral replication in the fetal thorax and abdomen, with fetal expulsion 14 DPI. Dam 1 was inoculated at days 68 and 72 of gestation (human equivalent of 14 weeks). Morphometric analysis of H&amp;E stained sections revealed tissue and organ typing, with labeling of ZIKV +ssRNA and −ssRNA localized regions of active viral replication. Overall signal was diffuse across many tissues but was not stronger than placenta (Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Histological sections of the abdomen demonstrate hepatic autolysis (i, arrow) with strong +ssRNA and −ssRNA ZIKV labeling indicative of active viral replication (ii-iii). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Microscopic sections of the superior right hypochondriac anterior thorax (rib cartilage, black arrows) just superior to the liver tissue (white arrow) (Bi) with scant evidence of active viral replication by - ssRNA labeling the primitive mesenchymal and muscle tissue around the rib show signal (
   <bold>B</bold>,ii-iii). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Sections around the developing cervical vertebrae in the posterior thorax (i, arrows) with rare dual ssRNA labeling indicative of scant active ZIKV replication in the muscle and immature mesenchymal tissue. Hybridization probe-free serial-sections were used as negative controls. Dashed boxes denote the zoomed area depicted.
