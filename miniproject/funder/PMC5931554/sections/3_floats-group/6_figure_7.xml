  <p>ZIKV infected dam 1 fetus during latter stages of placentation demonstrates ongoing vertical maternal-fetal transmission with active replication in the frontal brain and fetal eye. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Low-power H&amp;E stained sagittal cross-section provided anatomic orientation for dam 1 fetus. The primitive eye (PE) with retinal pigment, eye muscle (EM) and the optic nerve (ON) are identified. Boxed areas indicate the location of ZIKV probed in serial sections (
   <bold>B</bold>â€“
   <bold>D</bold>). The most highly infected area within the fetal head cross section was found to be the mesenchymal cells of the ocular muscle (Bii,iii).
