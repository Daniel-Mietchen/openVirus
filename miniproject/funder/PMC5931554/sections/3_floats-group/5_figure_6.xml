  <p>Maternal ZIKV infection during placentation renders significant latter neurophthalmic viral replication. Tissues in the fetus from dam 2 were identified based on morphology using H&amp;E stained sections under low (
   <bold>A</bold>) and medium power (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Shown is a frontal cross section taken immediately posterior to the eye. Visible features are identified in an H&amp;E stained section, including orbital bone, ocular muscles and nerves, as well as cortical plate of the frontal brain (i). Areas immediately posterior to the eye, inclusive of the ocular muscle and socket, demonstrated active viral replication as measured by dual labeling of both ssRNA strands (ii-iii, arrows). (
   <bold>B</bold>) A boxed area from the same slide at higher magnification showing nerve. Although relatively acellular, the perineurium is constituted of macrophage-like epithelioid myofibroblasts (i, dashed line). Perineural cells around a nerve focally showed the highest replication (ii,iii). (
   <bold>C</bold>) A boxed area at higher magnification showing brain. Cortical plate (CP) neurons are seen to be strongly infected (arrows).
