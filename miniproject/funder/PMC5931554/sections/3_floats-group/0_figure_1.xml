  <p>Study overview and results from viral load and antibody testing. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Timeline showing days of sample collection before and following ZIKV inoculation at day 0, including collection of placental and fetal samples at time of fetal demise and expulsion (16â€“18 days post-inoculation). Measured Ab titers at days 7 and 30 post-inoculation for dam 1, and at days -5, 2, 7, and 30 post-inoculation for dam 2 are also given. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Viral loads in serially collected body fluids. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Flow chart describing analysis of placental and fetal samples. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Viral loads in maternal tissues at time of necropsy, and in fetal/placental tissues at time of fetal demise. The error bars shown for the fetal/placental viral loads are based on multiple tissue replicates. Abbreviations: gd, gestational day; wk, week.
