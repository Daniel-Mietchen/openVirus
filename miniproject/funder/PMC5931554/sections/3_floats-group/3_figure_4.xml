   <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization + and − single strand RNA (ssRNA) oligonucleotide probes in spontaneously aborted marmoset (dam 2) placental tissue. The concomitant labeling of both + and − ssRNA is indicative of actively replicating ZIKV. Villous sections were hybridized using amplified probe sets against the +ssRNA the −ssRNA genome to localize active viral replication in the placenta. Fixed Vero cells actively replicating ZIKV at 6 DPI were used as positive controls (
   <bold>A</bold>). Placental tissue sections were highly positive for the presence of genomic RNA in villous parenchyma (
   <bold>B</bold>,i-ii). Furthermore, ubiquitous detection via ISH of the negative replication strand indicated ZIKV as established in the fetal-placental tissue of the chorionic villi (
   <bold>B</bold>,iii-iv). A probe set against human peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPID) mRNA was used as a negative control (
   <bold>B</bold>,v-vi). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Examination of H&amp;E stained sections of the placental villous revealed no leukocyte infiltration. Dashed boxes denote the zoomed area depicted at high power (60X).
