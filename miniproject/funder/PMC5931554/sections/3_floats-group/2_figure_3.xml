  <p>Immunohistochemical 4G2 antibody labeling against Flavivirus E-protein in the placenta of a ZIKV infected marmoset dam. The pregnant adult marmoset (dam 2) was inoculated at days 79 and 83 of gestation (human equivalent of 14 weeks). Placental tissue was collected upon expulsion following spontaneous abortion occurring 16 days post-infection (DPI). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Vero cells replicating ZIKV were fixed at 6 DPI as positive control (4G2) (Ai); to control for non-specific labeling, ZIKV infected Vero cells were probed with only secondary antibody (negative) (Aii). (
   <bold>B</bold>) 4G2-specific chromogenic signal is apparent with 
   <italic>in situ</italic> labeling of marmoset placental villi in the parenchyma (Bi) but not negative controls (Bii,iv). Areas imaged at 60x high power (
   <bold>B</bold>,i-ii) are indicated by dashed boxes in B iii and iv (4G2 labeled and negative control, respectively).
