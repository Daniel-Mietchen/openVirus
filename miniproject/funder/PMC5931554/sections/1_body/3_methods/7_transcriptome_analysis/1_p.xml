<p id="Par34">Prior to inoculation, whole blood was drawn from the two age-/sex-matched healthy pregnant dams in the ZIKV study to use as internal controls in the transcriptome analysis. All marmosets studied here were from a single colony, thus increasing genetic similarities and decreasing environmental bias. 400 uL microliters of blood were drawn directly into RNAgard tubes (Biomatrica) for immediate RNA stabilization of intracellular RNA at time of collection. Total RNA was extracted using the Biomatrica Blood RNA Purification Kit (Biomatrica). The Ovation Human Blood RNA-Seq Kit (Nugen, San Carlos, CA) was used to generate RNA-seq libraries from 100 ng of input per sample (as measured using the Invitrogen Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were sequenced in duplicate as 100 bp paired-end runs on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument.</p>
