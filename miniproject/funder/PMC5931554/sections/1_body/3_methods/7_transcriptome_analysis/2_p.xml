<p id="Par35">Paired-end reads were mapped to the marmoset genome (
 <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> Ensembl version 3.2.1), using STAR 2.5
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>
 </sup>, and gene and transcript normalized counts were calculated by HTSeq version 0.6.0
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>
 </sup>. Differential expression of genes was calculated using linear modeling using the Bioconductor EdgeR software package version 3.12.2
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup>, as implemented in the R programming language. Genes were considered to be differentially expressed when their fold change was &gt;±2, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05, and adjusted 
 <italic>p</italic>-value (or false discovery rate, FDR) &lt; 0.1%. Pathway and network analyses of the transcriptome data were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen). Marmoset transcriptome data has been submitted to the public National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (accession numbers pending).
