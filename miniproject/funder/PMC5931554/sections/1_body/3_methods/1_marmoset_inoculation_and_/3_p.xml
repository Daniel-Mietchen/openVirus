<p id="Par28">Following ZIKV infection, pregnant dams were monitored daily for symptoms. Both females gained weight over the period from inoculation to abortion (0.4 grams −1.5 grams per day), within or exceeding the published range of weight gain for pregnant dams at mid-term (0.39–0.71 grams/day)

 </sup>. Urine, blood, and saliva were sampled and serially monitored for ZIKV RNA by qPCR testing per a pre-established schedule (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). For the 2 female marmosets, blood samples to obtain serum were collected via venipuncture on days -5, 2, 7 and 30; voided urine was collected on days -5, 2, 7, 9, 10, 14, 21, and 28; saliva was collected on days -5, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 30 by allowing the subjects to chew on a sterile cotton swab. Whole blood samples for transcriptome analysis were collected for dam 1 on days 7 and 30 and for dam 2 on days -5, 2, 7, and 30 in tubes containing RNA stabilization media (Biomatrica, Inc.). At day 30, both female marmosets were euthanized and their necropsy tissues examined for persistent ZIKV infection (Fig.
