 </sup>, followed by a second identical inoculation 4 days later. The gestational age of the embryos at the time of inoculation was determined by crown-rump length, which we have previously demonstrated to provide a reliable gestational age to within +/−3 days

 </sup>. Embryonic growth was tracked by ultrasonography performed on unsedated animals. For dam 1, ultrasound exams took place on days 80, 88, and 93, confirming two live embryos with biparietal diameters as expected for those ages. Ultrasounds on dam 2 were on days 78 and 82, confirming one live embryo. In each case, the number of embryos was consistent from pre-dosing screening through the infection period.
