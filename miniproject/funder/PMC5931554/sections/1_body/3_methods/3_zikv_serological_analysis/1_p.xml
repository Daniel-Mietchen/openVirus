<p id="Par30">Plaque-reduction neutralization assay (PRNT) on longitudinally collected marmoset sera was performed by the California Department of Public Health, using a protocol adapted from that used by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for confirmatory ZIKV testing in patients. Briefly, 100 plaque forming units (PFU) of ZIKV (Brazilian SPH2015 strain) were mixed with equal volumes of serial 2-fold dilutions of inactivated marmoset sera and incubated for 1 hr at 36 °C, followed by inoculation and adsorbing to a monolayer culture of Vero cells for 1 hr at 36 °C. After addition of 3 mL of 0.6% agar in Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (MEM), plates were placed in a 36 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 3 days, followed by addition of 3 mL of 1% agar and 0.004% neutral red in Eagle’s MEM and another 1–2 days of incubation until plaques were formed. An 80% or more reduction of the number of plaques compared to positive control wells inoculated with virus-diluent mixtures was considered neutralization, with serum titers reported as the highest dilution exhibiting 80% or more reduction.
