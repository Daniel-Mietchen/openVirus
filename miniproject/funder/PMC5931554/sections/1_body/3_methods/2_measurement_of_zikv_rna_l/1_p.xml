<p id="Par29">The course of infection in inoculated marmosets was monitored by determination of ZIKV RNA loads (expressed as RNA copies/mL) in infected body fluids (serum, urine, and saliva) and placental and fetal tissues. ZIKV RNA loads were calculated by generation of a standard curve, followed by quantitative RT-PCR testing for 45 cycles using published PCR conditions and primers targeting the envelope gene (ZIKV-1086/ZIKV-1162)

 </sup>. By standard curve analysis, the estimated limit of detection for the qRT-PCR assay was ~15 RNA copies per mL.
