<p id="Par31">Nucleic acid was extracted from 50 μg of placenta or fetus lysate, 50 μL of body fluid sample (serum, urine, or saliva), or 100 μL of viral culture inoculum using the automated Qiagen EZ1 instrument (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), followed by treatment with Turbo DNase (Thermo-Fisher, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using a 1:5 mix of random hexamer and short spiked primers targeting ZIKV genomes (ref). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), followed by single-end, 150 base pair (bp) sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq. 2500 instrument. Raw reads were preprocessed by adapter trimming and removal of low-quality, low-complexity sequences as previously described

 </sup>. Data was scanned for ZIKV reads using an NCBI BLASTn database constructed from all known ZIKV sequences as of October 2017, using an E-value significance threshold of 1 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>. Consensus ZIKV genomes were assembled using Geneious (v10.2.2) by mapping preprocessed ZIKV reads to reference genome KU321639.
