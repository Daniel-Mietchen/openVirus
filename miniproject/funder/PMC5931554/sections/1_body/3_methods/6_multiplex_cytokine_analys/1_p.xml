<p id="Par33">Plasma samples were analyzed for marmoset cytokines and chemokines by Luminex using established protocols for New World primates (Giavedoni, LD. Journal of Immunological Methods 301, 89–101, 2005). Evaluation of analytes GRO-α (CSCL1), interferon alpha (IFN-α), IFN-γ, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-22, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1, CCL2), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG, CXCL9), macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1α, CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES, CCL5), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) were included in this assay. Only analytes quantifiable above the limit of detection are presented.</p>
