<p id="Par23">Our results here document a definitive role for early infection of a maturing placenta in the response to ZIKV infection during the critical period of fetal neurodevelopment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We observed (1) active and robust ZIKV replication in the absence of local inflammation, (2) a maternal host response dominated by interferon type I and II-associated genes and proinflammatory cytokines, and (3) evidence of a functional placenta (normal amniotic fluid volume) and viable fetus despite viral replication and disruption of neuronal migration in developing brain and eye demise. Taken together, these findings suggest that contemporary ZIKV strains are capable of both replicating in the placenta and migrating to the developing fetus despite robust antiviral maternal responses. Our findings are consistent with previous work showing that multiple placental cell types, including macrophages, cytotrophoblasts, and primary human trophoblasts, are permissive to ZIKV infection
