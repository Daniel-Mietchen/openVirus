The serendipitous finding of a F252L coding mutation is unlikely to be coincidental, as the mutation was not seen in any of the other 603 ZIKV genomes sequenced to date not associated with microcephaly (p = 0.0135). Further investigation of the potential functional significance of the F252L mutation is warranted.
