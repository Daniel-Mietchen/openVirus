<p id="Par20">An important point of consideration for applying our current findings to human congenital disease is an appreciation of the timeline of embryonic and placental development in marmoset monkeys versus humans. Marmosets have a delayed period of embryogenesis relative to humans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), resulting in the marmoset undergoing critical stages of neural development in association with a relatively far more mature placenta (both structurally and in terms of duration of the placenta as a functioning organ). Our findings further suggest that marmosets may be particularly sensitive to fetal Zika infection with respect to fetal loss, perhaps related to the initial infection of a relatively mature placenta when considered against their human counterparts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
