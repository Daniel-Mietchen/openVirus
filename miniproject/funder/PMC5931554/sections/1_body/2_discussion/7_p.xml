 </sup>. It has long been supposed that shuttling of bloodborne ZIKV to the developing human fetus requires establishment of maternal blood in the intervillous space, which occurs approximately at 6–8 weeks post-conception (mean of roughly 42 days) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), or 8–10 weeks of pregnancy, corresponding to the late first trimester. However, epidemiologic observations reveal that both first and second trimester are highly vulnerable windows of CZS susceptibility

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. It has thus been unclear whether CZS susceptibility in the first trimester may relate to leaks in placental architecture or shifting antiviral capacity of the maturing trophoblast
