<p id="Par25">We are enthused by both the potential relevance and significance of our findings employing pregnant marmosets. First, they show that the marmoset faithfully recapitulates all crucial aspects of human CZS and does not require the exogenous manipulation of interferons, necessary in murine models

 </sup>. Given the capacity for the marmoset to complete multifetal gestations in 143 days and undergo repeat pregnancy within 10 days, this is an efficient model whose reproductive capacity over short time intervals rivals most rodent models. Second, these studies underscore crucial mechanistic insights pertaining to the role of the placenta in modulating (or failing to modulate) congenital infection and maternal-to-fetal transmission. Understanding the role of placental permissiveness in this process is of utmost crucial importance and reinforces the emerging notion of the placenta not as a 
 <italic>de facto</italic> barrier, but as an active conduit for maternal and fetal communication during gestation. Thus, the identification of drugs not only to treat or prevent ZIKV infection of the fetus but also to prevent placental infection and viral transport may be critical to prevent the irreversible neuronal damage associated with CZS. Third and of potential crucial clinical importance, our findings demonstrate a high rate of pregnancy loss with maternal ZIKV infection and placental and fetal transmission. These observations should prompt reexamination of human epidemiologic data and provide additional endpoints in prospective studies as ZIKV continues to emerge in newly endemic communities in Texas, Florida, and other at-risk regions of the Americas.
