<p id="Par17">The first trimester of pregnancy in both humans and marmosets is critical for appropriate development of the major organ systems, especially the brain and its associated neuroprogenitor cells. Gestational ages of 79–83 days (dam 1) and 68–72 days (dam 2) at the time of inoculation correspond to approximately 6.6–8.6 weeks in humans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), and is a time of crucial placental development in the marmoset. Indeed, the marmoset spends a third of its entire 143-day gestation invested in placentation. When compared to the human, which completes organogenesis by day 56 of a 266-day gestation, the marmoset will not complete organogenesis until day 80 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Spontaneous abortion rates in the absence of congenital viral infections at this stage are hard to document, given the small sizes of the placental and fetal material being expelled; however, the available data indicate that two abortions in this gestational age range is an unexpected, spontaneous finding. For 2016–17, the SNPRC non-infected marmoset colony documented two abortions with placental/fetal material indicating this gestational age range out of 103 pregnancies (1.9%). The most comprehensive data documenting loss rates at this stage of marmoset pregnancy come from hormonal verification of pregnancy and pregnancy loss in a large (n = 596) number of marmoset pregnancies in a research colony in Berlin

 </sup>. The investigators documented a pregnancy loss rate during days 80–142 of 4.4%; our finding of 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected pregnancies resulting in spontaneous abortion is thus statistically significant (p = 0.011 by Fisher’s Exact Test). In comparison, the overall loss rate in experimentally ZIKV-infected macaques at a comparable stage of embryonic development is 38%, as compared to expected non-infected loss rates of approximately 4–10% (Dudley 
 <italic>et al</italic>., under review). In humans, documented rates of pregnancy loss due to ZIKV across all 3 stages at time of infection are estimated to be ~3%, with 8% of completed pregnancies following infection during the first trimester resulting in ZIKV-associated birth defects

 </sup>. However, due to inherent limitations in the studies of miscarriages, early and mid-gestation ZIKV-induced pregnancy loss has been likely underreported and largely limited to case reports and limited retrospective series

 </sup>. We speculate that our observation of uniform pregnancy loss in our marmoset model is a highly significant novel finding of potential translational significance and worthy of prioritized further human studies and re-analysis of existing epidemiologic data
