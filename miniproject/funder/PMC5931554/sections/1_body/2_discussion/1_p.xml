 </sup>. Here we show that ZIKV inoculation of pregnant marmosets causes a maternal asymptomatic infection and seroconversion similar to that seen in humans. This maternal infection is measured as prolonged viremia and viruria, and is accompanied by active viral replication in the placenta, with resultant fetal infection, a predominant neuropathology of the developing fetal brain and eye, and early demise. Although atypical for non-pregnant human cases, persistence of virus in serum and urine (

 </sup>. In both inoculated dams, spontaneous abortion was observed 16–18 days post infection, with extensive productive viral infection in the placenta and fetal tissues documented by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and ISH for (+) and (−) ssRNA strands. We also visualized direct infection of neural progenitor cells associated with disorganized migration. The most straightforward explanation for the measured 50% expected biparietal diameter of the fetuses from dam 1 is cranial collapse following intrauterine demise; however, we also cannot rule out this finding as an early predictor of microcephaly since it is temporally and spatially accompanied by aberrant migration patterns which are hallmarks of secondary microcephaly. In 1 of the 2 inoculations, a spontaneous 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutation, F252L, shared in common with a ZIKV genome from a human case of microcephaly, was identified. Finally, maternal interferon-associated host responses and increased activity of proinflammatory cytokines were demonstrated at early as day 2 post-inoculation. Collectively, these findings reveal several intriguing and novel mechanistic insights pertaining to the potential roles of placental replication, mutation-driven viral adaptation, and maternal responses in ZIKV-mediated fetal pathogenesis.
