 </sup>. It is thus important to note that in ZIKV-infected pregnant marmoset dams, maximal RNA-seq differential expression between the infected and uninfected state and significant up-regulation of interferon-associated genes in peripheral blood were observed at day 2. This early IFN systemic burst in pregnant dams is in contrast to day 9 in a previous study of ZIKV-infected male marmosets

 </sup>. This may reflect the enhanced susceptibility of pregnant versus non-pregnant individuals to ZIKV infection, driving a more rapid host response and resulting in higher viral loads as well as persistence in body fluids and tissues

 </sup>. In addition, it may provide crucial insight into the role of the placenta as both reservoir and conduit. We found early (day 2) increases in the concentrations of several proinflammatory molecules, including IFN-γ, which drives the type II interferon pathway. Interestingly, an antiviral response characterized by increased interferon and proinflammatory cytokine activity has been previously reported in association with ZIKV infection of primary human placental macrophages (Hofbauer) cells and cytotrophoblasts

 </sup>. Here we observed extensive ZIKV infection of the placenta and fetus in the absence of overt inflammation and despite induction of a robust host antiviral response. This is consistent with ours and others recently described human placental pathogenesis
