<p id="Par7">Serum, saliva, and urine samples were collected longitudinally at 
 <italic>a priori</italic>-determined specific intervals, including a pre-infection sample taken 5 days before infection, and for up to 30 days following inoculation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Viral RNA loads were measured in body fluids and tissues by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Detectable viral loads up to 3 weeks post-inoculation and seroconversion by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) confirmed both active viral replication and acquired adaptive immunity, respectively Specifically, ZIKV was detectable in the serum for at least 1 week following inoculation by qRT-PCR, with a day 2 peak viral load of ~10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mL, while ZIKV levels in urine and saliva peaked at later time points (day 10 and day 7) and persisted for 2 and 3 weeks respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Both marmosets were seronegative prior to infection (Ab titers &lt;1:20) and seroconverted at 30 days post-infection with positive titers of 1:2560 for Dam 1 and 1:640 for dam 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>).
