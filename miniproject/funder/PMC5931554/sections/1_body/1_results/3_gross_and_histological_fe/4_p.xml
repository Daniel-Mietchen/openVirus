 </sup>, close examination of fetal cranium and its contents from both dam 1 and dam 2 fetuses was made to characterize and anatomically localize cephalic viral infection and replication. The ophthalmic and cerebral regions of a frontally sectioned head of dam 2 fetus were examined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). ZIKV signal from both positive viral genomic and negative replication strands was present behind the eye in the muscle and surrounding tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, arrows). Among the strongest cephalic signal was from the perineurium region of an intra-orbital nerve, likely ophthalmic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Neuroprogenitor cells (NP) of the developing cortical plate were also highly infected and shown to be actively replicating ZIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>, arrows). Similarly, the optic nerve and anatomy of the eye was most clearly visualized from a sagittal H&amp;E stained section in the fetus of dam 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>), with the strongest ZIKV-ISH signal in the fetal head occurring in ocular muscle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>) and with evidence of active viral replication (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Although the ZIKV signal was weaker in the brain of the fetus from dam 1 relative to the fetus from dam 2, areas of infection and active ZIKV replication were clearly observed (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), with H&amp;E sections showing regions of disorganization within the cortical neurons indicating a disruption in development and neuronal migration patterns of the cerebral cortex (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).
