<p id="Par9">Two days prior to fetal demise and expulsion, Dam 1 was confirmed by fetal sonogram to carry a live dichorionic, diamniotic twin gestation with normal amniotic fluid volumes and cardiac activity. The spontaneous demise and delivery of the twin fetuses and their placentae were discovered approximately 20–36 hours after expulsion (3 days post sonogram). Both of the aborted fetuses were friable and each had a measured biparietal diameter (BPD) that were 50% of the expected values based on the ultrasounds performed 2 and 4 days earlier; however, this is most likely due to cranial collapse and dolicocephaly typical in fetal tissue after prolonged (&gt;4–6 hours) demise. One twin fetus was immediately placed in formalin for the histological analyses, while the other fetus was dissected for RNA viral load testing (Fig.
