<p id="Par10">For dam 2, early gestational sonogram at 56 days, prior to ZIKV inoculation, revealed a singleton gestation, an indication of early intrauterine demise of one of the fetuses that occurs in approximately 10–15% of marmoset pregnancies

 </sup>, in a number of instances they have been shown to carry singleton fetuses successfully to term

 </sup>. After confirming a continuing developing viable singleton gestation, dam 2 was infected with 2 ZIKV inoculums on days 68 and 72. A viable singleton gestation was confirmed on day 82 and subsequently demised with fetal expulsion on day 86. The single expulsed fetus and its placenta were immediately recovered; the head was formalin-fixed for histology while the body was dissected for RNA viral load testing (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of the placenta alongside positive and negative controls were assessed for the presence of ZIKV using 4G2 antibody against a flavivirus envelope protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A,B</xref>). The villous parenchyma stained strongly positive for ZIKV protein by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). 
 <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH), targeting positive-strand ZIKV RNA and its corresponding negative-strand replicative intermediate, established the presence of viral genomic RNA and active replication within placental tissue, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B)</xref>. Positive signal for genomic ZIKV RNA strands was adjacent to the nucleus, consistent with the establishment of flaviviral replication factories in the endoplasmic reticulum

 </sup>. The ZIKV protein immuno-staining overlapped with the hybridization positive and negative strand signals, with comparatively much stronger signal from the stable viral genomic strand (+) compared to the replication (−) strand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Despite clear evidence of extensive placental infection by ZIKV, examination of histological sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) revealed no leukocyte infiltration and inflammation in the placenta (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>); this is consistent with absence of placental inflammation observed in human CZS
