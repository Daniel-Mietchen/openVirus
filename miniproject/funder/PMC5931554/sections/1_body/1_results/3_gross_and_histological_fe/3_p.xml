<p id="Par11">Having established that the placenta in dam 2 actively harbored and propagated ZIKV, we next examined the abdomen and thorax from the dam 1 fetus for evidence of infection using the ISH (+) and (−) strand probes, reserving the corresponding abdomen and thorax from the dam 2 fetus for viral load testing (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). H&amp;E stained sections were used to identify the primitive organs and tissues of the developing fetus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). The hepatic tissue of the animal appeared highly autolyzed, consistent with the prolonged 20–36 hour post-expulsion period, but other tissues and structures were well preserved, with bone or developing cartilage of vertebrae and ribs, and surrounding muscle and primitive mesenchymal tissue apparent and readily identifiable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5Ai</xref>). The fetal thorax and abdomen were diffusely positive for ZIKV hybridization of both + and − RNA strands, with the strongest signal in liver tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5Bii</xref>); however, ZIKV-specific hybridization of either strand was not stronger than that measured in the placenta (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Differentiated bone and cartilage did not hybridize with either positive or negative strand probes of ZIKV, whereas viral infection of the surrounding muscle and mesenchymal progenitor tissue was apparent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B,C</xref>) with evident active viral replication (- strand ISH, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A–C,iii</xref>). As with placenta, there was no evidence of inflammation in the fetal tissues despite the apparent extensive infection (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
