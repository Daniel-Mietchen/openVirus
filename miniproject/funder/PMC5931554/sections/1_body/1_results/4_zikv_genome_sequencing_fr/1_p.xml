<p id="Par13">ZIKV genome sequencing from tissues and body fluids, done in parallel from the original inoculum, was performed to identify mutations arising after infection. In the infected placenta and singleton aborted fetus from dam 2, a single consensus coding mutation (99.5% frequency) was identified in the matrix protein resulting in an amino acid change from phenylalanine to leucine (F252L) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). In contrast, this mutation was present in the original ZIKV inoculum at a frequency of 0.3%. Given that this is comparable to the Illumina error rate of 0.1%
