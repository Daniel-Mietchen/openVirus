<p id="Par14">Whole blood from both the asymptomatic ZIKV-infected dams collected at post-infection days 2 (for only 1 of 2 dams), 7, and 30 were collected for transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq, and compared to whole blood samples drawn from the same animals prior to ZIKV inoculation. Each sample was sequenced in duplicate to increase statistical power. The average sequencing depth was 23.9 M reads per sample (±6.7 M reads) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), and STAR/Cufflinks detected an average of 55.1% (±9.8%) of all Ensembl isoforms in each sample.
