<p id="Par15">We analyzed the RNA-seq data for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 2, 7, and 30 days post-infection relative to the uninfected baseline. Distinct from our previously published in male marmosets, in which maximal differential expression was observed at day 7 post-ZIKV infection

 </sup>, differential gene expression in pregnant marmoset dams peaked by day 2 post-infection, returning to near baseline by day 30 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Canonical pathway analysis showed that the interferon signaling pathway was the top pathway significantly up-regulated at both days 2 and 7 post-infection (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2A</xref>). Most of the differentially up-regulated genes corresponded to the type I interferon pathway, although both type I and type II pathways were predicted to be activated (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Cytokine profiling assays showed increases in activity of a number of proinflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2B</xref>). After subtracting DEGs found in common with ZIKV-infected male marmosets

 </sup> to evaluate the 29 remaining DEGs at day 7 for those that may be playing a role in the fetal loss and neuropathology (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Two such candidate genes among the 29 were identified: TRPV6, a member of the TRP membrane family that plays a role in maternal-fetal Ca
