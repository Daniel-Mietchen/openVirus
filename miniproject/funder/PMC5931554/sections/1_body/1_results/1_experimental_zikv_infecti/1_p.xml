<p id="Par6">We inoculated 2 pregnant marmosets (dams) with Brazil ZIKV strain SPH2015 (an Asian lineage strain first isolated in 2015) at estimated gestational days 79 (Dam 1) and 68 (dam 2) with a dose at 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU), followed by a second inoculation with the same dose 4 days later (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Gestational age prior to inoculation was confirmed by fetal sonogram with biometry and crown-rump length (CRL) measurements. The chosen gestational windows span the ongoing and prolonged periods of placentation in marmosets, as well as critical phases of embryonic neurodevelopment (Carnegie embryonic stages 16–23; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Both animals were assessed daily for evidence of clinical signs of illness, and remained asymptomatic following inoculation until delivery. Spontaneous expulsion of intrauterine demised fetuses at days 16 and 18 post-inoculation occurred for dams 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Fetuses (dichorionic, diamniotic twins for Dam 1, singleton for dam 2) were documented via ultrasonography to be alive 2 and 4 days prior to fetal demise and expulsion, respectively.
