<p id="Par4">A number of animal models of ZIKV infection have been described to date. These include several murine models in which ZIKV-associated complications in pregnant females required the use of immunodeficient animals with defects in the interferon-related signaling pathways

 </sup>. Acute ZIKV infection in these nonhuman primate (NHP) models early in the course of the pregnancy have been shown to result in an average spontaneous abortion rate of 38% (Dudley

 </sup>. However, there are several limitations to existing NHP models of viral congenital infections, including long lengths of gestation, limited mating periods associated with long intervals of lactation-induced or seasonal ovulatory suppression between pregnancies, and a large body size that makes higher biocontainment housing and testing of limited-quantity vaccines or therapeutics challenging.
