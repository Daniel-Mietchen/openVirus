<p id="Par5">In contrast, mounting evidence over the past decade has pointed to the common marmoset (

 </sup> infection. We also recently reported that the course of infection in ZIKV-infected male marmosets resembles that seen in acutely infected humans in many aspects

 </sup>. Specifically, viral illness was subclinical, the virus persisted in body fluids such as semen and saliva for longer periods of time than in serum, and there were neutralizing antibody as well as characteristic interferon-associated host responses. Encouraged by these initial studies demonstrating that viral illness in male marmosets is akin to the human condition, we sought to determine whether infection of marmoset dams would more faithfully recapitulate maternal infection and CZS in humans when compared to murine models and provide key opportunities not afforded by other NHP models. As a nonhuman primate, the marmoset has a hemomonochorial placental architecture that develops early in pregnancy
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>, a situation much more similar to humans than that of the chorioallantoic placental architecture of the mouse that is only mature relatively late in gestation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, we hypothesized that crucial mechanistic insights pertaining to placental infection and vertical transmission could be reached as a result of the unusual but well described characteristics of trophoblast and embryonic development in the common marmoset. Marmosets have a delayed period of embryogenesis relative to humans
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>, resulting in the marmoset undergoing critical stages of neural development in association with a relatively far more mature placenta (both structurally and in terms of duration of the placenta as a functioning organ). Here we report the outcomes of experimental infection with ZIKV in two pregnant marmoset dams, and the resultant impact on the placenta and developing fetus.
