<p id="p0089">The data points that have been clustered (by the Mapper Algorithm) into the yellow vertices of the simplicial complex correspond exclusively to all the late (26 and 31 hpc) time points of the co-infection group (IAV + T4); the rest of the data points (all other time points in the co-infection and all the data in the single viral (IAV) and single bacterial (T4) infection groups) have been grouped together by the mapper algorithm and clustered into the vertices colored teal/purple. In other words, the Mapper Algorithm has segregated those specific points (26hpc and 31hpc in the co-infection) away from all other points, indicating that the data behaves differently at and after 26hpc in the co-infection scenario, compared to the other points. This, we interpret as the immune system undergoing a shift in its behaviour in the co-infection, sometime between 18 and 26Â h post co-infection. From this observation we conclude that the topological data analysis has highlighted a transition in the nature of the immune response during a co-infection sometime between 18 and 26 hours post co-infection.</p>
