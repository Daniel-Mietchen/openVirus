<p id="p0093">In the simplicial complexes illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> in both the T4 single infection and co-infection (IAV + T4) groups the simplicial complexes generated with the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> projection draw attention to the later time points in both infection scenarios. Specifically, for T4, the points correspond to time 26 hpc and in IAV + T4 the data sets correspond to times 26 and 31 hpc. 
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> highlights that in both the single bacterial infection and in the co-infection, the concentration of the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> cytokine changes significantly between 18 and 26 hours post the onset of the bacterial infection. Our previous analysis 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> of experimental results for TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> showed levels were increasingly and significantly elevated in co-infected mice from 18 hpi on. Therefore the simplicial complexes in 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> of the single bacterial infection and the co-infection generated by the projection to TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> are exactly revealing this dramatic change in the concentration of this cytokine at this late stage in the course of the co-infection.
