 <xref rid="fig0008" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 8</xref>A, now looking at the neighbours of the co-infection data subsets outside of the orange dotted box and inside the green dotted boxes (i.e. along the rows), we can see that co-infection data sets at early times also have neighbours exclusively in the IAV single infection group and co-infection data sets at late times also have neighbours exclusively in the T4 single infection group. In other words, the early co-infection data sets are closely correlated with the data sets in the IAV single infection group and the late co-infection data sets are closely correlated with the data sets in the T4 single infection group. Putting these three observations together, we can conclude that the immune response in the co-infection inherits its early response from the primary viral infection but at 6 hpc it undergoes a shift and quickly shapes its response to defend against the secondary bacterial infection.
