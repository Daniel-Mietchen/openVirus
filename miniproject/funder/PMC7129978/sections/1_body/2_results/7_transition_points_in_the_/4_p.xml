<p id="p0090">In order to interpret more precisely why the mapper algorithm is highlighting the specific regions illustrated inside the yellow circles, we calculated the p-values between groups of data points at consecutive time points, for each feature of the data (
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ); we also made box plots to compare the data belonging to the two groups separated by the simplicial complex in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> corresponding to lens 2 = IL-6 (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The p-values show that, in the co-infection scenario, there is a strong change in the concentration of the cytokines TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, MCP-1 and IL-6 (as well as in the viral load) between 18 and 26 hpc. The boxplots clearly revealed that data points of IAV + T4 from 26 and 31 h post co-infection are separated by the simplicial complex from the earlier data points and that 18 and 26 hpc represent a transition point for the system, since at both time points there are data subsets that belong to both groups in the simplicial complex (the yellow and the teal/purple). It is possible that the shape of the simplicial complexes in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> is exactly mirrowing the dramatic change in the concentration of the cytokines (and possibly the viral load) that is revealed by the 
 <italic>p</italic>-values.
