 <xref rid="fig0008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> A shows the k-nearest neighbours for the data sets in the three infection groups, with metric correlation and 30 neighbours. The rows and columns indicate each data points and dark regions indicate the 30 closest neighbours of each data point. The labels show which points belong to which infection group and time point. The bottom right panel, inside the orange dotted box, corresponds specifically to the data points of the co-infection group (IAV + T4). The data sets in this region can be divided into three groups: the early period (1.5 hpc), the transition period (6 hpc) and the later period (between 18 and 31 hpc). This is illustrated by the fact that within the orange dotted box, the data sets at 1.5 hpc are neighbours with only data sets at 1.5 and 6.0 hpc, the data sets in 6 hcp have neighbours in both the early and the later groups and data sets at 18, 26 and 31 hpc have neighbours only at 6 hpc and late time points. This can be seen more clearly in 
 <xref rid="fig0008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>B which shows the correlation coefficients between data points in the co-infection data set. Data sets at 1.5 hpc are closely correlated to themselves, data sets at 6 hpc have close correlation to points in both the early and later periods, the later data sets (18, 26 and 31 hpc) are closely correlated to themselves only. Data sets between the early and later groups are not correlated.
