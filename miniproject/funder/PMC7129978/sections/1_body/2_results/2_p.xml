<p id="p0078">In the context of infectious diseases from which hosts can recover (e.g. malaria, influenza, pneumococci, etc), disease maps that form loops are representative of the trajectory from health, through infection and sickness and back to recovery or death 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In particular, disease space with looping behaviour and disease maps that are circular can be used to, for example: 1.) describe the in-host dynamics of infections; 2.) identify where data of patients lie along the infection timeline, regardless of whether the stage of the infection is known (for example, from cross-sectional studies or from data of patients coming clinics to be treated, at different (and unknown) stages of the infection); and 3.) distinguish between more and less resilient individuals, from a relatively early stage of the infection course. This methodology was applied in 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> to investigate malaria. Motivated from this approach, we investigated if looping curves are a common motif in influenza or influenza in co-infection with bacteria. To that end, we also generated phase plots of pairs of features of our data sets and used K-nearest neighbour analysis, as is explained below.
