<p id="p0087">The simplicial complexes reveal different persistent shapes for the three infection groups - in IAV the later time points are segregated from the earlier time points; in T4 the simplicial complexes are homogeneous and do not reveal special areas; in IAV + T4 the time course of the infection is elucidated. Together this indicates that the immune system behaves differently in the three infection scenarios.</p>
