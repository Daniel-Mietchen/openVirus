<p id="p0083">A detailed presentation of our semi-unsupervised algorithm and a discussion on how the representative simplicial complexes are chosen and how we came to the conclusion that those (simplicial complexes) are persistent in their shape is included in 
 <xref rid="sec0002" ref-type="sec">SectionÂ 2</xref>. Of note, during the parameter value search we obtained consistent results to those presented here with the same lenses and metric (correlation) and different parameter values for the number of intervals and percentage overlap. We also obtained similar results with the same metric but other pairs of lenses that included also linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms. Finally, we obtained similar results also with the cosine metric.
