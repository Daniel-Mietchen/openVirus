For example, the simplicial complexes of the IAV infection group (second row) generated with the cytokines can all be divided into two regions, green vertices versus blue vertices. The simplicial complexes of the single bacterial infection (T4 infection group) generated with the bacterial burden and the cytokines IL-6, MCP-1 and IFN-

 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> corresponds to the simplicial complexes of the co-infection group (IAV + T4) alone. The time course can be clearly distinguished by the simplicial complexes generated with lens 2 being the two pathogens burden and the concentration of the cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1, as is indicated by the gray arrow (from early to later time points).
