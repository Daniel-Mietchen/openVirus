<p id="p0082">We used the mapper algorithm to study four data sets: The first consisted of the data for the three infection groups put together, and the other three were the individual separate infection scenarios. The Kepler Mapper 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, a library implementing the mapper algorithm in Python, was employed. Additionally, we wrote a semi-unsupervised algorithm that built all simplicial complexes for various metrics, lenses and ranges of values for the lens intervals and percentage overlap, and which chose simplicial complexes to represent the data. More specifically, using our semi-unsupervised algorithm, we tested the cosine, euclidean and correlation metrics, along with different epsilon values for the clusterer. Furthermore, all analysis was done using two lenses and we tested different combinations of the following: projections to the features of the data sets (i.e. the values of the pathogen load or the concentrations of the cytokines), the distance to the two nearest neighbours, the first two dimensions of various linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms and projections to (the image of) functions that reveal interesting geometric and statistical information about the data, such as density, eccentricity or centrality. We tested between 2 and 30 intervals for each lens and 10 different values for the percentage overlap of the lensâ€™ intervals and the epsilon parameter of the clusterer. This resulted in almost 1 billion simplicial complexes being generated, from which, using properties of graphs such as the number of connected components, the algorithm chose complexes that were persistent in shape and that showcased important information about the immune response.
