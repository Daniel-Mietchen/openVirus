<p id="p0085">These analyses revealed persistence in the shape of the data. For example, in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> all the simplicial complexes generated with the different projections for lens 2 can be divided into three regions, two in yellow and one in purple/teal, where the circles (or vertices) in the yellow regions belong to time points 26 and 31 h post co-infection (hpc) in the IAV + T4 infection group, and the circles in purple/teal belong to the IAV, T4 single-infection groups and early (1.5, 6, 18 hpc) time points in the IAV + T4 co-infection group. This is illustrated more explicitly in the simplicial complex generated by lens 2 = IL-6. The fact that the same shape is generated regardless of the projection used indicates that the shape is likely to represent the data.
