<p id="p0084">For the sake of clarity, we discuss only the results obtained by using the correlation metric with the following two types of lenses: lens 1 is the distance to the first neighbour and lens 2 is a projection to one of the features. 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> illustrate the representative simplicial complexes that we discuss in more detail here (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists the parameter values specific for these simplicial complexes). 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> corresponds to the data set that consists of all infection groups together, and 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows the simplicial complexes for the individual infection groups separately. The columns in both figures indicate the projection for lens 2.
