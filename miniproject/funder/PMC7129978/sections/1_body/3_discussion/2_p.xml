<p id="p0094">The relative contributions of the immune system during co-infections and how they can help in laying out the evolution of the immune system in response to co-infections are largely fragmented. The complexity of multi-pathogen infections makes detailed dissection of contributing mechanisms and stages of the immune response, which may be non-linear and occur on different time scales, challenging. Recently, in conjunction with experimental data, theoretical approaches have been able to uncover infection control mechanisms, establish regulatory feedback, connect mechanisms across time scales, and determine the processes that dictate different disease outcomes
