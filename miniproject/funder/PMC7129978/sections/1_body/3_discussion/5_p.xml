 <italic>γ</italic> showed that the co-infection led to an increase as early as 1.5 hpc and 6 hpc compared to the single IAV infection. The levels of IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> remained constant compared to the underlying IAV infection for the later time points, but a significant increase was observed when compared to the single T4 infection. Finally, overshooting concentrations of IL-6 in the co-infected mice were also detected experimentally at 26 hpc and 31 hpc compared to the single T4 infection. The chemokine MCP-1 was experimentally found to be significantly increased in the IAV + T4 group compared to the single T4 infected group and marginally increased to the IAV only group at 26 hpi and 31 hpi.
