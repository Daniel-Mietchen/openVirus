 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. While under specific assumptions these models can highlight relevant mechanism, the design of mechanistic models and the abstraction complexity remain largely debatable. Here, TDA is presented as an additional tool to abstract high dimension data sets during co-infections, thereby significantly extending current knowledge and building a basis for translating improved mathematical models into potential therapies.
