<p id="p0100">Looking in more detail at the simplicial complex corresponding to the projection to IL-6 on the top row of 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 5</xref>, we can see that the two groups of yellow circles are sprouting from different regions in the complex; one yellow group sprouts from vertices in purple and the other from vertices in teal. Recall that the vertices of the simplicial complex represent clusters of points of the data set and edges between vertices indicate that there are data in common between clusters. Therefore, after further analysis of the data sets that are in common between the purple and yellow vertices (clusters) and teal and yellow vertices, we could elucidate that, in fact, the purple vertices have data sets exclusively in the single viral infection at early time points and vertices in teal have all the data sets in the single bacterial infection and some data sets in the late stages of the single viral infection. In other words, the yellow region emanating from the purple vertices is connected exclusively to early time points in the single viral infection and the other yellow region to the single bacterial infection and late time points in the viral infection.
