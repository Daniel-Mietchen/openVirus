<p id="p0105">In some cases, it has been difficult to uncover the implications in the biological context with certainty, with respect to the structures of the simplicial complexes. For example, we speculate that the segregation of specific data sets represents striking changes in feature values - i.e. changes in concentration of cytokine of pathogen load from one time point to the others. This seems indeed to be the case as explained earlier in this discussion. However, for example, striking changes in bacterial burden and viral load in the co-infection are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, where the bacterial burden changes significantly between 1.5 and 6 hpc and between 6 and 18 hpc and the viral load changes significantly between 18 and 26 hpc. In this case, it is not clear exactly how these changes are represented in the simplicial complexes of 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. Therefore further quantification is required in order to understand in more detail the information that the choice of lenses provide in the biological context.
