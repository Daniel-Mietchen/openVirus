<p id="p0102">In 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> mathematical modelling, we proposed IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> as a key and sufficient modulator in the impairment of bacterial clearance and other detrimental effects specifically for IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in bacterial clearance. At the current stage of application of the mapper algorithm for this particular data set, we are not able to draw specific conclusions regarding causal roles of the cytokines in the co-infection. We can only allude to possible involvement of cytokines at specific stages in the infection course (as we have done, for example, with TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6 and MCP-1.) In other words, TDA can dissect the potential of the different cytokines to represent the whole data set during co-infections, however, it can not point out or reject a key role of a specific cytokine for the susceptibility to bacterial co-infections.
