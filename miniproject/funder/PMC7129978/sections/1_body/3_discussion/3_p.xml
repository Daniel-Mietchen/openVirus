 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) in combination with nearest neighbour analysis (
 <xref rid="fig0008" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) we have shown that the immune response during influenza-pneumococcal co-infection consists of three stages (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>): It is initially shaped by the inherited response to the primary influenza infection. We call this phase 1 of the immune response. Subsequently, the system undergoes an abrupt transition at 6 hours post onset of the secondary bacterial infection as it quickly modulates itself and starts responding predominantly to the bacterial infection; this is phase 2 of the immune response. There is a second transition stage between 18 and 26 h post co-infection after which the immune response does no longer resemble the behaviour under a single viral or bacterial infection, but presumably shapes its response to the co-infection itself; this stage we call phase 3.
