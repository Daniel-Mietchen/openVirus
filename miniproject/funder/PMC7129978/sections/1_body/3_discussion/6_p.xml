<p id="p0098">The simplicial complexes illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> perfectly matches these observations. More specifically, the experimental observations made in 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> regarding the temporal changes in concentrations of the cytokines throughout the co-infection coincide with the special regions highlighted by the simplicial complexes. We observe that the simplicial complexes generated by the mapper algorithm with a projection to the features could be representing exactly those dramatic changes in the values of the features and that the algorithm is able to separate data points with high relative concentrations of cytokines away from other data points. In the simplicial complexes illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> in both the T4 and IAV + T4 infection groups the simplicial complexes generated with the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> projection draw attention to the later time points in both infection scenarios. Specifically, for T4, the data sets correspond to time 26 and in IAV + T4 the data correspond to times 26 and 31. We could further interpret these results as further supporting evidence that the immune response at this stage of the co-infection is primarily responding in a way that is similar to its response in the single bacterial infection.
