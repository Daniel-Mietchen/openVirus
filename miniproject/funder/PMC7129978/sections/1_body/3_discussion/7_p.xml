The simplicial complexes of the co-infection scenario generated by the projections to IL-6 and MCP-1 (and to the viral load and bacterial burden) reproduced the timeline of the infection course. It is interesting to contemplate the possibility that the simplicial complexes of the co-infection imply that the cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 play a consistent role through the whole infection course in the co-infection scenario.
