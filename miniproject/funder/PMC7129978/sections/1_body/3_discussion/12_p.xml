 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> the simplicial complex of the stages a host infected with malaria goes through is circular and serves as a map of the loop an individual goes through on its way from health, through sickness and recovery and back to health. It is to be expected that a topological approach to study infectious diseases where hosts recover would also reveal circular topological simplicial complexes. This is not the case for the data set we have used. For the three infection groups, the data sets do not contain information for the full course of the infections. More specifically, the data set of the single IAV infected group is based on data starting from day 7 post the onset of the viral infection. The data set for the co-infected groups is incomplete towards the end of the infection course because for ethical reasons the mice that developed a high morbidity had to be euthanized before the bacterial infection is resolved naturally. Nevertheless, we found hints of looping behaviour in the co-infection, as discussed in
