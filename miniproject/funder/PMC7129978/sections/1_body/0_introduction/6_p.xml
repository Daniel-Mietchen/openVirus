<p id="p0008">Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a collection of computational tools derived from the mathematical subject of Algebraic Topology, that can help in identifying the behaviour of a biological system from a global perspective, guide detailed quantitative investigations and aid tailor further experimental settings. In fact, algorithms from topological data analysis have started to play important roles in novel interdisciplinary fields in biomedical sciences, including cancer genomics
