<p id="p0011">Here, we use the co-infection data sets from 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> where we investigated the hierarchical effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the post-influenza susceptibility to pneumococcal co-infection by assessing the early and late kinetics of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the respiratory tract. In the experimental part of this study mice were divided into three groups and given either a single viral infection (with IAV strain A/PR8/34), a single bacterial infection (S. pneumoniae strain T4) or a co-infection (IAV + T4). The experimental readouts were the bacterial burden, viral titers and cytokine concentrations in the lung. Our previous work 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> used mathematical modelling that suggested a detrimental role of IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> alone and in synergism with IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in impaired bacterial clearance. We now use the mapper algorithm to investigate the global shape of the immune response under the three above infection scenarios, illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> .
