<p id="p0010">Motivated by the obvious potential of topological investigations in biomedical sciences, in the present study we seek to understand the evolution of the immune system as it responds to co-infection between virus and bacteria. Mathematical modeling research in influenza-pneumococcal co-infections has been a growing field within last years

While they are suitable tools to test different hypothesis, and have helped elucidate many of the details of the mechanisms of these intricate systems, these models are susceptible to bias by the designer and model complexity rapidly limits the reliability in the parameter fitting procedures
