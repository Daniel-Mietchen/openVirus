<p id="p0007">The harmful effects of chronic co-infections, such as tuberculosis or Hepatitis B and C in association with HIV for example, are well established. However, generally and especially in acute infections, the mechanisms of co-pathogens with the host immune system and the possible consequences, ranging from insignificant, harmful or beneficial, are still largely unknown and difficult to dissect. The development of mathematical approaches that characterise the immune responses in the host have offered important steps for studying pathogen - pathogen interactions 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Interpretation of data sets with modern mathematical and machine-learning strategies can provide a comprehensive understanding of co-infections and their relevance/significance.
