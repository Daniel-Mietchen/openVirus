<p id="p0009">Among the different TDA techniques for the qualitative analysis, the mapper algorithm 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> has shown a potential to simplify and visualize high dimensional data sets. It generates a simple description of the data in the form of a combinatorial object called a 
 <italic>simplicial complex</italic>, that captures topological and geometric information of the point cloud in high dimensional space. The algorithm uses a (combination of) function(s) that map the data to a metric space, and builds an informative representation based on the clustering of subsets (which are associated to the values of the function(s)) of the data set. In the simplest case, this method reduces high dimensional data sets to a network whose nodes correspond to clusters in the data and edges to the existence of points in common between clusters. The aim of this algorithm is not to obtain a fully accurate representation of a data set, but rather a low-dimensional image which can highlight areas of interest, possibly for further analysis and quantification.
