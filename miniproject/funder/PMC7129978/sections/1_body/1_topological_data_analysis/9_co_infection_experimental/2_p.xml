<p id="p0074">We consider the murine data that we first presented in 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Three groups were considered: single viral infection (IAV), single bacterial infection (T4) and co-infection (IAV + T4). All experiments were performed in groups of 4–7 WT C57BL/6 J mice. The mice were anesthetized and intranasally infected with either a sublethal dose of IAV (A/PR8/34) or a bacterial infection with the 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strain T4 on day 7, or both, depending on the infection group. Following infection, mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), post-lavage lung and blood were collected at 1.5, 6, 18, 26 and 31 hours post bacterial infection (hpi) or post bacterial co-infection (hpc). Lungs were homogenized, and the supernatants were used to determine virus titers, immune cell populations, and cytokine and chemokine concentrations. Kinetic measurements for viral titers (mRNA by real-time PCR), bacterial counts (colony forming units (CFU)) as well as the following cytokines were considered: IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, IFN-
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-22 and the chemokines MCP-1 and GM-CSF. The experiments are described in detail in
