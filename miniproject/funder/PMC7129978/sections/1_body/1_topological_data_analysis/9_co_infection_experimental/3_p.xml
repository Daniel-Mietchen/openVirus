<p id="p0075">For the analysis done in this study we took the measurements collected from the post-lavage lung. For the T4 and AIV + T4 infection groups, at 18 hpi and 18 hpc, respectively, the measurements had to be repeated. As it is a cross-sectional study (each measurement is coming from a mouse), to impute corresponding values, we allocate high values of bacterial burden to rows that contain high values of cytokines. Since mice were naive, we replaced any N/A values (under level of detection) in the bacterial burden (in the single IAV infection group) and viral load (in the single T4 infection group) with the value 0. For each infection group, for time points that have less than five missing values in one feature, we replaced the missing values with the average value of the feature for that specific time point. For infection groups that have missing values at one single time point for one particular feature, we performed a linear interpolation between the mean values of the previous and the next time points and replaced the missing values with the predicted value for that time point.</p>
