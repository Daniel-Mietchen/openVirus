<p id="p0060">To start with, we constructed simplicial complexes of the data sets with between 1 and 4 lenses. However, when we visually inspected the result of using a three or four lenses, we observed many more clusters corresponding to the same points, because of oversampling by the larger number of intervals introduced by the third and fourth lenses. In addition, using more that two lenses can make the calculations take over 20 hours to complete, compared to 3-5 hours for two lenses (ran on a standard laptop). Therefore we limited ourselves to using two lenses.</p>
