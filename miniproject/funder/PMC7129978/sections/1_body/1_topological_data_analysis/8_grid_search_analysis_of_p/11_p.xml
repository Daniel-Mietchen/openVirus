 <bold>Clusterer:</bold> DBSCAN from scikit-learn 
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. For the min_samples parameter we chosed the value of 1, i.e. a cluster can be formed with 1 or more data points. For the eps parameter we tested values between the minimum and maximum distances in the data sets for each metric. More specifically, the distances between the data points in the three infection groups range between [0,520002] in the Euclidean metric; between [0,1] in the cosine metric; and between [0,2] in the correlation metric. So for the Euclidean metric we tested 5000 values between 0 and 520002; and for the cosine and correlation metrics we tested 10 values between 0 and 1 and 0 and 2, respectively.
