<p id="p0073">From all the simplicial complexes generated, the algorithm chooses those that have a user-specified number of connected components. Biologically it makes sense that the simplicial complexes for the three infection groups have only one connected component. From the resulting list of simplicial complexes with one connected component, we ordered the simplexes in ascending order of epsilon value for the clusterer and the percentage overlap for the intervals for both lenses; choosing the smaller rather than the larger values for these parameters makes the simplicial complexes, as models of the system, simpler, which is desirable when working with models. Next, we chose simplicial complexes that had number of vertices at least half of the number of data points in the data set (for example, if the data set for the IAV infection group has 30 data points then we favour simplicial complexes that consist of only one connected component and at least 15 vertices); choosing this number gives a good resolution, not too simple, but also prevents the user from choosing simplicial complexes that have oversampling of data points. Finally, we visually inspected the simplest (in terms of small values for the parameters) 10, 20 or 30 simplicial complexes in that list. The visual inspection has two purposes: First, to give the user an idea of whether there is persistence in the global and local structures of the simplicial complexes generated. Second, to choose a representative structure for the data set.</p>
