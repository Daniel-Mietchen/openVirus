<p id="p0057">We wrote a semi-unsupervised algorithm that built all simplicial complexes for various metrics, lenses and ranges of values for the lens intervals, percentage overlap and epsilon values of the DBSCAN clusterer from sklearn, and which “chose appropriate” simplicial complexes to represent the data. More specifically, below we list all the values we tested.</p>
