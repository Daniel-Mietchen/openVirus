<p id="p0050">The choice of number of intervals and percentage overlap defines how detailed or coarse a topological network representation of the data we want to create is, in other words, the “resolution” of the representation. The number of intervals can be any number starting from 1 and, as the name indicates, the percentage overlap can be anything in the range [0.0,1.0]. Thus, choosing a higher number of intervals translates to increasing the number of vertices of the graph. Increasing the percentage overlap allows the algorithm to find more data points in common between two intervals, thus roughly translating to an increased possibility of connecting two vertices. (Note that increasing the number of lenses also increases the number of vertices, since it increases the number of intervals that the data is partitioned into).
