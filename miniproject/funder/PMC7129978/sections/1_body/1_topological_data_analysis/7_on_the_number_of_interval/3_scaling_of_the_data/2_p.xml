<p id="p0051">PCA gives different results when the scales of the features are different. Additionally, manifold learning methods are based on a nearest-neighbor search, therefore, such algorithm may perform poorly if the features of the data are on different scales. Therefore, we normalise the data before applying the dimensionality reduction algorithms. (Note that the clustering algorithm is run on the original data, which we do not normalise.)</p>
