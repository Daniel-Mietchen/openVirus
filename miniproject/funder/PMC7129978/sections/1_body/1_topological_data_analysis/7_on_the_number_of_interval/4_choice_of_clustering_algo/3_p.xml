<p id="p0055">We chose the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) 
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> because we can specify what metric to use, the thresholds for the number of points needed to create a cluster (min_samples) and the value of the distance below which two points are considered to belong to the same cluster (eps).
