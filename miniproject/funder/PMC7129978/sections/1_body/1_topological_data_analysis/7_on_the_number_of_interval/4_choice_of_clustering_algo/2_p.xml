<p id="p0052">Finding a good clustering of the points is a fundamental issue in computing representative topological networks. Currently there is no automated or principled method of making a choice. The mapper algorithm does not have any limitations on the cluster used and in particular, according to 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> desired characteristics when choosing a clustering are that it:
 <list list-type="simple" id="lst0001">
  <list-item id="lstitem0012">
   <label>1.</label>
   <p id="p0053">is able to take an interpoint distance matrix as an input, not restricted to the Euclidean distance,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="lstitem0013">
   <label>2.</label>
   <p id="p0054">does not require specifying the number of clusters.</p>
