<p id="p0014">The algorithm begins with a data set of interest that consists of a point cloud 
 <italic>X</italic> containing 
 <italic>N</italic> points 
 <italic>x</italic> ∈ 
 <italic>M</italic> sampled from a space 
 <italic>M</italic> whose topology we want to elucidate. We define a real valued function 
 <italic>f: X</italic> → 
 <italic>R</italic> (
 <italic>f</italic> is referred in the literature as a 
 <italic>lens</italic> or 
 <italic>filter</italic>) whose value is known for the 
 <italic>N</italic> data points. Next, we find the range 
 <italic>I</italic> of the function 
 <italic>f</italic> that is restricted to the points in 
 <italic>X</italic>. We divide this range into a set 
 <italic>S</italic> of smaller intervals of the same size, that overlap. This results in two parameters that can be used to control how detailed a representation of the data, i.e. the “resolution”, namely the number 
 <italic>l</italic> of the smaller intervals and the percentage overlap 
 <italic>q</italic> between successive intervals.
