<p id="p0013">The mapper algorithm is a method of replacing a topological space by a simpler one, known as a 
 <italic>simplicial complex</italic>, which captures topological and geometric features of the original space. The purpose of doing this is not only to obtain a visualization of high dimensional data sets in 3-d, but also because mathematical properties of simplicial complexes allow for the implementation of algebraic calculations that facilitate the classification of the topological features of the complex, and by extension, of the original topological space.
