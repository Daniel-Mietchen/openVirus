<p id="p0019">Although the mapper algorithm is less sensitive to the choice of metric than other methods that aim at creating simpler representative objects of spaces in high dimensions (e.g. dimensionality reduction algorithms) 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> we still wanted to make sure that our investigation was not biased by the choice of metric. Therefore we tested three metrics that “appeared suitable” for our data sets. These were the Euclidean, cosine and correlation metrics. We chose the Euclidean metric as it is the most intuitive to work with. Next, we wanted to investigate whether looping is a recurrent property in our data sets. In 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, where looping was indeed found to be a motif in their data set (of an infection from which patients can recover, such as in our study), the cosine metric was used, so we also decided to test this metric. Finally, we regarded the correlation metric to make the most biological sense. So we also tested this one.
