 <italic>x.y</italic> is the dot product between

 <italic>u</italic>||
 <sub>2</sub> is the L2-norm (Euclidean norm) of 
 <italic>u</italic>. This definition is of the absolute value of the normalised dot product of 
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> minus 1. The reason we take this definition and, not simply the normalised dot product, is the following: The normalised dot product of any two points takes values between +1 and −1. We want to cluster points whose vectors from the origin are almost parallel and point almost in the same direction. Two such points have a normalised dot product value that is close to +1. However, DBSCAN clusters two points whenever they are a distance less than or equal to the eps parameter. (The eps parameter is the maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as in the same neighbourhood). Therefore, what we need is a distance formula that outputs small values for points that are “close” to each other (i.e. whose vectors from the origin point in roughly the same direction). The above bespoke distance formula achieves this. In order to implement this computationally, we precompute the distance matrix of the data using the normalised dot product with the sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity function of sklearn, next, we preprocess the distance matrix such that it fits our bespoke distance criterion:
