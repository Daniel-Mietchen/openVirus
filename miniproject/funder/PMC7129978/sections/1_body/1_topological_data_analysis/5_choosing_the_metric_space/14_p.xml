<p id="p0031">In the main part of this study we only reported the results obtained with the correlation metric. We observed the same results with the correlation and cosine metrics and we could not make concrete observations about the result obtained with the Euclidean metric. The questions of why the cosine and correlation metrics create the same simplicial complexes and how they differ from those created with the Euclidean metric require further investigations that were not done as part of this study.</p>
