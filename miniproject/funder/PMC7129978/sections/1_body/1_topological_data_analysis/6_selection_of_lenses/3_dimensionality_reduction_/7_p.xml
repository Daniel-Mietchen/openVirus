<p id="p0047">The Isomap seeks a lower-dimensional embedding which maintains geodesic distances between all points. LLE seeks a lower-dimensional projection of the data which preserves distances within local neighborhoods, and it can be thought of as a series of local Principal Component Analyses which are globally compared to find the best non-linear embedding. For the Isomap and the LLE one needs to make a choice on the number of neighbors; since in our data set each time point should have between two and five data points corresponding to individually analyzed mice, we chose the value of three neighbors for these algorithms.</p>
