<p id="p0046">LLE, Isomap, MDS and Spectral Embedding are algorithms that belong to a framework called Manifold Learning, which are an attempt to generalize linear frameworks like PCA, to be sensitive to non-linear structure in data. These approaches learn the high-dimensional structure of the data from the data itself, in an unsupervised manner, i.e. without the use of predetermined classifications.</p>
