<p id="p0048">Multidimensional scaling (MDS) seeks a low-dimensional representation of the data in which either the distances between the two output points are set to be as close as possible to the similarity or dissimilarity of the original data (the metric approach) or the algorithm seeks a monotonic relationship between the distances in the embedded space and the similarities/dissimilarities of the original data (the non-metric approach).</p>
