<p id="p0049">For spectral embedding Laplacian Eigenmaps are implemented, which find a low dimensional representation of the data using a spectral decomposition of the graph Laplacian. The graph generated can be considered as a discrete approximation of the low dimensional manifold in the high dimensional space. Points close to each other on the manifold are mapped close to each other in the low dimensional space, preserving local distances.</p>
