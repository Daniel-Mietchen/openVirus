<p id="p0012">In this section we give a brief and intuitive introduction to the mapper algorithm and the algebraic topology concepts behind it. We also present in detail our methodology for using the mapper algorithm to investigate influenza in co-infection with bacteria. For further details, we refer the reader to the following resources: the original paper of the mapper algorithm is 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; the paper presenting the Kepler-Mapper Python Library that we used to implement the mapper algorithm computationally is 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>; we also recommend 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> as an introductory book to computational algebraic topology (albeit it does not include the mapper algorithm) and 
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> for a thorough treatment of the mathematical subject of algebraic topology.
