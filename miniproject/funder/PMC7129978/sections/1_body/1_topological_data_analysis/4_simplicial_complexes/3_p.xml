<p id="p0017">In practical terms regarding the mapper algorithm, when we use one lens to construct a simplicial complex, the maximum dimension of the simplices is 1, i.e. the complex is made up of vertices and edges and is thus a standard network. When we use two lenses to construct a simplicial complex, the maximum possible dimension of the simplices is 4, meaning it is made of vertices, edges, triangles and tetrahedra. 
 <xref rid="sec0015" ref-type="sec">SectionÂ 3.2</xref> in the original paper of the mapper algorithm 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> describes explicitly how simplicial complexes are built with 2 lenses and how this can be generalised to more lenses and higher dimensional simplicial complexes.
