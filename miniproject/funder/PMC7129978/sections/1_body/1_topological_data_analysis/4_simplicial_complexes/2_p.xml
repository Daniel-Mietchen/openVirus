<p id="p0016">To arrive at a precise definition of a simplicial complex and to understand it is not required for the context of this paper. Instead, here it is sufficient to think of simplicial complexes as a generalisation of networks that include higher dimensional elements. That is, simplicial complexes can be thought of as combinatorial objects consisting of vertices (0-d), edges (1-d), triangles (2-d), tetrahedra (“triangular pyramid”) (3-d) and higher-dimensional (

 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, “using a single function as a filter we get as output a complex in which the highest dimension of simplices is 1 (edges in a graph). Qualitatively, the only information we get out of this is the number of components, the number of loops and knowledge about” local and global component structure. “One natural way of building higher dimensional complexes is to associate many functions with each data point instead of just one.” In particular, “the dimension of simplices which we use to construct the complex” associated to two lenses “will be 4 or less” (depending on the covering of choice).
