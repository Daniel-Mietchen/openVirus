   <bold>Resolution of simplicial complexes and persistence of the shape of the data</bold>. Three simplicial complexes of data sampled from an unknown 3-dimensional space of different resolution are generated using the mapper algorithm 
   <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, implemented computationally using the Kepler mapper Python library 
   <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. One lens is used for all simplicial complexes, namely a projection on the x-axis. The number of intervals and percentage overlap for the lens at each resolution are indicated. Observation 1: the three simplicial complexes consist of one connected component. Observation 2: the three simplicial complexes have a “big hole” in the middle. Conclusion: The data set is sampled from a topological space that consists of one component and that has a hole in the middle. Since we know it is a 3-dimensional space, we can say it is a torus.
