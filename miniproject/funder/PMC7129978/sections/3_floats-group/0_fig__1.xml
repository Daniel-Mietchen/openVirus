   <bold>Predictions about the behaviour of the immune system in response to co-pathogenesis in the lung.</bold> Topological data analysis and nearest neighbour analysis reveal that initially the immune system inherits its behaviour from its response to the primary infection; it goes through a swift transition early in the co-infection (i.e. soon after the onset of the secondary infection) and it is consequently and temporarily driven mainly by its response to the secondary infection. There is a second transition point in the behaviour of the immune system and from there, it no longer resembles a standard response associated to either of the two single infections, but rather it shapes its behaviour to respond to the co-infection itself.
