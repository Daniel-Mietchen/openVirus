   <bold>K-nearest neighbour analysis of co-infection.</bold> A) 30-nearest neighbours of all data sets in the three infection scenarios, with the correlation as metric. The infection groups and the time points for each infection group are indicated on the axes. The dark regions indicate the 30 neighbours of each data point. Inside the orange dotted box are the neighbours of co-infection data within the co-infection scenario. Inside the green dotted boxes are the neighbours of the co-infection data in the IAV single infection and T4 single infection groups. B) Correlation distance matrix of the co-infection group. The color-bar on the right indicates the correlation distance values between data sets.
