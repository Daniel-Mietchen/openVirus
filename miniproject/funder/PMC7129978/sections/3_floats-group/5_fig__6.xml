   <bold>Decoupling simplicial complexes of the immune response to virus, bacteria and co-infection.</bold> Five simplicial complexes are generated for the single viral (top row) and single bacterial (middle row) infection groups and six simplicial complexes are generated for the co-infection group (bottom row). The vertices of the simplicial complexes are color (see legends) coded according to the hour post infection or co-infection in the clusters. Clusters that contain data subsets belonging to more than one time point are colored by the average color value for members in that node.
