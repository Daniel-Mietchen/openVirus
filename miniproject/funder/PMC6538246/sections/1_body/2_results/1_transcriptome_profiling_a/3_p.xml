<p>Poly-A selected RNA from three biological replicates was used for paired-end library preparation and transcriptome sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq platform. Approximately 136 million raw reads and 131 million clean reads were generated on average per sample, with phred Q30 values averaging 90.5% (
