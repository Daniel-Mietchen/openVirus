<p>Our goal in this study was to specifically analyze differential transcriptional and alternative splicing landscapes during RVFV infection. A related but distinct study detailing differential expression and pathway analysis at time points up to 18h post-RVFV infection in HSEAC cells was recently published [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here we were interested in capturing a composite of statistically significant splicing events and changes in transcription factor usage occurring post-infection, therefore a synchronous infection was not ideal for our purposes. At 48 hours after infection at MOI = 0.1, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry indicated that nearly all cells were infected, and few were dead (
