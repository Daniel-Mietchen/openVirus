<p>Differential expression comparison of infected and mock-infected cells was carried out using the DEGSeq2 R package [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217497.s003">S3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217497.s004">S4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217497.s005">S5</xref> Tables). A threshold of p&lt;0.05 and log2&gt;1.8 (3.5 fold change) yielded 3125 differentially expressed genes, 2909 upregulated (93%) and 216 (7%) downregulated genes (

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> represents the top up- and down- regulated genes. The differential expression analysis was validated via RT-qPCR for 5 genes, 3 upregulated (CXCL10, IFIT2, IFNB) and 2 downregulated (MIR210hg, NOG) (

In infected cells, the 31kDa NSs is present in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus, where it forms filamentous structures mediated by the C-terminal domain [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. NSs has been shown to suppress transcription on a global level through its interaction with transcription complex TFIIH components p44 and p62, which inhibits TFIIH complex assembly by sequestration of p44 and promotes posttranslational degradation of p62 [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to its role in transcription, TFIIH also plays roles in cell cycle control and DNA repair [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Despite these mechanisms, it is clear that there is an abundance of mRNA present at the 48h timepoint post-infection. In fact, the number of reads obtained from mock infected cells was only slightly higher than read count from MP-12 infected cells on average across the three replicates (
