<p>Downregulated genes comprised genes involved in a diverse array of cellular functions. The most highly downregulated gene was MIR210HG, a microRNA that is upregulated in several cancers and is critical for regulating the hypoxic response [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The hypoxia-induced lipid droplet associated HILPDA was also highly downregulated in our study and the study by Pinkham and colleagues. Downregulation of these factors is interesting, since RVFV infection stimulates oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition to its role in altering host cell transcription, virulence factor NSs is also known to interact with the mitochondria leading to redox imbalance and reactive oxygen species production, which leads to activation of NF-ÎºB (p65) and p53 [

Ionotropic glutamate receptors (GRIA3, GRID2), a potassium-voltage gated channel (KCNA2), kinesin family member 12 (KIF12), and several long noncoding RNAs (RP11-214O1.2, RP11-355I22.7, RP11-250B2.3, RP11-148O21.6, AC083843.1) were also significantly downregulated.
