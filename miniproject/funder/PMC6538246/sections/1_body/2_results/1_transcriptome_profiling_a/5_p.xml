<p>Upregulated genes are in good agreement with those from a transcriptome profiling study performed by Pinkham and colleagues with both MP-12 and ZH548 strains of RVFV over a shorter 18hr time-course of infection in HSEAC cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Their study showed that the most highly upregulated genes during both MP-12 and ZH548 infection were ISGs (interferon stimulated genes). The two most highly upregulated genes at 18hpi were interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) IFIT2 and OASL, and in our study at 48hpi those were also the top upregulated transcripts. Additional ISGs upregulated at 48hpi include the other 2’-5’ oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) family members OAS1 and OAS2, IFI44, MX2, IFNB1 and IFIH1/MDA5. Many inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were also activated (CXCL10, CCL5, IL16, ANGPT2, CXCL11). Tripartite motif containing 22 (TRIM22) was also highly upregulated, and has previously been shown to play an important role in antiviral immunity during Influenza A virus (IAV) infection due to its ability to target the IAV nucleoprotein for degradation [
