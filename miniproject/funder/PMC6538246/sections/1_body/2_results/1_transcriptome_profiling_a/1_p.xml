<p>In the present study, mRNA-seq was performed to compare transcriptomes in RVFV infected and uninfected HEK293 cells. Cells were either mock-infected or infected with RVFV MP-12 strain at an MOI = 0.1 and total RNA was harvested at 48hpi. RVFV MP-12 is an attenuated vaccine candidate strain that allows viral work to be completed under BSL2 containment conditions. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR confirmed that most cells were infected at the time of harvest using this scheme and that harvested cells were live (
