<p>Several splicing events were validated via RT-PCR using primers flanking the splicing events of interest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217497.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These events also produced interesting changes in the mRNA transcripts that would result in intriguing functional outcomes. For example, Rio kinase 3 (RIOK3) undergoes alternative 5â€™ splice site selection in exon 8 in infected cells, which generates a frameshift and introduces a premature termination codon in exon 9. This truncated RIOK3 transcript could be a target for nonsense mediated decay, or, if it were translated, it would be predicted to produce a C-terminally truncated protein product that lacks almost the entire kinase domain. Interestingly, RIOK3 has been implicated as an important player in the host antiviral response and thus this splicing event could have important regulatory consequences for these pathways post-infection [
