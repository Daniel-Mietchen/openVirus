<p>Transformer 2 beta homolog (TRA2B) exhibits decreased exon 2 skipping in infected cells. This demonstrates incidence of an autoregulatory splicing event that has been previously characterized. TRA2B is an SR-like protein responsible for altering splice site selection in a variety of transcripts in a concentration dependent manner. As is the case with most splicing factors, their expression must be tightly regulated, as misregulation is associated with various disorders. TRA2B uses a negative feedback autoregulatory mechanism to activate inclusion of its own exon 2. Inclusion of exon 2 generates the TRA2B4 splice variant, which is not translated into protein [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In infected cells, the decreased incidence of exon 2 skipping seems to indicate production of the non-functional TRA2B4 variant, perhaps the result of high TRA2B protein expression regulating its own splicing and downstream expression.
