<p>Most of these alternatively spliced genes were not differentially expressed at the level of transcription, indicating that differential expression and AS are independent regulatory mechanisms occurring post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217497.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To understand the functional consequences of these splicing events, we implemented GO enrichment analysis using all AS genes. GO terms with p-values of &lt;0.05 were subjected to Revigo in order to cluster and delete redundant GO terms. REVIGO scatterplot analysis shows that most AS genes are involved in cellular metabolic and biosynthetic processes, as well as RNA processing (
