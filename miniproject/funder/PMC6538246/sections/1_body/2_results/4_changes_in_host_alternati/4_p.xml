<p>Similar to TRA2B, CDC like kinase 2 (CLK2) also autoregulates its protein expression by promoting skipping of its own exon 4. This event generates a frameshift which renders the CLK2 mRNA transcript a target of the nonsense-mediated decay machinery and is thus not translated into functional protein [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In infected cells there is an increase in exon 4 skipping, which appears to indicate that these CLK2 transcripts are not translated. Lastly we validated the decrease in intron retention noted during viral infection in DEAD-box helicase 5 (DDX5) between exons 11 and 12. Interestingly, this intron is highly conserved and variably included in DDX5 transcripts across tissues, indicating an important functional role [
