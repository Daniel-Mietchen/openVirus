<p>Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs is a critical mechanism for regulating gene expression and expanding proteome diversity. Recent studies indicate that viral infection can cause marked changes in host splicing patterns, which results from the altered post-transcriptional program undertaken by the host as a response to invasion, but also many viruses have evolved methods to interfere with and modulate host splicing [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. To determine whether AS might play a role in RVFV pathogenesis, we examined differences in splicing patterns between MP-12 infected and uninfected cells using a program called MISO (Mixture of Isoforms), which estimates differential spliced isoform expression and confidence intervals using Ψ values and Bayes factors, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217497.s007">S7 Table</xref>). Analysis yielded 1499 differential AS events between infected and uninfected cells using threshold Ψ of &gt;0.2 and BF &gt;10. MISO categorizes isoforms as being one of five different splicing event types: alternative 5’ splice site selection (A5SS), alternative 3’ splice site selection (A3SS), mutually exclusive exons (MXE), retainied introns (RI), and skipped exons (SE). The analyses yielded SE events as the dominant splicing pattern at 783 events, which is just over half the total number of events (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217497.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). While most genes had only one event per gene (n = 979), there were many genes that had multiple AS events per gene. These include GUSBP11 with 7 events, EEF1D and TRA2A with 6 events, WASH7P with 5 events, and 216 genes with 4, 3 or 2 events.
