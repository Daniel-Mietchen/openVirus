<p>A high confidence axis represented in the STRING network is the canonical NF-κB transcription factors RELA (p65) and NFKB1 (p50), which form heterodimeric complexes that act as transcriptional activators important for innate immunity, inflammation, apoptosis and cell growth and differentiation. SP1 connents to this axis, and although it is involved in a variety of biological processes and binding sites are present in many housekeeping genes, it has been implicated in cell cycle arrest and p-53 dependent apoptosis as well as in switching on early innate immune transcription [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the synergy between ESR1 and NF-κB during viral infection has not been extensively studied. During a transcriptional profiling study of Influenza A infection in lung epithelial cells, however, ESR1 was noted as a gene whose regulation was altered during NS1 deletion mutant viral infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Since the viral NS1 protein is a virulence factor responsible for repressing the host antiviral response in several ways, this study along with our work may indicate that ESR1 could play an important and underappreciated role in host activation or regulation of the antiviral response. ESR1 expression fluctuates during pregnancy, meaning that ESR1 has the potential to be uniquely important during RVFV infection, which is associated with high levels of abortion and neonatal death in pregnant ruminants [
