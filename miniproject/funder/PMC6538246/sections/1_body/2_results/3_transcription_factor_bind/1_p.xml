<p>As mentioned previously, the viral NSs protein is a major virulence factor that dramatically alters the host-pathogen interface during infection. Its primary biological functions include inhibition of general transcription, suppression of IFNB promotor activation, and degradation of PKR. Although NSs inhibits general transcription and specifically that occurring from IFNB promoters, it is clear that the cell can at least partially overcome NSs’s transcriptional shutdown at this timepoint post infection. In order to investigate and categorize the types of genes that may escape NSs’s block on general transcription, we looked for overrepresented transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the promoter regions of up- and down- regulated genes using oPOSSUM-3 software in Single-Site Analysis (SSA) mode [

SSA is used to find transcription factor binding motif enrichment in a given list of genes and assessed relative to motif enrichment in a background list of genes. Z-scores in conjunction with p-values are used to determine if a particular TFBS that occurs in the foreground set differs significantly from the expected occurrence in the background. Using a threshold Z-score of &gt; 10 and a p-value of &lt; 0.05, we discovered that just under 20 TFBS were significantly enriched in our DEGs (

In order to deduce synergistic interactions and functional networks associated with the transcription factors that interact with the identified binding sites, we performed STRING analyses where network edges represent interaction partners and thicker lines correspond to higher confidence interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217497.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Consistent with the analysis of GO terms associated with DEGs, we found TFBS that are important for regulation of fatty acid metabolism, including PPARG, RXRA and ZNF423 [

Interestingly, ZNF423 also interacts with SMAD1-SMAD4 complex, which is involved in BMP and TGF-β signaling that regulates cell growth and differentiation as well as apoptosis. The SMAD family of transcription factors were also recently shown to be phosphorylated as a result of RVFV infection [
