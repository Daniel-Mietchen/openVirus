<p>KEGG pathway analysis using DAVID for all significantly differentially expressed genes indicated that several pathways, inclucing many pathways involved in the type I IFN response (NF-ÎºB signaling, TNF signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, RIG-I like receptor signaling, cytosolic DNA-sensing) were transcriptionally modified post-infection (
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As is the case with canonical type I IFN activation, it appears that IFN signaling activated the JAK/STAT pathway, which in turn upregulated interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Pathway analysis also showed robust activation of the cytokine-mediated inflammatory response (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling). Linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways were also altered, which could indicate that arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids influenced the immune and inflammatory response during RVFV infection, as was previously discovered for respiratory viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Lastly, extracellular matrix (ECM) -receptor interaction pathways were modified during infection. Further investigation of the involvement of ECM receptor signaling during infection could yield insight into viral entry and cell to cell spread, which is an understudied area for RVFV.
