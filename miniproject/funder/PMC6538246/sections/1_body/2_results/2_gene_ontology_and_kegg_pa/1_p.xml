<p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using GOrilla, which allows the user to input a ranked list of target genes for analysis, and redundant GO terms were removed using REVIGO [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using GOrilla for a large list of genes, input of genes ranked by their log2 fold change values outputs GO terms more significantly enriched in highly differentially expressed genes. GO analysis of upregulated genes using a single ranked list of genes and a p-value threshold of 10
 <sup>âˆ’3</sup> illustrates, as expected, that the immune response is highly enriched upon infection as well as cell surface receptor signaling and signal transduction (
