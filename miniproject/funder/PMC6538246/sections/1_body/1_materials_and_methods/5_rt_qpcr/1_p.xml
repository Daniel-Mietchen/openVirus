<p>Total RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 600ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with random hexamers or gene specific primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems Step One Real-Time PCR System. For relative RT-qPCR, RNA levels were normalized to GAPDH and fold change in expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method [
