<p>HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For experiments using MP-12 RVFV, 80–90% confluent HEK293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with virus at the specified MOI in DMEM without serum or antibiotics and incubated for one hour at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After incubation with virus the media was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and the cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until time of harvest. Viral infection was confirmed using immunofluorescence targeting the viral nucleocapsid protein as well as RT-qPCR amplification of the viral small genome segment. The MP-12 vaccine strain of RVFV was kindly provided by Brian Gowen (Utah State University, Logan, UT). The virus stock was amplified once on Vero cells and portioned into small aliquots and frozen so that all experiments used the same passage of virus.
