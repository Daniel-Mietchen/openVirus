<p>Total RNA was extracted from infected and uninfected cells using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNA integrity was verified using TapeStation 2200 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and agarose gel electrophoresis. High quality RNA samples representing triplicate infected or mock-infected cells were submitted to Novogene for commercial RNA-sequencing (Novogene Beijing, China). Poly-A mRNA was selected from total RNA using oligo-dT bound magnetic beads and strand specific NEBNext Ultra RNA libraries were synthesized for paired-end 150 bp (PE 150) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina Inc.). Base calling was performed using CASAVA and raw data was stored as FASTQ files. Reads were filtered for quality and aligned to the GRCh-37 (hg19) genome using TopHat2 to generate BAM files [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For further differential expression analysis, we employed a threshold of p&lt;0.05 and log2&gt;1.8 (3.5 fold change). Since even these stringent parameters yielded a large number of DEGs, a ranked approach using lists organized by log2 fold change for up- and down- regulated genes was input for GOrilla and then REVIGO, which performed gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes and removal of redundant GO terms, respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs was analyzed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The oPOSSUM3 default setting for gene-based analyses was used, in which all genes in the oPOSSUM database serve as background. The Mixture of Isoforms (MISO) framework was used for identification of alternatively spliced genes [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. KEGG pathway analysis of differentially spliced genes was also carried out using DAVID.
