Cells were infected or mock infected and harvested after 48 hours, and RNA was isolated via TRIzol. cDNA was generated using 0.1 μg total RNA, Maxima H Minus reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher), and random hexamer primer. The PCR reaction was comprised of 10

 <sub>2</sub>O. Amplification was achieved with one cycle at 98°C for one minute, and 30 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for one second followed by paired annealing and extension at 72°C for 15 seconds. RT-PCR reactions were analyzed via agarose gel electrophoresis (
