<p>To establish infection and live/dead counts for cells harvested for RNA sequencing analysis, another set of HEK293 cells was either mock-infected or infected with RVFV MP-12 strain at an MOI = 0.1 and harvested at 48hpi with trypsin/EDTA. After quenching the trypsin with serum-containing media, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS (1 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per tube; 1 ml PBS). Cells were then incubated in the dark with a live/dead cells differential staining kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo LIVE/DEAD Fixable Red Dead Cell Stain Kit). All incubations used to prepare samples for flow cytometry were carried out at room temperature in the dark with gentle agitation. After two PBS washes, cells were fixed with fixation buffer for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo eBioscience intracellular fixation &amp; permeabilization buffer set). The fixed cells were permeabilized with two washes with permeabilization buffer. Cells were then incubated for 60 min with mouse monoclonal antibody directed against RVFV Gn protein (1:200 dilution in permeabilization buffer; BEI Resources). After two washes with permeabilization buffer, the cells were incubated for 30 min with a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-mouse green Alexa-Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo). Finally, after two washes with permeabilization buffer, the cells pellets were resuspended in 1 ml PBS and stored at 4Â°C in the dark until flow cytometry analysis. Cells were analyzed on an LSR II (BD Biosciences) in the University of Montana Center for Translational Medicine. Data were analyzed with FlowJo 10 software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
