<p>Several studies have highlighted the importance of the antiviral response in determining viral pathogenesis and disease outcome as a result of RVFV infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Age-associated susceptibility to RVFV has been demonstrated in humans, livestock and laboratory animals, which suggests that host resistance may be mediated by the more robust type I interferon system present in mature adults [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Like most negative-sense RNA viruses, RVFV does not produce significant levels of dsRNA during infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Nevertheless, RVFV activates PKR, and the 5â€™ triphosphate groups present at the RVFV genome termini act as a strong activators of RIG-I-dependent interferon induction, culminating in ISG induction [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Despite the fact that NSs is a powerful inhibitor of PKR signaling and IFNB promoter activation, our work shows that the host still mounts a significant antiviral response by 48hpi. Global transcriptome profiling during Schmallenberg virus infection (SBV) showed dampened activation of IFN stimulated genes in SBV infection as opposed to infection with SBV lacking the NSs gene [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, similar to the results shown here, their work also indicated that some antiviral genes escape NSs suppression during SBV infection.
