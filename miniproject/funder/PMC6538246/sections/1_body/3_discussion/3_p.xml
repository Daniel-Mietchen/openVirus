<p>It has been previously shown that NSs acts as a global inhibitor of transcription via its interaction with TFIIH complex components and by binding with SAP30 to prevent IFNB promoter activation [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We observed only a modest decrease in total reads obtained from MP-12 infected cells when compared with mock-infected cells, and most genes in the DEG analysis were actually upregulated during infection. A similar trend was observed by Pinkham and coworkers during mRNA-seq analysis comparing MP-12 and ZH548 strains of RVFV in HSEACs at timepoints post-infection, where it was noted that, although the differences were not statistically significant, fewer reads were obtained during later times post-infection, and DEG analysis at 18hpi yielded more upregulated than downregulated genes [

Their study did, however, support the role of NSs as a general inhibitor of transcription, since RT-qPCR analysis of several housekeeping genes at 9 and 18 hpi exhibited decreased expression relative to mock infected cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with promoter sequence microarray analysis of NSs showed that several promoter regions interacted with NSs and that the interaction corresponds to decreased expression of the corresponding genes, with the notable exception of genes associated with the coagulation cascade, which actually exhibited increased expression as a function of NSs binding [

Interestingly, KEGG analysis in our study indicated alteration in the complement and coagulation pathway at 48hpi, possibly corroborating the ability of NSs to stimulate transcription of some gene categories. While certain families of genes were overrepresented among NSs interaction regions in the ChIP study, NSs only specifically interacted with about 10% of promoter regions represented in the array [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It is possible that at later timepoints post-infection, host antiviral response gene overexpression masks the transcriptional inhibition ability of NSs which may be more effective at earlier timepoints post-infection. Furthermore, mRNA-seq analysis at 48hpi represents a single snapshot in time, not providing any information to distinguish between newly transcribed mRNAs and mRNAs that are still present due to a longer half-life or regulation by mRNA decay mechanisms. A detailed study with multiple timepoints post-infection, as well as incorporating an infection scheme using an NSs-deletion mutant virus could aid in our understanding of the role of NSs in transcription.
