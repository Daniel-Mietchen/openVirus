<p>Our analysis also showed that a surprising array of mRNA transcripts are alternatively spliced during infection. Preliminary analysis and validation of several events indicated that these are programmed events that have been previously characterized and have functional consequences for gene expression, as opposed to abberant events that could be construed as a byproduct of cellular disarray due to infection. Alternative splicing events occurring during infection were primarily in genes with GO terms related to RNA processing, and this was evident in the validated splicing events. Notably, DDX5, TRA2B and CLK2 all play important roles in RNA splicing and gene expression [

For these three genes, the alternative splicing patterns adopted during infection yielded transcripts that have been previously shown to be non-functional. Alternative splicing is appreciated widely as a mechanism for expanding genetic economy and proteome diversity. However, the coupling of alternative splicing with RNA decay pathways is also an important mechanism by which the cell can post-transcriptionally control gene expression. Although not extensively studied to this point, it is possible that this is an important mechanism adopted by the cell to fine-tune gene expression in the wake of viral infection. It is also important to acknowledge that viruses have adopted multifarious methods to thwart or hijack host RNA transcription, splicing, processing and decay [

As more transcriptome profiling studies are conducted during viral infection, it will be of great interest to examine the global splicing environment in order to better understand the host and viral mechanisms at play.
