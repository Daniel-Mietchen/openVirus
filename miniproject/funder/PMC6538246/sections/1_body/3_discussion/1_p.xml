<p>This study has detailed the transcriptional modifications and alternative splicing events that occur in RVFV MP-12 infected HEK293 cells. We demonstrate that many genes are differentially expressed and we identify GO and KEGG pathways as well as transcription factor binding sites in DEGs. One of the main themes that appeared in this analysis was activation of innate immunity and inflammation. ISGs comprised a majority of top up-regulated genes, and we confirmed an increase in several of these genes using RT-qPCR. In addition, KEGG pathways associated with DEGs included NF-kB signaling, TNF signaling, toll-like receptor signaling, RIG-I like receptor signaling, cytosolic DNA-sensing, JAK-STAT signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling.</p>
