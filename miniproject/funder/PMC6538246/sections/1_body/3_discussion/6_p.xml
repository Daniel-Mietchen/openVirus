<p>In conclusion, this study provides a transcriptomic perspective of RVFV infected HEK293 cells after two days of infection. Despite the powerful ability of NSs to derail the host immune response via inhibition of the IFNB promoter as well as NSs-driven PKR degradation, we have illustrated that the cell still mounts a robust antiviral response at this late timepoint post-infection. We further illustrate that functionally related groups of transcription factor binding sites were represented in DEGs, highlighting specific cellular priorities at this point during infection. Future transcriptome profiling studies incorporating an infection scheme with an NSs deletion MP-12 strain would better discern the effects of NSs. In addition, this is the first study to characterize significant global splicing changes that occur in RVFV infected cells, and we demonstrate that some of these splicing changes lead to non-productive trancripts. This emphasizes the importance of future studies addressing the functional consequences of the splicing overhaul that occurs as a result of infection.</p>
