<p>Another prevalent theme across our analyses were altered pathways associated with linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolism, which appeared in KEGG analysis of the DEGs. Also, TFBS overrepresented in the DEGs belonged to TFs known to regulate fatty acid metabolism. The linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolic pathways are connected, as non-essential arachidonic acid can be obtained from diet or by desaturation and elongation of the essential fatty acid linoleic acid. Free arachidonic acid is an important lipid second messenger involved in cellular signaling and arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids are critical for immune function. In particular, eicosanoids cooperate with cytokines and chemokines to influence inflammation [

Work performed in patients infected with the hemorrhagic fever virus severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), which is closely related to RVFV, has suggested that disease progression and severity are linked to inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production imbalance [
