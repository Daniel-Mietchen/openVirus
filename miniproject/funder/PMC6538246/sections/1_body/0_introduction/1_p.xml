<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease that was originally discovered in the Kenyan Rift basin in the 1930s [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. High rates of human infection coincide with above average periods of rainfall and flooding, which provide ripe conditions for an overabundance of mosquito vectors. RVFV has already demonstrated both its potential for spread outside of endemic regions and its ability to cause devastating public health and economic impacts. Furthermore, there is no licensed vaccine for human use, although there is ongoing vaccine testing in livestock [
