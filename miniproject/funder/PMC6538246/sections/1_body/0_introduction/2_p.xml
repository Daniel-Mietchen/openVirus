<p>RVFV is a tri-segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus within the 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The viral genome consists of three segments designated large (L), medium (M) and small (S), which encode the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc and nonstructural protein NSm, and the viral nucleocapsid protein N and the nonstructural virulence protein, NSs, respectively. These few viral proteins, in conjunction with host proteins, ensure that the virus can replicate its genome during a productive infection. Virus-host interaction is paramount for viral progeny production and therefore it is of great interest to understand how these interactions shape the cellular landscape during viral infection. The rising trend of high throughput mRNA sequencing has enabled a profound appreciation for the cellular transcriptomic overhaul that occurs as a result of disease progression, cancer state, or environmental condition [

 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, relatively few mRNA-seq studies to date have characterized the host response to viral infection. The studies that have risen to this challenge have revealed novel insights into host-pathogen dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0217497.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A deeper understanding of the host response to viral infection will contribute to the development of effective treatment options and targeted therapies. In this study our objective was to characterize changes in gene expression that occur during RVFV infection, as well as alterations in transcription factor usage and host splicing.
