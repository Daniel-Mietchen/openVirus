  <title>RVFV MP-12 infection in HEK293 cells at MOI = 0.1.</title>
  <p>A. Immunofluorescent detection of viral nucleocapsid protein in infected and mock-infected cells 48hpi. B. Flow cytometry analysis of the infection levels and live/dead cells ratio at 48hpi of mock-infected (left panel) and infected (right panel) cells. The X-axis represents the red fluorescence associated with the live/dead cell staining. Live cells are on the left, dead cells on the right of the vertical cut-off line. The Y-axis represents the green fluorescence associated with infection (

   <italic>e</italic>., presence of viral Gn protein). Infected cells are on the top, uninfected cells on the bottom of the horizontal cut-off line. The fraction (percent) of each of the four possible combinations (dead/live, uninfected/infected) is indicated in the corner of each quadrant. C. RT-qPCR absolute quantification of the viral sense small genome segment at timepoints post-infection. Each point represents the mean copy number during infections performed in triplicate.
