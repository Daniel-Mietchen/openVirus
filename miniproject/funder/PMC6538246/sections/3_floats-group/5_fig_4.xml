  <title>Alternative splicing events induced by viral infection.</title>
  <p>A. Significant AS events in infected compared with mock-infected cells. Splicing pattern types identified by the MISO algorithm are shown. B. Verification of AS events using RT-PCR with PCR primers flanking the spliced region. IGV was used to visualize mRNA-seq transcripts and the vertical axis represents the quantity of mapped reads for each condition. Red arrows indicate the primer amplicon region, except for RIOK3, where a larger region was amplified between exons 5 and 10.</p>
