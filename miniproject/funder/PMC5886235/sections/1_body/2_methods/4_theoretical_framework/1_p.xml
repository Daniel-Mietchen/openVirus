<p>Policy transfer theory explores how ‘knowledge about policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in one political setting (past or present) are used in the development of policies, administrative arrangements, institutions and ideas in another political setting’ (

National responses to global health issues appear increasingly guided by ideas put forward by organizations in the international community; in particular, in low- and middle-income settings where financial and technical assistance are often provided in support of adoption of policies or acceptance of norms. We utilize elements of two pre-existing theoretical frameworks to uncover the policy transfer process that has occurred in Ghana and Uganda. 
 <xref rid="czx132-B3" ref-type="bibr">Dolowitz and Marsh’s (1996)</xref> framework poses six questions to examine the policy transfer process (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T7">Box 2</xref>). The framework encourages evaluation of the extent to which transfer has occurred and is evident, in addition to what potential constraints on transfer exists that may prohibit transfer, both of which are of value to our investigation into the manner in which the 90–90–90 targets have been adopted in the current environment of financial uncertainty and health system capacity constraints (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T7">Box 2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="czx132-B3" ref-type="bibr">Dolowitz and Marsh 1996</xref>). We integrate this framework with the GHAPP framework to consider the involvement of actor networks at local and global levels influencing the response, as opposed to vertical or horizontal analyses commonly applied in policy transfer studies. Furthermore, while Dolowitz and Marsh consider the rationale for transfer on a spectrum—from voluntary to more directly coerced—the network features, policy environment and issue characteristics considered in the GHAPP framework are used to consider why such a pattern of transfer was observed. This allows a more nuanced comparison between the two case study countries. Thus, questions D to F of Dolowitz and Marsh are expanded upon utilizing aspects of the GHAPP framework (Box 2).
