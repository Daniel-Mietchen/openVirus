<p>Case studies of the response to 90–90–90 were conducted between August 2016 (25 months following UNAIDS’ release of 90–90–90) and April 2017 in Ghana and Uganda. The countries were selected purposively for their differences in current HIV burden, historic response to the epidemic, and economic status (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T1">Table 1</xref>). Uganda has high HIV burden and a long history of engaging different actors to implement a variety of approaches to combat the epidemic; how the low-income nation responds to these ambitious targets in this context is thus of interest (

 </xref>). Ghana has a low HIV prevalence relative to Uganda but also exhibits lower treatment coverage. Whilst Ghana has experienced economic growth to reach lower-middle income status this necessitates greater counterpart financing for the HIV programme; whether the country prioritises resources to respond to these targets is thus of interest (
