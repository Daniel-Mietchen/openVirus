<p>Documents relevant to the national HIV response in Ghana and Uganda were searched for by the primary researcher from websites of the National AIDS Commission (NAC), Ministry of Health (MOH), President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), The Global Fund and Country Coordinating Mechanism (the two major funders of the HIV programme in both countries) from July 2014 onwards (the date UNAIDS released 90–90–90—at the International AIDS Society conference in Melbourne). Key informants were also asked to share documents released post July 2014 that may have included national HIV policies, programme or budget information. Twenty-three documents were obtained (14 Ghana, 9 for Uganda). The document review allowed for tracing of transfer over time. Documents were assessed for presence or absence of alignment to the 90–90–90 targets in rhetoric (defined as statements regarding the adoption or alignment to the targets or whether the country is ‘on track’ to meet the targets), actual or planned policy or programme changes, and actual or planned budgetary changes (such as seeking programme efficiencies, donor or domestic resource mobilization or re-allocation). Details on policy and programme changes were extracted and compared against recommendations from UNAIDS’ 90–90–90 strategy to assess whether a shift in approach from ‘business as usual’ had occurred. A second reviewer verified data extraction.</p>
