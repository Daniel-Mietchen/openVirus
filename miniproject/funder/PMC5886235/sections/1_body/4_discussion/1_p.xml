<p>The setting of health targets by global health institutions intended for adoption at the national-level is increasingly commonplace. Review of the influence of these targets on policy, programme, and resources is of value to those that set the targets and those that are intended to respond. First, as global health initiatives can ascertain whether the targets they set result in any real changes to programmes, and learn from factors that facilitate and hinder adoption. Second, as it is not necessarily clear that national level decision-makers should respond to all targets set down upon them because of resource constraints on the health budget. In this study, we explore the transfer of the 90–90–90 treatment targets set by UNAIDS near to midway through the timeframe to 2020, in two countries, Ghana and Uganda, that have markedly different HIV disease burden.</p>
