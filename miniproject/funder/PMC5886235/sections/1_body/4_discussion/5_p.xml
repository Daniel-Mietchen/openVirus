<p>In this study, transfer appears to be based to a large extent on the desire for international acceptance, to conform to social norms, and for receipt of funding for the HIV programme. In the policy transfer literature, Dolowitz and Marsh state their belief that transfer based upon financial necessity or for international acceptance is more likely coerced rather than voluntary, and thus may be more likely to result in policy failure due to inappropriate transfer of the policy to that context (
 <xref rid="czx132-B4" ref-type="bibr">Dolowitz and Marsh 2000</xref>). We argue, however, that coerced transfer is not always inappropriate; the 90–90–90 targets and associated policy content are based on research evidence and we do not find clear evidence that the targets have diverted resources away from other important health issues (whether such targets are still detrimental to attainment to goals of universal health coverage remains unknown). However, it is clear that context specific investigations need to be conducted and supported so that decision-makers at the national level can ascertain how beneficial a response is in terms of population health.
