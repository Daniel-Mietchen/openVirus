<p>UNAIDS reported global progress to 90–90–90 at the mid-way point to 2020 (
 <xref rid="czx132-B42" ref-type="bibr">UNAIDS 2017</xref>). While Botswana has already met the targets, for most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a substantial way to go. Whilst Ghana and Uganda demonstrate their intentions to respond to 90–90 and ‘test and treat’, what will get translated into practice on the ground is likely to suffer gaps between intentions and actions. For the shift from nationwide scale up to an approach that targets populations and geographies to have the desired impact, there is requirement for a high degree of certitude in where to target limited resources or for flexibility in reallocation of resources should the evidence, upon which allocation decisions have been made, change. PEPFAR are thought to have a relatively high degree of flexibility in allocation of resources, compared with domestic resources, as evidenced by their reconfiguration in focus districts between Country Operational Plans 2015 and 2016 in Ghana and Uganda further to latest data on local epidemiology or service use, respectively (
