<p>In both countries, and across the African continent, reporting of financial information for the HIV response has been limited and inconsistent. Uganda’s last National AIDS Spending Assessment covers up to 2010 only. Thus efforts to track funding allocations are weak. Analysis of budgetary changes and health outcomes would likely yield more information on the actual consequences of such targets, but will not be feasible until tracking of expenditure is institutionalized and routine. We therefore make a call for better reporting on such information in order to improve decision-making in the longer term. It was not possible to interview all desired individuals, in particular the Ministry of Finance, which would have provided insight on internal allocation processes. When interviewing senior representatives of organizations, as we did in our study, it can be difficult to obtain an honest personal opinion rather than the ‘party line’. We consider the respondents to have been relatively truthful, however, given that concerns were raised over realization of resources and as statements were largely corroborated with the document review.</p>
