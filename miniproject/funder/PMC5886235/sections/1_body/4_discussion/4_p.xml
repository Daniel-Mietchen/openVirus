<p>We find the Dolowitz and Marsh framework valuable for enabling consideration of differences in the response in two settings, but limited in explanatory power for the differences between settings, in particular, in regard to the role of actor networks. We find supplementing the Dolowitz and Marsh framework with the GHAPP useful in considering a range of factors that influenced the effectiveness of transfer. Through application of the GHAPP we see how lessons are being drawn from mathematical modelling analyses with US government agencies funding the provision of such technical assistance. We consider there to be a growing epistemic community of mathematical modellers arising in the HIV response; modellers provided the framework through which to consider how to eliminate the AIDS epidemic (that is the 90–90–90 targets) and offer a framework for considering how best to respond, thus driving national application of such methods. Mathematical modelling studies that demonstrate the cost effectiveness of ART scale up for test and treat have been criticized for being ‘theoretically optimal, but practically infeasible’ (

Whether countries that directly apply mathematical modelling to inform HIV programme planning achieve greater impact than countries that do not, may warrant investigation.
