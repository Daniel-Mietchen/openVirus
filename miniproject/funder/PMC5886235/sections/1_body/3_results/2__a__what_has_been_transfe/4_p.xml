<p>The majority of participants felt the targets were largely influential over allocations within donor budgets, but less so for the national HIV programme budget. One respondent in Uganda stated: ‘You go and talk to Ministry of Finance and say with respect to 90–90–90, we have these strategies, how has this changed your budgets? The answer is zero’. (R1, Uganda). When asked why, respondents stated that reallocation would not occur as domestic budgets predominantly relate to recurrent management costs. Across both settings, no respondents were aware of funds being transferred to HIV from other areas of the health budget to respond to these targets or any other previously. Respondents from TB and malaria programmes stated that they were not aware of, or did not feel that, their disease budget had suffered as a consequence of 90–90–90. A number of respondents in Ghana were optimistic that the Government of Ghana would pledge additional funds as they previously pledged 150 million Ghana Cedis (USD 98.5m 2011 equivalent) for implementation of the 2011–16 NSP at a United Nations Special Session. Other respondents were more sceptical, stating actual government disbursement was ∼50% of what was promised: ‘Financially we have not seen the government honour its funding commitments to HIV—at least on the commodity side of HIV in the past 2 or 3 years’ (R10, Ghana). One respondent in Ghana thought there could be reallocation of central funds if Government of Ghana could not mobilize sufficient resources elsewhere to honour commitments of counterpart financing for ‘test and treat’ to PEPFAR for the 2019/20 period.</p>
