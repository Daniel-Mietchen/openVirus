<p>All respondents across both settings stated the national HIV response in their country had adopted the 90–90–90 targets with the majority stating the targets had influenced significant policy, programme and budgetary changes. This was largely supported by findings from the document review; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T4">Table 4</xref> presents an overview of the national documents reviewed. Documents from both settings evidence adoption of the 90–90–90 targets in rhetoric, in addition to policy, programme and budget changes intended to support implementation to meet the targets. In both countries, adoption of the 90–90–90 targets, and planned programme and budgetary support for 90–90–90 is first witnessed in PEPFAR’s Country Operational Plans and is recognized in national strategic (August 2016 in Uganda and September 2016 in Ghana), policy and operational documents subsequently. Ten (71%) documents in Ghana and 4 (44%) documents in Uganda detail proposed, planned or actual programme or policy changes to respond to 90–90–90. Of interest, many key informants in Uganda commented on the alignment of the latest National Strategic Plan (NSP) to 90–90–90; however, the targets were only mentioned once on page 64 (compared with 55 mentions in the Ghanaian NSP). Two respondents said this was because the targets came late in the development of the NSP, whereas more respondents (

Although not attributed to 90–90–90, the programme targets in the Ugandan NSP are closely aligned to the global targets—the target treatment coverage for PLHIV is 80% by 2020 (also stated as 80% in the 2015 PEPFAR Country Operational Plan, but referred to as ‘national saturation’) as opposed to the 81% of the 90–90–90 targets.
