<p>Details on how the countries intend to respond to 90–90–90 as demonstrated in the documents reviewed and discussed in interviews are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T5">Table 5</xref> against recommendations from UNAIDS. Both countries demonstrate a move from broad nationwide scale-up to an approach that targets populations and geographies of highest burden to achieve optimal impact with the available resources, which demonstrates a substantial shift in approach for both countries. Arguably, Uganda demonstrates a more marked shift, rapidly moving to district programming, whereas Ghana first adopts a regional plan and focuses on prior gaps in nationwide intervention coverage, such as prevention of mother to child transmission. The following excerpt from PEPFAR Uganda’s Country Operational Plan summarizes the change toward programme prioritization by geography and population:

  <p>
   <italic>PEPFAR Uganda previously focused on national programmatic scale up with little emphasis on geographical prevalence, disease burden, or evidence of KPs [key populations]/PPs [priority populations]. During 2015 COP [Country Operational Plan] preparation, attention was paid to aligning district budgets and associated targets to disease burden and population</italic> (PEPFAR Uganda Country Operational Plan 2015).
