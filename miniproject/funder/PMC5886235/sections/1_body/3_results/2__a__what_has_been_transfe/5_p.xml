<p>Given unlikely gains from government resources in both settings, the NACs were undertaking a variety of approaches for domestic resource mobilization to close the resource gap. The Ghana NAC were awarded a grant from the United Nations Development Program for the employment of a full-time ‘Resource Mobilization Officer’ and were continuing efforts to institutionalize HIV funding as part of private companies’ corporate social responsibility, holding annual private sector roundtable breakfast meetings to seek funds. In Uganda a national tax (2% from alcoholic drinks) was to be developed: ‘AIDS Trust Fund’. However, progress in establishing the fund was uncertain due to disagreements between MOH and Uganda NAC about whether this should be managed by MOH or independently. Ghana NAC passed legislation in 2015 for the development of a similar HIV fund in Ghana. The volume of funding obtained from these means, however, is limited and will not be sufficient to close the resource gap in either country.</p>
