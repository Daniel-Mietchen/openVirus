<p>The network of actors involved in the transfer of the target was diverse but broadly similar across Ghana and Uganda (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T3">Table 3</xref>); comprised of actors at global and local levels from a variety of sectors within and outside health (Factor 3—composition of actor networks). In Uganda, however, PEPFAR has a much more dominant role, funding over 70% of the HIV programme. There was no major opposition to the transfer of the targets noted by respondents from either setting; however, a senior implementer in Ghana voiced they had wanted adoption of more modest and realistic targets given perceived implementation challenges and resource gaps: ‘I kept mentioning it is not possible and we won’t do it until we get the money – people were feeling that I was going to be a stumbling block’ (R6, Ghana) (Factor 5—allies and opponents). UNAIDS Geneva, utilizing its widely accepted role as a technical leader in the HIV response, created awareness of the targets through several participatory venues for discussion with policy-makers from sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana and Uganda: launch at International AIDS Society meeting in Melbourne, Australia (2014), United Nations retreat in Addis Ababa (2015) and formal adoption by the African Union at a meeting in Johannesburg in 2015 (Factor 1—leadership). Once passed down to the national level, the local health networks in both settings, was described as well governed by all respondents (particularly in comparison to the ‘disorganized past’), with all actors participating in the network clear on their roles and responsibility in the response, with NACs coordinating the effort (Factor 2—governance). In Uganda, there was a clear role of civil society and affected populations who had bought into the targets and were advocating for a response (Factor 10—role of affected groups). Consequently, the national launch for 90–90–90, organized by UNAIDS and Uganda NAC, was held at the main local organization for people living with HIV, which was cited by many as playing an important role in acceptance of the targets locally, in particular by affected groups. In Ghana, the Director General of the NAC was named by many as a clear leader in the response, acting as a policy entrepreneur, as a result of her position on central UNAIDS boards (Factor 1—leadership), which may explain the vocal response to 90–90–90 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T4">Table 4</xref>) despite the significant financial and health system constraints demonstrated in the USAID reports: ‘The Director General is on the panel of the UNAIDS and so she would really want to demonstrate clearly our commitment [to 90–90–90]’. R1, Ghana. In Uganda, such a significant portion of the programme is funded by PEPFAR, who appear to have been able to relatively quickly refocus their programme activities from general nationwide scale up to district programming (Factor 6 – funding). In both settings, it appears that lessons were also drawn from mathematical modelling analyses, typically conducted and funded by US Government agencies; however, the extent to which these studies influenced actual programme activities is unclear (Factor 3 – composition of actor networks). In Uganda, a respondent explained that utilizing modelling, a number of programme scenarios for the HIV response were simulated, including one to meet 90–90–90 and another scenario (‘feasible maximum’) that estimated the programme coverage achievable with the resources realistically to be mobilized in the country. The latter scenario was selected and incorporated into the NSP, perhaps explaining the slightly lower targets adopted.
