<p>The health networks in both settings appear to have developed highly effective framing strategies for encouraging a response to the 90–90–90 targets (Factor 4 – framing strategies). Respondents from both countries demonstrated recognition of the benefits of meeting the policy target, both clinically and at the population level. Specifically, interviewees spoke of the merits of early treatment, the deployment of effective interventions (Factor 9—tractability), and the importance of eliminating the AIDS epidemic (the ‘policy goal’). The lower severity of the epidemic in Ghana could have been prohibitive in ensuring rapid transfer of the 90–90–90 targets (Factor 5 – severity). However, the network of actors appear to have still been effective in facilitating marked policy and programme change by utilizing framing strategies (Factor 4) – that the low HIV prevalence in Ghana should not encourage complacency, but should instead motivate desire to eradicate HIV so that the country may demonstrate leadership in West Africa, with one stating: ‘only right to be able to address this issue and eliminate HIV from this country while the epidemic is still small’ (R11). Such phrasing of ‘only right’ also demonstrates the now well-embedded norms of human rights within the HIV response that encourage a response, such as the right to health, and thus access to efficacious medicines, which is aligned with the 90–90–90 treatment targets (Factor 7—norms).</p>
