<p>Whilst all respondents voiced that transfer was voluntary or ‘not an imposition’, transfer of the target was clearly attributed to the mandate to respond to the United Nations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx132-T3">Table 3</xref>). Some respondents described a feeling of pressure or competition within the international community, put by one Ugandan respondent (Factor 7—norms): ‘that you just look terrible if you do not pick up the target’(R9). The majority of informants across both settings said that availability of funding was not a reason to adopt the 90–90–90 targets given the resources available would be insufficient for the complete response. However, it did still appear that there was a strong financial motivation for accepting the targets (Factor 6—funding). PEPFAR have largely driven the response to ‘test and treat’ in both settings, providing funding for commodities; funding for commodities was made available further to necessary revisions in clinical treatment guidelines. One respondent in Uganda succinctly highlighted the requirement to respond to the United Nations and for securing funding:

   <italic>90 targets are global targets and that is guidance that cascades from UNAIDS and WHO - member countries have to respond to that, but also that is essentially an addendum to Sustainable Development Goals and a framework for funding. If you are not there then you cannot get funding because this is the framework</italic> (R6, Uganda).
