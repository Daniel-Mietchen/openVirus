<p>Respondents in Ghana reported a higher number of alternate constraints to the transfer of the targets than in Uganda. One respondent commented on constraints observed in reallocating resources from more generalized programme scale up to selected regions, noting that initially there had been little political support for prioritized programmes over universal coverage. Further to this, the respondent noted that limitations in epidemiological information at lower administrative units added a fair amount of uncertainty in programme planning and resource allocation for the response. Conversely, four respondents felt very confident in the location of PLHIV for informing programmes at local levels. Respondents with positions relating to implementation discussed concerns over health system capacity in regard to the uptake of newly developed task-shifting guidelines (not released at time of publication). Whilst these factors had not influenced the adoption of the targets, they are likely to influence the policy-practice gap. One respondent phrased this succinctly:

   <italic>So it feels a bit like 90</italic>–
   <italic>90</italic>–
   <italic>90 has been launched in name and targets have been put in place and there is a roadmap, very high level, but there is no detailed planning as yet and it is not clear yet what the output will be</italic> (R17, Ghana).
