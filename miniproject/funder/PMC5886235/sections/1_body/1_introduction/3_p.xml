For the targets to be met, a substantial shift is needed from the strategy of broad nationwide programme scale up, to more targeted and active promotion and provision of testing, treatment and care that is cognizant of the geographic and demographic heterogeneity of the epidemic. An estimated 36 billion USD is required globally per year between 2015 and 2020 to fund implementation; however, in 2013 an estimated 19 million USD was mobilized for the HIV response, which falls far short of this new requirement (
