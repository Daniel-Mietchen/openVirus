<p>Whilst HIV programmes in many sub-Saharan African countries are well established, and have achieved tremendous scale up in access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the past decade, the 90–90–90 targets have been met with scepticism, and even criticism, for being over ambitious (

The utilization of mathematical modelling for informing programme decisions across a range of countries, such as the analysis accompanying the 90–90–90 targets and the policy goal to end AIDS necessitates generalization of intervention costs and impact. Most mathematical modelling studies, such as this, do not capture the full range of budget and health system constraints that may limit the feasibility of approaches deemed cost-effective from such analyses (

 </xref>). Complex public health interventions, such as those advocated for in 90–90–90, present a wide range of context specific constraints that may prohibit ease of adoption that must be considered by decision-makers alongside the benefits of responding to such targets.
