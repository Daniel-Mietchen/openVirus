<p>In this research, we aim to explore what the influence of UNAIDS’ 90–90–90 targets have been on the national HIV programme in Ghana and Uganda. We assess how these technical and ambitious targets have been transferred, or adopted and adapted, to the national level and whether the transfer of the targets appears in rhetoric only, or if notable policy, programme and budgetary changes have occurred to support implementation (we do not assess implementation). We utilize an integrated analytical approach that combines the policy transfer framework developed by Dolowitz and Marsh to consider what has been transferred how this is evidenced, and constraints on transfer, and supplement this with Global Health Advocacy and Policy Project (GHAPP) conceptual framework for the effectiveness of global health networks to provide deeper reflection on the role of actor networks in mediating the observed response to the 90–90–90 targets (
