<p>Debates on the value of global targets or vertical programmes in low-income countries and their impact on health systems have prevailed for many years. Arguments against include concerns that targets can obfuscate efforts to achieve universal health care coverage by channelling resources toward one health concern that may not have the greatest effect on population health or be aligned with priorities of the government (

In low-income settings where resources are highly limited, the potential opportunity cost of reallocation of health resources to meet just one disease specific target may be great. An alternative view, however, is that some targets are adopted in rhetoric only, as a vision to guide the response, but to a large extent do not influence programme activities or resource allocation and thus have minimal impact on health. Here targets are of little concern, but are ultimately ineffective at achieving policy change. Evaluation of the Expanded Programme on Immunization for the eradication of polio found that, while successful in galvanizing attention, action and strengthening immunization programmes more broadly, in some settings there was diversion of resources to meet this health goal at the expense of other health issues or the wider development agenda (
