<p>The 90–90–90 targets have been transferred to the national programme in Ghana and Uganda with evidence of a shift to more targeted programming and reinvigoration of domestic resource mobilization efforts. Differences in adoption of the targets between the countries studied could be attributed to variation in the composition of the actor networks involved in the transfer of the targets and the technical and financial resources available to them. Whether the targets achieve significant traction in implementation and ultimately the intended policy goal warrants follow-up. Improvements in routine collection and reporting of resource allocation and budgeting for the HIV response are recommended in order to support quantitative assessments of the influence of disease-specific targets on national HIV programme activities and across health more broadly.</p>
