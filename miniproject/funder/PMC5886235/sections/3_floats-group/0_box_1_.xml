        <bold>First 90:</bold> More frequent testing/increase demand for testing; strategic, focused testing to key population groups and/or geographies; increase/make available a broader number of HIV testing and counselling approaches, e.g. self-testing, provider initiated counselling and testing and community-based approaches.

        <bold>Second 90:</bold> Recommend antiretroviral therapy to all people with diagnosed HIV infection (or ‘test and treat’), without the requirement of a prior CD4 test; use of preferred, optimized regimens; make HIV treatment and care (including diagnostic tests and other treatment-related items) free to the individual; address implementation issues that have often slowed scale-up, e.g. frequent drug stockouts, barriers to procurement of optimally affordable medicines and diagnostics, and inadequate availability of second- and third-line regimens.

        <bold>Third 90:</bold> Sustained use of HIV treatment and ongoing virologic monitoring to verify treatment success and to intervene to support treatment adherence and re-engage those who fall out of care; every person starting HIV treatment will need to have access to viral load testing.
