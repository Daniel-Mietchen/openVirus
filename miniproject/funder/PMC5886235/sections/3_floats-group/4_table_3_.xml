       <p>The 90–90–90 treatment targets (also the policy goal of eliminating the AIDS epidemic, and much of the associated policy content) and concepts for more targeted programming that is cognizant of geography and population groups. In addition the need to increase programme efficiency and mobilize resources domestically. This was evidenced in rhetoric with all key informants in both settings and in policy, programme and budgetary documents (but to a lesser extent for the latter).</p>

       <p>Appears to be greater flexibility in reallocation of resources to more targeted approach as PEPFAR are the major funder of the HIV programme and thus have more autonomy with which to decide how to reallocate compared with government resources.

       <p>Whilst the reasons for adoption of the targets are many there are substantial constraints operating the may limit the rationality of implementing these targets, in particular when considering the cost required in terms of overall benefit to population health as a decision maker. There is a clear amount of international pressure to respond to the targets – in many cases countries may have signed on to respond to the targets before even conducting studies into the feasibility of implementation. Respondents in both settings cited the feeling of international pressure to adopt the targets regardless of available funding.</p>

      <list-item>
       <p>Summary: Transfer of 90–90–90 is voluntary as was not a pre-requisite for receipt of funding, driven by perceived necessity as a mandate to the UN and for international acceptance/conforming to global norms to respond. However, to receive funding from PEPFAR for ‘test and treat’ both countries needed to revise their treatment guidelines—for this specific policy this could therefore be argued as more a direct imposition.</p>
