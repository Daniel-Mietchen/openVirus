<p>Several limitations should be noted in our study. First, the estimated parameters were averaged in our model. In reality, the individual differences in humans and mosquitoes make the parameters different (e.g., transmission rate or recovery rate). The stochastic model may be used to provide a more accurate estimation for the epidemic in the future[

Therefore, this proportion has to be estimated by the model and may lead to overestimation or underestimation of the epidemic. Third, the parameters for mosquitoes, such as the density-independent death rate, the transmission rate and the natural growth rate, are affected by many climate factors, especially temperature[
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The daily mean temperature in Hangzhou is ordinarily below 20 degrees after October 15 and the density of the mosquitoes drops with temperature. Therefore, the effectiveness of the control measures in this epidemic may be overestimated. The model with climate factors is necessary for future studies and may provide more accurate simulations. Finally, owing to hypersensitivity to the number of cases for one parameter, the implications of our conclusion should be limited to the value setting in this research.
