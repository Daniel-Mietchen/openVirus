<p>In conclusion, the practical control interventions in the outbreak that occurred in Hangzhou were highly effective and prevented most of the infections. The proportion of inapparent infections was large, and inapparent infections played an important role in transmitting the disease during this epidemic. High efficacy and early vector control measures could significantly decrease the number of cases. Continuous vector control intervention was necessary compared with implementing them every few days. The effectiveness of isolation of the symptomatic case was not as good as that of controlling the mosquitoes for the high I:S ratio. As inapparent infections contribute to the global spread of dengue and increase the probability of severe outcomes in secondary infections, early, continuous and high efficacy vector control interventions are necessary to limit the development of dengue epidemics and to lower the future risk of severe outcomes. The timely diagnosis and case report are important in the intervention at an early stage of the epidemic.</p>
