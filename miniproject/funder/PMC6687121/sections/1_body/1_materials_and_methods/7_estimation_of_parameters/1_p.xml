<p>The total human population was reported from the system. Ten variables, including

 </sub>, would be unknown and unstable from different outbreaks. Therefore, these ten variables were estimated and optimized from the model. The method used was the Runge-Kutta method of order 4. The other four variables, including 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>h</italic>1
 </sub>, 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>v</italic>

 <italic>γ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>h</italic>1

 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>v</italic>
 </sub>, were generally known and stable. Thus, they were referred to related studies[

 <xref rid="pone.0220391.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All the parameters are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220391.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The reduction rate of mosquitoes as a result of the vector control measures (
 <italic>δ</italic>) was set to 0, -log0.95, -log0.925 and -log0.90, which means without vector control measures, 5% daily reduction in mosquito density at day t, 7.5% daily reduction in mosquito density at day t and 10% daily reduction in mosquito density at day t, respectively. The proportion of isolation (Q) was set to 100%, which means every symptomatic case should be isolated in time, while 0 means no isolation (
