<p>According to the global autocorrelation analysis, the distribution of the dengue cases in the outbreak presented a spatial autocorrelation. The Moran's I Index was 0.2097 (
 <italic>Z</italic> score = 2.7366, 
 <italic>P</italic> value&lt;0.001). In addition, it was shown in the semivariogram figure that the value of the semivariation function was relatively low over a short range. The value gradually increased as the distance between the sample points grew and fluctuated around an extremum when the distance grew to a particular value. The partial sill (C
 <sub>1</sub>) was 1.053. The nugget (C
 <sub>0</sub>) was 0.2055. The C
 <sub>1</sub>/ C
 <sub>0</sub>+ C
 <sub>1</sub> ratio was 83.67%. This ratio suggested that the spatial autocorrelation was relatively strong in general (
