  <title>Spatiotemporal distribution of the 2018 JE incidence in Ningxia.</title>
  <p>The information of JE cases demonstrated on the map were obtained from the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS). The spatiotemporal distribution of JE cases was analyzed using ArcGIS (v.10.0; ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Each point represents a case of JE; red points are cases reported (excludes the JE cases diagnosed in this study) in Ningxia in 2018, and blue points are confirmed cases diagnosed in this study. From the south to the north: GY, Guyuan City; ZW, Zhongwei City; WZ, Wuzhong City; YC, Yinchuan City; and SZS, Shizuishan City, same in Fig2(A, B, C). The shading scheme for this map is used to distinguish the five different cities of Ningxia province. Fig2A shows that 1 case was reported in July, Fig2B shows that 113 cases were reported in August, of which 67 were confirmed cases diagnosed in this study, Fig2C shows that 48 cases were reported in September.</p>
