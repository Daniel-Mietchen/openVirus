  <title>Phylogenetic analyses of the E fragment of JEV from human cases and mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>Blue indicates JE gene sequences from mosquito specimens of Ningxia in 2018. Red indicates the JEV isolate (NX1889) from cerebrospinal fluid specimens of JE cases. Fig 3A used data set of reported JEV GIb isolates[
   <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] along with JEV GIbs from the 2018 Ningxia outbreak, including seven JEV sequences from mosquitoes and one from human; To visualize the phylogenetic relationship of JEV GIbs from Ningxia, the referenced JEV GIb isolates shown in Fig 3B were selected from Fig 3A and represent different hosts (equid, midge, human, mosquito, pig, and unknown host), different countries (China, Japan, Korea, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and Australia), and different times (from the 1970s to 2000s).
