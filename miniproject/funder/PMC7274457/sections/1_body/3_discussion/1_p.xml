<p>In this study, multiple strains of JEV GIb were obtained from JE cases and

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008312.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) showed that JEV GIb was divided into two clades, one of which consisted of two viruses isolated from Vietnam and Thailand in 2005, and the other of which included JEV isolates from mosquitoes and pigs, and cases from China, Japan and Korea, which could be further divided into multiple branches. Among the JEVs GIb that caused the 2018 JE outbreak in Ningxia, there were also two branches, the Ningxia/Yunnan branch, which has circulated in China in the past, and the Ningxia 2018 branch, which has been evolving in the local environment of Ningxia regionally. Thus it can be inferred that JEV GIb was the pathogen that caused the 2018 Ningxia JE outbreak. However, whether the Ningxia 2018 branch could continue to circulate in the local mosquitoes and cause human infection, or appeared only once, as was the case for the two JEV GIb strains isolated from Vietnam and Thailand in 2005. This might become a new issue for monitoring the phylogenetic evolution of JEVs in Ningxia.
