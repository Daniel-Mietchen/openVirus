<p>As mentioned above, JEV GIb was detected simultaneously in JE case samples (serum and cerebrospinal fluid) and mosquito samples collected in nature in this study, that is, both clinical samples and natural samples suggested that this JE outbreak was caused by JEV GIb infection. However, there are also some shortcomings in this study, for example, this study only obtained one JEV strain (NX1889) from case samples, besides, although a large number of JEV gene-positive were detected in mosquito samples, no JEV isolates were obtained and further analysis in viral molecular biology could not be carried out. In conclusion, to provide more basic etiological data for the relationship between the changes of JEV genotype and local diseases, a long-term detection and monitoring of local JE cases and virus carriage in mosquitoes in Ningxia is needed.</p>
