<p>To exclude the possible serological cross-reaction between JEV and WNV, the seven cases positive for JEV and WNV IgM antibody were followed up with collection of convalescent serum. Convalescent serum was obtained from four cases. The detection of neutralizing antibodies against JEV and WNV was carried out in parallel with the acute and convalescent sera of the four cases (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). JEV neutralizing antibody in the acute stage of all four cases was 1:10 or lower, but was 1:40 or 1:80 in the convalescent stage. In all specimens, the WNV neutralizing antibody level was less than 1:10, indicating that these four cases presented with JEV infection rather than WNV.
