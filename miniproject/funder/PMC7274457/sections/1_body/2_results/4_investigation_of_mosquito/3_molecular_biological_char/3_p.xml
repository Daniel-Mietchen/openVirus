<p>Phylogenetic analyses were performed as reported previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]to determine the genotypes of the viral sequences obtained from Ningxia in 2018. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008312.g003">Fig 3</xref>, JEV was divided into five lineages (five genotypes), of which genotype I could be divided into two clusters, JEV GIa and JEV GIb. JEVs isolated from cases and mosquitoes in Ningxia 2018 belong to the JEV GIb cluster. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008312.g003">Fig 3B</xref> shows that the viruses isolated in Ningxia in 2018 were grouped into two branches of JEV GIb. One branch is NX340(from mosquito) that forms a separate branch (Ningxia/Yunnan branch) with isolates from two JE cases in Yunnan Province, in 2009. The other branch consists of the remaining JEVs isolated in Ningxia in 2018 that form another separate branch (Ningxia 2018 branch), including isolates from JE cases and mosquitoes from the local environment of Ningxia, 2018. The JEVs of the latter branch were completely independent of the other isolates and became a completely new viral phylogenetic population in the evolution of JEV GIb.
