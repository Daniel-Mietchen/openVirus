<p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus disease caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). JEV can circulate in several hosts: Aquatic wading birds are reservoir hosts [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], pigs are amplification hosts, and humans and equids are the terminal hosts. The first JEV was detected in Japan, which caused a pandemic that infected 6,000 people in 1924. Since then the virus has been found to be mosquito-borne. Humans can be infected with JEV through mosquito bites, particularly

 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although JEV is infectious to all age groups, JE mainly occurs in children and the mortality rate is approximately 30%. Although JE is a vaccine-preventable disease, it is prevalent in 24 countries and regions in Asia and Oceania. Approximately 3 billion people live in JEV endemic areas and are threatened by JEV infection; therefore, JE represents a significant disease burden with a fatality rate of 20–30% and neurological or psychiatric sequelae in 30–50% of survivors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. JE has become a public health issue of international concern [
