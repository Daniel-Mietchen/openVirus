<p>Pools of 50 mosquito specimens were homogenized in a 1.5mL Eppendorf (EP) tube with 1 mL 4°C pre-cooled minimum essential medium (MEM) (10-010-CVR; Corning, Inc, Corning, NY, USA) containing 5% Penicillin (1000units/mL)Streptomycin(100μg/mL)(PS)(15070–063, GIBCOTM, Invitrogen, USA). The EP tube was then placed in an oscillating instrument (Retsch Tissue Lyser, Cat. No. 85220; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and oscillated at a frequency of 25 oscillations s
 <sup>−1</sup> for 3 min. The oscillated EP tube was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C until detection [
