<p>qRT-PCR detection of JEV and WNV was performed on extracted RNA using the Stratagene real-time PCR instrument (model MX300; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the AgPath-IDTM One-step RT-PCR Kit (AM1005, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Universal primers and probes for JEV (detect JEV genotype I, III and V) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and specific primers and probes for WNV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] were used. Then the positive samples detected by qRT-PCR with JEV universal primers were amplified using primers specific for JEV E gene. The PCR products were subjected to nucleotide sequence determination and JE virus phylogenetic analyses were used to confirm the JEV genotype.
