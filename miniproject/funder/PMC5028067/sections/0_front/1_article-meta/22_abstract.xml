 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>Zika virus was first isolated in Uganda in 1947 and exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes and non-human primates or humans. Whilst most clinical infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness, Zika virus has recently been linked to neurological syndromes, such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and congenital birth defects. Since 2007, Zika virus has undergone a dramatic range expansion, causing epidemics in nations and territories of the western Pacific and South America. To assess the emergence and transmission risk of Zika virus emerging in Australia, we evaluated the ability of local mosquitoes to become infected with and transmit the prototype African Zika virus strain. In agreement with its substantiated role in Zika virus transmission overseas, Australian 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> were shown to be competent vectors. Coupled with its anthropophilic feeding behavior, this species should be considered the primary potential Zika virus vector in Australia. Although other common Australian species, such as 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>notoscriptus</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>vigilax</italic>, were readily infected, they did not transmit the virus. The species of 
  <italic>Culex</italic> tested were either refractory to infection or had a low infection rate. We also demonstrated that the Zika virus dose necessary to infect 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> was higher than virus levels reported in infected humans. Finally, a high threshold level of virus circulating through the mosquito body was required before 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> transmitted the virus. These results suggest that an outbreak of Zika virus in Australia would require high mosquito population densities and a susceptible human population.
