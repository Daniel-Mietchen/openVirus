  <title>Example standard curve used in each experimental run to determine viral load.</title>
  <p>The standard curve was prepared using RNA extracted from ZIKV MR 766 virus stock as template. The x-axis represents the concentration of duplicate, serially diluted template (0.01 to 10000 tissue culture infectious doses equivalents/ml) and the y-axis plots the resultant real-time RT-PCR Ct values.</p>
