<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated from a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 during studies investigating the ecology of yellow fever virus [

 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic>, indicating a mosquito-borne transmission cycle. It was not until almost 20 years later that human clinical disease attributed to ZIKV infection was recognized [

Although 80% of infections remain asymptomatic, clinical disease caused by ZIKV is typical of many mosquito-borne viruses, and is characterized by fever, muscle and joint pain, headache, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal manifestations and rash [

However, during its rapid expansion in the last 5 years, more severe disease manifestations have been recognized among those with Zika virus–like disease, most notably neurological symptoms, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, microcephaly and other central nervous system malformation in neonates [
