<p>The risk of ZIKV spread to Australia is very high due to its close geographical proximity to the epidemic region in the western Pacific and high intake of travelers from this area. Indeed, between 2012 and June 3 2016, 60 people infected with ZIKV have traveled to Australia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], there is potential for autochthonous transmission of the virus to occur, but this has not been reported to date. Clinical similarity of ZIKV disease with that caused by arboviruses, such as dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV), could delay ZIKV identification or detection of transmission, and there are currently no established vaccines or therapeutics. Therefore, it is very important to estimate the risk of ZIKV establishment in Australia for the purposes of heightened public awareness, and for adequate and appropriate response of public health authorities.
