<p>In the current study we evaluated the ability of common Australian mosquito species to become infected with and transmit the African lineage of ZIKV. Although the Asian lineage is responsible for the recent activity in the Pacific and South America, we were not able to obtain an isolate to facilitate the assessment of the vector competence of local mosquito fauna for this ZIKV lineage in a manner that was timely for formulation of targeted control strategies. The sylvan vectors circulating ZIKV between primates in Africa are tree-hole inhabiting 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., of which 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic> is the most important [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The primary urban vectors are 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Of the species implicated abroad, only 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> occurs on the Australian mainland, albeit with a distribution restricted to northern Queensland [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is currently restricted to the Torres Strait islands off northern Australia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and was not tested in the current experiments. In terms of other potential vectors, Australia has a number of other species that could potentially transmit ZIKV. For instance, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>notoscriptus</italic> is a widespread urban species throughout Australia and was shown to be a competent laboratory vector of yellow fever virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Another potential species is 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>vigilax</italic>, which has a widespread coastal distribution, is a notorious biter and a highly competent laboratory vector of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Finally, it has been postulated that 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., most notably 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic>, may play a role in transmission in South America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
