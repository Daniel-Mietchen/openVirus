<p>ZIKV titers in the mosquito bodies did not significantly differ among the four 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004959.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In contrast there was a significant difference (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0014) in the ZIKV titers in the legs+wings between these species. Importantly, transmission of ZIKV by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> on day 14 post exposure occurred only when the titer of ZIKV in the legs+wings was â‰¥ 10
 <sup>5.6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> equivalents/mL, with all individuals at or above this threshold able to transmit ZIKV.
