<p>Five out of seven species, including all species of

 <sub>50</sub>/mL of ZIKV (

 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>annulirostris</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>sitiens</italic> were refractory to infection and only 2 out of 30

 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> were infected but none developed a disseminated infection. On day 14 post exposure, infection rates in

 <italic>notoscriptus</italic>,

 <italic>procax</italic> and

 <italic>vigilax</italic> did not significantly differ (

 <italic>notoscriptus</italic>, dissemination rates in these three species did not significantly differ (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was the only species that was able to transmit ZIKV, with transmission first observed at day 10 post exposure.
