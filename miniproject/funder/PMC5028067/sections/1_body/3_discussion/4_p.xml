<p>The current study has highlighted aspects of the susceptibility, replication and transmission dynamics of ZIKV in the mosquito vector that may ultimately impact transmission cycles in the field. We demonstrated that the ID
 <sub>50</sub> for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was 10
 <sup>6.4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL, which is considerably higher than that observed for other arboviruses in Australian populations of this species, including DENVs (≈ 10
 <sup>5.5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) and CHIKV (10
 <sup>4.9</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The relatively low infection and transmission rates reported for some populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] would suggest a similarly high threshold for infection in this species. Paradoxically, the high ID
 <sub>50</sub> required to infect 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in our study is potentially higher than the viremia values of 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> RNA copies per mL circulating in the blood of symptomatic patients during recent outbreaks in the western Pacific [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This may simply reflect the differences inherent to quantifying infectious virus and viral RNA or it may hint at factors other than low susceptibility to infection of the mosquito vector. Such factors include high mosquito population density and high survival rates of infected mosquitoes, coupled with a naïve human population suffering high viral loads, and alternative modes of transmission, such as sexual transmission, all of which may contribute to epidemic transmission of ZIKV.
