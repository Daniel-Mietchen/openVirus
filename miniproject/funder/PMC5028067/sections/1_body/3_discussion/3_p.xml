<p>To assess the potential risk for local ZIKV transmission in Australia, we exposed 6 other mosquito species to ZIKV and evaluated their ability to transmit the virus. The results demonstrated that the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. were either refractory to infection or exhibited a low infection rate but did not transmit ZIKV, suggesting that they should not be considered potential vectors of ZIKV in Australia. Despite being susceptible to infection, the inability of

 <italic>notoscriptus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>vigilax</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>procax</italic> to transmit the virus, indicate that these species would be unlikely to play a role in ZIKV transmission. However, given the potential for intraspecies variation in vector competence of arboviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], it is important that the vector competence of other Australian populations of these species for ZIKV be assessed using the prototype strain, as well as the Asian lineage viral variant(s) currently circulating in the western Pacific and South America, and recently imported into Africa.
