<p>In conclusion, Australia possesses the two key elements for ZIKV to occur: a competent ZIKV vector and importation of the virus by infected travelers. The Australian distribution of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is currently restricted to north Queensland, so this is the region that is receptive to ZIKV. It is paramount that container mosquito surveillance is maintained and, when resources are available, enhanced to ensure that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> do not expand their range. There is also a need to maintain comprehensive testing of travelers from epidemic regions to ensure that suspected cases are diagnosed, particularly those residing in the ZIKV receptive zone. Indeed, there have already been several cases notified in northern Queensland where 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> occurs, although control strategies implemented routinely for DENVs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] may have assisted in preventing local transmission of the virus to date. Unfortunately, tracking of ZIKV infected travelers is compounded by the high number of asymptomatic infections and local transmission may be occurring before ZIKV is tested for in human or mosquito populations. Ultimately, a combination of case recognition, specific laboratory diagnostics, virus surveillance in mosquito populations, vector surveillance to detect incursions of potential vectors into uninfested locations and targeted mosquito control strategies will reduce the risk of an explosive ZIKV outbreak occurring in Australia.
