<p>There are a number of intrinsic barriers that can influence the ability of an arbovirus to infect, disseminate within and be transmitted by mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and the species tested in our study expressed one or more of these barriers. Based on their refractoriness to infection or low infection rate, it appears that the three species of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> tested possess a midgut infection barrier. Similar to what has been observed previously with DENVs and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>notoscriptus</italic> expresses a midgut escape barrier, as only 10% of mosquitoes tested at day 14 had a disseminated infection. With the exception of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the remaining 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. tested appeared to have a salivary infection/transmission barrier, as none of the individuals with a disseminated infection subsequently transmitted ZIKV. Interestingly, within the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> cohort, it was only those mosquitoes with a high disseminated infection titer of ≥ 10
 <sup>5.1</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL in the legs+wings that transmitted the virus. This suggests that a considerable quantity of virus is required to overcome the salivary gland barriers to transmission. Conversely, the other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. had lower legs+wings titers of ≤ 10
 <sup>4.8</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL and this may explain why they did not transmit the virus. A correlation between the leg titer and the percentage of mosquitoes transmitting has previously been shown for dengue virus type 1 (DENV-1), whereby a threshold titer had to be reached before transmission occurred [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It was concluded that the high dissemination titers led to increased transmissibility by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, which potentially resulted in a DENV-1 clade replacement event in Thailand. Future studies, using strains of ZIKV from the current epidemics and a considerably larger sample size, should examine whether a similar correlation exists between different viral lineages, proportion of each mosquito species infected, dissemination titers and the transmission rate. Importantly, this will reveal whether only a relatively small proportion of the mosquito population is likely to be contributing to the majority of virus transmission.
