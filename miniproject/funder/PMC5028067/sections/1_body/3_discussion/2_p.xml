<p>In addition to the intrinsic ability of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> to transmit ZIKV, this species exhibits a number of biological traits which dramatically elevate its role as a vector of this virus, as well as other viruses transmitted by this species. Jansen et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] used a relatively simple vectorial capacity model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to assess the relative roles of Australian mosquitoes in the transmission of CHIKV. Vectorial capacity takes into account a number of factors, including mosquito density, host feeding patterns, survival, vector competence and the duration of the intrinsic incubation period of the virus. It was demonstrated that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> had the highest vectorial capacity even though other species, such as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>vigilax</italic>, had higher experimental transmission rates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and population densities compared to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> ([
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; Queensland Health, state government data). The reason for this was that a high proportion of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> obtain their blood meals from humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and they exhibit multiple host blood feeding behavior [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], whereby females probe/feed up to four times in a single gonotrophic cycle. This latter trait exposes them to more infected humans increasing the likelihood of consuming virus, as well as increasing the number of susceptible humans exposed to an infected mosquito. The majority of other mosquito species usually take only a single blood meal per gonotrophic cycle.
