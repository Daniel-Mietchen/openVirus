<p>Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 2 h on an infectious blood meal containing stock virus diluted in commercially available defibrinated sheep blood (Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia). The blood meal was housed within a Hemotek feeding apparatus (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, Lancashire, UK) that was fitted with pig intestine as the membrane. Due to sufficient numbers and relatively high feeding rates, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and

 <italic>notoscriptus</italic> were exposed to serial 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV, with 10
 <sup>6.7± 0.2</sup> tissue culture infectious dose
 <sub>50</sub> (TCID

 <sup>6.7± 0.2</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL. Pre- and post- feeding samples of the blood/virus mixture were diluted 1:10 in growth media (GM; Opti-MEM (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation, Grand Island, NY) containing 3% foetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics and antimycotics), and stored at -80°C.
