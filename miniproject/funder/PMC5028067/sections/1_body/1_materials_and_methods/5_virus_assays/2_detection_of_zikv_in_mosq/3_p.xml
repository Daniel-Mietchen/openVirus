<p>The ZIKV-NS5 real-time RT-PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR machine (QIAGEN, Australia). Amplification of ZIKV RNA and detection of the 64 bp product took place in a 20 μL single-tube, Superscript III Platinum one-step qRT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reactions contained 0.4 μL Superscript III RT/Platinum 
 <italic>Taq</italic> mix, 10.0 μL of 2X reaction mix, 650 nM primers, 250 nM dual-labeled probe, 50 nM ROX reference dye, and 5 μL of extracted sample RNA or serially diluted extracted ZIKV MR 766 RNA. Each amplification run included positive primer control (5 μl synthetic primer assay control RNA) and probe control (5 μl synthetic probe assay control RNA) reactions as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The cycling conditions consisted of one cycle at 50°C for 5 min, one cycle at 95°C for 2 min, and 40 cycles at 95°C for 3 s and 60°C for 30 s. The threshold cycle number (

 <sub>t</sub> value ≥40 cycles was chosen to indicate no RNA detection.
