<p>The ZIKV stock was titrated in 96 well microtiter plates seeded with Vero African green monkey cells (ATCC, CCL-81) and the CC-EIA was used to determine TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL values [

 <sup>−4</sup>–10
 <sup>−9</sup>) was run in duplicate and presented as a mean using Rotor-Gene software. Standard curves were plotted as
