 <italic>In vitro</italic> RNA transcription of 2–5μg of each synthetic assay control was performed for one hour at 37°C in a 100μl volume using the Riboprobe System-T7 kit (Promega, United States). Each RNA preparation was subjected to DNase treatment, DNase inactivation (TURBO DNA-free kit, Life Technologies, Unites States) and RNA purification using a spin column, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RNeasy Mini Kit, QIAGEN, Australia). The DNase treatment, inactivation and RNA purification process was conducted twice to ensure sufficient reduction of amplifiable template DNA.
