<p>The susceptibility of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti and Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>notoscriptus</italic> to infection with ZIKV was calculated by probit analysis using SPSS release 16.0.0. Log-log models were assessed using the Pearson χ
 <sup>2</sup> goodness-of-fit statistic and susceptibility to infection was expressed as ID
 <sub>50</sub> ± 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and defined as the virus dose per mL at which 50% of mosquitoes tested positive for ZIKV infection in the TaqMan RT-PCR. Infection, dissemination and transmission rates between 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and the other species were analyzed using Fisher’s Exact Tests with two-tailed 
 <italic>P</italic>-values (GraphPad Prism Version 6). ZIKV TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL equivalents were tested for differences between species, and within 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> using the Kruskal-Wallis test (GraphPad Prism Version 6).
