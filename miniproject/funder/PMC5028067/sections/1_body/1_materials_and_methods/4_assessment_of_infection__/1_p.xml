 <xref rid="pntd.0004959.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, mosquitoes were anesthetized with CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and the legs and wings removed. The saliva was collected by inserting the proboscis of the mosquito into a capillary tube containing GM with 20% FBS. After 30 min, the contents of the capillary tube were expelled into 500 μl of GM with 3% FBS. The legs+wings and bodies were placed in separate 2 mL tubes containing 1 mL of GM with 3% FBS and a single 5 mm stainless steel bead. Detection of virus in the legs+wings indicates that the mosquito has developed an infection whereby the virus has escaped the midgut and disseminated throughout the hemocoel, thus bypassing the midgut escape barrier [
