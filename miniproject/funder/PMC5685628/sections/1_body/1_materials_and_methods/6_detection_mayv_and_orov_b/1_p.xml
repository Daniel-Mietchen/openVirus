<p>For the reverse transcription (RT), a 20 μl mixture was prepared to contain 5 μl of RNA extracts, the Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 166 bp and 300 bp fragments were amplified for Mayaro and Oropouche viruses respectively [

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187897.t001">Table 1</xref> shows the primers used for amplification. The final volume of the PCR mixture was 50 μl, distributed as follows: 25 μl of enzyme mix (Taq polymerase, 2.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 15 mM Tris / HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 200 μM of each deoxynucleotide), 20 pmol of each primer (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea), and 5 μl of DNA extraction. Thus, the PCR conditions were: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 55 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, with a final elongation of 10 min at 72°C. The amplified DNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 2% agarose (FMC, Rockland, ME) gel containing ethidium bromide (3 mg/L). Amplified products were gel recovered, purified (SpinPrep
 <sup>™</sup> Gel DNA Kit, San Diego, USA) and sent to be sequenced (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea).
