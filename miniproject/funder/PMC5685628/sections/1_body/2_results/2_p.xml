<p>The molecular diagnosis of the DENV, OROV, ZIKV, CHKV, and MAYV viruses in this study allowed us to identify an etiological agent in 29.5% (CI95%: 22.6â€“37.6%) of all cases of clinically diagnosed AFI. Thus, CHIKV and OROV were the arboviruses identified with most prevalence in 9.4% and 8.6%, respectively. While the prevalence of DENV and ZIKV were of 6.5% and 5%, respectively (

However, no significant differences have been observed between the prevalence of the identified viruses. To understand this result, it can be observed that CI 95% for their respective prevalence showed very similar values (
