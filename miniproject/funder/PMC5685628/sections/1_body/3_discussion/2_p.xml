<p>A comprehensive analysis of the clinical symptoms frequently used for the AFI diagnosis is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187897.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Clinical symptoms for AFI were ordered by their frequency in a descending distribution and it was used a reference for comparing the clinical symptoms of DENV, ZIKV, OROV and CHIKV infections. We found that the distribution of clinical symptoms of arboviral infections correlates with the distribution of symptoms reported in cases of AFI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187897.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The paired analysis (
 <italic>t</italic>-Test) of the distributions has only demonstrated significant differences between AFI and CHIKV (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014) since in this infection the symptomatology has a higher frequency (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187897.t003">Table 3</xref>). However, based on the distribution and frequency of symptoms it was difficult to differentiate between AFI and OROV (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.632), ZIKV (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.314) or DENV (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.826).
