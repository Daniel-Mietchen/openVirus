<p>In this sense, the difficulty of distinguishing arbovirus infections from AFI symptomatology is evident. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187897.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the association of AFI symptoms and arbovirus infections graphically, and in all cases the associations were positive. This association was 96% and 93% for AFI and CHIKV or OROV viruses, respectively. An intermediate value of 88% was observed between AFI and ZIKV, and the lowest association of 77% was found for AFI and DENV. The main conclusion of these results is that a diagnosis of the arboviruses studied based on the symptomatology is a challenging task.
