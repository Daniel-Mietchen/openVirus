<p>Based on symptom frequencies, odd-ratios were calculated for symptom control of arbovirus infections (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0187897.t003">Table 3</xref>). The association analysis of these odd-ratios shows that the odd-ratios of the symptoms of infections between DENV and CHIKV may be very similar with a correlation close to 91% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187897.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, no association was found between the odd-ratios of clinical symptoms for other pairs of arboviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0187897.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, the analytical correlation of the clinical symptomatology demonstrates the enormous difficulty of making a correct and safe etiological diagnosis when arboviruses such as DENV, OROV, ZIKV or CHIKV are involved. Thus, a molecular diagnosis is essential to determine the infectious agent when these clinical symptoms so common for AFI are detected in patients.
