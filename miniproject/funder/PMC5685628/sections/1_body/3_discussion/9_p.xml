<p>In 2015, Peru reported 208 native cases of CHIKV in only 2 regions located on the northern coast: Tumbes where 91.3% of cases were observed and Piura with 8.7%. We found 13 cases of CHIKV in Puerto Maldonado including a child younger than 4 years old. Even though we cannot conclude if these 13 patients were native cases, this study is the first to report CHIKV in Puerto Maldonado.</p>
