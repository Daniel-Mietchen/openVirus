<p>This study is the first to report 7 cases of ZIKV in Puerto Maldonado, and this finding raises our concern since no cases have been previously reported by the Peruvian National Surveillance program until January 2016 [

Among the 7 patients, the most common symptom was headache (57.1%), followed by muscle pain, joint pain, nausea and low appetite (42.8%); surprisingly, none of the patients presented the classical maculopapular rash. However, due to our study design we cannot establish causality between the isolated ZIKV and the registered symptoms. Furthermore, ZIKV case definition is especially challenging during simultaneous DENV and CHIKV epidemics. [
