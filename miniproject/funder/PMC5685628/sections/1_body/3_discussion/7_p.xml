This lower prevalence of DENV can be related to the fact that we only used RT-PCR for case confirmation in comparison to the other study where RT-PCR and IgM seroconversion were considered as diagnostic tests. Moreover, in this previous study, a 32% of IgM cross-reactivity was observed between DENV and yellow fever virus (YFV) antigen in acute or convalescent phase samples [
