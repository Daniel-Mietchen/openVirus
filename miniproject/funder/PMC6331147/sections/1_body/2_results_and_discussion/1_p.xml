<p>Among 500 patients with a clinical suspicion of encephalitis, 234 (46.8%) of their CSF samples were positive for an increased concentrations of cells, protein and glucose. These patients, whose CSF findings were suggestive of viral encephalitis, were designated as Group 1. The remaining 266 subjects comprised Group 2. Identification of a possible viral etiologic agent of encephalitis was accomplished in only 18 (8.0%) CSF samples from patients in Group 1 and 8 (3.0%) from those in Group 2. 
 <xref rid="pone.0209993.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographic characteristics of patients according to rates of virus detection. Gender was equally divided between male and female and the largest groups of patients were those over 50 years old. There were no differences in either category between those positive or negative for viruses or between Groups 1 and 2.
