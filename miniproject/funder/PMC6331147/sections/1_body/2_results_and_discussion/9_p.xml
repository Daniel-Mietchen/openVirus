<p>In the present study no presumptive viral agent was identified in 90% of suspected cases of encephalitis. Worldwide, &gt;70% of cases of presumptive encephalitis cases are not associated with any known infectious agent. Limitations and sensitivity of diagnostic methods, timing of sample collection and storage conditions, viral load and evolution of the disease in infected individuals are factors that may decrease ability to detect etiologic agents [
