  <p>Summary of sensitivity analyses of weeks since the last case and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) to univariate changes in parameter values.</p>
  <p>Panels A, C and E show the timing of declaration of the end of Ebola epidemic obtained through the sensitivity analysis according to the threshold value 5% (black bar) or 1% (grey bar) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. For each bar, single parameter is varied to take either minimum or maximum in the assumed range (
   <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). “0.WHO” shows the waiting time by applying the 6 weeks (42-day) criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). “1.base” is our baseline combination of parameters in 
   <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Weeks corresponding to “2. 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2” represent the weeks since the secondly purported cases before second declaration (
   <italic>n</italic> = 2). In addition, the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases (
   <italic>p</italic>), the mean duration of virus RNA positive period (
   <italic>m</italic>), the proportion of diagnosed cases among all cases (
   <italic>q</italic>), the proportion who refrained from unprotected sexual contact (
   <italic>u</italic>) and the reproduction number (
   <italic>R
    <sub>f</sub>
   </italic>) were varied in the shown ranges. The parameter 
   <italic>u</italic> is also varied while 
   <italic>p</italic> is maintained to be a large value, 0.1 in “13.
   <italic>u</italic> = 0.4(0.1)” and “14.
   <italic>u</italic> = 0.8(0.1)”. Panels B, D and F show the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated as US dollars per life-year in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, respectively, compared to the application of WHO criteria with the fixed 42-day waiting period. In some cases, the time at which our proposed model suggest as the end of Ebola epidemic is earlier than the waiting time adhering to the WHO (i.e. 6 weeks). In such an instance, ICER can take a negative value, and was not calculated (i.e. not calculable).
