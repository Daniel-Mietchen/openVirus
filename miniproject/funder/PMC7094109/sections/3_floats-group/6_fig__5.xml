  <p>Uncertainty analysis of weeks since the last case and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) to assess the end of Ebola epidemic.</p>
  <p>The proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary transmissions was randomly sampled from a triangular distribution with median 0.0012 with the range from 0 to 1. A. Weeks to declare the end of Ebola epidemic since the last case testing negative twice or buried as a function of the threshold risk of observing at least 1 additional case at 5% or 1%. B. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio calculated as US dollars per life-year as a function of the threshold risk of observing at least 1 additional case at 5% or 1%. In both panels, red diamond points the mean. Box plot shows interquartile and median values, while whiskers extend to plus/minus 1.5 times interquartile range.</p>
