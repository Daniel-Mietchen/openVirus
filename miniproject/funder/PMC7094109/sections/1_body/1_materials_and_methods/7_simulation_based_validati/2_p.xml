<p id="para0022">We assessed the model performance by means of random simulations, varying parameters 
 <italic>p, m</italic> and 
 <italic>u</italic> with an application to the setting of Guinea. First, we assumed that the observed case counts were known by Week 58 in which the first purported last case was notified to the WHO. From Week 59, the renewal process was randomly simulated for 20,000 times, using a negative binomially distributed case counts, of which the mean corresponded to the expected number of cases derived from the renewal equation in every week. The effective reproduction number during the waiting period was assumed as known and fixed at 0.05, 0.10 and 0.50, as empirically estimated during the late stage of the epidemic in three West African countries. Second, the probability of observing at least one additional case was calculated. Let A and B represent the time period of waiting time and the time after declaration of the end of epidemic, respectively. The length of waiting time, or the time period of A, denoted by 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>A</sub>, was calculated from our proposed method, and the time period, B was simulated for (300- 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>A</sub>) additional weeks where 300 is an arbitrary number of the final week of simulations that we consider as sufficiently large. Let 
 <italic>X</italic> be a random variable of the number of cases in the week 
 <italic>t</italic> ∈ {
 <italic>A, B</italic>}. Computing
