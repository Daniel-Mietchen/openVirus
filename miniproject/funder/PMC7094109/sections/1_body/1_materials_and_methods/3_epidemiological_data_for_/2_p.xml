<p id="para0012">We obtained weekly incidence data of confirmed and probable cases from three countries in West Africa, using the Situation Report of the WHO up until 2 May 2016 (
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (WHO), 2016b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">Mayrhuber et al., 2017</xref>). The first case in Guinea and Sierra Leone from the Situation Report was reported on 15 September 2014, while the actual first confirmed case was confirmed in March 2014, Guinea and May 2014, Sierra Leone. We had to use the Situation Report, because (i) the alternative datasets, i.e., Patient Database, were subject to revisions even in the present day and (ii) the omitting the very early data in 2014 had only a negligible impact on our calculations. The first case in Liberia was reported earlier than the other two countries on 17 March 2014. We defined Week 0 of the epidemic to be the week starting 15 September 2014. The total number of cases was 2675 in Guinea, 4469 in Liberia and 7118 in Sierra Leone since 15 September 2014, excluding 1580 cases that were reported before 15 September 2014, in Liberia. In addition to epidemic weeks, we also counted weeks since the first “purported last” case (Table S1). In Liberia, this was the Week 27 since the burial of purported last case, and in Guinea and Sierra Leone, this occurred in Week 61 and Week 53 since the second negative test of the last case, respectively.
