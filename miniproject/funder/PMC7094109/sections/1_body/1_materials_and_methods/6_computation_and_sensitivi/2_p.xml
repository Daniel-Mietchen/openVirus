<p id="para0018">We compared our model performance and the resulting data against that based on the WHO criteria, varying unknown parameters within plausible ranges (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). First, since we did not have an empirical estimate of the mixture weight of sexual transmission among the all secondary transmissions without strict guidance to refrain from unprotected sexual contact, we varied the weight 100 × 
 <italic>p</italic> of the mixture distribution of serial interval from 0.001% to 10%, while the most plausible value 0.12% that is derived from a published estimate on the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases in West Africa from 2014–16 (

The largest value 10% may be out of the plausible range, but we examined this value for two reasons: (i) we do not know what would have happened if people were not advised to refrain from sexual transmission during the 2014–16 epidemic and (ii) hypothetically we intended to present scenarios in which there were substantial number of sexual transmissions before the end of an epidemic. The parameter 
 <italic>p</italic> constitutes the serial interval distribution as a weight of the stationary serial interval distribution, and the real time assessment of the proportion of sexual transmissions does not apply to the interpretation of
