<p id="para0006">Ebola virus disease (EVD), caused by Ebola virus, also referred to as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, spreads from human to human. Non-specific symptoms include fever, sore throat, muscular pain and headaches, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea, and a rash. EVD has an estimated case fatality risk among confirmed cases of 60–70% (

From December 2013 to March 2016, the largest ever observed Ebola epidemic occurred, with more than 28,616 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and 11,310 eventual deaths in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in West Africa (

The major mode of transmission of Ebola virus is direct personal contact with blood, feces, vomit, semen or other bodily fluids. Once patients have recovered, the viral RNA is no longer detectable via ordinary blood testing, but the virus remains detectable in the semen of survivors even 9 months after the onset of illness (
