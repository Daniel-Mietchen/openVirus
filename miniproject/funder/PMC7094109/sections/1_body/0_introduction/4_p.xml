<p id="para0008">While the WHO criteria offer a definite fixed waiting time, the scientific basis for this may not be sufficiently robust or objective. In a modeling study that aimed to offer a more objective approach to determining the end of an epidemic, Nishiura and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Nishiura et al., 2016</xref>) derived the probability of observing additional cases at a given time by using the serial interval (i.e., the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in the secondary case) and offspring distribution during the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea. Using the computed probability, authors suggested that the objective determination of the end of a MERS outbreak was attainable if the probability yields less than the threshold value. Despite its successful application in the case of MERS, the extension of this methodology to other diseases including EVD has yet to be conducted.
