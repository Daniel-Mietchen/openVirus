<p id="para0009">Using the 42-day waiting period, there have been erroneous declarations of the end of Ebola epidemic (i.e. freedom from Ebola virus disease) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2015 to 2016. 
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Nishiura (2017)</xref> systematically searched the underlying mechanisms of recrudescence, identifying that many recrudescent cases were suspected to have been caused by sexual contact with survivors, implying that accounting for sexual transmission would be essential in making policy decisions on the end of an epidemic. Because sexual transmission was later identified as the cause of recrudescent events, diagnosis of infected individuals has become more challenging than before due to its potential for discrimination (
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2016b</xref>). Thus, not only the existence of sexual transmission but also under-ascertainment of convalescent cases are key factors in determining the end of an EVD epidemic.
