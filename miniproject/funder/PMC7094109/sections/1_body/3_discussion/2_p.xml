<p id="para0032">On many occasions, the end of an Ebola epidemic has been erroneously declared in West Africa after adhering to the WHO criteria that specify a waiting period of 42 days since the purported last case testing negative for the second time or since the burial. From a mathematical modeling point of view, the 42-day rule was not object-oriented, and moreover, did not account for the importance of sexual transmission appropriately. Motivated by a critical need to develop new science-based criteria to assist local communities with deciding when to declare the end of an epidemic, the present study employed a mathematical model (

In addition to comparing the modeling results with those derived from the WHO criteria, we examined how influential relatively unknown parameters are to determining the week in which the end of an epidemic can be declared. While the relevance of sexual transmission to the overall transmission dynamics has been explored elsewhere (
