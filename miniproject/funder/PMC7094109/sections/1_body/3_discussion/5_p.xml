<p id="para0035">Compared with the existing WHO criteria, our proposed method offers an objectively interpretable probability of observing additional cases in the future. Through random simulations, the proposed method was tightly validated. However, our study indicated that the computation of objective probability requires a good knowledge of sexual transmission. This finding underscores the need to conduct sexual behavior surveys during and after the Ebola virus disease epidemic (

In addition to the frequency of sexual contact and the use of condoms, it should be noted that sexual partnership structures can also vary by country and could influence the end of an epidemic. This aspect needs to be explored more in future studies to attain a more precise identification of the end of an Ebola epidemic. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to other infectious diseases by accounting for all routes of transmission. Using this approach only via a direct transmission, Nishiura and colleagues (
 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Nishiura et al., 2016</xref>) have investigated the end of an Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea. In many infectious diseases, asymptomatic infection plays a critical role in determining the end of epidemic. For example, Zika virus infection involves 80% of asymptomatic infections (

To objectively determine the end of outbreak, the generation time, i.e. the time from infection in a primary case to infection of the secondary case, or the serial interval needs to be mathematically derived by employing an explicitly structured mathematical model that accounts for all important routes of transmission and asymptomatic infection (
