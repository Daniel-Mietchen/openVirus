<p id="para0034">Second, we have shown that the waiting period to ascertain the end of an Ebola epidemic cannot be determined by a pre-fixed length of time, and rather, it can vary according to transmission dynamics, indicating that the waiting time can be highly variable according to the shape and height of the epidemic curve prior to the observation of last case, and also variable by the detailed mode of transmission including the sexual transmission. As the number of recent cases increases in a country, so does the time period before declaration of the end of the epidemic. Furthermore, the length of the waiting time can also vary depending on the ascertainment rate, which is seldom observable in real time. We have shown that the 42-day waiting period specified by the WHO is too short for the first declaration and risks unnecessary second, third and fourth declarations due to an unexpected small number of recrudescent cases.</p>
