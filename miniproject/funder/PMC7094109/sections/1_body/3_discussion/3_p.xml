<p id="para0033">Our findings convey two main messages. First, the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases during the convalescent period plays a critical role in determining the risk of recrudescence of Ebola. As a result of the long persistence of the virus in semen among male survivors, we have shown that ascertaining the end of an epidemic may require up to 1 year from the purported last case. This finding should not be taken too negatively. As we have shown even with the long waiting time, refraining from unprotected sexual contact can substantially shorten the waiting time. It is striking that the adherence to refraining from unprotected sex or sexual abstinence is likely one of the key factors in determining the absence of additional cases after declaration. In future studies, the importance of sexual transmission should lead to the incorporation of heterogeneous sexual contact patterns into the modeling and decision-making process to allow for precise determination of the end of an Ebola epidemic. Moreover, despite the difficulty to statistically estimate the infectiousness during the late stage of infection (
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Weitz and Dushoff, 2015</xref>), an explicit estimate of the proportion of sexual transmissions among all secondary cases will be called for. The evidence of additional zoonotic sources was not reported except for a single transmission from the natural reservoir by human-to-human transmission through the genetic surveillance for the sequenced 2014 samples in Sierra Leone (
