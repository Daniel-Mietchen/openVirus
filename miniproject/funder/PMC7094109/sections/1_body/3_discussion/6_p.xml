<p id="para0036">Several important limitations of this study should be noted. First, the extent of sexual transmission was dealt with as a constant value throughout the course of the epidemic, but it may in fact vary during this time, potentially as a result of public health interventions. Second, while our model underscored the need to explore the importance of sexual transmission, we had to discard gender information in the dataset. It may be preferable to obtain summary data detailing gender and age (to identify sexually active people) in the future. Third, implemented control measures were not taken into account. In some cases, if contact was traced, secondary cases may not easily be produced even through the sexual route. Fourth, we did not incorporate the latent case model to separate observation process from unobservable transmission dynamics model. This simplification has introduced two critical issues to our results, i.e., (i) zero observed case did not lead to non-zero actual cases by the simple use of correction factor (1−
