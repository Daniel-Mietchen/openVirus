<p id="para0024">Hereafter, we consistently use the “week since the last case” as defined by the number of weeks that have elapsed since the purported last case testing negative twice or burial (Table S1). Using the baseline parameter values including

 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the probability of observing additional cases lowered 5% at 19, 37 and 28 weeks since the last case in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively; these time points varied by country due to the different sizes and shapes of the epidemic curves. Considering that the WHO criteria imposes 6 weeks to wait since the last case, the suggested lengths of our proposed method were 13, 31 and 22 weeks longer than the WHO, but all those events were successfully captured within the waiting time (Table S3).
