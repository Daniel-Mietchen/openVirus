<p id="para0030">We implemented random simulations of the epidemic since the purported last case, validating our proposed method. Given the absence of recrudescence during the waiting period, the probability of observing at least one additional case after declaration was below 4.9% and 1.3%, respectively, for all combinations of parameters using the cut-off values 5% and 1%, respectively. If the WHO criteria were used, highly variable results were obtained including recrudescence with the probability greater than 50%. Given those failures, the use of heightened surveillance period for 90 days following the 42-day waiting time did not help excluding the possibility of recrudescence, given large values of
