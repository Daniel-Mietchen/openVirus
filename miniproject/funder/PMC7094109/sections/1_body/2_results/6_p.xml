 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> examines the extent of the impact of under-ascertainment on the declaration of the end of an epidemic. As the extent of under-ascertainment is magnified by the factor of 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9, a country has to endure considerably longer waiting times to ensure that an epidemic is over (e.g. it was 19 weeks since the last case in Guinea with 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0012 and 
 <italic>q</italic> = 0.5, but it can vary from week 14 to 33 with 
 <italic>q</italic> = 0.1 and 0.9). However, with an ascertainment rate of 10%, the impact was less than that observed with a weight of 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.1 (with 10% of secondary transmission events attributed to sexual transmission) in
