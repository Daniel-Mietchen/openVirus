 <sub>f</sub> varied by country due to different epidemic curves, e.g., in Liberia, there were a greater number of recent cases before the purported last case than in the other two countries, and thus, there was more variation in the week in which the end of the epidemic was declared. 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B,D and F compare our suggested week of declaration of the end of an epidemic against those adhering to the WHO criteria for all possible opportunities for declaration. In observation, declarations of the end were made twice in Guinea and Sierra Leone and four times in Liberia. Guinea declared the end of the epidemic 6 weeks after the first purported last case being buried, and subsequently, declared 28 weeks after the first purported last case testing negative twice. Liberia declared 6, 23, 42 and 63 weeks after the first purported last case testing negative twice for all possible declarations. Sierra Leone declared in weeks 6 and 25 after the first purported last case testing negative twice. Considering Week 0 of the epidemic to have commenced on 15 September 2014, the first purported last case was buried in Week 27 in Liberia and tested negative twice in Weeks 61 and 53 in Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively. For the first declaration in all three countries, our method proposed longer waiting periods than the 42-day wait recommended by the WHO criteria. However, during the later opportunities for declaration, our method proposed earlier declaration times than those based on the WHO criteria due to the low chance of secondary transmission.
