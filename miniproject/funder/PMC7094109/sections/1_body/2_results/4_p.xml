<p id="para0026">It appears that the extent of sexual transmission among the total secondary transmission events had a profound impact on the waiting period before declaring the end of the epidemic (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). If as many as 10% of secondary transmission events were attributed to sexual contact, it may be necessary to wait 55–81 weeks (i.e., approximately 1 year) from the purported last case to declaring the end of the Ebola epidemic. It is clear that the mean length of virus persistence also plays a role (
