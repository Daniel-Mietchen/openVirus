 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A,C,E and Table S3 examine the sensitivity of the weeks since the last case to various univariate changes, leading to waiting time for up to 80 weeks with

 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B,D and F for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. As long as 5% threshold was used, the ICER indicated that the proposed method is regarded as cost effective. When 1% threshold was used, and when the number of weeks was counted from the 2nd or later purposed last cases, our analysis indicated that a large cost would be required due to too conservative decision making. 
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> summarizes the results from cost-effectiveness analysis. It appeared that 50% of realizations led to declaration from week 55 to 65. The cost required to save one life year was 3000 US Dollars using the threshold 5%, indicating that the use of our modeling method would be regarded as cost effective, according to the standard in industrialized countries. However, compared with a threshold of ICER at 50,000 US Dollars in the United States (

 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Bartsch et al., 2015</xref>). That is, our result remains cost effective according to their countries’ criteria of cost effectiveness.
