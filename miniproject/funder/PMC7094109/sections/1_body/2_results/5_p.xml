<p id="para0027">As the proportion of sexual transmission among all secondary transmission events influences the probability of observing additional cases, individual's behavior regarding unprotected sex would impact on the waiting period (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). This effect is particularly visible if the extent of sexual transmission is substantial (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, D and F). For example, in Sierra Leone, the waiting period between the last case and declaring the end of the epidemic was 28 weeks without any interventions to avoid unprotected sex (i.e.,
