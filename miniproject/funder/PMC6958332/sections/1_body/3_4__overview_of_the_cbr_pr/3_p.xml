<p>The objectives for the three lines of BTRPâ€™s work BS&amp;S, BSV, and CBR are often achieved in consensus for capacity-building which is traditionally associated with international development, but are inherently difficult to measure. A major accomplishment of DTRA BTRP funding has been building research networks to better implement the CBR program in Kazakhstan, which can be measured in simple metrics such as conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications, both in the English language, and outcomes such as results from testing suspect samples and operational enhancements. The cooperation between Kazakhstan and the US continues to show intent for reducing biological threats and the CBR program has also increased cooperation among institutes in Kazakhstan that often did not previously communicate their respective infectious disease surveillance results. The overall capacity-building and capability-maturing has been harder to assess and quantify.</p>
