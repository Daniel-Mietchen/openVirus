<p>CBR has served as a foundation for incorporating standard operating procedures into working practice under multiple research studies, especially related to BS&amp;S to ensure that the work is performed in a safe and secure environment while supporting tasks to enhance infectious disease surveillance for human and animal health. More importantly, growing a quality research program especially in terms of capability maturity, that is the state “as is” and “to be”, requires a strategic vision. The evolution and progression of the Kazakhstan CBR program are linked and illustrated in an iterative fashion (

The projects were largely assigned by the need and individual discussions among project participants, collaborators, and implementers, as this program was not developed through a traditional, competitive grant-based system. In 2014, from the original funding for 12 CBR projects and studies, the work completed lead to over six follow-up studies (

There was a common focus to address research projects and studies that addressed zoonotic diseases and employed a One Health approach.
