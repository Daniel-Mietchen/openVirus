<p>More recent CBR work has engaged applied science and academic institutes in Kazakhstan to take advantage of their capabilities and resources for next-generation workforce training and tapping into their basic research programs. These resources also include individuals who have been educated through the current system that includes more exposure to US and Western science and technology and better knowledge of the English language associated with major publications. This approach also reinforces similar examples of public–private partnerships where a “triad” is formed when academic and university sectors are engaged [

In Kazakhstan, these capabilities and resources complemented the CBR program while their peer institutes, already engaged in this program, have the required infrastructure to perform research activities on Select Agents which require higher biological containment measures. As the CBR program has evolved, the next-generation workforce has also developed through experience and incorporating various participants such as academics. It has become apparent to the US participants that levels of English language proficiency among Kazakhstani collaborators has markedly increased. This is an obvious factor in improving better communications and has a larger role in project planning and implementation. In the long term, this will have been one of the most useful by-products from BTRP, enabling Kazakhstani personnel access to international literature, scientific meetings, and personal relationships with international scientists and physicians. This ability and practice to consistently and effectively network increases the chances to collaborate especially for competitive funding opportunities.
