<p>In terms of simple metrics, from 2009â€“2014, the CBR, TAP, and CAP work resulted in at least 12 peer-reviewed publications, 60 conference presentations, and 30 research collaborator visits to Kazakhstan. Overall, the Kazakhstan CBR projects have resulted in a few hundred conference presentations and several peer-reviewed publications. The benefit of conference presentations is the practice of developing and presenting results while meeting and networking with peers in the scientific community. While the number of peer-reviewed publications is often used to judge scientific merit, publications are often developed well after a project has ended. In addition, the number of citations from these publications also grew over time beyond the time of the initial publications (
