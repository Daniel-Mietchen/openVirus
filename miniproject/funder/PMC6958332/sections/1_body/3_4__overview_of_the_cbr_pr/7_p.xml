<p>The multiple institutes involved in KZ-29 included three Kazakhstani institutes: (1) Scientific and Practical Center of Sanitary and Epidemiological Expertise and Monitoring (SPCSEEM), (2) Kazakh Scientific Center of Quarantine and Zoonotic Diseases (KSCQZD), and (3) the Uralâ€™sk Anti-Plague Station (UAPS); and five international collaborating institutions: (1) University of Buffalo, (2) Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), (3) Public Health England (PHE), (4) University of Florida and (5) United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). All of these institutions provided various skill sets and techniques from viral and rickettsial disease research fields, as well as data analysis and mapping. The project was successful, in obtaining many tick and human samples made available by the Kazakhstani scientists. Moreover, during the study a number of Kazakhstani institute staff was trained in modern diagnostic and data management techniques. Infectious disease agents were detected in multiple different areas of the country, several for the first time at specific locations, and the results were written up for presentations at a number of international meetings [

The downside for the project was a lack of sequencing capability on site and collaborators were unable to transfer any genomic material (including PCR products) out of the country, where sequence data could be generated. This lack of sequence data meant that otherwise important and novel data on new and suspected infectious agents could not be determined and therefore the epidemiology of the rodent- and vector-borne infectious diseases caused by these agents could not be properly defined. There were also issues of access to laboratories and difficulty in sharing data, while minor issues have potential to delay project schedule. Lastly, the incomplete investigation of the infectious agents made it difficult to obtain meaningful data and publish the results in peer-reviewed international journals. Nevertheless, the project revealed many potential infectious disease issues in Kazakhstan that will provide a starting point for future, in-depth investigations [
