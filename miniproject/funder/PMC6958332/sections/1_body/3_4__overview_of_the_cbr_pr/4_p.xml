<p>DTRA BTRP funded several CBR projects and smaller studies which contractors implemented during 2005–2007, 2009–2014, and 2015–2018. In 2005–2007, the initial CBR projects centered on studies involving select agents including zoonoses: anthrax, plague, tularemia, highly pathogenic avian influenza, and brucellosis. The typical CBR projects funded researchers in Kazakhstan and project collaborators in the US and UK who mentored and guided those researchers to develop and test their hypotheses. From 2009–2014, five CBR projects were funded with up to $ 1M each, which covered labor hours, materials, travel, and infrastructure overhead. In parallel, several smaller 12-month studies were funded with approximately $100 k called Threat Agent Detection and Response (TADR) Activity Projects (TAP) and were implemented in parallel to the CBR projects. The TAP studies were intended to support TADR which was the earlier name for the biosurveillance line of work and only funded material and did not fund labor hours. From 2015–2018, the trend for smaller studies continued as TAP studies evolved to Central Reference Laboratory (CRL) Activity Projects (CAP), which were designed and implemented to support studies for the new CRL that DTRA funded and constructed in Almaty, Kazakhstan.</p>
