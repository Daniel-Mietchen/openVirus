<p>After the BTRP addressed the biosecurity risks resulting from the breakup of the Soviet Union that included accounting for biological WMD and re-training scientists, the BTRP continued to fund the construction of a central reference laboratory (CRL), upgrades of other laboratories, and biological research. BTRP, which now runs programs in over 40 countries, has three lines of work: biosafety and biosecurity (BS&amp;S); biosurveillance (BSV); and cooperative biological research (CBR). As discussed in our earlier manuscripts [
 <xref rid="B1-tropicalmed-04-00136" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-tropicalmed-04-00136" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], Kazakhstan and the Central Asia region are interesting “hotspots” for infectious disease occurrence and surveillance due in part to its history, geography, and its diversity of vertebrate and invertebrate host species. Many of the BTRP supported research and epidemiologic studies involved One Health approaches, especially those studies related to zoonotic diseases. The objective of this project was to develop a historical perspective for the CBR program in Kazakhstan, including project chronology, successes and challenges, so that lessons learned might be applied to other CBR endeavors.
