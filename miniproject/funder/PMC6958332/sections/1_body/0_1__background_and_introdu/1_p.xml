<p>After the Soviet Union breakup, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program began in 1991 which funded work through the United States Department of Defense (US DoD) in several former Soviet Union (FSU) republics, including Kazakhstan, to dismantle, secure, and prevent proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Since the early 2000s, the US DoD has funded and implemented a Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP) through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in Kazakhstan.</p>
