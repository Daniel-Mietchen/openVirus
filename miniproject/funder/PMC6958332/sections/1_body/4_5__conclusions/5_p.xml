<p>For long-term capability-building, the sustainability of CBR program in Kazakhstan needs to reach a maturity level where it can compete and acquire external research funding apart from BTRP; this threshold remains a challenge. When funding a scientific research program, it is difficult to balance immediate needs and manage risk with raising quality and innovation. Similarly, standardized evaluation techniques such as the capability maturity model (CMM) which are often used in business and technology sectors are also good for assessment at a scientific research program level. At the BTRP level, outputs for cost-effectiveness, which could be incorporated into their program lifecycle analysis, and measuring benefits to foreign relations would augment program metrics. A unified top-down and bottom-up approach that is focused on capability maturity also needs to be employed to ensure that funder and recipients agree on expectations and science objectives.</p>
