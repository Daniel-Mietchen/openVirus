<p>Our compendium provides a perspective that can help draw a roadmap for a scientific research program when the project outputs and metrics are incorporated. In addition, aligning program objectives and exacting expectations across participants and stakeholders contribute to the roadmap that ultimately builds that partner countryâ€™s capability and capacity necessary for sustainability. Tracking the evolution of program projects and studies, especially collaborations and networks, is emphasized to capture important activities that are often omitted when large programs evolve and institutional memory is lost through turnover of human resources. To advance science through increased transparency and mature capabilities, a multi-sectoral approach, commitment, and vision is required to advocate a strategy and can be implemented through strong leadership.</p>
