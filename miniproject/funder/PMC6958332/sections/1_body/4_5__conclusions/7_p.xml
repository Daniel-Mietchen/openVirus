<p>Our experience suggests incorporating multi-sectoral partners that better leverage existing resources may offer higher impact especially among similar research studies of small scale and magnitude [

For example, initial studies such as those involving multi-institute participants in Kazakhstan were challenged with distributing project tasks and budgets equally. Often these initial studies were designed to demonstrate new cooperation among institutes in Kazakhstan, however they may have been performing similar tasks under their respective missions. Alternatively, a multi-sectoral approach such as those providing mutual benefits across different scientific, public health communities, and disadvantaged populations have benefits beyond generating research data [

An important effect of employing these types of studies is engaging the public and educating them on the purpose and objective of this work as related to larger programs which demonstrates transparency and counters any misperceptions and stigmas. Further incorporating approaches such as One Health that included joint animal and human health studies in Kazakhstan should also be encouraged to increase impact and reinforce cooperation in future CBR studies.
