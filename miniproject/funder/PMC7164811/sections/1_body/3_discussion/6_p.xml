<p id="para370">Third, our collected data suggest that costs associated with new technologies do not differ substantially from costs associated with well-established technologiesâ€” a finding that is contradictory to the prevailing assumptions made in the literature to date. This may be because of the compounding complexities of certain pathogens that make it difficult to disassociate pathogen-specific from technology-specific cost drivers, unless one has access to more granular cost data. However, a more plausible explanation perhaps is that cost variations are strongly associated with business models, rather than the technologies themselves, by which the various vaccine developers in epidemic infectious diseases are operating in the industry or non-industry sector.

 </xref> Our statistical analysis suggests that platform technologies are not a substantial explanatory factor for average vaccine development project costs, even if we control for the assumption that the data may be nested with respect to the individual pathogens. Instead, it is indirect costs and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience in the organisations developing these products that drive cost estimates upward.
