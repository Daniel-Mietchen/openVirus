<p id="para390">Second, the assumption that higher probability of success is associated with more experienced vaccine developers, and vice versa, is based on common sense and insights shared by vaccine developers during the survey process. However, clear evidence in the literature does not exist to indisputably substantiate such claims. The implications for epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development cost estimates could be considerable. On one hand, higher probability of success associated with less experienced vaccine developers could well mean that the portfolio costs of achieving at least one phase 2a outcome per priority epidemic infectious disease would be lower than our analysis suggests. On the other hand, lower probability of success manifested in experienced vaccine developer efforts would suggest much higher portfolio costs than has been reported in this study.</p>
