<p id="para440">Seventh, the study estimates costs for only a small part of a much bigger picture in epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development preparedness. The research and development scope of our analysis is restricted to preclinical, phase 1, and phase 2a. It excludes costs associated with phase 2b–3 trials, stockpiles of phase 2b–3 ready material, regulatory, and delivery activities (including for having in-country infrastructure to support emergency response activities)—all critical elements of vaccine research and development preparedness needs in response to public health emergencies. Issues pertaining to clinical trial design, locations, and target populations of clinical studies, are some of the many factors that are likely to drive clinical development costs but which have not been explicitly considered in our study. These issues, together with factors pertaining to stockpile strategies and phase 2b–3 trial complexities under different disease outbreak scenarios, clinical trial designs, and regulatory requirements, deserve special attention and a separate analysis, which we hope a future study will provide.</p>
