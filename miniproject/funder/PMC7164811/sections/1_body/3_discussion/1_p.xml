<p id="para320">The vaccine research and development cost estimates produced in this study highlight the need for substantial investments in priority epidemic infectious diseases if minimum vaccine research and development preparedness targets—ie, at least one phase 2b–3 ready vaccine candidate per epidemic infectious disease—are to be achieved, given the relatively large number of preclinical candidates and the low probability of success associated with these. Our analysis identifies several disease areas for which the upstream vaccine research and development pipeline today is insufficient, and highlights the need for entry of new vaccine candidates into preclinical development if the chances of minimum vaccine research and development preparedness targets are to be increased. Moreover, we demonstrate that higher vaccine research and development costs, and in particular clinical research and development costs, are likely to be associated with greater industrial sector affiliation and previous licensure experience of vaccine developers. If this experience were assumed to translate to higher probability of success, investing in these projects could progress more epidemic infectious disease vaccines through to end of phase 2a.</p>
