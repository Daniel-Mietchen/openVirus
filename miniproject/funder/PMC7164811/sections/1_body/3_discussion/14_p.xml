<p id="para450">Eighth, our simulation–optimisation framework assumes that one phase 2b–3 ready vaccine candidate expected per disease is a sufficient research and development preparedness target for efficacy testing in response to an epidemic. This assumption might not be the case if historical probability of success for phase 3 in the literature is considered.

 </xref> which might require different thresholds for clinical and regulatory success during public health emergencies. Moreover, as experience with Ebola and other recent epidemic infectious disease outbreaks has shown, interest of funders in supporting vaccine research and development in response to outbreaks withers together with the waning of epidemics. Any additional phase 2b–3 ready vaccine candidate would not only require an additional multimillion investment just in case, but also a substantial new investment in phase 2b–3 testing and emergency response. Whether more than one phase 2b–3-ready vaccine candidates can be supported for a particular epidemic infectious disease is therefore also an issue for consideration by funders and decision makers in the epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development space.
