<p id="para330">Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to use simulation-optimisation techniques to generate vaccine development cost estimates by combining pipeline and cost information, subject to multiple objectives against a range of constraints. In doing so, this study meaningfully combines up-to-date evidence on research and development pipelines and project costs with rigorous analytical methods to demonstrate investment needs under alternative scenarios. Moreover, we have done this study with the consideration of research and development cost drivers and uncertainty in both costs and probability of success informing the analysis.</p>
