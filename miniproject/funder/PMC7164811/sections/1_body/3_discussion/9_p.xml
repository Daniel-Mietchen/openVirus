<p id="para400">Third, the numbers of vaccine candidates and associated portfolio costs reported in this study do not guarantee with full certainty that one phase 2a outcome per epidemic infectious disease would be achieved, under any probability of success and cost scenario. Given the confidence intervals applied, there is a small chance that the suggested vaccine candidates and costs would fail to meet such clinical development targets. Increasing the confidence intervals in the analysis would improve the certainty of phase 2a outcomes. However, given the variance in reported costs and probability of success estimates, the lower and upper limits of vaccine candidates required and associated portfolio costs would increase substantially in the model.</p>
