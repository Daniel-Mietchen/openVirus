<p id="para380">Our study has several limitations. First, the average vaccine development project cost estimates, from which our simulation-optimisation approach draws, are based on self-reported data by vaccine developers. Despite the statistical analyses and our consistency checks with CEPI and literature sources to minimise bias, such bias is likely to persist in any self-reported cost projections. This implies a certain price for innovation that vaccine developers are willing to accept in order to engage in research and development, which may differ across sectors and organisations operating with different business models and internal cost structures.

Coupled with unexpected circumstances, such as unforeseen regulatory requirements, or technological spillovers from other research and development activities, such factors may well drive realised vaccine research and development expenditures either way, downwards or upwards, compared with the estimates provided in this study.
