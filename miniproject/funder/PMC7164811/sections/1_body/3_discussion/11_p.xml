<p id="para420">Fifth, our study does not report or estimate funding flows to epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development, which other surveys do, at least for other neglected disease areas, and more recently, Ebola.

 </xref> Different vaccine developers will probably have different capacities to access internal or external financing, which suggests that the funding gaps to support epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development may be, overall, smaller than the cost estimates reported in this study as well as varying between sectors and types of organisations researching and developing epidemic infectious disease vaccines. This may also suggest that, in practice, transition probability of success between development phases is also likely to vary between organisations not only for technical reasons but also because of access to finance bottlenecks. It would be a plausible assumption to make that those organisations with previous licensure experience (and marketed vaccines) also have better access to finance, and are therefore, for financial reasons, likely to face higher probability of success in the vaccine research and development programmes (as captured by our high probability of success to high cost scenario).
