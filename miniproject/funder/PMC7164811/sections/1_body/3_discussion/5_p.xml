<p id="para360">Our study attempts to overcome some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research and development cost analyses and tries to deviate from recent studies focused on epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development in several ways. First, although we draw our probability of success estimates from published evidence specific to vaccine research and development,
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> we consider probability of success distributions instead of point estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in research and development that cannot be attributed to specific explanatory factors, as our regression analyses have shown. Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for epidemic infectious disease vaccine development.
