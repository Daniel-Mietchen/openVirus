<p id="para460">Vaccines for epidemic infectious diseases need the world's attention and investment efforts if we are to respond effectively to potential future epidemics and avert humanitarian crises. Our study offers a comprehensive set of epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development pipeline and cost findings and a reproducible methodology for identifying optimal research and development portfolios and associated investment needs across several of these diseases. More broadly, we demonstrate that a better understanding of disease-specific product research and development pipelines and associated costs through rigorous analyses can benefit any assessment of investment needs in global health research and development, improving the credibility of claims around funding requirements and of portfolio planning.</p>
