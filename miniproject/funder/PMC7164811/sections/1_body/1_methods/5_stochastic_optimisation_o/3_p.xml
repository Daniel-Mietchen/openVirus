<p id="para240">In this model, we treated cost and probability of success by research and development phase parameters as random variables with the same distributions as in the simulation. The stochastic modelling approach ensured the robustness of our optimisation findingsâ€”ie, allowed us to run probabilistic sensitivity analyses on all the outputs of the model, capturing both the sources of variability as well as the probabilities attached to different modelling outputs expected (see 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref> for more details).
