<p id="para220">Whereas simulation-based analyses can provide analytical depth to highlighted scenarios, they have a relatively low capacity to demonstrate optimal solutions on their own, such as how to minimise or maximise objectives in epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development. Given the inherently risky nature of vaccine research and development, stochastic optimisation approaches are likely to represent realistic reflections of the uncertain expectations from the pharmaceutical research and development process. Several stochastic modelling approaches have been proposed in pharmaceutical research and development management to address various portfolio optimisation problems (see literature overview in

 </xref> Drawing from previous evidence, we built a two-stage stochastic optimisation model—ie, a stepwise optimisation of objectives that includes uncertainty—to identify optimal research and development portfolios and costs for progressing at least one vaccine candidate per epidemic infectious disease through to end of phase 2a. In stage 1, we derived the minimum number of ideal candidates required to achieve at least one phase 2b–3 ready candidate for an epidemic infectious disease, starting from preclinical testing, to phase 1 and phase 2, respectively. Using this information against the evidence on available pipelines per epidemic infectious disease, we derived the minimum and maximum number of vaccine candidates needed by research and development phase to progress at least one of these through to end of phase 2a. In stage 2, we drew from stage 1 findings to define lower and upper boundaries of vaccine candidates by research and development phase, on the basis of which we estimated the minimum cost of successfully developing at least one phase 2b–3 ready candidate per epidemic infectious disease.
