 <italic>t</italic> tests in order to: ascertain how strongly these variables are related to each other; whether any of these variables are statistically significant explanatory factors of cost; and, if so, which of these can explain variations observed in estimated costs. We also ran a hierarchical cluster analysis to identify other potential factors not captured by the regression model. We did this by computing the distance between clusters using a Euclidean metric as the similarity measure for our data (
