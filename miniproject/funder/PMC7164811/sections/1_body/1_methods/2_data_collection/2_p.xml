<p id="para160">We searched PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, country-level trial registries, National Institutes of Health reporter, and WHO pipeline tracker using terms based on [pathogen name], [vaccine candidate name], [developer name], “vaccine” and combinations of these. Searches were limited to the last 11 years (Jan 1, 2006, to Aug 31, 2017). To ensure completeness, we also searched more freely in websites and press releases of organisations identified as epidemic infectious disease vaccine development partners, and scanned reference lists of relevant articles for any missed vaccine candidates from previous searches. Acknowledging that not all pipeline information is publicly available, nor updated regularly, we confirmed the status of the vaccines identified in the literature by sending a survey to 414 organisations. The survey asked recipients to: validate the current status of development of a pre-filled list of vaccine candidates that our team had collated via literature searches, grant database searches and clinical trial registries searches over the past 12 months prior to survey launch, including information on disease, phase of development, vaccine technology type, and product development partners; clarify current sources of funding, development costs incurred and future funding needs for bringing the vaccines through phase 2 and potentially phase 3 in response to potential disease outbreaks, including stockpile estimates for phase 3 trials and for emergency use (the latter not reported in the paper); specify main drivers of R&amp;D costs and technical success to date and identify potential drivers of future costs and technical risks for bringing vaccine candidates through late phases of clinical development. Organisations were those whom we identified as owners, partners, or supporters of epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development (
