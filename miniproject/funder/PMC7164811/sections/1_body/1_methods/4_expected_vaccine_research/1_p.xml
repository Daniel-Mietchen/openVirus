<p id="para190">We considered three key input parameters for estimating vaccine research and development portfolio costs from preclinical through to phase 2a: (1) vaccine development project costs by research and development phase; (2) probability of success by research and development phase; (3) the number of vaccine projects available in the pipeline. Given the relevance of vaccine developer licensure track record and a large variation in self-reported costs not explained by regression or clustering analyses (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>), we incorporated this uncertainty into a Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically, we defined cost distributions for lower and upper bounds by dividing our sample into two groups: a lower bound group associated with costs reported by product developers with no vaccine licensure track record; and an upper bound group associated with costs reported by product developers with previous licensure experience. For each group, we constructed discrete cost distributions by research and development phase, assigning equal probabilities to the respective self-reported cost estimates. In addition to costs, we constructed triangular distributions for probability of success by research and development phase. Triangular distributions were chosen since they are commonly used to define ranges of values for uncertain variables where available data is either scarce or heterogeneous enough to not clearly dictate the appropriate range and frequency of the possible values of variables.
