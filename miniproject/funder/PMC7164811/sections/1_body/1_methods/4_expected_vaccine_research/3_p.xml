<p id="para210">Within each iteration, the sum of the product of the number of available vaccine candidates, probability of success, and cost was calculated as the vaccine candidates (their integers) advanced through to the end of phase 2a. This allowed the estimation of the mean and 95% CIs of costs adjusted for probability of success for each iteration of the simulation, which, when analysed across all iterations, allowed the calculation of the likely phase 2a outcomes associated with the number of vaccine candidates considered (
