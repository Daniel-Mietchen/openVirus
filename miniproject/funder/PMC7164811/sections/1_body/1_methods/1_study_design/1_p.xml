<p id="para140">We took four distinct analytical steps to help us ascertain costs for achieving minimum vaccine research and development preparedness targets in a given portfolio of 11 epidemic infectious diseases. First, we mapped existing epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development pipelines and collected self-reported cost data from vaccine developers, associated with epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development from preclinical phase through to phase 2a. Second, we tested for drivers of vaccine development costs drawn from published studies, using various statistical techniques. Third, we drew vaccine research and development probabilities of success from published estimates. We combined these with self-reported cost data to simulate costs adjusted for probability of success for advancing vaccines from preclinical testing through to phase 2a, within a Monte Carlo framework. Fourth, we used the cost and probability of success parameters of the simulation to determine minimum portfolio costs required for achieving at least one phase 2bâ€“3 ready candidate for each epidemic infectious disease through a stochastic optimisation model.</p>
