<p id="para130">In this study we estimate the cost of epidemic infectious disease vaccine development from preclinical phase through to the end of phase 2a, on the basis of new data and analytical tools. Assuming that one phase 2bâ€“3 ready vaccine candidate is a reasonable minimum vaccine research and development preparedness target per epidemic infectious disease, the study gives an indication of the number of minimum vaccine candidates and cost to achieve this.</p>
