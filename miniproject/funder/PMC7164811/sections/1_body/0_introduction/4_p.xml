   <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para60">There are almost 600 literature references on vaccine candidates being developed against 11 priority epidemic infectious diseases (
   <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). This information has previously neither been collated systematically nor has its actual development status been confirmed. Moreover, evidence on the cost of pharmaceutical research and development has been made available since at least the 1950s; however, this has been limited to mainly chemical drug products. Whereas publications by Di Masi and colleagues have provided the foundations on which numerous analyses or critiques of pharmaceutical research and development costs have since been conducted, evidence on vaccine-specific research and development costs for epidemic infectious diseases has been limited. The handful of articles published to date are either descriptive, based on expert opinions with limited data inputs to validate those claims, or focusing on single pathogens or only on clinical research and development phases. Recent studies have attempted to overcome several of the above limitations, focusing their analyses on poverty diseases or epidemic infectious diseases, as well as differentiating more systematically between costs associated with incremental versus breakthrough innovations.

   <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para80">Our study presents a comprehensive dataset of vaccine research and development candidates against 11 epidemic infectious diseases, which combines a systematic search of a substantially sized literature and the confirmation of current development status of these candidates by vaccine developers active in the field. Moreover, our study attempts to overcome some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research and development cost analyses in several ways. First, we consider probability of success distributions drawn from multiple published estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in research and development which cannot be explained by single sources. Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for vaccine development. Third, our collected data suggest that costs associated with new technologies may not differ from costs associated with well-established technologiesâ€”a finding that is contradictory to prevailing assumptions made in extant literature. Our analysis suggests that it is indirect costs, and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience of the organisations developing these products, that drive cost estimates in upward directions.</p>

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para100">We demonstrate that it is possible to combine up-to-date evidence on vaccine research and development pipelines with rigorous cost analysis methods to generate robust estimates of vaccine research and development investment needs in epidemic infectious diseases. Our methods and findings can benefit future assessments of global health research and development costs, improving the credibility of funding need claims and of portfolio planning.</p>
