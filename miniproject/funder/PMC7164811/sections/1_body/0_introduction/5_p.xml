 </xref> Owing to the sporadic and unpredictable emergence of epidemic infectious diseases, large-scale vaccine efficacy studies (phase 2bâ€“3) are almost impossible unless there are ongoing epidemic infectious disease epidemics. Part of CEPI's scope is to address the just-in-case research and development preparedness gap between late preclinical and early clinical safety and efficacy testing (phase 2a) of epidemic infectious disease vaccines, in advance of epidemic outbreaks.
