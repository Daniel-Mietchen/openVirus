 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). This analysis demonstrates that whereas zero phase 2a outcomes are unlikely given the numbers of vaccine candidates supported by research and development phase under the low and high probability of success scenarios, outcomes previously mentioned and beyond one phase 2b–3 ready candidate per epidemic infectious disease are dependent on the probability of success. In a scenario in which low costs were associated with high probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be supported as per the high probability of success and high cost scenario to achieve minimum phase 2a outcomes per epidemic infectious disease, but the overall portfolio cost would reduce to US$1·6 billion ($715 million–2·9 billion range). In contrast, in a scenario where high costs were associated with low probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be funded as per the low probability of success and low cost scenario to successfully advance at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a successfully. In this case, however, the associated portfolio cost would increase to $6·8 billion ($1·5–15·1 billion range;
