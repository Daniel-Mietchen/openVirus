<p id="para280">The simulation suggests that the advancement of a single epidemic infectious disease vaccine candidate from preclinical through end of phase 2a can cost $31–68 million ($14–159 million range), assuming no risk of failure (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). However, the total cost of progressing one epidemic infectious disease vaccine successfully through to end of phase 2a is dependent on the probability of success and on the shape of the vaccine research and development pipeline. As the 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure</xref> demonstrates, accounting for probability of success and assuming no clinical vaccine candidates exist for a given epidemic infectious disease, 11 to 21 preclinical candidates would be required if at least one of these were to progress through to end of phase 2a, at a cost of $319–469 million ($137 million–$1·1 billion range). Similarly, six to ten phase 1 candidates would be needed for at least one candidate to advance through to end of phase 2a, at a cost of $167–201 million ($61 million–$485 million range). Assuming vaccine candidates and funding were made available, progressing at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a for each of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases would cost a minimum of $2·8–3·7 billion ($1·2 billion–$8·4 billion range). Finally, at least one candidate would progress through to end of phase 2a, out of initial investments of $84–112 million ($23 million–$295 million range) in four to five phase 2 candidates.
