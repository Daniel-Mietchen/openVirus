<p id="para270">Reported vaccine development costs from preclinical testing through to end of phase 2a range from $8 million to $350 million (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> ). Based on the regression analysis, previous licensure experience and indirect costs associated with operating models of vaccine developers are statistically significant explanatory factors driving an increase in research and development costs. Previous licensure of vaccines for a given disease can potentially drive a reduction in research and development costs. However, a licensed prophylactic vaccine for humans does not exist for any of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases. A hierarchical clustering analysis suggests that increased research and development costs in clinical research and development phases may also potentially be associated with increased industrial sector affiliation. Substantial variation in reported costs cannot be explained despite considering several factors, including, in addition to the above, research and development timelines and previous licensure track-record of platform technologies (
