<p id="para260">From our literature search, we identified 262 vaccine candidates in preclinical to phase 2 stages for 11 epidemic infectious diseases. Of the 414 organisations we approached, we received survey responses from 64, covering 314 vaccine candidates for epidemic infectious diseases in total. Of these, 121 were confirmations of vaccine candidates that were active, not yet started, or on-hold owing to lack of funding, previously identified through the literature review. 193 were newly reported vaccine candidates, of which 97 candidates had infectious diseases of epidemic potential outside the scope of the WHO priority list. From the original set of 262 vaccine candidates identified in the literature for the 11 WHO priority epidemic infectious diseases, 104 remained unspecified owing to lack of responses at the end of the survey; 44 were confirmed as terminated, on hold for technical reasons or were not confirmed at all as active projects by survey respondents; and 114 were confirmed as active, not yet started, or on hold owing to lack of funding or other reasons not related to technical failures. In total, these pipeline searches amounted to 224 vaccine candidates from preclinical to phase 2, for 11 priority epidemic infectious diseases (
