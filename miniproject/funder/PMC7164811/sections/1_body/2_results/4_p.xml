<p id="para290">At the time of writing, there are 194 preclinical trials, 24 phase 1, and six phase 2 vaccine candidates under development for 11 epidemic infectious diseases. As 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref> demonstrates, 13 candidates (six to 34 range) would progress through to end of phase 2a at a cost of $3·6 billion ($1·6–6·6 billion range), in a low probability of success and low cost scenario (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Under a high probability of success and high cost scenario, the cost for 43 phase 2b–3 ready candidates (26–70 range) would amount to $9·8 billion ($2·4–21·6 billion range). Seven epidemic infectious diseases—Zika, Ebola, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, Marburg, and Lassa—have sufficient vaccine pipelines for investments (if made available) to guarantee successful phase 2a outcomes regardless of probability of success (in reality, phase 2b–3 ready candidates already exist for Ebola). Under a low probability of success scenario, the successful progression of a vaccine through to end of phase 2a cannot be guaranteed for Nipah, given the available candidates for this epidemic infectious disease. Vaccine pipelines for Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome comprise too few candidates for any phase 2a outcomes to be predicted through investments in these, even under a more optimistic probability of success.
