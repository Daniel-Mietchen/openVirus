<p id="para300">Based on the stochastic optimisation (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref> ), lower investments would be needed in a smaller number of vaccine candidates to achieve phase 2a outcomes in chikungunya, Zika, Rift Valley fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Marburg, as their clinical vaccine pipelines are modestly mature. Higher investments across a larger number of preclinical vaccine candidates would be needed for a Lassa phase 2b–3 ready vaccine to be guaranteed. 18 to 55 new preclinical candidates would need to be added to the vaccine pipelines of Nipah, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome collectively for a phase 2b–3 ready candidate to be guaranteed in each of these epidemic infectious diseases.
