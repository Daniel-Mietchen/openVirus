Evidence on vaccine development costs for such diseases is scarce. Our goal was to estimate the minimum cost for achieving vaccine research and development preparedness targets in a portfolio of 11 epidemic infectious diseases, accounting for vaccine pipeline constraints and uncertainty in research and development preparedness outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We assembled a pipeline of 224 vaccine candidates from preclinical through to phase 2 for 11 priority epidemic infectious diseases. We used a linear regression model to identify drivers of development costs from preclinical through to end of phase 2a. Drawing from published estimates of vaccine research and development probabilities of success, we simulated costs for advancing these 224 vaccine candidates through to the end of phase 2a. We combined these findings to determine minimum costs for progressing at least one vaccine through to the end of phase 2a per epidemic infectious disease by means of a stochastic optimisation model.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>The cost of developing a single epidemic infectious disease vaccine from preclinical trials through to end of phase 2a is US$31&#x02013;68 million (US$14&#x02013;159 million range), assuming no risk of failure. We found that previous licensure experience and indirect costs are upward drivers of research and development costs. Accounting for probability of success, the average cost of successfully advancing at least one epidemic infectious disease vaccine through to the end of phase 2a can vary from US$84&#x02013;112 million ($23 million&#x02013;$295 million range) starting from phase 2 to $319&#x02013;469 million ($137 million&#x02013;$1&#x000b7;1 billion range) starting from preclinical. This cost includes the cumulative cost of failed vaccine candidates through the research and development process. Assuming these candidates and funding were made available, progressing at least one vaccine through to the end of phase 2a for each of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases would cost a minimum of $2&#x000b7;8&#x02013;3&#x000b7;7 billion ($1&#x000b7;2 billion&#x02013;$8&#x000b7;4 billion range).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our analysis provides new evidence on vaccine research and development pipelines and associated costs for 11 epidemic infectious diseases, highlighting both funding needs and research and development gaps for achieving vaccine research and development preparedness targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was partly supported by the Research Council of Norway through the Global Health and Vaccination Programme GLOBVAC.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">Vaccines can be powerful tools for preventing potential outbreaks of epidemic infectious diseases from becoming humanitarian crises.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Developing these vaccines requires investment.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> However, evidence on what it would cost to successfully develop a sound epidemic infectious disease vaccine portfolio is scarce.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This is partly because of a paucity of explicit, publicly available cost data.

<bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
</p><p id="para60">There are almost 600 literature references on vaccine candidates being developed against 11 priority epidemic infectious diseases (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). This information has previously neither been collated systematically nor has its actual development status been confirmed. Moreover, evidence on the cost of pharmaceutical research and development has been made available since at least the 1950s; however, this has been limited to mainly chemical drug products. Whereas publications by Di Masi and colleagues have provided the foundations on which numerous analyses or critiques of pharmaceutical research and development costs have since been conducted, evidence on vaccine-specific research and development costs for epidemic infectious diseases has been limited. The handful of articles published to date are either descriptive, based on expert opinions with limited data inputs to validate those claims, or focusing on single pathogens or only on clinical research and development phases. Recent studies have attempted to overcome several of the above limitations, focusing their analyses on poverty diseases or epidemic infectious diseases, as well as differentiating more systematically between costs associated with incremental versus breakthrough innovations.</p><p id="para70">
<bold>Added value of this study</bold>
</p><p id="para80">Our study presents a comprehensive dataset of vaccine research and development candidates against 11 epidemic infectious diseases, which combines a systematic search of a substantially sized literature and the confirmation of current development status of these candidates by vaccine developers active in the field. Moreover, our study attempts to overcome some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research and development cost analyses in several ways. First, we consider probability of success distributions drawn from multiple published estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in research and development which cannot be explained by single sources. Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for vaccine development. Third, our collected data suggest that costs associated with new technologies may not differ from costs associated with well-established technologies&#x02014;a finding that is contradictory to prevailing assumptions made in extant literature. Our analysis suggests that it is indirect costs, and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience of the organisations developing these products, that drive cost estimates in upward directions.</p><p id="para90">
<bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
</p><p id="para100">We demonstrate that it is possible to combine up-to-date evidence on vaccine research and development pipelines with rigorous cost analysis methods to generate robust estimates of vaccine research and development investment needs in epidemic infectious diseases. Our methods and findings can benefit future assessments of global health research and development costs, improving the credibility of funding need claims and of portfolio planning.</p></boxed-text>

Second, we tested for drivers of vaccine development costs drawn from published studies, using various statistical techniques. Third, we drew vaccine research and development probabilities of success from published estimates. We combined these with self-reported cost data to simulate costs adjusted for probability of success for advancing vaccines from preclinical testing through to phase 2a, within a Monte Carlo framework.

For each group, we constructed discrete cost distributions by research and development phase, assigning equal probabilities to the respective self-reported cost estimates. In addition to costs, we constructed triangular distributions for probability of success by research and development phase.

Given the inherently risky nature of vaccine research and development, stochastic optimisation approaches are likely to represent realistic reflections of the uncertain expectations from the pharmaceutical research and development process. Several stochastic modelling approaches have been proposed in pharmaceutical research and development management to address various portfolio optimisation problems (see literature overview in <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Drawing from previous evidence, we built a two-stage stochastic optimisation model&#x02014;ie, a stepwise optimisation of objectives that includes uncertainty&#x02014;to identify optimal research and development portfolios and costs for progressing at least one vaccine candidate per epidemic infectious disease through to end of phase 2a. In stage 1, we derived the minimum number of ideal candidates required to achieve at least one phase 2b&#x02013;3 ready candidate for an epidemic infectious disease, starting from preclinical testing, to phase 1 and phase 2, respectively. Using this information against the evidence on available pipelines per epidemic infectious disease, we derived the minimum and maximum number of vaccine candidates needed by research and development phase to progress at least one of these through to end of phase 2a.

Of the 414 organisations we approached, we received survey responses from 64, covering 314 vaccine candidates for epidemic infectious diseases in total. Of these, 121 were confirmations of vaccine candidates that were active, not yet started, or on-hold owing to lack of funding, previously identified through the literature review. 193 were newly reported vaccine candidates, of which 97 candidates had infectious diseases of epidemic potential outside the scope of the WHO priority list. From the original set of 262 vaccine candidates identified in the literature for the 11 WHO priority epidemic infectious diseases, 104 remained unspecified owing to lack of responses at the end of the survey; 44 were confirmed as terminated, on hold for technical reasons or were not confirmed at all as active projects by survey respondents; and 114 were confirmed as active, not yet started, or on hold owing to lack of funding or other reasons not related to technical failures. In total, these pipeline searches amounted to 224 vaccine candidates from preclinical to phase 2, for 11 priority epidemic infectious diseases (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>).</p><p id="para270">Reported vaccine development costs from preclinical testing through to end of phase 2a range from $8 million to $350 million (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>
). Based on the regression analysis, previous licensure experience and indirect costs associated with operating models of vaccine developers are statistically significant explanatory factors driving an increase in research and development costs. Previous licensure of vaccines for a given disease can potentially drive a reduction in research and development costs. However, a licensed prophylactic vaccine for humans does not exist for any of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases. A hierarchical clustering analysis suggests that increased research and development costs in clinical research and development phases may also potentially be associated with increased industrial sector affiliation. Substantial variation in reported costs cannot be explained despite considering several factors, including, in addition to the above, research and development timelines and previous licensure

Similarly, six to ten phase 1 candidates would be needed for at least one candidate to advance through to end of phase 2a, at a cost of $167&#x02013;201 million ($61 million&#x02013;$485 million range). Assuming vaccine candidates and funding were made available, progressing at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a for each of the 11 epidemic infectious diseases would cost a minimum of $2&#x000b7;8&#x02013;3&#x000b7;7 billion ($1&#x000b7;2 billion&#x02013;$8&#x000b7;4 billion range). Finally, at least one candidate would progress through to end of phase 2a, out of initial investments of $84&#x02013;112 million ($23 million&#x02013;$295 million range) in four to five phase 2 candidates.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure</label><caption><p>Estimated cost of progressing at least one epidemic infectious disease vaccine from preclinical through to end of phase 2a</p><p>PoS=probabilities of success.

Seven epidemic infectious diseases&#x02014;Zika, Ebola, chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, Marburg, and Lassa&#x02014;have sufficient vaccine pipelines for investments (if made available) to guarantee successful phase 2a outcomes regardless of probability of success (in reality, phase 2b&#x02013;3 ready candidates already exist for Ebola). Under a low probability of success scenario, the successful progression of a vaccine through to end of phase 2a cannot be guaranteed for Nipah, given the available candidates for this epidemic infectious disease. Vaccine pipelines for Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome comprise too few candidates for any phase 2a outcomes to be

This analysis demonstrates that whereas zero phase 2a outcomes are unlikely given the numbers of vaccine candidates supported by research and development phase under the low and high probability of success scenarios, outcomes previously mentioned and beyond one phase 2b&#x02013;3 ready candidate per epidemic infectious disease are dependent on the probability of success. In a scenario in which low costs were associated with high probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be supported as per the high probability of success and high cost scenario to achieve minimum phase 2a outcomes per epidemic infectious disease, but the overall portfolio cost would reduce to US$1&#x000b7;6 billion ($715 million&#x02013;2&#x000b7;9 billion range). In contrast, in a scenario where high costs were associated with low probability of success distributions, the same numbers of vaccine candidates would need to be funded as per the low probability of success and low cost scenario to successfully advance at least one vaccine through to end of phase 2a successfully.

Our analysis identifies several disease areas for which the upstream vaccine research and development pipeline today is insufficient, and highlights the need for entry of new vaccine candidates into preclinical development if the chances of minimum vaccine research and development preparedness targets are to be increased. Moreover, we demonstrate that higher vaccine research and development costs, and in particular clinical research and development costs, are likely to be associated with greater industrial sector affiliation and previous licensure experience of vaccine developers. If this experience were assumed to translate to higher probability of success, investing in these projects could progress more epidemic infectious disease vaccines through to end of phase 2a.</p><p id="para330">Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to use simulation-optimisation techniques to generate vaccine development cost estimates by combining pipeline and cost information, subject to multiple objectives against a range of constraints.

</p><p id="para360">Our study attempts to overcome some of the limitations identified in previous vaccine research and development cost analyses and tries to deviate from recent studies focused on epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development in several ways. First, although we draw our probability of success estimates from published evidence specific to vaccine research and development,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> we consider probability of success distributions instead of point estimates, acknowledging uncertainties in research and development that cannot be attributed to specific explanatory factors, as our regression analyses have shown. Second, we draw our cost data from both historically incurred and projected cost estimates in infectious disease vaccine research and development, as reported by vaccine developers who are active specifically in the field of epidemic infectious diseases. This gives us confidence that the baseline cost estimates informing our models can provide a more accurate reflection of total investments needed for epidemic infectious disease vaccine development.</p><p id="para370">Third, our collected data suggest that costs associated with new technologies do not differ substantially from costs associated with well-established technologies&#x02014; a finding that is contradictory to the prevailing assumptions made in the literature to date. This may be because of the compounding complexities of certain pathogens that make it difficult to disassociate pathogen-specific from technology-specific cost drivers, unless one has access to more granular cost data. However, a more plausible explanation perhaps is that cost variations are strongly associated with business models, rather than the technologies themselves, by which the various vaccine developers in epidemic infectious diseases are operating in the industry or non-industry sector.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Our statistical analysis suggests that platform technologies are not a substantial explanatory factor for average vaccine development project costs, even if we control for the assumption that the data may be nested with respect to the individual pathogens. Instead, it is indirect costs and variations in costs associated with different levels of experience in the organisations developing these products that drive cost estimates upward.</p><p id="para380">Our study has several limitations. First, the average vaccine development project cost estimates, from which our simulation-optimisation approach draws, are based on self-reported data by vaccine developers. Despite the statistical analyses and our consistency checks with CEPI and literature sources to minimise bias, such bias is likely to persist in any self-reported cost projections. This implies a certain price for innovation that vaccine developers are willing to accept in order to engage in research and development, which may differ across sectors and organisations operating with different business models and internal cost structures.<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> However, in practice, project costs in areas of relatively low commercial potential are more likely to be established by payer&#x02013;developer negotiations around risk and benefit sharing, which balances payer constraints with the developers' appetite for financial risk exposure. Coupled with unexpected circumstances, such as unforeseen regulatory requirements, or technological spillovers from other research and development activities, such factors may well drive realised vaccine research and development expenditures either way, downwards or upwards, compared with the estimates provided in this study.</p><p id="para390">Second, the assumption that higher probability of success is associated with more experienced vaccine developers, and vice versa, is based on common sense and insights shared by vaccine developers during the survey process. However, clear evidence in the literature does not exist to indisputably substantiate such claims. The implications for epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development cost estimates could be considerable. On one hand, higher probability of success associated with less experienced vaccine developers could well mean that the portfolio costs of achieving at least one phase 2a outcome per priority epidemic infectious disease would be lower than our analysis suggests. On the other hand, lower probability of success manifested in experienced vaccine developer efforts would suggest much higher portfolio costs than has been reported in this study.</p><p id="para400">Third, the numbers of vaccine candidates and associated portfolio costs reported in this study do not guarantee with full certainty that one phase 2a outcome per epidemic infectious disease would be achieved, under any probability of success and cost scenario. Given the confidence intervals applied, there is a small chance that the suggested vaccine candidates and costs would fail to meet such clinical development targets. Increasing the confidence intervals in the analysis would improve the certainty of phase 2a outcomes. However, given the variance in reported costs and probability of success estimates, the lower and upper limits of vaccine candidates required and associated portfolio costs would increase substantially in the model.</p><p id="para410">Fourth, our analysis is limited in scope to 11 priority epidemic infectious diseases. There are many other infectious diseases of epidemic potential that deserve attention according to different priority lists<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and experts' perspectives.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Our estimates of costs draw on contemporaneous information made available on vaccine research and development pipelines for more than just the 11 epidemic infectious diseases, and provide an overall price tag for bringing vaccines against the 11 epidemic infectious diseases successfully through to phase 2. Further pipeline data collection work would be needed to increase the number of diseases included in the cost analysis.</p><p id="para420">Fifth, our study does not report or estimate funding flows to epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development, which other surveys do, at least for other neglected disease areas, and more recently, Ebola.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Different vaccine developers will probably have different capacities to access internal or external financing, which suggests that the funding gaps to support epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development may be, overall, smaller than the cost estimates reported in this study as well as varying between sectors and types of organisations researching and developing epidemic infectious disease vaccines. This may also suggest that, in practice, transition probability of success between development phases is also likely to vary between organisations not only for technical reasons but also because of access to finance bottlenecks. It would be a plausible assumption to make that those organisations with previous licensure experience (and marketed vaccines) also have better access to finance, and are therefore, for financial reasons, likely to face higher probability of success in the vaccine research and development programmes (as captured by our high probability of success to high cost scenario).</p><p id="para430">Sixth, the hierarchical clustering analysis highlighted the possibility of marginal differences in costs between industry versus non-industry actors of different sizes. Our data sample was not sufficiently large to confidently label observations as smaller versus larger industry actors, nor was the composition of the partnerships developing these vaccines clearcut between sectors, subsectors, or geographical regions. These variables, in addition to the definitional challenges of what constitutes smaller or larger industry actors, suggest that more research would be needed to understand, and to report with greater certainty, any significant differences in costs associated with size, sectoral affiliation, and geographical location of vaccine developers.</p><p id="para440">Seventh, the study estimates costs for only a small part of a much bigger picture in epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development preparedness. The research and development scope of our analysis is restricted to preclinical, phase 1, and phase 2a. It excludes costs associated with phase 2b&#x02013;3 trials, stockpiles of phase 2b&#x02013;3 ready material, regulatory, and delivery activities (including for having in-country infrastructure to support emergency response activities)&#x02014;all critical elements of vaccine research and development preparedness needs in response to public health emergencies. Issues pertaining to clinical trial design, locations, and target populations of clinical studies, are some of the many factors that are likely to drive clinical development costs but which have not been explicitly considered in our study. These issues, together with factors pertaining to stockpile strategies and phase 2b&#x02013;3 trial complexities under different disease outbreak scenarios, clinical trial designs, and regulatory requirements, deserve special attention and a separate analysis, which we hope a future study will provide.</p><p id="para450">Eighth, our simulation&#x02013;optimisation framework assumes that one phase 2b&#x02013;3 ready vaccine candidate expected per disease is a sufficient research and development preparedness target for efficacy testing in response to an epidemic. This assumption might not be the case if historical probability of success for phase 3 in the literature is considered.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, unique clinical trial designs and speedy launches of these might be required to mitigate against waning disease outbreaks,<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> which might require different thresholds for clinical and regulatory success during public health emergencies. Moreover, as experience with Ebola and other recent epidemic infectious disease outbreaks has shown, interest of funders in supporting vaccine research and development in response to outbreaks withers together with the waning of epidemics. Any additional phase 2b&#x02013;3 ready vaccine candidate would not only require an additional multimillion investment just in case, but also a substantial new investment in phase 2b&#x02013;3 testing and emergency response. Whether more than one phase 2b&#x02013;3-ready vaccine candidates can be supported for a particular epidemic infectious disease is therefore also an issue for consideration by funders and decision makers in the epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development space.</p><p id="para460">Vaccines for epidemic infectious diseases need the world's attention and investment efforts if we are to respond effectively to potential future epidemics and avert humanitarian crises. Our study offers a comprehensive set of epidemic infectious disease vaccine research and development pipeline and cost findings and a reproducible methodology for identifying optimal research and development portfolios and associated investment needs across several of these diseases. More broadly, we demonstrate that a better understanding of disease-specific product research and development pipelines and associated costs through rigorous analyses can benefit any assessment of investment needs in global health research and development, improving the credibility of claims around funding requirements and of portfolio planning.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kieny</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>R&#x000f8;ttingen</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrar</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><collab>on behalf of the WHO R&#x00026;D Blueprint team and the R&#x00026;D Blueprint Scientific Advisory Group</collab></person-group><article-title>The need for global R&#x00026;D coordination for infectious diseases with epidemic potential</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>388</volume><year>2016</year><fpage>460</fpage><lpage>461</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27507751</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Norwegian Institute of Public Health</collab></person-group><article-title>Outcome document financing of R&#x00026;D preparedness and response to epidemic emergencies.
