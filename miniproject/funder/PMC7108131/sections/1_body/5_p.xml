<p>Accumulation and curation of the data will depend on a variety of sources and methodology types, but it is critical that high-quality clinical data are highlighted as an integral component. Often lost to competing priorities for clinicians during outbreaks, standardized data collection regarding the presentation and natural history of disease, biomarkers of disease severity, and response to supportive care can be sporadic or missing. While these data have their most important benefits in improving patient management (through better recognition of disease complications and informing supportive care) and public health control, patient-based data are also used to determine key parameters for clinical trials, such as the inclusion criteria, the nature and rate of clinically relevant outcomes, and potential confounders. We suggest that adoption of clinical case registries (such as those used for rare cancers) provides a feasible option to produce standardized clinical data that have multiple clinical, public health, and research benefits [
