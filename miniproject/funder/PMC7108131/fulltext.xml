This is a significant step toward improving outcomes for patients with the disease.</p><p>Ebola virus disease constitutes but one of the priority diseases that the World Health Organization (WHO), in their Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, suggests poses a severe public health risk and for which there are insufficient countermeasures [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The purpose of this priority list is to identify high-threat pathogens for which there is a need to prioritize and advance the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Any diagnostics, drugs, or vaccines that are developed as a result of this and other initiatives, such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, will need to be fully evaluated in diagnostic evaluation studies or phase II and III clinical trials.</p><p>However, due to the very nature of the epidemic-prone infectious diseases that appear in the WHO list of priority diseases, evaluation in clinical studies is challenging, not least because the epidemiology is unpredictable but also because the pathogenesis and natural history of many of these diseases are not well defined. For example, during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, case fatality rate (CFR) estimates varied widely from 0 to 13 500 per 100 000 laboratory-confirmed infections, with a heterogeneity of 99.97% (using <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> estimate) [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A therapeutic trial designed with patient survival as a primary outcome measure would have grossly misjudged the required sample size if the trial was designed using the wrong CFR. Therapeutic trials for the prevention of congenital Zika syndrome will be hindered by the absence of consistently used criteria to define the outcome of congenital malformations [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a lack of systematic biological sampling means that disease pathophysiology and factors associated with more severe disease and viral clearance (a commonly used secondary outcome measure) are not well understood [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The need for well-defined core minimal datasets for emerging infectious diseases is not a new observation. A decade ago Sheila Bird and Jeremy Farrar [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] noted the need to define a core minimal dataset for human cases of avian influenza A/H5N1, yet there remains no systematic examination of the completeness of the core data needed to design and conduct trials for high-priority pathogens. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> identifies some key domains that could contribute to a core minimal dataset that informs clinical trial design for each priority pathogen.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Suggested Elements for a Core Minimal Dataset of Observation-based Data for Designing Clinical Trials for High-priority Pathogens</p></caption><table frame="vsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nature of Information</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value to the Conception and Design of Clinical Trials</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Case counts for previous outbreaks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Serves as rudimentary estimate of the feasibility of sample-size requirements.

Importantly, a harmonized data collection initiative can also prospectively embed data-sharing agreements into data-collection protocols. This will allow valuable clinical information to be readily available to stakeholders, while identifying and protecting the interests of those collecting data in regions where outbreaks occur.</p><p>Accumulation and curation of the data will depend on a variety of sources and methodology types, but it is critical that high-quality clinical data are highlighted as an integral component. Often lost to competing priorities for clinicians during outbreaks, standardized data collection regarding the presentation and natural history of disease, biomarkers of disease severity, and response to supportive care can be sporadic or missing. While these data have their most important benefits in improving patient management (through better recognition of disease complications and informing supportive care) and public health control, patient-based data are also used to determine key parameters for clinical trials, such as the inclusion criteria, the nature and rate of clinically relevant outcomes, and potential confounders. We suggest that adoption of clinical case registries (such as those used for rare cancers) provides a feasible option to produce standardized clinical data that have multiple clinical, public health, and research benefits [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Compared with expensive and lengthy countermeasure development pipelines, improving the scale, relevance, and quality of observational data is likely to be an efficient and cost-effective strategy to improve global preparedness against epidemic and pandemic infections.</p></body><back><notes id="n1"><title>Notes</title><p>
