<p>C6/36 cells were seeded into 12 well plates at 200 000 cells/well. The next day, cells were infected with CHIKV at MOI 2 (2xPFU as determined on BHK-21 monolayers/C6/36 cell number) and treated with the MNTD of compounds as described for Huh7 cells. The supernatants were harvested and CHIKV titer determined at 24 hpi. All experiments were performed in three independent repeats, each consisting of 2 wells/condition. A one-way ANOVA was employed and a Dunnettâ€™s multiple comparisons test was performed, comparing treated samples to untreated sample.</p>
