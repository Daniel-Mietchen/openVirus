<p>Huh7 cells were seeded into 96 well plates at 10 000 cells/well (20 000 cells/well for C6/36 cells) one day prior to treatment with increasing doses of Ribavirin (Fluorochem); 4,4'-Diisothiocyanato-2.2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS, Sigma); 9-Anthracenecarboxylic acid (9-ACA, Sigma); indanyloxyacetic acid-94 (IAA-94, Cayman Chemical), 5-Nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Fisher Chemical). Compound stocks were dissolved in DMSO and stored at -20°C in aliquots until dilution into complete DMEM/Leibovitz’s for addition onto cells. After 6 hrs and 24 hrs incubation respectively, media/compound was removed and cells incubated in Opti-MEM (Gibco) plus 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) for 30 min at 37°C. After removal of Opti-MEM/MTT, cells were lysed in DMSO and absorbance determined at 570 nm on an Infinite F50 microplate reader (Tecan). Absorbance of samples was normalized to untreated control cells. Three independent experiments were conducted, each repeat consisting of three wells/dose. A two-way ANOVA was employed and a Sidak’s or Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed, comparing each compound dose to the average of untreated samples. The MNTD was defined as the highest compound concentration that does not show a significant reduction in normalized absorbance to the untreated samples.</p>
