<p>C6/36 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 2) and treated with inhibitory compounds as described above. At 24 hpi, total RNA was extracted from cells using TRI Reagent Solution (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was confirmed by denaturing ageraose gel electrophoresis before reverse transcription of 1 μg of RNA using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR was performed using the qPCRBIO SyGreen Blue Mix Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) with primers amplifying a 78 bp region of the CHIKV nsP1 encoding sequence (fwd primer: 5’CCGACTCAACCATCCTGGAT’3, rev primer: 5’GGCAGACGCAGTGGTACTTCCT’3), 100ng of cDNA template and a PCR program as described above. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> transcribed CHIKV ICRES RNA was reverse transcribed and a cDNA dilution series employed as a standard to quantify copy numbers in the respective samples. All experiments were performed in three independent repeats, each consisting of 2 wells/condition. A one-way ANOVA was employed and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed, comparing each sample to the untreated control sample.
