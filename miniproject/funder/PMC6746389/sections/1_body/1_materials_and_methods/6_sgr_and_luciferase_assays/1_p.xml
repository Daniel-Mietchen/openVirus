<p>The CHIKV-Fluc SGR contains a Firefly Luciferase (Fluc) reporter gene which is expressed from the sub-genomic promotor [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; therefore, detection of Fluc activity is indicative of CHIKV genome replication. The plasmid was linearized using NotI and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion). 400 ng CHIKV-Fluc SGR RNA was co-transfected with 100 ng Renilla Luciferase (Rluc) encoding RNA using 1 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher) into Huh7 cells seeded the previous day into 24 well plates at 50 000 cells/well. During the time of transfection, cells were incubated with Opti-MEM/inhibitor. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) at 6 hrs post-transfection. The dual luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). The Fluc signal was adjusted to the Rluc signal as follows: (average Rluc signal (untreated control)/ Rluc signal (sample X)) x Fluc signal (sample X). Three independent repeats were performed, with each repeat consisting of 2 wells/conditions, which were analyzed as 2 technical repeats each. A one-way ANOVA was employed and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed comparing each sample to the untreated sample.
