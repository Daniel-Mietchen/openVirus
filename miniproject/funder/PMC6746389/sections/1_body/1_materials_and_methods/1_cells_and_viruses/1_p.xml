<p>Huh7 cells (hepatocytes derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma) and BHK-21 cells (fibroblasts derived from Syrian golden hamster kidney) were a gift from M. Harris (University of Leeds, UK). C6/36 cells (
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> larva) were a gift from S. Jacobs (The Pirbright Institute, UK). All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma. Mammalian cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and non-essential amino acids (Lonza) in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Invertebrate cells were maintained at 28°C in Leibovitz’s media (Gibco) supplemented with Tryptose Phosphate Broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin.
