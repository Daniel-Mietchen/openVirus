<p>Huh7 cells were seeded into 12 well plates at 100 000 cells/well. The next day, cells were transfected with 75 pmol/well CLIC1, CLIC4 and control-B (= scrambled) siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, with each siRNA representing a pool of three 19–25 nt siRNAs. Transfection was conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-29528) with a siRNA to transfection reagent ratio of 1:1. At 24 hrs post transfection, the transfection was repeated to achieve a clearly discernable reduction in protein expression level. At 48 hrs post initial transfection, cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 10) as described above and a sample harvested for analysis on western blot. Supernatant was harvested at 24 hpi and standard plaque assays performed to determine viral titer. Cells were lysed and analyzed on western blots as described. For double knock down of CLIC1 and CLIC4, a total of 150 pmol siRNA/well was transfected into the cells. Three independent repeats were performed and CHIKV titers of CLIC1/CLIC4 knock down samples were expressed as percentage of scrambled siRNA control sample per repeat. A one-way ANOVA was employed and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed, comparing each sample to the scrambled siRNA control sample.</p>
