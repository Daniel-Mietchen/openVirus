<p>Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV and treated with inhibitory compounds as described above. At 6 hpi, total RNA was extracted from cells using TRI Reagent Solution (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Strand-specific qPCR (ssqPCR) was performed according to the protocol described by Plaskon and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, 500 ng of RNA were reverse-transcribed with gene specific primers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007703.s005">S1 Table</xref>) using the SCRIPT cDNA Synthesis Kit (Jena Bioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 100ng of strand-specific cDNA was used as template for the quantitative PCR performed with the qPCRBIO SyGreen Blue Mix Lo-ROX (PCR Biosystems) with gene specific primers (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> transcribed CHIKV ICRES RNA was reverse transcribed and a cDNA dilution series employed as a standard to quantify copy numbers in the respective samples. All experiments were performed in four independent repeats, each consisting of 2 wells/condition. A one-way ANOVA was employed and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was performed comparing each sample to the untreated control sample.
