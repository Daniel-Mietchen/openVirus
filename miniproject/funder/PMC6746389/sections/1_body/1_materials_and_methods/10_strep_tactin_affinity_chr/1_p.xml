<p>Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV ICRES TST-nsP3 (MOI 10) as described above. At 24 hpi, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (2x, pH 7.2, 20mM PIPES, 240mM KCl, 60mM NaCl, 10mM MgCl2, 2% Triton x-10, 20% Glycerol) and total protein concentration of clarified cell lysate determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Strep-Tactin Sepharose 50% suspension (iba, 2-1201-002) was washed with wash buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8) before equilibrating with lysis buffer. 1mg/ml total protein was incubated with the sepharose o/n at 4Â°C. Sepharose was washed once with lysis buffer followed by wash buffer (100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; X mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA) with increasing and then decreasing stringency (150 mM, 275 mM, 500 mM, 150 mM NaCl). Sepharose was boiled in standard SDS sample buffer and bound proteins analyzed on western blots as described above.</p>
