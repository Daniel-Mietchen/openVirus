<p>Anion channels have been shown to be important in other viral systems. Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels were identified as part of the Semliki Forest virus, that is closely related to CHIKV, replication complex by quantitative proteomics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], supporting our CLIC1/nsP3 findings. In addition, the replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (family 
 <italic>Tombusviridae</italic>) was shown to depend on Cl
 <sup>â€”</sup>proton exchanger function [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Gef1p Cl
 <sup>-</sup>silencing, a homologue of the mammalian CLC proteins in yeast, inhibited replication through its downstream effects on Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> homoeostasis, inhibiting the functionality of the viral replicase. Direct interaction of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 with VP1 and VP3 of infectious bursal disease virus (family 
 <italic>Birnavirdae</italic>) was shown to stabilize the ribonucleoprotein complex, allowing full activity of the viral polymerase [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It may be possible that CLIC1, as an nsP3 interacting protein, is required for CHIKV genome replication for a similar mechanism.
