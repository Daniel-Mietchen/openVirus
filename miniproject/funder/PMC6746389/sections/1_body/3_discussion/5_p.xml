<p>Using a combination of broad acting inhibitors and siRNA screens, the involvement of several Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel/transporter proteins in the hepatitis C virus lifecycle has previously been reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], with CLC2, CLC3, CLC5, CLC7 being specifically required for genome replication. A Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel from the same family, CLC6, has been identified as a pro-viral factor in a genome-wide loss of function screen performed with a CHIKV reporter virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This raises possibility that further Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels are involved in the replication of the CHIKV genome or other stages of the virus lifecycle. For example, it is conceivable that Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels not targeted by the compounds used in this study, or other ion channels, may play a role in post-entry events, leading up to genome replicationâ€”i.e. trafficking or uncoating as observed for e.g. Bunyamwera virus [
