<p>In this study we demonstrate that cellular Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels have a significant pro-viral role during CHIKV infection. Our data shows that Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel modulators inhibit efficient CHIKV RNA synthesis and that the intracellular Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels CLIC1 and CLIC4 are specifically required for CHIKV replication. CLIC1 was found in complex with CHIKV nsP3, albeit to low levels, suggesting a direct involvement in CHIKV replication complex formation or nsP3-mediated viral functions. For the first time, these data highlight the requirement of cellular ion channels during the CHIKV lifecycle.
