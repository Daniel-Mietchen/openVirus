<p>The regulation of ionic homeostasis, mediated through cellular ion channels, has emerged as a requirement for a number of virus infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has previously been shown that two pore domain (K
 <sub>2P</sub>) potassium channels play a role during the trafficking of Bunyamwera virus (family 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae)</italic> in endosomes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and that Hazara virus (family 
 <italic>Nairoviridae)</italic> similarly requires endosomal potassium to permit release from endosomes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ebola virus (family 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic>) is known to require endosomal calcium channels for entry into its host cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while entry of Influenza virus (family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>) depends on binding of the hemagglutinin to the voltage-dependent calcium channel Ca
 <sub>v</sub>1.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Hepatitis C virus (family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) replication is inhibited by Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel blockers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] whilst the Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel CLC6 was identified as a pro-viral factor in a genome-wide loss of function screen during CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
