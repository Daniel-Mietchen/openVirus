<p>In this study, we used a panel of ion channel modulating compounds to demonstrate that CHIKV requires Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel activity during its lifecycle, in both mammalian and mosquito cells, for efficient replication of the viral genome. Through RNAi silencing, two Cl
 <sup>-</sup> intracellular channels, CLIC1 and CLIC4, were identified as pro-viral factors for CHIKV replication, with CLIC1 potentially interacting with CHIKV nsP3â€”further implicating this channel as a significant host cell factor during CHIKV infection. These findings expand our understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis and reveal Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels as a potential host cell target for the development of much needed CHIKV antivirals.
