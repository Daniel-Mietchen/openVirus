<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus in the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family. It was first isolated during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Following transmission, CHIKV replicates in the fibroblasts of the dermis and disseminates through the blood-stream to several tissues including muscle, joints and the liver [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CHIKV causes chikungunya fever which is characterized by high fever, maculopapular rash, myalgia and debilitating arthralgia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In some cases more severe symptoms occur—including encephalitis, encephalopathy, myocarditis, hepatitis and Guillain Barré syndrome [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], however chikungunya fever-associated death is rare [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to the chronic debilitating symptoms and sequela that persist for up to 3 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], CHIKV has a major impact on morbidity and loss of economic productivity within at-risk populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Treatment of CHIKV-associated disease is limited to the relief of symptoms with no licensed vaccines or direct acting antivirals currently available.
