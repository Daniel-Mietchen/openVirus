<p>Given the inhibitory effects of chloride channel inhibition on CHIKV genome replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we reasoned that the channels may form part of the virus replicase complex. To assess this, cells were infected with CHIKV twin-strep-tag nsP3 (CHIKV TST-nsP3) (MOI 10), which encodes a 28 amino acid TST-tag within the hypervariable domain of nsP3. At 24 hpi, cells were lysed and TST/strep-tactin affinity pull-downs performed—whereby the TST-tag of nsP3 selectively binds to Strep-Tactin Sepharose. Following elution, proteins interacting with CHIKV nsP3 were identified by western blot analysis. Negative controls for this analyses included cells infected with wild-type CHIKV (i.e. expressing untagged nsP3) and uninfected cells. We observed that untagged nsP3, capsid, and to lesser extent CLIC1, bound non-specifically to the Sepharose resin, albeit to low levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). However, compared to both controls, enriched levels of CLIC1 were evident in complex with TST-nsP3—implying low levels of direct/indirect interaction between CLIC1 and nsP3. CLIC4 was not identified as an nsP3 interacting partner, suggesting an independent function outwith the CHIKV replicase complex. Previously published immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated an interaction between alphavirus capsid protein and nsP3 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that CLIC1 interacts either directly or indirectly with nsP3, an essential component of the CHIKV replication machinery.
