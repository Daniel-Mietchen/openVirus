<p>We next sought to identify the stage of the CHIKV lifecycle that is sensitive to Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibition. The CHIKV lifecycle begins with virus attachment to host cells mediated by the CHIKV E2 protein. To analyze cell attachment, CHIKV (MOI 2) was adsorbed onto cells at 4°C (to prevent virus internalization) for 1 hr in the presence of either DIDS, 9-ACA, NPPB or Ribavirin. Both virus and compound were then removed by rigorous washing and cells were warmed to 37°C to permit the internalization of attached virus particles. Virus infection efficiency was lower in this assay compared to infections carried out at physiological temperature. Thus, cell supernatants were assayed for infectious CHIKV progeny at 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), rather than 12 hpi as in other assays. Treatment with 9-ACA, NPPB and Ribavirin had no influence on CHIKV titers, indicating that these compounds do not impact CHIKV E2 mediated cell surface attachment. DIDS had a modest but non-significant effect on virus binding, implying it may partially impact this lifecycle stage.
