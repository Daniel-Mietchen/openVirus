 <sup>-</sup> channel blockers—including diisothiocyanostilbene-2,20-disulfonic acid (DIDS), 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9-ACA), indyanyloxyacetic acid 94 (IAA-94) and 5-nitro-2-3-phenylpropylamino benzoic acid (NPPB) for their effects on CHIKV infection. For these assays, maximal non-toxic doses (MNTD) for human hepatoma cells (Huh7) were determined for each compound by MTT assay (

Next, Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 2) in the presence of the MNTD of each compound; at 12 hpi titers of released virus were determined. Treatment with NPPB resulted in an 18-fold reduction in CHIKV progeny compared to untreated cells, while treatment with DIDS and 9-ACA led to an 8-fold decrease in CHIKV titer (p ≤ 0.05) (
