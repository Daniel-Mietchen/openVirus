<p>As an arbovirus, CHIKV infects both humans and mosquitos. We thus investigated if the dependency of CHIKV on cellular Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels is limited to human cells or extends to those of its mosquito host. To assess this, C6/36 cells derived from the larva of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were infected with CHIKV in the presence of the MNTD (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007703.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) of NPPB, the Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitor that exhibited the most significant inhibitory effects on CHIKV replication in mammalian cells (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">3</xref>). A 357-fold reduction in CHIKV titer, following infection (MOI 2) of NPPB-treated C6/36 cells, was observed at 24 hpi (p ≤ 0.001), implying that Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels are required during the CHIKV lifecycle in mosquito host cells. Ribavirin-treatment, used as a positive control, led to a 39-fold decrease in CHIKV titer (p ≤ 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The effects of the other Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors (DIDS, 9-ACA and IAA-94) tested in mammalian cells, were also investigated in infections of C6/36 cells (MOI 2) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007703.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Only DIDS-treatment led to a significant reduction in CHIKV replication at 24 hpi. As this could have been due to a similar non-specific effect as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g002">Fig 2</xref>.—DIDS, 9-ACA and IAA-94 were not pursued further in C6/36 cell infection studies. By analogy to the data from mammalian cells, the effects of NPPB on viral genome replication were investigated using the CHIKV-Fluc SGR. Though the cytotoxic effect of CHIKV-Fluc SGR transfection in combination with NPPB-treatment prevented replicon analysis, CHIKV RNA copy numbers could still be determined by reverse transcription qPCR 24 hpi. Viral RNA copy numbers were reduced 137-fold in NPPB-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and 15-fold in Ribavirin-treated cells (p ≤ 0.0001). Taken together, these data demonstrate that NPPB-sensitive Cl
 <sup>-</sup> channels are involved in the CHIKV lifecycle in both human and mosquito host cells.
