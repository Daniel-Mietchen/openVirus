  <title>Chloride intracellular channels (CLICs) facilitate CHIKV replication.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A) (i)</bold> CLIC1 and CLIC4, respectively, as well as 
   <bold>(ii)</bold> CLIC1 and CLIC4 in combination, were knocked down by transfecting siRNA into Huh7 cells. 
   <bold>B)</bold> At 48 hrs after initial siRNA transfection, cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 10) and released CHIKV and titered at 24 hpi (n = 3). Viral titer was normalised to the scrambled siRNA control sample. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare samples to scrambled siRNA transfected cells. Error bars represent standard deviation. *p≤0.05; ** p≤0.01, *** p≤0.001. 
   <bold>C)</bold> TST-tagged nsP3 from CHIKV infected (MOI 10) Huh7 cells (24 hpi) was pulled-down using Strep-Tactin Sepharose. Western blots were probed for nsP3 binding proteins.
