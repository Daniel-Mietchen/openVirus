  <title>Inhibition of Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channels decreases CHIKV replication.

   <bold>A)</bold> Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 2) in the presence of the MNTD of Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors; Ribavirin served as a positive control and DMSO as a carrier control. The titre of the released virus was determined at 12 hpi, (n = 3). 
   <bold>B)</bold> Huh7 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 10) and expression levels of CHIKV nsP1 and capsid were determined by western blot at 24 hpi. 
   <bold>C)</bold> CHIKV-infected Huh7 cells (MOI 2) were treated with decreasing concentrations of the Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors; Ribavirin was used as control. The titer was determined at 12 hpi, (n ≥ 3). 
   <bold>D)</bold> CHIKV was incubated with the compounds at 37°C (except for DEPC ≙ RT) for 1 hr prior to adsorption to Huh7 cells (MOI 2). The released CHIKV harvested and titred at 12 hpi, (n = 3). Error bars represent standard deviation. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare samples to untreated cells. * p≤0.05, ** p≤0.01, *** p≤0.001.
