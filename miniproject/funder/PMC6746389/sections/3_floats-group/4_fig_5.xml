  <title>Inhibition of Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channels reduces CHIKV replication in invertebrate cells.
  </title>
  <p>C6/36 cells were infected with CHIKV (MOI 2) in the presence of the MNTD of NPPB and Ribavirin, respectively. 
   <bold>A)</bold> The viral titer (n = 3) and 
   <bold>B)</bold> CHIKV RNA copy number (n = 3) were determined at 24 hpi. Error bars represent standard deviation. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare samples to untreated cells. *** p≤0.001, **** p≤0.0001.
