   <bold>A)</bold> Schematic of the CHIKV genome (top) and the CHIKV-Fluc SGR (bottom). 
   <bold>B)</bold> Huh7 cells were transfected with the CHIKV-Fluc SGR and Rluc mRNA in the presence of Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors. At 6 hrs post-transfection, Fluc and Rluc activities were determined and Fluc activities normalised to Rluc. 
   <bold>C and D)</bold> Total RNA was extracted from Huh7 cells 6 hpi with CHIKV (MOI 2) and treatment with the Cl
   <sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors. CHIKV positive-strand genomic 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and minus-strand intermediate 
   <bold>(D)</bold> RNA was quantified by reverse transcription followed by qPCR (n = 4). One-way ANOVA was performed to compare samples to untreated cells. Error bars represent standard deviation. ns = not significant, * p≤0.05, ** p≤0.01, *** p≤0.001, **** p≤0.0001.
