The CHIKV lifecycle is poorly understood and specific antiviral therapeutics or vaccines are lacking. In this study, we investigated the role of host-cell chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) channels on CHIKV replication.We demonstrate that specific pharmacological Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors significantly inhibit CHIKV replication in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that Cl<sup>-</sup>channels are pro-viral factors in human cells. Further analysis of the effect of the inhibitors on CHIKV attachment, entry, viral protein expression and replicon replication demonstrated that Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are specifically required for efficient CHIKV genome replication. This was conserved in mosquito cells, where CHIKV replication and genome copy number was significantly reduced following Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibition. siRNA silencing identified chloride intracellular channels 1 and 4 (CLIC1 and CLIC4, respectively) as required for efficient CHIKV replication and protein affinity chromatography showed low levels of CLIC1 in complex with CHIKV nsP3, an essential component of the viral replication machinery. In summary, for the first time we demonstrate that efficient replication of the CHIKV genome depends on cellular Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, in both human and mosquito cells and identifies CLIC1 and CLIC4 as agonists of CHIKV replication in human cells. We observe a modest interaction, either direct or indirect, between CLIC1 and nsP3 and hypothesize that CLIC1 may play a role in the formation/maintenance of CHIKV replication complexes. These findings advance our molecular understanding of CHIKV replication and identify potential druggable targets for the treatment and prevention of CHIKV mediated disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that infects humans and causes chikungunya fever&#x02014;characterized by fever, rash and chronic arthralgia. Treatment of chikungunya fever is limited to the alleviation of the symptoms and no vaccine is available to prevent infection. Consequently, new anti-CHIKV therapies or targets are urgently required. Since its initial isolation in Tanzania in 1952, CHIKV has spread widely across tropical/sub-tropical and more temperate regions. It has been responsible for epidemics in &#x0003e;70 different regions of the world, resulting in high morbidity and financial burden. Despite this, the CHIKV lifecycle is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that CHIKV requires host-cell ion channels that mediate chloride ion (Cl<sup>-</sup>) flux through the membranes of infected cells, to complete its lifecycle. Specifically, using pharmacological compounds, we show that Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are required for efficient replication of the virus genome, identify two specific channels (CLIC1 and CLIC4) required for replication and demonstrate that CLIC1 may interact with viral non-structural protein 3 (nsP3)&#x02014;an essential component of the CHIKV replicase complex. These findings advance our understanding of CHIKV replication and identify potential druggable targets for the treatment and prevention of CHIKV mediated disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/NO1054X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2524-707X</contrib-id><name><surname>Tuplin</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Royal society</institution></funding-source><award-id>RG140704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2524-707X</contrib-id><name><surname>Tuplin</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funding from the Royal Society (RG140704) and MRC (MR/NO1054X/1) to AT.

It was first isolated during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952 [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], since which its geographic range has expanded globally to include almost 40 countries [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Following transmission, CHIKV replicates in the fibroblasts of the dermis and disseminates through the blood-stream to several tissues including muscle, joints and the liver [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CHIKV causes chikungunya fever which is characterized by high fever, maculopapular rash, myalgia and debilitating arthralgia [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In some cases more severe symptoms occur&#x02014;including encephalitis, encephalopathy, myocarditis, hepatitis and Guillain Barr&#x000e9; syndrome [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], however chikungunya fever-associated death is rare [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to the chronic debilitating symptoms and sequela that persist for up to 3 years [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], CHIKV has a major impact on morbidity and loss of economic productivity within at-risk populations [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Treatment of CHIKV-associated disease is limited to the relief of symptoms with no licensed vaccines or direct acting antivirals currently available.</p><p>CHIKV is a small, enveloped virus, with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of ~12 kilobases. The genome possesses a type-0 5&#x02019; 7-methyl-GpppA cap, a 3&#x02019; poly(A) tail and two open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF (ORF-1) encodes the non-structural polyprotein P1234 that is processed to yield four mature non-structural proteins (nsP1-4). The second ORF (ORF-2) encodes the structural polyprotein that is processed into the capsid protein, E3, E2, 6K, and E1. Virus attachment onto mammalian cells is mediated by the CHIKV E2 protein and the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Internalization is achieved via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, although clathrin-independent pathways have also been identified [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Following CHIKV trafficking to early endosomes, the E1 glycoprotein facilitates endosomal fusion and capsid release into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Replication of the viral genome is not well studied but through analogy to other alphaviruses proteolytic cleavage of P1234 in <italic>cis</italic> by the protease function of nsP2 releases the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsP4, initiating the synthesis of minus-strand RNA. Subsequent proteolytic cleavage of the remaining P123 polyprotein initiates synthesis of genomic and sub-genomic RNAs from the minus-strand template [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Viral RNA replication occurs in membrane-bound replication complexes, termed spherules, located at the plasma membrane [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], facilitating an optimal environment for replication and protection of dsRNA intermediates from host cell detection. The structural polyprotein is translated from sub-genomic RNA and is co- and post- translationally cleaved by viral and host proteases. Virus assembly and budding takes place at the plasma membrane.</p><p>The regulation of ionic homeostasis, mediated through cellular ion channels, has emerged as a requirement for a number of virus infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It has previously been shown that two pore domain (K<sub>2P</sub>) potassium channels play a role during the trafficking of Bunyamwera virus (family <italic>Peribunyaviridae)</italic> in endosomes [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and that Hazara virus (family <italic>Nairoviridae)</italic> similarly requires endosomal potassium to permit release from endosomes [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ebola virus (family <italic>Filoviridae</italic>) is known to require endosomal calcium channels for entry into its host cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], while entry of Influenza virus (family <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>) depends on binding of the hemagglutinin to the voltage-dependent calcium channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Hepatitis C virus (family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) replication is inhibited by Cl<sup>-</sup> channel blockers [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] whilst the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel CLC6 was identified as a pro-viral factor in a genome-wide loss of function screen during CHIKV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we used a panel of ion channel modulating compounds to demonstrate that CHIKV requires Cl<sup>-</sup> channel activity during its lifecycle, in both mammalian and mosquito cells, for efficient replication of the viral genome. Through RNAi silencing, two Cl<sup>-</sup> intracellular channels, CLIC1 and CLIC4, were identified as pro-viral factors for CHIKV replication, with CLIC1 potentially interacting with CHIKV nsP3&#x02014;further implicating this channel as a significant host cell factor during CHIKV infection. These findings expand our understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis and reveal Cl<sup>-</sup> channels as a potential host cell target for the development of much needed CHIKV antivirals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Huh7 cells (hepatocytes derived from human hepatocellular carcinoma) and BHK-21 cells (fibroblasts derived from Syrian golden hamster kidney) were a gift from M.

Both are based on the isolate LR2006 OPY1, representing the East Central South African genotype. CHIKV TST-nsP3 was generated by synthesizing a 129 bp DNA fragment containing the twin-strep-tag (TST) encoding sequence flanked by two SpeI restriction sites (ThermoFisher Scientific). This fragment was cloned into the CHIKV-Fluc SGR using a unique SpeI site in region corresponding to the hypervariable domain of nsP3 (position 5222). The TST-nsP3 fragment was then excised and cloned into the CHIKV ICRES plasmids using the unique KfII and the AgeI restriction sites. All CHIKV plasmids were linearized using NotI and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion). 1 &#x003bc;g of RNA was electroporated into 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> BHK-21 cells using a single square wave pulse (260 V, 25 ms).

To assess this, cells were infected with CHIKV twin-strep-tag nsP3 (CHIKV TST-nsP3) (MOI 10), which encodes a 28 amino acid TST-tag within the hypervariable domain of nsP3. At 24 hpi, cells were lysed and TST/strep-tactin affinity pull-downs performed&#x02014;whereby the TST-tag of nsP3 selectively binds to Strep-Tactin Sepharose. Following elution, proteins interacting with CHIKV nsP3 were identified by western blot analysis. Negative controls for this analyses included cells infected with wild-type CHIKV (i.e. expressing untagged nsP3) and uninfected cells. We observed that untagged nsP3, capsid, and to lesser extent CLIC1, bound non-specifically to the Sepharose resin, albeit to low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). However, compared to both controls, enriched levels of CLIC1 were evident in complex with TST-nsP3&#x02014;implying low levels of direct/indirect interaction between CLIC1 and nsP3. CLIC4 was not identified as an nsP3 interacting partner, suggesting an independent function outwith the CHIKV replicase complex. Previously published immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated an interaction between alphavirus capsid protein and nsP3 [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which was included as a positive control to validate the pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

A 357-fold reduction in CHIKV titer, following infection (MOI 2) of NPPB-treated C6/36 cells, was observed at 24 hpi (p &#x02264; 0.001), implying that Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are required during the CHIKV lifecycle in mosquito host cells. Ribavirin-treatment, used as a positive control, led to a 39-fold decrease in CHIKV titer (p &#x02264; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

Our data shows that Cl<sup>-</sup> channel modulators inhibit efficient CHIKV RNA synthesis and that the intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> channels CLIC1 and CLIC4 are specifically required for CHIKV replication. CLIC1 was found in complex with CHIKV nsP3, albeit to low levels, suggesting a direct involvement in CHIKV replication complex formation or nsP3-mediated viral functions. For the first time, these data highlight the requirement of cellular ion channels during the CHIKV lifecycle.</p><p>Cl<sup>-</sup> channels at the cell membrane regulate an array of cellular processes including cell-volume control, fluid transport and cell excitability. Intracellularly, Cl<sup>-</sup> transport across organelle membranes regulates endosome, lysosome and Golgi acidification. We observed inhibitory effects for three out of four assessed Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors on CHIKV replication in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><p>The tested compounds do not display virucidal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) nor influence virus binding or the early stages of the viral lifecycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Intriguingly, 9-ACA- and NPPB-sensitive Cl<sup>-</sup> channels were required specifically for efficient RNA replication&#x02014;as evidenced by the effect of the inhibitors on the CHIKV-Fluc SGR and copy number of the CHIKV genomic and intermediate minus-strand RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g003">Fig 3</xref>). NPPB-sensitive Cl<sup>-</sup> channels appear to have a conserved function in mosquito cells, as application of the inhibitor to infected C6/36 cells led to a reduction in CHIKV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p><p>To identify specific Cl<sup>-</sup> channels required for CHIKV replication, we focused on two CLIC family members, namely CLIC1 and CLIC4. CLIC proteins are small proteins (236&#x02013;253 aa, with the exception of CLIC5B and CLIC6), harboring an N-terminal GST-like domain and a C-terminal alpha-helical domain (reviewed in [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). CLICs are metamorphic proteins that reversibly alternate between soluble cytoplasmic and membrane-associated forms, by rearrangement of the GST-like fold under oxidative conditions. Consequently, CLICs are multifunctional, exerting GST-like enzymatic functions as well as functions in membrane trafficking, endosomal sorting and functioning as Cl<sup>-</sup> channels. In Merkel cell polyomavirus infected cells, both CLIC1 and CLIC4, mediate small T antigen induced cell motility via their Cl<sup>-</sup> channel activity [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, CLIC1 and CLIC4 silencing inhibited CHIKV replication and, given that these effects mirrored those of the Cl<sup>-</sup> modulators, we reasoned that this effect was likely due to Cl<sup>-</sup> channel activity. Interestingly, we identified CLIC1 as a potential interacting partner of nsP3&#x02014;an essential component of the CHIKV replication complex. We thus speculate that CLIC1 is in its membrane-inserted conformation and interacts with nsP3 and/or other ns-protein(s) bound to nsP3 as part of the replicase, to ensure optimal replication conditions within this membrane imbedded complex. These functions may align with the known roles of intracellular Cl<sup>-</sup> function, namely the regulation of organelle pH to maintain complex stability and genome integrity. In addition, isolation of CHIKV replication complexes has shown that all proteins needed for viral genome replication are present in the membrane fraction, and no soluble proteins are required [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], further supporting a role for membrane associated CLIC1. The double knock down of CLIC1 and CLIC4 did not have a synergistic effect on inhibiting CHIKV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007703.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and CLIC4 was not observed to directly interact with nsP3. These results imply that, although required for efficient CHIKV replication, CLIC4 functions through an alternative mechanism or different stage in a pathway to CLIC1.</p><p>Using a combination of broad acting inhibitors and siRNA screens, the involvement of several Cl<sup>-</sup> channel/transporter proteins in the hepatitis C virus lifecycle has previously been reported [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], with CLC2, CLC3, CLC5, CLC7 being specifically required for genome replication. A Cl<sup>-</sup> channel from the same family, CLC6, has been identified as a pro-viral factor in a genome-wide loss of function screen performed with a CHIKV reporter virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This raises possibility that further Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are involved in the replication of the CHIKV genome or other stages of the virus lifecycle. For example, it is conceivable that Cl<sup>-</sup> channels not targeted by the compounds used in this study, or other ion channels, may play a role in post-entry events, leading up to genome replication&#x02014;i.e. trafficking or uncoating as observed for e.g. Bunyamwera virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Anion channels have been shown to be important in other viral systems. Cl<sup>-</sup> channels were identified as part of the Semliki Forest virus, that is closely related to CHIKV, replication complex by quantitative proteomics [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], supporting our CLIC1/nsP3 findings. In addition, the replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (family <italic>Tombusviridae</italic>) was shown to depend on Cl<sup>&#x02014;</sup>proton exchanger function [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Gef1p Cl<sup>-</sup>silencing, a homologue of the mammalian CLC proteins in yeast, inhibited replication through its downstream effects on Cu<sup>2+</sup> homoeostasis, inhibiting the functionality of the viral replicase. Direct interaction of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 with VP1 and VP3 of infectious bursal disease virus (family <italic>Birnavirdae</italic>) was shown to stabilize the ribonucleoprotein complex, allowing full activity of the viral polymerase [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It may be possible that CLIC1, as an nsP3 interacting protein, is required for CHIKV genome replication for a similar mechanism.</p><p>Interestingly, CLIC-dependent Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux has been shown to act during NLRP3 inflammasome activation and signaling [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and it has recently been shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in CHIKV infected humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A small molecule inhibitor of the inflammasome abrogated inflammatory pathology in mice without influencing the CHIKV titer. This could imply that CLIC Cl<sup>-</sup> channel function is also involved in the inflammatory response to CHIKV infection, in addition to its role in efficient CHIKV genome replication. Inhibitors specific to CLIC1 and CLIC4 may hold potential as both CHIKV antivirals and inhibitors of the CHIKV inflammatory response. Specific inhibitors would exclude possible off-target effects caused by the currently available broad acting Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors.</p><p>In conclusion, for the first time this study identifies Cl<sup>-</sup> channels as essential host cell factors for efficient CHIKV replication and in conjunction with other recent studies highlights the significance of ion channel modulation as a druggable target to inhibit virus infection. Notably, we show that the requirement for cellular Cl<sup>-</sup> channels is conserved between human and mosquito host cells and it is likely that other Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are required at various stages of the CHIKV lifecycle. In general, Cl<sup>-</sup> channels may represent a potential target for the development of antivirals acting against a broad variety of (arbo-)viruses and encouragingly Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors are in clinical or pre-clinical use [<xref rid="pntd.0007703.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], potentially facilitatatig the development of Cl<sup>-</sup> channel specific compounds for future anti-CHIKV strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007703.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Maximal non-toxic doses (MNTD) of Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors and Ribavirin.</title><p>Huh7 <bold>(A)</bold> and C6/36 cells <bold>(B)</bold> were incubated with increasing concentrations of Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors, Ribavirin and carrier (DMSO) only.
