<p id="p0325">This tool represents a first step towards understanding the limiting factors in vaccine development and epidemic preparedness. However, there are still several key outstanding challenges it does not fully capture. The first is sustained funding for this problem, which is partly address through the creation of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI,

 </ext-link>), however improved co-ordination is still required between industry, academia, government and international organizations, such as the WHO. This will be a key priority for policy makers in the future. Infrastructure and manufacturing capacity needs to be accurately assessed, especially fill-finish capacity for the different vaccine types/classes. Additionally, continued research is required to better understand the correlates of protection, appropriate animal models and, of course, the discovery of new antigens that can protect against these emerging pathogens.
