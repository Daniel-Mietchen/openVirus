<p id="p0330">An extraordinary array of technologies are under development that have the potential to change our ability to respond to emerging infectious diseases. Amongst these, viral vector and subunit vaccines are at the forefront, however future innovations with nucleic acid based vaccines are on the horizon. Currently, there are no DNA or RNA vaccines licensed for human use. Yet should this milestone be reached, many of the bottlenecks described currently will be eliminated. In the meantime, funders, governments and policy makers must all focus to overcome the existing bottlenecks identified and employ better co-ordination to overcome future epidemic threats.</p>
