<p id="p0195">Pre-clinical development is a complex, multi-step, and time-consuming process (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). It requires that vaccine candidates undergo strain development and confirmation of antigen presentation, verified by animal studies. This is followed by process development to ensure that a scalable, robust, and GMP compliant manufacturing process is created. Material generated at the end of pre-clinical development can be used for animal toxicology studies and forms the basis of a clinical trial application.
