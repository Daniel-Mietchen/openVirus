<p id="p0200">The first bottleneck encountered is in strain development. Some development work can occur using a research cell bank, however research cell banks are generally not to GMP standards therefore delays at later stages can be avoided by ensuring banks are GMP compliant. This will often require re-cloning into traceable cell lines that are GMP certified and free of any adventitious agent.</p>
