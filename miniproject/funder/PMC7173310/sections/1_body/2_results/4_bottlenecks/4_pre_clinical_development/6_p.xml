<p id="p0215">GMP manufacturing is an infrastructure bottleneck that requires funders and policy makers to examine the pressures upon the current manufacturing model. Almost all vaccine manufacturers operate at capacity and are dedicated to production of a single product. ‘Step-in’ rights in an emergency scenario will disrupt supply of an essential vaccine, but also cause delay. Recruiting a CMO to the task may help to alleviate the situation, but essential training and know-how is required. Furthermore, some sites may only be suitable for certain vaccines classes, which can range from protein sub-unit vaccines to live viral and bacterial vaccines. Based on vaccine class, facilities may not have the appropriate containment level for bulk manufacture of the drug substance, or the fill-finish for drug product. Indeed, many facilities do not have fill-finish operations co-located and fill-finish is also a bottleneck in clinical development due to the limited number of appropriate sites and the volume of vials required for Phase 2 and 3 trials.</p>
