<p id="p0205">Major bottlenecks are around Process Development to create a scalable, GMP compliant, manufacturing process and the determination of the critical process parameters. At this stage manufacturers must address if the vaccine can in fact be manufactured in a scalable process. There is no generic manufacturing process for vaccines, thus almost all processes are designed from the bottom up, which adds costs and delays to any future intervention plan. Platform manufacturing technologies are a method to overcome this issue by streamlining manufacturing with generic operations into which your selected antigen(s) can be introduced. Viral vectors are one such platform technology that was effectively employed during the Ebola outbreak

 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Other advances in nucleic acid based vaccines, such as DNA and RNA, offer a future, though as yet unrealised potential, for generic manufacturing and release testing of vaccines. The determination of the range of physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological properties that ensure the quality of the desired product, is described as ‘Critical Quality Attributes’ (CQA) and requires well-defined analytics which in the long term can reduce Quality Control (QC) costs. Finding suitable analytics that can resolve complex antigen structure, increase understanding of degradation pathways and formulation needs is a continuing bottleneck. Funders must ensure that process development, manufacturing, and analytics are not overlooked in future research calls.
