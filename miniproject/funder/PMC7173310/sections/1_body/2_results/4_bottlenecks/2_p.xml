<p id="p0180">Iterative workshops hosted ongoing discussion on what was involved in each step, and where might rate limiting steps slow down development. There was agreement that almost anything could be described as a bottleneck in that each step is necessary, and by the nature of discovery research and development, such endeavours take time. However, in order to scrutinize the bottlenecks that could potentially be ameliorated by corrective action or investments by governments, research funders and policy makers, WG3 agreed that the tool should only identify steps where corrective action could be taken that could potentially accelerate vaccine development. The main bottlenecks and the corrective action required are summarised in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . An additional important consideration, was that the identification of these bottleneck ‘nodes’ should be sufficiently generic so as to be applied to a range of vaccine types, and pathogens – thus WG3 refined the key steps to common denominators that were shared across approaches. Overall, many of the bottlenecks focused around gaps in funding for scientific knowledge, training, and infrastructure. An additional item was harmonisation of regulation, especially with regards to the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The bottlenecks can readily be seen on the process map by clicking ‘show bottlenecks’ on each map page; below we describe the main bottlenecks highlighted at each stage.
