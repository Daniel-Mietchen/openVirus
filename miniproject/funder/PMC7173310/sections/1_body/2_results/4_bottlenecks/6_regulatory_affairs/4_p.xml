<p id="p0275">In the case of life-threatening infections, it is conceivable that many of the priority vaccines under development will ultimately never undergo the standard clinical trials process and be used in an outbreak situation under EUAL 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In these circumstances, it is imperative to test novel vaccine candidates in well characterised animal models. Previously applied to defence vaccines due to the limitations of clinical testing, the FDA Animal rule 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> may provide a pathway to test novel vaccine candidates. In outbreak settings, as was the case with Ebola, it is possible to undertake an emergency use protocol and expedite authorisation to ensure a promising vaccine candidate can be deployed for human use, if it is justified as major interest for public health and/or therapeutic innovation.
