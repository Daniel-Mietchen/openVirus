<p id="p0240">The process mapping tool emphasises the importance of ethical and regulatory considerations throughout the entire process, as the iterative workshops continually highlighted the importance of early engagement so the appropriate advice and input shape the R&amp;D. The tool provides an overview and signposting to other organisations and information sources, as many outbreak vaccines may never go through market authorisation due to there being no commercial incentive for the manufacturers. Nevertheless, there will be several stages where necessary approvals must be obtained in order to proceed with developing and testing a candidate. For regular marketing authorization in the EU, vaccine developers must provide a full development dataset of pre-clinical and clinical trial results to evidence Clinical Safety and Efficacy, as well as evaluation of a positive benefit-risk ratio. The mapping tool highlights that:
