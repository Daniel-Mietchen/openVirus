<p id="p0230">Obtaining Regulatory Approval may be especially difficult in the context of an international trial, where local rules may differ from country to country, or the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) itself may have insufficient experience and seek expert opinions, which can further delay the process. Engagement with the NRA at an early stage is essential, as seeking opinion on the proposed trial design can capture any ‘in country’ requirements. The availability of trial sites may also impede progress; particularly if sites are not approved to work with GMO vaccines, or there are other limitations such as lack of infrastructure, skilled personnel, and capacity. Working with credible and experienced partners will help to minimise delay and several clinical trial networks already exists to facilitate clinical development, some of which are pathogen specific that can further minimise this bottleneck.</p>
