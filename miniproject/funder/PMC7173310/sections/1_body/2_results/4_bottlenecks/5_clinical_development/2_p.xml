<p id="p0225">Many of the priority pathogens are prone to sporadic outbreaks, and due to potential lethality, it will not be possible to conduct full Phase 3 trials, and even Phase 2 studies may prove challenging in a human population due to the unpredictable nature of these outbreaks. Nonetheless, the sequential clinical trial steps that would comprise the ‘normal’ steps in development of a vaccine being taken forward for licensure have been incorporated into the tool. Clinical trials require great investment and resource to execute, and the lengthy nature of the process could itself be described as a bottleneck; for the purposes of the tool however, we highlight fives steps within clinical development. Current GMO regulations do not distinguish vaccines based on viral vectors, or live, replication incompetent vectors based on bacteria and viruses. Current regulation stipulates that use of GMO vaccines is done so under ‘contained use’ or ‘deliberate release’ protocols to prevent release into the environment. Consequently, this may involve obtaining separate approvals, modifications to the trial site, modified procedures for sterilising, administering and disposing, separate storage facilities and special training of staff to handle GMOs. Overall, this whole area would benefit a revision of regulations and derogating the use of common vaccine vectors in separate regulations from the currently applicable GMO guidance would have a substantial beneficial impact in speeding up approvals.</p>
