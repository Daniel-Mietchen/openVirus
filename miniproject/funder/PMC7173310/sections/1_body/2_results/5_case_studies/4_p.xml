<p id="p0290">More bottlenecks were identified when applying the Vaccine Development Process Map to a novel Zika vaccine. At the time of the UKVN formation, Zika was little heard of, and had only modest investment as a potential emerging virus in UK research funding portfolios. As the work of the UKVN progressed, the Zika outbreak unfolded, and funders in the UK and internationally were mobilised to increase investments. The UKVN immediately added Zika to the priority pathogen list, and contributed to a number of funding streams to support vaccine R&amp;D. Applying the process mapping tool to such an emerging pathogen, allowed the visualisation of the significant number of unknowns and challenges when dealing with a little-known emerging disease without platform approaches (

Without a robust set of assays and generation of some antigen in the early discovery phase, the bottleneck would be overcome however identification of the surrogate/correlate of protection in the appropriate challenge models will be important. It should be noted that many vaccines have launched without the establishment of correlates of protection and will depend on the licensure sought and the severity of the disease and its outbreak.
