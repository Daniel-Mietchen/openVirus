<p id="p0295">In pre-clinical development, due to the novelty of the vaccine, process development, assays, adjuvantisation and formulations were identified as bottlenecks. Time could be saved if a platform technology was used for this vaccine, circumventing many steps in process development and formulation. In clinical development, deploying a human challenge model to study the response to a vaccine studies were considered rate-limiting, and it must be noted that in the case of emergency or experimental licensure, a strategy might be to establish some animal challenge data and seek to establish safety data in a Phase 1 trial before expansion into a Phase 2a/b trial. However, demonstrating efficacy can only be one in endemic or outbreak situations and will require early engagement of the NRA, and locating suitable overseas trial sites has the potential to be rate-limiting.</p>
