<p id="p0285">MERS was selected as there are several candidates in later stages of development, including the viral vectored vaccine candidate ChAdOx1 MERS. The viral vector approach overcomes a number of bottlenecks to speed up development, mainly impacting on the preclinical development stages to overcome delays that would be associated with masterseed bank production, pre-formulation work/

 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and lead identification. Antigen identification bottlenecks are also overcome, through straightforward selection of the spike protein (the major external antigen of coronaviruses) which elicits neutralising antibodies to the receptor binding domain 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The bottlenecks that remains relevant from the generic tool are: basic understanding of human/livestock host immunology; using an appropriate animal challenge model (camels would be suitable, but few places have facilities for such a large model); and the three main bottlenecks in clinical development of obtaining ethical and regulatory approval, working with vaccines classified as GMOs, as the viral vector platform has been altered genetically from its original form, and the availability of overseas trial sites.
