<p id="p0300">A plague vaccine potentially has dual application: the development path could be in collaboration with government agencies in producing an anti-bioterror vaccine but could be expanded and developed as a vaccine against endemic disease in regions such as Madagascar. This dual nature affects the way we think about the TPP and development path. As with the MERS case study the Plague Vaccine exploited a platform technology – Prokarium’s Vaxonella platform – thus many bottlenecks, particularly in preclinical development, were circumvented (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The main bottlenecks are in the clinical phase and animal rule regulations necessary to follow for licensure and are particular to this pathogen and vaccine approach, and included: Quality control; Phase II regulatory requirements for two animal models; Fill Finish; and in Phase II safety studies, meeting requirements for licensure regulations.
