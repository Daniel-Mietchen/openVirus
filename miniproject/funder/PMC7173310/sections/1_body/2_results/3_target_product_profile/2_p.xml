<p id="p0175">The Target Product Profile (TPP) is a descriptive document that sets out clear parameters for the characteristics of the desired end product, its intended use, and market. It is the designated entry point into the process map. This came about through repetitive discussions that prevailed on the importance of the TPP at all stages in development; in simple terms, to know what it is you are making, and for whom. WG3 agreed that the significance of the TPP and the relevance to even the earliest exploratory basic science work, should not be underestimated, therefore prominently placing the TPP, aimed to engage early discovery scientists to consider what the end product is, and how the choices made during pre-clinical discovery and development influence them. The consensus opinion within the working group was that the TPP should be seen as a strategic planning document that should be utilised as a benchmark as data emerges. During normal development, this is a tool for novel vaccine creation. However, in an outbreak situation, the TPP acts as an essential checklist under accelerated timescales. It is worth noting that that the importance of TPPs is widely shared and recent work by the WHO and CEPI includes creating standard TPPs for priority pathogens.</p>
