<p id="p0160">After initial literature consultations, a basic schematic overview of the major steps was created, which then fell into four main areas: (i) pre-clinical discovery; (ii) pre-clinical development; (iii) manufacturing; and (iv) clinical trials. Several subgroups were convened to discuss these areas; membership was drawn from the UKVN, a core group of specialists that made up WG3 and further expertise consulted according to need. Process schematics were made, and members undertook interactive discussions to add in, remove, and reorganise steps. The UKVN Secretariat led on organising a series of iterative workshops that repeated this process several times; each time a skills gap analysis was carried out to ensure appropriate expertise was representing different disease/vaccine interests, and from across the vaccine sector from academic and industry discovery, development, regulation, manufacturing and clinical trials. The repeated process of interactive mapping, refinement of core documents, and presentation of progress back to the subgroups stimulated dialogue on the map as a whole. This was a concerted effort to break down silos between disciplines and sectors, and address how choices made in early discovery may affect the later development pathway.</p>
