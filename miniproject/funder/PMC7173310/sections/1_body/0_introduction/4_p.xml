<p id="p0120">As the Ebola epidemic worsened, the availability of small vaccine stockpiles, taken together with the threat of further spread, catalysed stakeholder engagement to test the vaccine in humans to determine safety for potential deployment. Researchers, industrialists, regulators, and funders worked together to expedite the process of carrying out first-in-man trials of the Ebola vaccine

In the case of Ebola, it was fortuitous that several candidate vaccines were already in development and immense global efforts made the vaccine available. However, this also conspicuously highlighted that nations around the world need to be better prepared for outbreaks of all infectious diseases, particularly those with the potential for high levels of morbidity and mortality, and that other measures to control infection spread should also be implemented
