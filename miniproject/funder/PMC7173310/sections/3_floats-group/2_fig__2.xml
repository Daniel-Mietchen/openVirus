  <p>Pre-clinical simplified development map. This map summarises the main bottlenecks in pre-clinical development following lead candidate identification. The target product profile is re-evaluated during this process to ensure it correctly reflects manufacturing data, and developers are encouraged to liaise with regulatory bodies and ensure early input at any relevant stage.</p>
