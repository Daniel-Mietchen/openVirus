  <p>Zika case study summary. As a relatively neglected pathogen until recently, much of the bottlenecks identified are in the pre-clinical discovery phase, which requires antigen identification and development of assays and challenge models. The need for a new vaccine also incurs bottlenecks in the pre-clinical development phase and in clinical development.</p>
