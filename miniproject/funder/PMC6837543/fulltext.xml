Health and climate sectors have partnered to co-develop climate services to improve the management of emerging arboviral diseases such as dengue fever, for example, through the development of climate-driven early warning systems. The objective of this study was to identify health and climate stakeholder perceptions and needs in the Caribbean, with respect to the development of climate services for arboviruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Stakeholders included public decision makers and practitioners from the climate and health sectors at the regional (Caribbean) level and from the countries of Dominica and Barbados. From April to June 2017, we conducted interviews (n = 41), surveys (n = 32), and national workshops with stakeholders. Survey responses were tabulated, and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative coding to identify responses by research topic, country/region, and sector.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Health practitioners indicated that their jurisdiction is currently experiencing an increased risk of arboviral diseases associated with climate variability, and most anticipated that this risk will increase in the future. National health sectors reported financial limitations and a lack of technical expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistics, and modeling, which constrained their ability to implement climate services for arboviruses. National climate sectors were constrained by a lack of personnel. Stakeholders highlighted the need to strengthen partnerships with the private sector, academia, and civil society. They identified a gap in local research on climate-arbovirus linkages, which constrained the ability of the health sector to make informed decisions. Strategies to strengthen the climate-health partnership included a top-down approach by engaging senior leadership, multi-lateral collaboration agreements, national committees on climate and health, and shared spaces of dialogue. Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate services for health operations to control arboviruses included climatic-health bulletins and an online GIS platform that would allow for regional data sharing and the generation of spatiotemporal epidemic forecasts. Stakeholders identified a 3-month forecast of arboviral illness as the optimal time frame for an epidemic forecast.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings support the creation of interdisciplinary and intersectoral &#x02018;communities of practice&#x02019; and the co-design of climate services for the Caribbean public health sector.

Extreme weather and climate events affect directly or indirectly most dimensions of human well being, including mental and physical health, food, housing, freshwater, and livelihoods. Climate-driven early warning systems (EWS) to predict epidemics of dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases can help nations to adapt to changing climate conditions. In this study we assessed climate and health sector stakeholder perceptions and needs to inform the development of a dengue EWS. Stakeholders identified capacity limitations (financial resources, trained personnel), and the need for local research on climate-arbovirus linkages to inform decision makers. They identified six key strategies for strengthening the partnership between the climate-health sectors, and they assessed the viability of public health actions that could be take in response to short (2 week), medium (3 month) and long-term (1 year) forecasts of dengue fever epidemics. The results of this study contribute to Caribbean efforts to develop climate services for health, a key adaptation strategy to reduce the health impacts of climate change.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000200</institution-id><institution>United States Agency for International Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AID-538-10-14-00001</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Royal Society</institution></funding-source><award-id>Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3939-7343</contrib-id><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was solicited by the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH) through the United States Agency for International Development&#x02019;s (USAID, Grant ID: AID-538-10-14-00001) Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean (BRCCC Programme: rcc.cimh.edu.bb/brccc) with funding made possible by the generous support of the American people.

Impacts include increased risk of communicable diseases, such as mosquito-borne arboviruses, and noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular complications associated with heat stress. SIDS face similar challenges&#x02014;small populations who are repeatedly exposed to extreme weather and climate events (e.g., droughts and tropical storms), limited global political power, reliance on imported goods, and difficulty preventing and responding to disasters due to resource constraints [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Caribbean SIDS will likely experience more extreme hydrometeorological events in the future due to climate change, thereby increasing the morbidity and mortality of climate-sensitive health events and increasing the associated social and economic costs.</p><p>Dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika fever are arboviral diseases transmitted by the <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Theses diseases among the top public health concerns in the Caribbean region [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2019, the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) issued an advisory for the possibility of a severe dengue epidemic [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], given a rise in dengue activity in Latin America, the increasing burden of arboviruses over the last number of years, and the large gap in time since the last dengue epidemic in the Caribbean region, which occurred in 2009. The Caribbean is the region of the Americas with the highest incidence of dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Vector control is the main public health intervention to prevent and control disease outbreaks through insecticide application, elimination of larval habitat sites, public education and community mobilization [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite these efforts, the annual number of dengue cases in the region increased from an estimated 136,000 to 811,000 cases between 1990 and 2013, with case estimates adjusted to account for underreporting [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. New tools and management strategies are urgently needed to increase the capacity of the public health sector to prevent and respond to arboviral disease outbreaks.</p><p>Changes in local climate can influence mosquito vector physiology and population dynamics, thereby affecting disease transmission. Warmer ambient temperatures increase the probability of arbovirus transmission by <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, with optimum transmission at 28.5&#x000b0;C; however, transmission is improbable in extreme heat (&#x0003e;34&#x000b0;C) [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both excess rainfall and drought conditions can potentially increase mosquito densities, depending on the characteristics of the built environment and anthropogenic water storage [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

These tools are known as <italic>climate services</italic>&#x02014;tailored products for a specific sector that allow decision makers and practitioners to manage the risks posed by climate variability and climate change.

Stakeholders from the climate sector were individuals involved in the development of climate services for the Caribbean region and managers/practitioners from NMHSs. Local leaders of the climate and health sectors assisted in identifying initial interviewees. Subsequent interviewees were identified through snowball methodology, whereby interviewees were asked to identify 2&#x02013;3 additional stakeholders. We determined that we had effectively sampled all key stakeholders when no new names were identified; this was feasible given the relatively small size of the climate and health sectors in Dominica and Barbados.</p><p>A survey instrument was developed for health sector stakeholders.

We collected basic demographic information and tailored the questions to focus on health sector perceptions of climate variability and arbovirus risk factors, perceptions of the public health sector response to climate variability, current use of climate information, how they prefer to interact with and receive EWS information, the current strengths and weaknesses of their department with respect to the implementation of an arbovirus EWS, and their training needs. In the survey, we defined climate variability as, &#x0201c;short-term changes in climate that occurs over months, to seasons, to years. This variability is the result of natural, large-scale features of the climate, often related to El Ni&#x000f1;o or La Ni&#x000f1;a events. Examples include floods, multi-year or seasonal droughts, heat waves, hurricanes or tropical storms.&#x0201d;</p><p>Printed surveys were distributed to health sector stakeholders at national vector control, environmental health, and epidemiology offices, as well as those who participated in national workshops on the development of climate services for arboviruses in Barbados and Dominica in April 2017.

also asked to discuss climate and non-climate risk factors for arbovirus epidemics. They indicated that frequent (re)-introduction of viruses and vectors was associated with human movement between the islands due to trade and tourism. In Dominica, interviewees identified human movement between rural and urban areas as a risk factor. With respect to climate, interviewees identified the onset of the hot, rainy/wet season as a risk factor for arbovirus transmission, although they perceived that the linkages between rainfall and dengue fever have become less clear due to water storage practices. Two interviewees highlighted this contradiction,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;If the rain falls very heavily, within two weeks [we] expect to have an increase in number of cases.

Another risk factor was the national legislation requiring that all new buildings greater than 1,500 square feet have rainwater storage receptacles as a drought adaptation strategy; however, the receptacles had become potential <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> larval habitat. Interviewees indicated that the improper management of public utilities and infrastructure (e.g., telephone junction boxes, manhole covers, public wells, drains) had resulted in cryptic mosquito larval habitats that were difficult to locate and treat with larvicide during the wet season.</p><p>In Dominica, interviewees commented that water storage had increased following Tropical Storm Erika in 2015. When the storm damaged the piped water systems, people began storing freshwater in 55-gallon drums around the home. This behavior continued despite repairs to water systems.

This included increased risk of morbidity due to the interaction of heat stress and diabetes associated with hotter days and nights, leptospirosis (<italic>Leptospira</italic> sp.) associated with flooding, and communicable diseases associated with relocation and crowding of people in shelters following tropical storms. Malnutrition was associated with droughts that reduced crop yields and warming ocean temperatures that caused fish kills. Respiratory problems (e.g., asthma) were associated with dry weather, dust and air pollution. Factors unique to Barbados included hypertension due to sea level rise and salt-water intrusion in the groundwater supply, reduced hygiene and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infections due to water scarcity and storage, skin cancer due to UV exposure, and water-borne diseases (e.g., gastroenteritis, <italic>Salmonella</italic>) associated with flooding. Factors unique to Dominica included loss of lives due to landslides associated with tropical storms, gastroenteritis associated with dry weather, and mental health morbidity in the elderly and other vulnerable populations who were relocated after tropical storms. One informant described the complex cascading impacts of climate on health,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;[During droughts] people are not able to go to their farms; they don&#x02019;t have food and their nutrition suffers.

Regional stakeholders mentioned the multi-lateral agreements recently signed amongst the CIMH, the CARPHA and other regional Caribbean agencies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007772.s001">S1 Text</xref> for details). Interviewees indicated that collaboration agreements would allow them to co-develop and co-deliver climate services for the health sector. The agreements signaled a strong commitment from institution directors and an understanding of mutual benefit.</p><p>Fourth, they suggested that national committees on climate and health be established to specify the work that would be done jointly, the roles of each partner, a timeline for an operational plan, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) with a framework for communication, and reporting guidelines. Development of data sharing protocols between the climate and health sectors was identified as a priority given the sensitivity of sharing health information.</p><p>Fifth, interviewees indicated the importance of creating shared spaces for dialogue between the climate and health sectors, such as regional and national climate and health forums. An interviewee from the regional climate sector stated,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;Just sitting with people in the sectors makes such a big difference&#x02026; Understand them, what drives them, what are their needs?

Interviewees from the Barbados NMHS indicated that they had limited experience with climate research, and that this was an area that they were interested in expanding. National health sector interviewees displayed a high level of field experience and local knowledge but indicated that they had little knowledge of local empirical studies that could inform their decision-making and planning processes. As stated by one regional health sector interviewee,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;We want more evidence-based decision-making.

Two thirds of respondents indicated they had received general information on the effects of climate on vector borne diseases, and half of the respondents confirmed that climate information was used for some level of planning for disease and vector control interventions. They were unsure as to whether an EWS for arboviruses existed in their jurisdiction, but most indicated that climate information was not part of existing epidemiological warning systems.</p><p>National and regional interviewees confirmed that the arbovirus alert systems in Dominica and Barbados were based solely on epidemiological surveillance. The health sector and PAHO issue an alert when the number of reported cases surpasses a pre-determined threshold established by the historical average for the same week or month (see Lowe et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for details). They indicated that the current system did not provide sufficient lead-time to effectively reduce the threat of an epidemic.</p><p>National interviewees described the current use of climate information for arbovirus control. The health sector considers wet/dry seasons and extreme climate events when planning vector control programs, for example, by increasing larviciding efforts at the onset of the wet season or increasing community campaigns on safe water-storage during droughts. Occasionally, the health sector requests climate data from their NMHS (typically shared as Excel files). However, the health sector does not formally incorporate climate information, such as seasonal climate forecasts, into their planning process. Overall, climate information was reported to play a minor role in decision-making, which was instead driven by policies, regulations, and specific competencies of the organizations.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Forecast scenarios</title><p>At the national workshop in Barbados, health and climate stakeholders were asked to identify the interventions they would implement if they were provided with short (two week), medium (three month) and long-term (one year) forecasts of vector abundance and dengue incidence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007772.s003">S3 Text</xref>). They unanimously stated that disease incidence forecasts would be more effective than vector forecasts in garnering the political attention necessary to mobilize resources to implement preventative interventions. With a short-term forecast, the health sector would increase education, community mobilization, and larval source reduction, especially in known hotspots. With a medium-term forecast, the health sector would be better able to plan with stakeholders, mobilize the field team, look at trends, and create bulletins for community mobilization. With a long-term forecast the health sector could better lobby with health sector leadership and the Minister of Finance for the needed financial support, allowing for more effective budgeting. They would be able to monitor and evaluate interventions and conduct a needs assessment to inform planning. They would also be able to procure diagnostic reagents and supplies for the national reference laboratory, a process that can take up to six months in Barbados. Although the workshop participants identified meaningful interventions at each time scale, they preferred the three-month forecast as indicated in the following,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;A year can feel like a long time away.

The top responses were a climate and health bulletin (91%), an interactive GIS platform (66%) and internal meetings within their departments (59%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007772.s008">S4 Table</xref>). Interviewees were also asked to identify climate services that would improve their day-to-day work related to arboviruses. National health sector interviewees confirmed that they were interested in utilizing the Caribbean Health Climatic Bulletin launched in 2017 by the CIMH, the CARPHA and the PAHO. The bulletin qualitatively summarizes potential health impacts for a three-month period based on seasonal climate forecasts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rcc.cimh.edu.bb/health-bulletin-archive/">https://rcc.cimh.edu.bb/health-bulletin-archive/</ext-link>). Health sector interviewees also reiterated that a GIS platform would allow them to integrate, analyze, and visualize real-time information on vectors and disease risk in relation to rainfall, temperature, and other meteorological variables. Wind speed and wind direction forecasts were also identified as useful information to inform insecticide fogging operations. Regional stakeholders highlighted the importance of creating a multi-country health and climate data repository that would allow for a regional epidemic EWS. National interviewees summarized the health sector needs in the following,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;We need it [climate services] packaged in such a way that the health professional would understand.

Our study confirms that an arbovirus EWS would benefit the Caribbean health sector&#x02013;a region that is highly vulnerable to extreme hydrometeorolgical events and arboviral disease outbreaks. However, we found that the development of climate services for arboviral diseases will require stronger partnerships, strengthening of local capacities, and greater investment in local research on climate-health linkages. Our findings are echoed by Huang et al [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], who emphasize that health sector adaptation to climate change requires both the implementation of adaptation actions (e.g., climate-driven EWS for arboviruses) and adaptive-capacity building.</p><p>In this study we identified strategies and opportunities to initiate a successful process of joint collaboration between the climate and health sectors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007772.s004">S4 Text</xref>). This partnership is critical to ensure commitment and ownership by different stakeholders and end-users as climate services are developed. We found that the sustainability of these initiatives will require the political will to establish climate services for health as a mandate in the NMHS and health sectors, allowing them to work in interdisciplinary teams. Beyond the climate and health sectors, we identified a complex web of institutional actors who can engage strategically in the development of climate services for health. This finding highlights the importance of intersectoral collaborations, a key element of Integrated Vector Management for arbovirus control [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>We found that health sector stakeholders demonstrated concern, awareness and a high-level understanding of the impacts of climate variability on arboviruses and health in general. People from the health sector identified an increased risk of arboviral diseases associated with climate variability. In this region, climate variability is associated with droughts and tropical storms; interviewees identified both as having the potential to increase the risk of arboviral disease outbreaks, as confirmed in prior research [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With an increasing number of potential arboviral disease threats [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] (dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro) and emerging insecticide resistance [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] in <italic>Ae, aegypti</italic>, it is possible that health stakeholders perceived that extreme hydrometeorological events and warmer temperatures may have a greater epidemiological impact today and in the future than in the past, when dengue was the only known arbovirus in circulation. It is also possible that survey respondents intermixed the concepts of climate variability and climate change.</p><p>Prior studies suggest that climate-health awareness has increased in the Caribbean over time. Earlier studies found that there was limited knowledge about climate and health linkages amongst nurses and doctors in private and public sectors [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. More recent studies in the Caribbean confirm a relatively high level of awareness and concern amongst health-care providers [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], similar to studies in the U.S. [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Several capacity building initiatives undertaken by regional health institutions have likely contributed to higher levels of climate-health awareness over time.</p><p>Our results also highlight the importance of considering non-climatic drivers of arbovirus epidemics (e.g., human movement, insecticide resistance, and community mobilization), which were perceived to be as important or more important than climate factors in determining arbovirus outbreaks. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of human movement in propagating arbovirus transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], including in island settings [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Insecticide resistance in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is a major challenges for the health sector, given their reliance on chemical control to reduce disease transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and lack of regulation of private vector control companies in Barbados. Community mobilization for arbovirus control is an ongoing challenge throughout dengue-endemic regions [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], requiring a nuanced understanding of local community perceptions and behavior [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Following several years of arbovirus epidemic alerts, Caribbean communities may experience message fatigue [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and be less responsive to future epidemic alerts. While community perceptions and communication were beyond the scope of this study, these elements should be considered in the development of an EWS.</p><p>Despite high levels of awareness, our findings suggest that the climate and health sectors do not feel ready to develop and implement an EWS or other adaptation measures due to limited institutional capacity (resources and expertise). This was also found in prior studies of health care professionals in the U.S. and Canada [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Health stakeholders stressed the need to increase analytical capabilities, such as GIS skills. User-friendly analytic tools/instruments that combine health and climate information could be developed for the health sector for use in routine reporting activities. We found that the national climate sectors (NMHSs) also faced severe capacity limitations. Prior studies have noted the embryonic status of the application of climate science in the Caribbean health sector [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with only one NMHS offering specialized climate information services for the health sector [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The capacity of NMHSs is especially limited in SIDS like Barbados and Dominica [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In recent research, representatives from the NMHSs recommended transitioning from a designation of NMHS to become &#x0201c;National Climate Services Centers (NCSC),&#x0201d; which would facilitate the development of climate services at the national level [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Our results confirm that climate information is neither routinely applied nor used in planning arbovirus/vector interventions in Barbados or Dominica, notwithstanding major advances in climate science and climate-health research globally. The operational co-production of tools and products, such as the quarterly Caribbean Health Climatic Bulletin is a noteworthy first step. The bulletin includes qualitative expert statements on probable health risks associated with seasonal climate forecasts (three months ahead). However, there is significant scope for the development of the next generation of climate services that focus on quantitative probabilistic forecasts of disease risk [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One of the most promising examples of a climate-driven dengue forecast model framework was recently described by Lowe et al. for Barbados [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The study found that dengue transmission in Barbados increased one month after a particularly wet month and five months after a drought event was observed, and the model was able to accurately predict outbreak versus non-outbreak months. Seasonal climate forecasts routinely produced by the CIMH could be incorporated in the model framework as an early warning tool. This could help the health sector to plan interventions that mitigate the impact of mosquito-borne disease epidemics in the region up to three months in advance&#x02014;the ideal window of prediction identified by study participants.</p><sec id="sec028"><title>Limitations</title><p>When comparing the results of this study to prior studies on health sector perceptions of climate, one key difference is that our study focused on people working with arboviruses, environmental health, and climate, whereas other studies focused on health-care providers or public health professionals in general. However, given the relatively small size of the health sector in Barbados and Dominica, we interacted with most senior leadership in interviews and national consultations, in particular those involved with overall management of the public health sector, epidemiological programs, environment, climate change and health. Although we did consider a regional perspective, the results of this study may not be generalizable to all of the Caribbean. Country-level studies should be conducted to capture the nuances of local governance structures, disease epidemiology, and climate.</p><p>Our results were skewed towards the health sector perspective rather than the climate sector, given that more health sector stakeholders were interviewed, and only health sector stakeholders were surveyed. In part, this reflected that there were many more people working in the national health sectors than in the national climate sectors. On the climate side, our results were skewed towards the regional perspective, given that regional stakeholders had more experience with climate services for health.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study provide recommendations to enhance an interdisciplinary dialogue and partnership within an active community of practitioners, decision makers, and scientists [<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].
