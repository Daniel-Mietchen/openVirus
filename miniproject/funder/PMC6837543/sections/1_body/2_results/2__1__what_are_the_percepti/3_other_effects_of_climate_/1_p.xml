<p>Interviewees identified other ways that climate affected health in their jurisdiction. This included increased risk of morbidity due to the interaction of heat stress and diabetes associated with hotter days and nights, leptospirosis (
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> sp.) associated with flooding, and communicable diseases associated with relocation and crowding of people in shelters following tropical storms. Malnutrition was associated with droughts that reduced crop yields and warming ocean temperatures that caused fish kills. Respiratory problems (e.g., asthma) were associated with dry weather, dust and air pollution. Factors unique to Barbados included hypertension due to sea level rise and salt-water intrusion in the groundwater supply, reduced hygiene and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infections due to water scarcity and storage, skin cancer due to UV exposure, and water-borne diseases (e.g., gastroenteritis, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>) associated with flooding. Factors unique to Dominica included loss of lives due to landslides associated with tropical storms, gastroenteritis associated with dry weather, and mental health morbidity in the elderly and other vulnerable populations who were relocated after tropical storms. One informant described the complex cascading impacts of climate on health,
