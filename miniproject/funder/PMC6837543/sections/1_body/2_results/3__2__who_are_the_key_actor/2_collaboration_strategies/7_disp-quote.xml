 <p>“Just sitting with people in the sectors makes such a big difference… Understand them, what drives them, what are their needs? Because we might think they need something they don’t… Sometimes it’s about forgetting yourself and putting yourself in the other person’s shoes to really figure out what the need is about. That’s true engagement.”</p>
