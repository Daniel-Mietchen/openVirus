<p>Regional interviewees recommended conducting case studies or demonstration projects to generate local evidence on climate-health linkages. They suggested focusing these investigations and interventions at the medium-term (climate variability) time scale (e.g., seasonal variation, year-to-year variation in extreme climate events), rather than the long-term (climate change) time scale. Interviewees highlighted that a collaborative research process with investigators from the climate and health sectors would facilitate data sharing, build trust, and foment a culture of research on climate and health.</p>
