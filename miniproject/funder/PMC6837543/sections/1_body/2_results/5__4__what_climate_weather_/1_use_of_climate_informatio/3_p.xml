<p>National interviewees described the current use of climate information for arbovirus control. The health sector considers wet/dry seasons and extreme climate events when planning vector control programs, for example, by increasing larviciding efforts at the onset of the wet season or increasing community campaigns on safe water-storage during droughts. Occasionally, the health sector requests climate data from their NMHS (typically shared as Excel files). However, the health sector does not formally incorporate climate information, such as seasonal climate forecasts, into their planning process. Overall, climate information was reported to play a minor role in decision-making, which was instead driven by policies, regulations, and specific competencies of the organizations.</p>
