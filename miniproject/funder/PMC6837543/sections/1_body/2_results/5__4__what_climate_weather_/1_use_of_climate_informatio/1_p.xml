 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007772.s007">S3 Table</xref>). Two thirds of respondents indicated they had received general information on the effects of climate on vector borne diseases, and half of the respondents confirmed that climate information was used for some level of planning for disease and vector control interventions. They were unsure as to whether an EWS for arboviruses existed in their jurisdiction, but most indicated that climate information was not part of existing epidemiological warning systems.
