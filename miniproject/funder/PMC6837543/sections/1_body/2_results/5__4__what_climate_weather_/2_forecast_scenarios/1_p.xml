They unanimously stated that disease incidence forecasts would be more effective than vector forecasts in garnering the political attention necessary to mobilize resources to implement preventative interventions. With a short-term forecast, the health sector would increase education, community mobilization, and larval source reduction, especially in known hotspots. With a medium-term forecast, the health sector would be better able to plan with stakeholders, mobilize the field team, look at trends, and create bulletins for community mobilization. With a long-term forecast the health sector could better lobby with health sector leadership and the Minister of Finance for the needed financial support, allowing for more effective budgeting. They would be able to monitor and evaluate interventions and conduct a needs assessment to inform planning. They would also be able to procure diagnostic reagents and supplies for the national reference laboratory, a process that can take up to six months in Barbados. Although the workshop participants identified meaningful interventions at each time scale, they preferred the three-month forecast as indicated in the following,
