<p>Small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean region are highly susceptible to the health impacts of climate variability and long-term changes in climate [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Impacts include increased risk of communicable diseases, such as mosquito-borne arboviruses, and noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular complications associated with heat stress. SIDS face similar challengesâ€”small populations who are repeatedly exposed to extreme weather and climate events (e.g., droughts and tropical storms), limited global political power, reliance on imported goods, and difficulty preventing and responding to disasters due to resource constraints [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Caribbean SIDS will likely experience more extreme hydrometeorological events in the future due to climate change, thereby increasing the morbidity and mortality of climate-sensitive health events and increasing the associated social and economic costs.
