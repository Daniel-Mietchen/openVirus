<p>Stakeholders from the health and climate sectors ideally play a central role in the development and implementation of a forecast model through an iterative engagement process with modelers and other scientists [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] report insightful lessons learned as scientists who attempt to communicate flood risk to the public sector. They state, “Decision makers are not a coherent entity, but a collection of individuals, each of whom uses different information to address different goals in a unique context.” Climate services should be developed with a realistic understanding of the present-day public sector capacity, which may be constrained by resources, information, prior experiences, and other actors or institutions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The GFCS aims for stakeholder engagement between health and climate actors at all levels to promote the effective use of climate information within health research, policy and practice [
