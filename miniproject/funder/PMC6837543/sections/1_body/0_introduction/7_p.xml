<p>Prior studies have focused on health sector perceptions of the effects of climate change and variability on overall health but have not assessed their perceptions of the potential role of climate services. Studies from the United States and Canada analyzed the perceptions and engagement of public health practitioners in the context of long-term climate change and impacts on health in general [
