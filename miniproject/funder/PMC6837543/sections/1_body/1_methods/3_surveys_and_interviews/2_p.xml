<p>A survey instrument was developed for health sector stakeholders. Questions were informed by prior large-scale surveys of health practitioner perceptions of climate change impacts on health conducted in the United States, called “Are We Ready?” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as well as studies by Paterson et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Gould and Rudolf [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We collected basic demographic information and tailored the questions to focus on health sector perceptions of climate variability and arbovirus risk factors, perceptions of the public health sector response to climate variability, current use of climate information, how they prefer to interact with and receive EWS information, the current strengths and weaknesses of their department with respect to the implementation of an arbovirus EWS, and their training needs. In the survey, we defined climate variability as, “short-term changes in climate that occurs over months, to seasons, to years. This variability is the result of natural, large-scale features of the climate, often related to El Niño or La Niña events. Examples include floods, multi-year or seasonal droughts, heat waves, hurricanes or tropical storms.”
