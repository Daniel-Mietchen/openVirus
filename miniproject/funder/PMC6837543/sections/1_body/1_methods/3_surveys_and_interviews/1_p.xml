<p>We collected data from key stakeholders from the climate and health sectors spanning senior leadership, managers, and expert practitioners. Stakeholders from the health sector were engaged in arbovirus epidemiology, vector control, or environmental health, at national and regional (Caribbean) agencies. Stakeholders from the climate sector were individuals involved in the development of climate services for the Caribbean region and managers/practitioners from NMHSs. Local leaders of the climate and health sectors assisted in identifying initial interviewees. Subsequent interviewees were identified through snowball methodology, whereby interviewees were asked to identify 2â€“3 additional stakeholders. We determined that we had effectively sampled all key stakeholders when no new names were identified; this was feasible given the relatively small size of the climate and health sectors in Dominica and Barbados.</p>
