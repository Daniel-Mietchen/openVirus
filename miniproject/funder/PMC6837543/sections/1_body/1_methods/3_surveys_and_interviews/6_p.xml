<p>During the Barbados national workshop, we conducted an exercise where health (n = 21) and climate sector (n = 6) participants were divided into small groups that included representatives from both sectors. Groups were asked to respond to different forecast scenarios (2-week, 3 month, and 1-year forecasts of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> larval indices and dengue incidence). They were asked to identify the actions that they would take in response to alerts at each time scale, and they discussed the utility of the different forecasts. As with interviews, responses were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded.
