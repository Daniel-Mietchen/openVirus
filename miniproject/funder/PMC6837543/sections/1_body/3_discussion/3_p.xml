<p>We found that health sector stakeholders demonstrated concern, awareness and a high-level understanding of the impacts of climate variability on arboviruses and health in general. People from the health sector identified an increased risk of arboviral diseases associated with climate variability. In this region, climate variability is associated with droughts and tropical storms; interviewees identified both as having the potential to increase the risk of arboviral disease outbreaks, as confirmed in prior research [

 <italic>Ae, aegypti</italic>, it is possible that health stakeholders perceived that extreme hydrometeorological events and warmer temperatures may have a greater epidemiological impact today and in the future than in the past, when dengue was the only known arbovirus in circulation. It is also possible that survey respondents intermixed the concepts of climate variability and climate change.
