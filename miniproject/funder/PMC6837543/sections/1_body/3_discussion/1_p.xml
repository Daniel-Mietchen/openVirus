<p>A climate-informed epidemic EWS is a potentially powerful tool to guide public health decision making. Our study confirms that an arbovirus EWS would benefit the Caribbean health sectorâ€“a region that is highly vulnerable to extreme hydrometeorolgical events and arboviral disease outbreaks. However, we found that the development of climate services for arboviral diseases will require stronger partnerships, strengthening of local capacities, and greater investment in local research on climate-health linkages. Our findings are echoed by Huang et al [
