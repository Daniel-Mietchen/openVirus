<p>When comparing the results of this study to prior studies on health sector perceptions of climate, one key difference is that our study focused on people working with arboviruses, environmental health, and climate, whereas other studies focused on health-care providers or public health professionals in general. However, given the relatively small size of the health sector in Barbados and Dominica, we interacted with most senior leadership in interviews and national consultations, in particular those involved with overall management of the public health sector, epidemiological programs, environment, climate change and health. Although we did consider a regional perspective, the results of this study may not be generalizable to all of the Caribbean. Country-level studies should be conducted to capture the nuances of local governance structures, disease epidemiology, and climate.</p>
