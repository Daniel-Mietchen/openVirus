<p>Our results confirm that climate information is neither routinely applied nor used in planning arbovirus/vector interventions in Barbados or Dominica, notwithstanding major advances in climate science and climate-health research globally. The operational co-production of tools and products, such as the quarterly Caribbean Health Climatic Bulletin is a noteworthy first step. The bulletin includes qualitative expert statements on probable health risks associated with seasonal climate forecasts (three months ahead). However, there is significant scope for the development of the next generation of climate services that focus on quantitative probabilistic forecasts of disease risk [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The study found that dengue transmission in Barbados increased one month after a particularly wet month and five months after a drought event was observed, and the model was able to accurately predict outbreak versus non-outbreak months. Seasonal climate forecasts routinely produced by the CIMH could be incorporated in the model framework as an early warning tool. This could help the health sector to plan interventions that mitigate the impact of mosquito-borne disease epidemics in the region up to three months in advanceâ€”the ideal window of prediction identified by study participants.
