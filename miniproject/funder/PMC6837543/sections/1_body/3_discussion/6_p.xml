<p>Despite high levels of awareness, our findings suggest that the climate and health sectors do not feel ready to develop and implement an EWS or other adaptation measures due to limited institutional capacity (resources and expertise). This was also found in prior studies of health care professionals in the U.S. and Canada [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Health stakeholders stressed the need to increase analytical capabilities, such as GIS skills. User-friendly analytic tools/instruments that combine health and climate information could be developed for the health sector for use in routine reporting activities. We found that the national climate sectors (NMHSs) also faced severe capacity limitations. Prior studies have noted the embryonic status of the application of climate science in the Caribbean health sector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with only one NMHS offering specialized climate information services for the health sector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The capacity of NMHSs is especially limited in SIDS like Barbados and Dominica [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007772.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In recent research, representatives from the NMHSs recommended transitioning from a designation of NMHS to become “National Climate Services Centers (NCSC),” which would facilitate the development of climate services at the national level [
