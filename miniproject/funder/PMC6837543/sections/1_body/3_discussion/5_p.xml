<p>Our results also highlight the importance of considering non-climatic drivers of arbovirus epidemics (e.g., human movement, insecticide resistance, and community mobilization), which were perceived to be as important or more important than climate factors in determining arbovirus outbreaks. Prior studies have highlighted the importance of human movement in propagating arbovirus transmission [
