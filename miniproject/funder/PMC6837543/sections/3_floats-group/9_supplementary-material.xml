  <title>Forecast scenarios discussed in the Barbados stakeholder workshop.</title>
  <p>This activity was conducted at a national consultation at the PAHO in Bridgetown, Barbados, in April 2017, with 27 representatives from the national Ministry of Health and Wellness (MoH) of Barbados, the Barbados Meteorological Services, the CIMH, and the PAHO. Participants were divided into small groups that included representatives from climate and health sectors. Groups were asked to respond to different forecast scenarios (2-week, 3 month, and 1-year forecasts of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larval indices and dengue incidence). They were asked to identify the actions that they would take in response to alerts at each time scale, and they discussed the utility of a vector versus disease forecast. Results were identified by coding the transcripts of audio recordings.
