<p>Based on information on the reported MLN-like symptoms, including leaf mosaic, stunting, yellowing in leaf margins, and necrosis from agricultural extension agents, farms (
 <italic>n</italic> = 41) were selected for direct visual observation and sampling of infected maize plants. The farms were within villages stratified across the maize producing AEZs in Northern Tanzania (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00004-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Within each farm, plants with MLN-like symptoms were scouted in quadrants of one-hundred maize plants (three random quadrants of each quarter-acre of the farm). The mean of the counts of the symptomatic plants (%) was considered as the magnitude of the disease in the sampled farm. MLN prevalence across the villages within AEZs and the regions were compared based on the percentages of symptomatic plants in the sampled farms (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00004-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Consequently, maize leaf samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 223) of randomly selected plants containing viral-like symptoms were collected across the farms and dried in silica gel prior to laboratory analysis.
