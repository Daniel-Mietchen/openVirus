<p>Based on the results of the RT-PCR for MCMV, a subset of samples positive for MCMV from Kilimanjaro (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15), Arusha (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22), and Manyara (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) were selected for NGS characterization of the MLN causal viruses. The samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48) were used for the construction of sequence libraries using the Illumina TruSeq RNA library prep kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 0.5µg of RNA/sample was fragmented using the fragmentation mix (Elute, Prime, Fragment High Mix) followed by first strand and second strand cDNA synthesis. The double-stranded cDNA was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA) followed by end repair and adapters ligation. The ligated ds-cDNA was amplified in a PCR using universal and index primers. Resulting libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads. Libraries’ quality and quantity were assessed with the Agilent Tape Station 2200 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a Qubit™ fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), respectively. The libraries were then normalized to a concentration of 10nM, pooled, and diluted to a final concentration of 6.5 pM. Pooled libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq system at the BecA-ILRI Hub (Nairobi, Kenya) generating 151 paired-end reads.
