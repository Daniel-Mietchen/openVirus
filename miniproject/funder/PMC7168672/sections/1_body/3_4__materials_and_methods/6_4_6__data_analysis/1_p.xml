<p>The quality assessment of the sequence reads generated was performed using Fastqc v0.11.2 [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The FASTX_toolkit [
 <xref rid="B51-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and SolexaQA [
 <xref rid="B52-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] were used for the removal of adapters and poor quality sequences. De novo assembly of the reads was performed using Trinity v2.2.1 [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Assembled sequences were then blasted against a locally installed plant virus database using BLASTN 2.2.30+, TBLASTX 2.2.30+ [
 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Identities of the viruses present in each sample were visualized using Krona [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Reference mapping was performed for individual samples against the most similar reference genome downloaded from NCBI, using CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5.1 software (Qiagen, Germany).
