<p>Multiple sequence alignment of the viruses was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench 5.5.1 software. Nucleotide sequences of MCMV and SCMV coat proteins were used for phylogenetic analysis in Mega 6.0 [
 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], where a maximum likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] was used with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Sequences of MCMV, SCMV, and MSV were submitted to the GenBank using the BankIt sequence submission tool [
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].
