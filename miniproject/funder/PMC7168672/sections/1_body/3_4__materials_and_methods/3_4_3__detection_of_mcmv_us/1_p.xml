<p>All leaf samples collected were tested for the presence of MCMV using RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 223) using a ZR Plant RNA MinPrep
 <sup>TM</sup>kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) after homogenization using mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. The quality of RNA was checked using formamide-denatured agarose gel electrophoresis on 1x TAE [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and quantified using a Qubit™ 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed using the Maxima First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as per manufacturer’ s instructions, followed by PCR. Reactions consisted of 10 µL of 2x One Taq master mix with standard buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl, 1.8 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl, 22 mM KCl, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 5% glycerol, 0.06% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.05% Tween 20 and 25 U/mL One Taq DNA Polymerase] (New England Bio Labs, Ipswich, MA), 0.1 µL (10 µM) of the forward (5′-CGCGGCTGACAAGCAAAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACTGGTTGTTCCGGTCTTG-3′) targeting MCMV, 2 µL cDNA and 7.8 µL of sterile water for a final volume of 20 µL. The thermocycler conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 sec, annealing at 49.4 °C for 30 sec, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72 °C for 15 min. The PCR products were visualized under UV light on a stained (gel red) 1.2% agarose gel following electrophoresis.
