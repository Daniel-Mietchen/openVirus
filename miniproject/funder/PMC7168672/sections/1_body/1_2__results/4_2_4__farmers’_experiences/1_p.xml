<p>Farmers from different villages (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00004-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) across three regions in Northern Tanzania were interviewed about specific aspects regarding MLN. The majority of the interviewed farmers (98%) cultivated maize every cropping season in each year. Across the three regions, over half of the interviewed farmers (50%â€“78%) were aware of MLN symptoms. More than half of the farmers (52%) reported to have observed MLN for the first time in their farms in 2013. The occurrence of the disease across the Northern Tanzania regions was reported to be higher (71%) during the long rain seasons than in dry seasons (21%) and short rain seasons (8%). Less than half of the farmers in each region had observed the previously reported MLN vectors such as beetles, rootworms, aphids, and thrips in their farms. The majority of the farmers interviewed (87%) were using certified seeds; however, none of the cultivated varieties was resistant to the disease. Different methods were used by farmers to manage MLN, including rouging, insecticide application, fertilizer application, and weed elimination. However, the disease remained unmanaged.
