<p>Assembly of MSV sequences from samples collected in Arusha produced complete genome sequences (accessions MH667487 and MH667488). Comparison search of the full-length nucleotide sequence of MSV against the NCBI database indicated that the virus is very closely related to MSV isolates from Kenya, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe (accessions FJ882094.1, FJ882100.1 and AF329882.1) sharing 99% nucleotide sequence identity.</p>
