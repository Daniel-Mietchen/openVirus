<p>Assembly of SCMV genome for samples from different regions of Tanzania gave sequences ranging from 9482 to 9575 nt, which were deposited into NCBI with the following accession numbers: Arusha (MF467400, MF467401, MF467404, MF467393, MF467403, MF467402, and MF467399), Manyara (MF467398, and MF467397) and Kilimanjaro (MF467394, MF467395, and MF467396). These genomes are translated via a large polyprotein precursor containing ten mature proteins similar to other viruses of 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A comparison of the full-length nucleotide sequences of SCMV isolates from the current study with those that are publicly available at NCBI showed that the virus had a high nucleotide sequence identity (96%â€“99%) with the very virulent SCMV isolate BD8 from Hebei, China (JN021933.1). Phylogenetic analysis of the CP nucleotide sequences showed that SCMV signatures from the current study were closely related to an isolate from Kenya (JX286701.1) and isolate BD8 from Hebei-China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00004-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This shows that SCMV isolates from this study are highly similar, falling under the same genetic cluster (group I). Apart from the unique SCMV isolate from Kenya (JX286701.1), SCMV isolates from other African countries including Rwanda and Ethiopia did not cluster with SCMV isolates from this study.
