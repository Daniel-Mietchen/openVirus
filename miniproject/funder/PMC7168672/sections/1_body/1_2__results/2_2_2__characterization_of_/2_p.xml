<p>Complete genome sequences of MCMV detected in the current study were deposited into NCBI with the following accession numbers: Arusha (MF467384, MF467383, MF467374, MF467389, MF467380, MF467378, MF467381, and MF467375), Manyara (MF467382, MF467379, MF467390, and MF467377) and Kilimanjaro (MF467387, MF467386, MF467388, MF467391, MF467385, MF467392, and MF467376). The genomes were found to be between 4410 to 4432 nucleotides (nt) long with six open reading frames similar to other previously reported MCMV isolates [

 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Comparison search of the full-length nucleotide sequence against the NCBI database indicated that the virus is very closely related to MCMV isolates from eastern Africa (accession KP851970.3, KP798454.1, KP772217.1, KT250543.1, KT250546.1) sharing 99% nucleotide sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis of the coat protein (CP) nucleotide sequences of MCMV from this study and existing MCMV isolates showed that the MCMV CP sequences from Tanzania were highly similar to eastern African isolates but different from Nebraska [
