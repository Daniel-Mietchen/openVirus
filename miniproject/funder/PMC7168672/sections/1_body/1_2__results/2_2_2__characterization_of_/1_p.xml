<p>A total of 48 RNA libraries from maize samples with MLN symptoms (MCMV positive using RT-PCR) collected from Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara regions of northern Tanzania were constructed and sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform at the BecA-ILRI Hub in Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 46,361,174 clean reads with an average length of 17â€“122 bp were produced after removing adaptor sequences and low-quality reads. The reads were assembled and compared against a plant virus database using BLASTN+ and TBLASTX and the resulting data was visualized using Krona [

 <italic>Maize streak virus</italic> (MSV)
 <italic>, Maize dwarf mosaic virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sorghum mosaic virus</italic> (SrMV)
 <italic>, Maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV</italic> (MYDV)
 <italic>,</italic> and 
 <italic>Barley yellow dwarf virus</italic> (BYDV). Further analysis of de novo and reference assemblies showed that no artefacts were introduced during reference assembly, and sequences for MCMV, SCMV and MSV had significant genome coverage while the rest represented short sequence fragments. Co-infection by MCMV and SCMV were detected in 62% of the sequenced samples (
