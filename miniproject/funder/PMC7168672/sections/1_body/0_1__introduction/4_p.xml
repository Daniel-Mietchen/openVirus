<p>Initial reports of maize lethal necrosis problems in East Africa were based on experiences by farmers and agricultural extension agents, complemented with diagnostics of the disease by international research organizations [
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An accurate identification of MLN symptoms by the farmers can play a key role in preventing the spread of the disease, as they can mechanically remove the infected plants and/or apply pesticides to control the vectors. Furthermore, farmers can provide useful information about the occurrence and extent of the spread of this and other diseases [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To safeguard maize production and food security in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a need to conduct comprehensive research (etiological, epidemiological, and genetic studies) to facilitate the development of effective and sustainable MLN control measures. Recent advances in diagnostic technologies including next generation sequencing (NGS) tools have been useful for the identification of new viruses and their variants in infected plants [

 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The objectives of the current study are to contribute to the existing knowledge on the status of MLN in northern Tanzania by characterizing the causative viruses using NGS, to assess farmersâ€™ awareness and experiences on the spread and damage of MLN, to investigate the prevalence of MLN across villages within different agro-ecological zones, and to identify possible other viruses that co-infect maize.
