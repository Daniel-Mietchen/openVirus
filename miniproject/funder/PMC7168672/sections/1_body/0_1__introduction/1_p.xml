<p>Maize is the most important cereal crop and a staple food in sub-Saharan Africa. With over 5 million hectares of its land planted with this crop and a per capita consumption of 128 kg, Tanzania is one of the largest producers and consumers of maize in eastern and southern Africa [

 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite its importance, maize production is hindered by maize lethal necrosis (MLN), a devastating viral disease that is currently spreading at an alarming rate. The disease was first reported in the Southern Rift Valley region of Kenya in 2011 [

 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The disease is characterized by elongated yellow streaks parallel to leaf veins, chlorotic mottling, and necrosis [
