<p>The reported causative agents of MLN in eastern and central Africa are 
 <italic>Maize chlorotic mottle virus</italic> (MCMV) and 
 <italic>Sugarcane mosaic virus</italic> (SCMV) [
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,

 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. MCMV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Tombusviridae</italic> and has a genome size of 4.4 kb [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SCMV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic> and has a genome size of 9.6 kb [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. MCMV alone infects maize causing leaf mosaic and moderate stunting symptoms, while co-infection of maize by MCMV and SCMV results in more severe symptoms of stunting, necrosis, and eventually plant death [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Other viruses in the 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic> family such as 
 <italic>Wheat streak mosaic virus</italic> (WSMV) and 
 <italic>Maize dwarf mosaic virus</italic> (MDMV) have also been reported to synergize with MCMV causing MLN [
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, these other viruses have not been reported to associate with MLN in eastern and central Africa. Given the complexity of this disease and the economic importance of maize in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a need for a targeted investigation of the possible presence of other MLN-associated viruses apart from MCMV and SCMV in Tanzania.
