<p>Sustainable control of plant diseases requires a good understanding of the epidemiological aspects such as the biology of the causal pathogen(s) and the favorable environmental conditions for compatible pathogen-host interactions [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The combination of several viral strains makes the disease even more complex because of varying favorable conditions for virulence and transmission of the viruses. The transmission of MLN has been characterized as mainly vector-borne, but also soil-borne and seed-borne [

 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. MCMV, which has mainly been associated with MLN symptoms, is transmitted by thrips [
