<p>This study contributes to a better understanding of MLN in Northern Tanzania, by providing information on disease prevalence across different AEZs in Kilimanjaro, Arusha and Manyara regions in 2015, detection of the associated viruses and indicates possible measures to manage the disease. Furthermore, the study detected other potential viruses that could present a threat to maize production in Northern Tanzania. The complete sequences of the virus isolates reported in this study provide additional resources for the development of diagnostic tools and for enhancing understanding of genetic relatedness of isolates of MCMV, SCMV, and MSV across Africa and their management. Given that the observational and sampling component of the current study were limited in scope, we propose further studies to expand these aspects in order to assess the seasonal variations of the epidemics, the role of the interaction among multiple viruses on severity of MLN, how the genetic variability of SCMV affects MLN, and the role of vectors in respect to changes in the climatic factors.</p>
