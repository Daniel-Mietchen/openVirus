<p>In addition to MCMV and SCMV complete sequences, NGS analysis revealed the occurrence of MSVand signatures of MYDV, MDMV, BYDV, and SrMV that have been previously reported to cause serious infections in maize [

 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Given that MSV is widely distributed [

 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and a recent study reported the presence of MYDV in a mixed infection with MLN viruses [
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we extrapolate the possibility of evolved interactions. The interactions could besynergistic, helper-dependence, cross-protection, replacement or mutual suppression that can lead to either an increase or decrease in replication and/or transmission of any of the viruses [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Mixed infections in many viruses have been reported to cause severe symptoms as well as provide opportunities for recombination events leading to the emergence of new viral species [
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is not known whether the other viruses detected in this study (except SCMV and MCMV) can affect MLN symptoms. The present study observed a higher incidence of MCMV (97%) with a higher co-infection (62%) (MCMV and SCMV) in symptomatic maize compared to previous reports (62% of MCMV incidence and a co-infection of 51%) [
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This difference in co-infection could be caused by changes in conditions that favor the pathosystem. There is a need to analyze the cause of these observations and the associated drivers in further laboratory and field tests.
