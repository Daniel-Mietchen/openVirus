<p>We emphasize the importance for regional scientists to utilize farmers’ degree of awareness in identifying MLN hot spots and facilitate their capacity to collect data from a wider geographical area to enhance better understanding of the disease complex and epidemiology. The findings in the current study revealed that the majority of the farmers across the three regions had observed MLN in four consecutive years since the first report in 2012. The highest MLN prevalence (complete yield loss in 88% of the surveyed farms) was observed in 2014. A similar magnitude of maize yield loss was previously reported in Western Kenya, with the incidence of MCMV increasing between the years 2013 and 2014 [

The devastating disease mainly damages small-scale farmers’ field crops, who cannot afford to buy pesticides to control the vectors, and yet their livelihood depends mostly on agriculture. Small-scale farmers contribute to over 80% of Tanzania’s total maize production [

Thus, the reported maize yield losses due to MLN indicate a major threat to the per capita income and food security at large in Tanzania, an African country that is struggling to feed its burgeoning population. Given that small-scale farmers cannot afford to buy pesticides and their current methods used to control MLN (e.g., roguing diseased plants) are not very effective, there is a need to look for more sustainable and targeted methods such as breeding for resistant maize varieties.
