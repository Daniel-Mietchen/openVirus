<p>Farmers reported a high incidence of MLN in irrigated farms, where continuous maize cropping is practiced throughout the year. As continuous cropping can lead to a build-up and retention of the viral inoculum, there is a need to train farmers on crop rotation methods. Maize could be replaced by other crops (e.g., legumes), as these would not only break the pathogen cycle but also increase dietary diversity. Besides crop rotation, farmers should be encouraged to practice intercropping of maize with crops that are not affected by either MCMV or SCMV. Intercropping creates a vegetation diversity that can divert or repel the vectors of MLN [

In the current study, both farmers and the research assistants observed the two main vectors of MLN (thrips and aphids) in farmersâ€™ fields. The presence of vectors enhances a fast spread of most vector-bone plant viruses. Although seed transmission could play a role in the transmission of MLN [

 <xref rid="B46-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], farmers should be trained on integrated pest management strategies to sustainably control the vectors and the spread of MLN. Pull and push technology has been developed and validated as an effective tool for controlling insect-pests within east Africa [

As the region works towards developing MLN resistant maize, it is paramount to train farmers on how to apply the push and pull, together with other feasible strategies to effectively combat the disease and hence enhance food security in Tanzania.
