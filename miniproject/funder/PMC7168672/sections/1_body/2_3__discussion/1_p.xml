<p>The current study began as a response to an alert by farmers about a disease that been spreading fast within the maize growing regions of northern Tanzania. The study confirms that the disease was maize lethal necrosis (MLN). This disease is not new in Tanzania, as its occurrence and the causal organisms have been previously reportedin Arusha and Mwanza [
 <xref rid="B7-pathogens-09-00004" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this paper, we provide information on the occurrence of MLN in a wider geographical area, confirming the presence of the causal viruses for MLN (SCMV and MCMV) and other viruses, which can potentially threaten maize production in Tanzania. The study entailed interviewing farmersâ€™ about their experiences, direct observation of MLN symptoms in the fields and a confirmation of the causal viruses by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing (Illumina Miseq) analysis of symptomatic maize from Arusha, Manyara and Kilimanjaro regions of Tanzania.
