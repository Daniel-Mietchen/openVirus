<p>Infection of plant cells by dichorhaviruses, or the related nucleorhabdoviruses, results in dramatic modification of nuclei without triggering programmed cell death or rendering nuclei nonfunctional [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007462.g002">Fig 2</xref>). A number of new resources are required to gain insight into the molecular events that underlie CoRSVâ€“plant interactions. Most important among these is the ability to recover infectious virus entirely from complementary DNA (cDNA) clones, as has been accomplished for sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV), after decades of sustained efforts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Improved cloning strategies are effective for facile construction of infectious clones of rhabdoviruses and viruses with long RNA genome such as potyviruses. Such approaches should be applicable to a broad diversity of virus types [
