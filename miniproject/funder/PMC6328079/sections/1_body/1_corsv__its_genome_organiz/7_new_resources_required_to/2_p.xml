<p>Although recombinant systems will facilitate mechanistic studies of functional domains in viral RNAs and protein, the study of plant nucleotrophic viruses will be advanced substantially with a more detailed characterization of plant cell nuclei [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. With the dramatic remodelling of nuclei by plant-adapted negative-strand RNA viruses, an essential area that is presently understudied is the characterization of protein dynamics in response to virus infection. Characterization of the portion of the plant proteome that associates with, or is resident in, nuclei lags behind that of yeast and mammalian systems. However, in a screen for novel nuclear proteins, the Goodin lab has identified several candidate proteins that will provide vital markers for mapping the response of nuclei to infection by CoRSV and related viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As each of the plant-adapted negative strand RNA viruses examined to date has a unique protein interaction and localization map [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it is anticipated that it will require investigation of a spectrum of viruses to identify common and unique features of plantâ€“virus interactions. Several nucleorhabdoviruses and CoRSV can be studied in the common host
