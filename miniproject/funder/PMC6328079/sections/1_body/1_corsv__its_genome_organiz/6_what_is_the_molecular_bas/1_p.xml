<p>Some plant hosts, 
 <italic>Chenopodium quinoa</italic> and 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, for example, exhibit a dramatic temperature-dependent susceptibility to CoRSV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In experiments conducted with both species, plants must be incubated at 28°C for at least five days in order for CoRSV to establish systemic infections. That this phenomenon occurs in two genetically dissimilar plant species suggests that the temperature-dependence affects some virus-specific process. The 2 to 4°C increase in ambient temperatures projected by climate change predictions may severely impact the occurrence of this virus in reservoir species, which in turn may impact the severity and frequency of CoRSV in coffee production areas.
