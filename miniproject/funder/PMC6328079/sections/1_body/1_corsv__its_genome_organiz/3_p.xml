<p>Phylogenetic analyses of the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene in 45 CoRSV samples were conducted in order to provide insight into the population structure of this virus within and between farms [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These studies revealed a strong geospatial relationship among isolates, given that the genetic distance between any two isolates was a function of the distance between collections sites. These data support the hypothesis that the spread of CoRSV is constrained by expansion of populations of Brevipalpus, which exist as haploidized females due to commensal interaction with 
 <italic>Cardinium</italic> spp. This fascinating biology makes this arthropod an exciting subject for phylogeography studies in its own right beyond its impact as an agricultural pest [
