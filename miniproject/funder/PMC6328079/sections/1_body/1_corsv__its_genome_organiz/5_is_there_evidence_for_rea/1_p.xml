<p>That the genome of CoRSV, which in all other aspects resembles that of rhabdoviruses with monopartite genomes, evolved a bipartite organization begs the question whether this occurred due to the genetic constraints imposed by its unique vector. A bipartite genome may allow for increased opportunities for reassortment, if not recombination. Further, phylogenetic investigations based on whole genome and genes other than the nucleocapsid are required to provide a detailed phylogeography of this virus and its vector [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Given the low genetic diversity observed and the strong geospatial relationship between isolates, it might be expected that the phylogenetic trees derived from different CoRSV genes would be congruent (
