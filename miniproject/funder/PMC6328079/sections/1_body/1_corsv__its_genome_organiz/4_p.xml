<p>An important and much under-investigated area in CoRSV research is identification of its wild reservoir hosts. Much of the coffee growing regions of Brazil are surrounded by wild and semiwild sections of the Cerrado [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007462.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a tropical savannah in which the flora have not been extensively indexed for viruses, despite the ease with which plants in this region can be found with virus-like symptoms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007462.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Given the range of experimental hosts of CoRSV, it stands to reason that plants in the Cerrado may serve as reservoir species for CoRSV [
