  <title>Genome organization of plant-adpated negative-strand RNA viruses.</title>
  <p>Colors represent proteins of similar function. Each open reading-frame is flanked by a conserved gene junction (black circle). Gene junctions lacking transcription start sites are located between the polymerase gene and trailer RNA regions. Note: “Y” is a standardized notation used here to denote movement proteins. (A) PYDV. Type species of the genus 
   <italic>Nucleorhabdovirus</italic>. (B) CoRSV. Genus 
   <italic>Dichorhavirus</italic>, which have bipartite genomes. Beneath the genome maps are overlays of single-plane confocal micrographs of virus-infected nuclei in leaf epidermal cells of transgenic 
   <italic>N</italic>. 
   <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants expressing GFP targeted to endomembranes (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI to visualize chromatin (blue). (C) Mock. shown on left of virus-infected nuclei. Nuclei in virus-free cells have a clearly defined nuclear envelopes, with nuclei being approximately 10 μm at midsection. Scale is 5 μm. (D) CoRSV. Nuclei in these cells contain large viroplasms that exclude DAPI staining. However, the nuclear envelope is largely intact. Note that virus-infected nuclei are larger than virus-free nuclei. CoRSV, coffee ringspot virus; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ldr, leader; ORF, open reading frame; PYDV, potato yellow dwarf virus; trl, trailer.
