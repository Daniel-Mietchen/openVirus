<p>The observed positive breeding places were categorized into two groups namely, man-made (artificial) and natural breeding places. The summary of the two categories were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231408.g003">Fig 3</xref>. A total of 416 breeding containers were positive for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes from which 70.0% (n = 291) were man-made containers and 30% (n = 125) were natural breeding places in all study areas. The most prominent man-made positive containers for dengue mosquito life stages was plastic and polythene containers (28.1%, n = 117) and the main natural breeding places were plant axils (9.4%, n = 39). Frequently observed other man-made breeding places were discarded tires (11.1%, n = 46), earthen pot (4.8%, n = 20), pet dish (4.1%, n = 17) and discarded tins (3.1%, n = 13). The highlighted other natural breeding places were bush-stumps (6.9%, n = 29) and tree holes (2.4%, n = 10). Summary of the categories of positive breeding places was show in Table A3 in
