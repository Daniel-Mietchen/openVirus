<p>After sequencing, the forward and reverse chromatograms generated from the E gene of isolated DENV-2 were assembled in Lasergene 8.00 software suite (DNASTAR Inc., USA). The generated sequences were aligned with retrieved DENV2 sequences available at NCBI database and Consensus sequences were aligned using MAFFT version 7 [

 <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The phylogenetic trees were developed using MEGA7 software with General Time Reversible (GTR) substitution model with gamma distributed rates. The robustness of clades was determined by using bootstrap analysis of 500 replicates and the developed phylogenetic tree is illustrated in the
