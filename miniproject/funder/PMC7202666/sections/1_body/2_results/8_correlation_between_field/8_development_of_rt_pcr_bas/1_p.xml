<p>An rRT-PCR assay was developed to detect presence of DENV in field-caught dengue vector mosquitoes in the study areas using both SYBR Green dye. The resulting fluorescence curve and subsequent melting curve for the first PCR is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231408.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. After the first PCR, semi nested RT-PCR was performed to identify the DENV serotypes using the TS1-4 serotype specific reverse primers. Each reverse primer was added to the master mixture at 0.4 μM concentration. In the RT-PCR assay, the product was 5 times diluted with PCR water prior to addition of 5.0 μl to the reaction mixture as template. The melting peaks that were developed for each DENV serotype following the semi-nested RT-PCR assay was illustrated in the

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231408.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). However, when the step size reduced to 0.1°C, the range of the developed peaks were differ for the each serotype (
