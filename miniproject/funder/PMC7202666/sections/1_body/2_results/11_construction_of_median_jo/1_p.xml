<p>Median joining evolutionary network was created to identify mutations of the E gene sequences in the similarly clustered sequences of DENV-2 cosmopolitan Clade Ib genotype to identify and visualize the mutation pattern using the Network 4.6.1 software. The resulted evolutionary network was visualized in

Comparative sequence analysis between the generated DNEV-2 sequences from the mosquito pools and Singapore isolates (2013–17) revealed that the Sri Lankan sequence (SL1) grouped with a sub-clade of clade Ib viruses (variant 3; fixed substitutions—C1383T + T1464C). The genetic relationship of clade Ib viruses between the two countries has been summarized in the following table (
