<p>Distribution of dengue incidences depending on gender and age in study and control areas are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. When number of dengue cases in the study areas were compared with control areas, significant correlations of calculated entomological indices with reported patient cases were identified using the cross correlation analysis up to three months lag periods. The significant correlations were summarized in the Table A5 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231408.s006">S2 File</xref>. In the analysis, positive significant correlation was observed in HI for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> for 3
 <sup>rd</sup> Kurana and Welikadamulla study areas with reported patient cases at zero and one month lag intervals respectively while none of other indices were not correlated significantly with the reported patient incidences. Since, none of the patient cases were reported from the control area, the Mawathahena study area was excluded for the analysis.
