<p>During the entomological survey, a total of 10,616 potential breeding containers were observed from all study areas and 2,718 dengue vector mosquitoes were collected and 4.56% of them were

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The results of the entomological survey were summarized in the 
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231408.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The highest number of mosquitoes (n = 728) were captured from the Eriyawetiya dengue high risk study area and highest number of potential containers (n = 2,426) were observed from the Akbar Town high risk area from which 52.4% (n = 1,272) were wet containers. In the high risk areas, the highest percentage of wet containers were reported from the Eriyawetiya study area (62.45%, n = 1,204) and the lowest percentage was reported from the Welikadamulla (50.5%, n = 1,194) study area. The highest percentage of positive containers for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes in the high risk areas was reported from the Akbar Town study area (8.5%, n = 108) from which 17.6% was positive for

 <italic>aegypti</italic> (n = 19). When considering the whole study population, the highest percentage of wet containers and positive containers for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes were reported from the control area (63.3% and 9.0% respectively). All the breeding places of immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes in the control area were positive for

 <italic>albopictus</italic>. However, no significant difference was observed in the distributions of total mosquito count and counts of dry, wet and total positive containers in the high risk study areas compared to the control area according to the Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. When comparing the number of field caught adult

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in the study populations using Kruskal-Wallis test, significant difference was observed in high risk areas compared to the control area (H(4) = 17.97, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.00125) and it was significantly higher in Eriyawetiya (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0268), Akbar Town ((
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0007) and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> Kurana (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0221) study areas. Further, significant difference was observed when analyzing the containers that were positive for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes. When comparing to the control, the number of breeding places of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> was significant differed in high risk areas (H(4) = 11.87,

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0256) study area.
