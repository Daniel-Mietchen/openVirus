<p>Cross correlation analysis was performed to identify significant correlations of calculated entomological indices with the count of field-caught adult dengue vector mosquitoes collected from respective species up to three months lag periods. Both CI and HI at zero month lag period were significantly correlated positively with the field-caught

 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquito count in the Akbar Town study area. In the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> Kurana study area, positive significant correlation was observed with all the indices, CI, HI and BI, with the field-caught 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquito count at zero month lag period. Further, the HI and BI were significantly correlated positively with the field-caught 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquito count at one month lag period in the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> Kurana study area. In the welikadamulla study area, positive significant correlation was observed for all the three indices with the field-caught 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquito count at zero month lag period. When considering the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> field-caught mosquito counts, positive significant correlation was observed only in 3
 <sup>rd</sup> Kurana study area with CI and BI at the lag period of two months. No significant correlation between entomological indices and field-caught mosquitoes were observed for Eriyawetiya and Mawathahena (control) areas at 5% significant level (
