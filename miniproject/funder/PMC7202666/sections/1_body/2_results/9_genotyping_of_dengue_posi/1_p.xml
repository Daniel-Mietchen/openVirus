<p>cDNA was prepared using random hexamers from the isolated RNA from positive samples and DENV-2 specific Den2_771F forward primer and Den2_2540R reverse primer were used to completely amplify the E gene. The optimized assay condition used for the PCR was, in 50 μl reaction system, 1x Colorless GoTaq
 <sup>TM</sup> reaction buffer, 1.5 mM of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, each dNTP at 0.8 mM, each primer at 0.2 μM with 2.5 U of GoTaq
 <sup>®</sup> DNA polymerase with 5–10 μl of cDNA. The optimized thermal profile was initial denaturation at 94.0°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94.0°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 58.0°C for 90 seconds and extension at 72.0°C for 2 minutes with final extension at 72.0°C for 7 minutes. The results of agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplified products of genotyping PCR was illustrated in

PCR products were purified using the GeneJET PCR purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions, before being sequenced at a commercial facility by using BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
