<p>Mosquito eggs and larvae were pooled separately as mentioned previously in pool preparation of adult mosquitoes during the detection of DENV in the field collected immature stages of

 <italic>Aedes</italic> dengue vector mosquitoes were washed with distilled water prior to store them until subjected to RNA extraction. RNA extraction and reverse transcription were performed as mentioned in the Chapter 3.3.1.4.a. The DENV identification PCR was performed using the assay optimized with the primers proposed by Lanciotti
