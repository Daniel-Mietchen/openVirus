<p>Cross correlation analysis was used to identify significant correlations between fields caught dengue vector mosquitoes and reported dengue incidences in the study areas with lags up to three months (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231408.s006">S2 File</xref>, Table A7). During the analysis, significant correlations were observed with number of filed caught adult

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Significantly positive correlations were observed at zero and one month lagged time periods with patient cases in Eriyawetiya study area and in Akbar Town study area, similar correlation was observed at two months lag period. No other significant correlations were observed between field collected dengue vector mosquitoes with reported patient cases even though non-significant positive correlations were observed at zero month lagged months in both the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> Kurana and Welikadamulla study areas. Since no dengue cases were reported in the control area during the studied period of time, correlations were not studied.
