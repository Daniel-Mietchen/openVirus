<p>The first dengue incidence in Sri Lanka was reported in 1962 and ever since, the number of dengue incidences increased every year. The first Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) epidemic was reported in Sri Lanka in 1989 and after that DHF has been considered endemic to Sri Lanka [

Approximately half of the total dengue incidences were reported in the Western Province which comprises of Districts of Colombo, Gampaha and Kaluthara. The highest number of dengue incidences were reported in the District of Colombo which is the commercial capital and largest city of the country followed by the District of Gampaha bordering the Northern boundary of the District of Colombo. Despite many efforts taken for controlling dengue in the District of Gampaha, more than 5,000 cases on average are reported annually with approximately 32,000 reported cases in the year 2017 [

It is required to have a broad knowledge on entomological risk factors, distribution, densities and seasonal variation of dengue vector mosquitoes together with climatic and other possible risk factors affecting transmission of dengue to control dengue incidences in the District of Gampaha, however, there is no study conducted in the district to identify DENV serotypes in specimens from entomological surveys and identification of its origin and circulation. Therefore, the study is focused on development of better entomological surveillance approach through vector survey programmes together with molecular and phylogenetic methods to identify detection of DENV serotypes circulation in order to minimize adverse effects of imminent dengue outbreaks.
