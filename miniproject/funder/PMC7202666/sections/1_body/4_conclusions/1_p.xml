<p>In the study, we identified a migrated DENV serotype 2, which belongs to the cosmopolitan Clade1b genotype leads the dengue epidemic in July, 2017 in Sri Lanka. This viral strain is the predominant strain in South-East Asian region since 2015. A real-time model of this approach can identify risks of virulent forms of DENV in early stage in individual clusters. Since the epidemiology and virulence of the DENV strain is known from previous areas, the spread of the disease can be minimized in the new area with more specified vector control and source reduction programmes managing scarce public health resources effectively. When the system is established in all areas, then it will be easy to identify the pattern of migrations of newly introduced DENV strains over the time in the country.</p>
