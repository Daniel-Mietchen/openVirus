 <italic>aegypti</italic> in Akbar Town and Welikadamulla study areas while Eriyawetiya study area demonstrated similar negative correlation was observed with HI and BI. These negative correlations may arise due to uncaptured breeding places present in households, such as some indoor breeding places and water tanks. During the survey, there were some restrictions on searching the inside of households, where mostly

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are resting, leading to missing some breeding places in those households which is similar to previous observations in Ethiopia China [
