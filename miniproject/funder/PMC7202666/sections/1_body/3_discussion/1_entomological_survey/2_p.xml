<p>Prior to data analysis, the homogeneity of variances was tested for study variables. During the analysis, variance within the population was significantly different with the number of reported dengue incidences, total mosquito count, field-caught

 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. However, variances within each population of the number of wet containers and total number of containers positive for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes were not significantly different. When considering the number of dengue cases, no incidences were reported during the study period of time in the control area. When considering the control area, only two

 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes were different in the study and control areas. The highest number of positive breeding places for
