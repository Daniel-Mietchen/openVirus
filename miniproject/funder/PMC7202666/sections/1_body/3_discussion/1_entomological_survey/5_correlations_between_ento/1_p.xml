<p>No significant correlations were observed with entomological indices of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> and reported patient cases. However, non-significant negative correlations were observed in the Eriyawetiya study area. This may be due to other vector control and source reduction activities conducted by the MOH office and residents in the study areas when there were dengue incidences. The Eriyawetiya study areas was highly affected by dengue and it was the highest number of dengue incidences reported study area among all study areas. The breeding places of dengue vector mosquitoes got reduced at the time of field surveys as the dwellers in the area removed potential breeding places from their households which lead to the reduction of potential breeding places of dengue vector mosquitoes even though the reported cases were higher [

During vector control activities, some of the breeding places may be unidentified depending on level of personal expertise, restrictions of accessibility to household, limitations due to inadequate resources, etc. which lead to differences between actual adult population and larval indices. Although those possibilities were addressed in the current study, some restrictions were aroused during investigation in inside of households. This may lead to poor correlation between entomological indices and dengue incidences in the study areas.
