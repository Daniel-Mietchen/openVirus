<p>When considering the RH, both the minimum and maximum RH were correlated in a similar manner with entomological indices. Positive correlations were observed between current month maximum RH with both HI and BI of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. Further, similar non-significant positive correlations were observed between HI of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and current month minimum and maximum RH. These positive correlations can be due to the higher RH in study areas. Sri Lanka is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean and a high level of humidity prevails throughout the year. The average RH in Sri Lanka is about 79.8% which makes favorable conditions for the development of dengue vector mosquitoes. Therefore, positive correlation of entomological indices with RH at current month has to be expected in Sri Lanka. However, all three entomological indices of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were negatively correlated with two and three month previous minimum and maximum RH in study areas. This may be due to higher RH can reduce the hatching rates of mosquito eggs attached to dry containers which is reported in a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In rearing insectaries, the mosquito eggs were stored in a desiccator below 60% of RH to maximize the hatching rates. This observation indicate that higher RH may be lead to reduce hatching rates of mosquito eggs. When the eggs were attached outdoors at high level of RH for long periods, the hatching rates will be decreased leading to a negative correlation of the entomological indices with two and three month previous minimum and maximum RH.
