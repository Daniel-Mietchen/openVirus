 <italic>albopictus</italic> and current month minimum and maximum temperature in most of high risk study areas. These negative correlations of entomological indices is probably due to reduction of ideal breeding places of dengue vector mosquitoes.

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is mainly indoor resting mosquito and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is outdoor resting mosquito. In the high risk study areas, temperature ranges from 21.3°C to 34.3°C. In high temperature periods,

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes will fly inside of households and rest in there for their survival and therefore, they can survive better in high temperature periods than

 <italic>albopictus</italic>. This can be another reason for negative correlations of entomological indices of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> and positive correlations of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> entomological indices with temperature. This may indicate that most of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are resting indoors in the study areas and therefore, more attention need to be paid to control indoor mosquito populations in future source reduction programmes during epidemic as well as non-epidemic periods. Further, positive correlations were observed between all three entomological indices of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and maximum temperature in all study areas at two and three months lag periods. These positive correlations may be due to safeguard of mosquito eggs. During high temperatures, water in the containers gets evaporated and even though the container completely dried out, the eggs can survive without dropping out as the eggs are attached to the walls of the container. Therefore, when there is a rainfall, those eggs can be hatched successfully and develop mosquito larvae leading to positive correlation [
