<p>When considering correlations between entomological indices and studied meteorological variables, similar correlation pattern was observed in HI and BI. Both the HI and BI demonstrated a positive correlation with current monthly rainfall in all study areas. Even these positive correlations were significant in Eriayawetiya, Akbar Town and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> Kurana study areas as well as control area. These positive correlations with current month rainfall were probably due to the availability of breeding containers for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> dengue vector mosquitoes after rainfalls. However, non-significant negative correlations of CI were observed with current and previous month rainfall Eriyawetiya, Welikadamulla and Mawathahena areas. Further, negative correlations were observed with current month number of rainy days in HI and BI of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in dengue high risk areas. These negative correlations were probably due to wash out of the potential containers due to excessive pouring conditions. However, in the control area, non-significant positive correlations were observed with current month rainy days which could be due to higher availability of breeding places for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Further, negative correlations were also observed with two months and three months previous rainfall and number of rainy days in high risk study areas with HI and BI which may be due to reduction of breeding places as a result of evaporation of water in the potential containers, temperature rises and degradation of the quality of water in the water holding containers due to sediments and bacterial activities [
