<p>The field-caught mosquitoes were tested using the developed rRT-PCR assay with primers developed by Lanciotti 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (1992). Wings and legs were removed and both head and thorax subjected for the RNA extractions. During the RNA extraction procedure, special precautions were taken to minimize the degradations by RNase enzyme. Precautions were taken into account during the preparation of buffers and solutions as well as throughout the extraction procedure. All glassware and crushing rods were rinsed thoroughly with DEPC treated water and autoclaved to remove residual DEPC. Molecular grade reagents were used to prepare stock solutions and the buffers were freshly prepared. Further, separate bench spaces, pipette sets and personal protection measures were followed.
