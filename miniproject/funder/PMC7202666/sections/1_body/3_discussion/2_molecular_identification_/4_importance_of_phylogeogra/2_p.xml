<p>District of Gampaha is located next to the District of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, where the highest number of dengue cases are reported every year. Previous studies mentioned that during the daily commute of residents in the District of Gampaha to the District of Colombo for work and other commercial purposes, they can be infected by dengue. However, these patients are reported under the District of Gampaha [

Further, it is a great concern that the dengue cases were reported sporadically prior to its spread all over the country. The proposed phylogenetic approach can be the solution to detect migration patterns of DENV serotypes throughout the country. For example, when cases are reported from a remote area, the generated E gene sequences can be modelled to identify the similarities and mutation patterns and compared with the sequences from outbreak areas to detect a possible migration pattern. Therefore, it is possible to identify whether the same DENV strain has spread to new areas. This may lead to identification of significant mutations for successful proliferations of DENV and it is reported that most of the generated mutations in the DENV strains are not epidemic while epidemic strains successfully proliferate in the environment causing outbreaks and epidemics [
