<p>The genotyping PCR was performed for DENV positive samples to amplify complete E gene using the DENV2 specific primers. The derived E gene sequences generated from the positive mosquito pools were compared with the available DENV-2 gene sequences at NCBI GenBank database and multiple sequence alignment was prepared using the MAFFT 7 software which utilize the Fast Fourier transformation which generate the alignment faster and accurately. Substitution models are used to predict the rate of substitution for nucleotides at a given site together with the distribution of substitutions across the entire sequence during generation of phylogenetic trees. The GTR model, which is also known as the General Reversible (REV) model, is more complex type of models that assumes different rates of substitution for each pair of nucleotides, in addition to assuming different frequencies of occurrence of nucleotides. The result of the phylogenetic analysis illustrates that the E gene sequences of DENV2 obtained from two DENV positive mosquito pools belong to DENV2 Cosmopolitan Clade Ib. The virus strain was detected in Singapore since 2013 and it has been the dominant strain in South-East Asia, specially Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and China since August, 2015. Comparative sequence performed using network indicate that the sequences generated from the mosquito pools were grouped with a Singapore isolates (2013–17) sub-clade variant 3 of clade Ib viruses which exhibits fixed substitutions of C1383T and T1464C, which caused the latest DENV-2 outbreak in Singapore during early 2016. Further, the BEAST analysis also indicated that the DENV clade Ib virus has migrated to Sri Lanka from the South-East Asian region. These evidences suggested recent introduction of this DENV strain to Sri Lanka and the cause for the epidemic in mid-2017. The DENV-2 clade Ib virus was reported to be the dominant viral strain since August, 2015 and it migrated to Sri Lanka approximately 2 years’ later. Since the virus strain was introduced to Sri Lanka recently and there was no herd immunity against the viral strain, the strain spread throughout the country increasing the number of dengue incidences rapidly until it reached an epidemic level. If there was a system in Sri Lanka to detect such migrations of virulent strains of DENV, the magnitude of the severity of the outbreak could be minimized with the aids of previous reports and literatures because most of times when there is an epidemic in an areas, the viral serotypes and genotypes as well as its virulence were reported to many WHO databases and online resources. Therefore, once a virulent genotype found, using the phylogeographic model, it is possible to analyze its spread and virulence at early stage of outbreak locally and control it before propagating into an epidemic. Furthermore, once the data gathered over few years, it is possible to identify recurrence of previously identified viral genotypes over the periods. This is mainly observed in after an epidemic. During an epidemic, most of times a viral genotype predominates other serotypes and genotypes when these epidemic strains introduced to the community recently. Therefore, there will be no enough herd immunity against the viral strain leading to rapid spread of the strain. Once the epidemic is over, where the herd immunity for the disease is mainly replaced by the epidemic strain, there is a possibility to overtake other already existing virulent DENV strains after a few years of silence. Since the population does not have enough herd immunity against those strains now, there is a higher possibility of another dengue outbreak, probably at lower magnitude as there is some level of herd immunity against the strain already in the population, due to reoccurrence of previously existing epidemic strains. These scenarios can be tracked using the developed phylogeographic model when it applied locally over some years and minimize spread of outbreaks at early stage.</p>
