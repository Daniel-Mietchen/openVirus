<p>The fifth serotype of DENV has already been reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If the serotype migrated to Sri Lanka where no prior cases are reported from the serotype and so no herd immunity, there is higher possibility of dengue epidemic depending on the virulence of the strain. A phylogeographyic model, like the one developed in the study, can detect the origin and distribution of the strains which will minimize the establishment of new DENV strains locally. This will enable utilize scare public health resources efficiently to minimize magnitudes of impending dengue epidemics.
