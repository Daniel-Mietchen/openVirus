<p>The real-time assays were developed using both SYBR Green and EvaGreen fluorescence dyes. The assays were developed initially with the QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR kit. During the melting analysis in the first rRT-PCR developed with the primers proposed by Lanciotti

The broad peak appeared in DENV-1 may be due to the variations in the GC content at the 5’ and 3’ ends or binding differences of SYBR Green of the amplified products of DENV-1. During the detection of serotypes, demarcations of serotypes were not strong at low level resolution (steps of 0.4°C). However, when using high melting resolutions with 0.1°C step size, different peak ranges were observed as illustrated in the

Since the size of the amplified product was 511 bp in length there is higher probability that the florescence curve developed from SYBR Green was not correlated proportionally with the amplified product as it can get attached to anywhere in the dsDNA.
