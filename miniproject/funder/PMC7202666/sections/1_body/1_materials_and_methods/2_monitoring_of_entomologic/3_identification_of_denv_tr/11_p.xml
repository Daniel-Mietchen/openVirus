After detection of serotype of DENV in positive pools, another PCR was performed to amplify complete E gene with serotype specific primers with the objective of identification of the genotype of the DENV. The extracted RNA were reverse transcribed using random oligonucleotide hexamers (Promega Corp., USA) as mentioned previously.
