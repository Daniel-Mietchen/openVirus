 <italic>Reverse-transcription of RNA</italic>. Extracted RNA from adult female dengue vector mosquitoes, eggs and larvae were subjected to reverse transcription. Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) was used to prepare cDNA. For the reverse transcription and PCR assay optimizations, Deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) solutions were purchased from Promega, USA. Mixture 1 was prepared using 3.0 μl of RNA and 0.4 μM of D2 reverse primer and the total volume of Mixture 1 was adjusted to 12 μl using PCR water. The Mixture 2 was consist of 1X First-Strand RT enzyme Buffer, 2.0 mM of each dNTP, 4 U of RNase inhibitor, 200 U of M-MLV RT enzyme and the total volume of Mixture 2 was adjusted to 13 μl using PCR water. Upon preparation of Mixture 1, the PCR tube was incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes followed by keeping 3 minutes in ice prior to addition of ice cold Mixture 2. After the addition of Mixture 2, the tube was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes and prepared cDNA was stored at -20°C until tested by PCR.
