 <italic>Extraction of dengue viral RNA</italic>. 
 <underline>Adult mosquitoes</underline>—Field-caught adult dengue vector mosquitoes were pooled together depending on the species, collection date and study area and each pool included maximum of 50 mosquitoes. In each pool, head and thorax of each mosquito was separated after removing abdomen, legs and wings. Then, an aliquot of 160 μl of autoclaved Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) was added to the pool and crushed well using autoclaved plastic rods. After crushing, the samples were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 1 minute time period and an aliquot of 140 μl of the supernatant was transferred to another 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube containing 10 μl of SC and 1 ml of lysis buffer. Then, the RNA extraction was performed as mentioned above.
