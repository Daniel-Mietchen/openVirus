 <italic>Development of evolutionary network of DENV</italic>. Evolutionary network was constructed using the Network (version 5.0.0.3) software to visualize the complex evolutionary processes of DENV E gene sequences. After transforming the aligned sequences to Phylip format (phy 3.2) using the BioEdit (version 7.2.5), the alignment was feed to Network software (version 5.0.0.3) to construct network with Median-Joining algorithm.
