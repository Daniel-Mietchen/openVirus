<p>Five times diluted products of the first PCR were used as the template for the semi-nested PCR to identify the DENV serotypes. Here, assay conditions were used following manufacturer’s guidelines of same RT-PCR kit with the four serotype specific reverse primers. An aliquot of 3 μl of diluted PCR product was used as the template for the serotyping assay. Thermal cycling profile was as follows: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 54°C for 60 seconds, extension at 72°C for 60 seconds followed by a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. Melting analysis was performed starting from 65°C with gradually increment of temperature by 0.1°C at each step of 20 seconds until 95°C.</p>
