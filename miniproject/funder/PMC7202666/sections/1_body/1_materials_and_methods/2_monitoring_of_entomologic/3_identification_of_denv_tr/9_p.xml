 <italic>Detection of DENV and serotypes</italic>. Prepared cDNA was then used for rRT-PCR to identify the presence of DENV in field-collected specimens. For the first PCR of detection of DENV, assay conditions were used following manufacturer’s guidelines of QuantiTect
 <sup>®</sup> SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> Green PCR kit (Qiagen-USA) with 5 μl of cDNA. Thermal cycling profile was as follows: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 54°C for 60 seconds, extension at 72°C for 60 seconds followed by a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. Melting analysis was then performed starting from 65°C with gradually increment of temperature by 0.5°C at each step of 20 seconds until 95°C. The rRT-PCR was performed using the same Real Time Thermal Cycler (ESCO, USA).
