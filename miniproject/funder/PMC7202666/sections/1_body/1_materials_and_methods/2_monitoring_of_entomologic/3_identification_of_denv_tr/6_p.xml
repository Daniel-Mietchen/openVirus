 <underline>Eggs</underline>—Field collected eggs of dengue vector mosquitoes were pooled together and directly subjected to RNA extractions. An aliquot of 160 μl of autoclaved PBS was added to egg pool and crushed well using autoclaved plastic rods. After crushing, the samples were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 1 minute time period and an aliquot of 140 μl of the supernatant was transferred to another 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube containing 10 μl of SC and lysis buffer. The RNA extraction was performed as mentioned above.
