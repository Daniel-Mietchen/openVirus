 <sup>®</sup> DNA polymerase. An aliquot of 5 μl of prepared cDNA was used for the assay and the total volume of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 50 μl using PCR water. The Den2_771F and Den2_2540R DENV serotype 2 specific primers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231408.s006">S2 File</xref>, Table A2) were used to amplify complete E gene. Thermal cycling profile was as follows: an initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 58°C for 90 seconds, extension at 72°C for 2 minutes followed by a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. The amplified PCR products were size fractionated using agarose gel electrophoresis as mentioned in Chapter 3.3.1.4.e.
