 <italic>Phylogeography analysis of spatio-temporal spread of DENV</italic>. The Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software package was used to analyze spatio-temporal spread of DENV using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) statistical framework. Sequences in the alignment was renamed in the format of Accession No._Country_Year prior to transforming the alignment to nexus (.nex) format. The nexus file was feed to the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility (BEAUti) and the clock model parameter was changed to “New trait” partition. In the ‘Tips’ tab, ‘Use tip dates’ was checked and ‘Chain Length’ was set to 10 000 000 iterations in the ‘MCMC’ tab. The edits were saved to.xml file which was feed to BEAST. Upon completion of BEAST run, the ESS values were examined using the trace log in Tracer software. The Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree was developed using the Tree Annotator software using the “Location Tree” log file. Discrete phylogenetic module was utilized for the visualization of the generated MCC tree [
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The output tree file of the BEAST run was feed to SPREAD (version 1.0.7) [
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the location coordinates were fed using the ‘Setup’ tab. The “Most recent sampling date” is set to 20th June, 2017 prior to generating the.kml file. The generated.kml file was visualized using the Google Earth Pro (version 7.3.2.5491-64-bit) software.
