 <italic>Identification of breeding containers and collection of immature stages of dengue vector mosquito samples</italic>. All potential breeding places in each premise were examined while wet and positive containers were recorded separately. Positive containers were divided into three groups depending on the mosquito species present

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae albopictus</italic> and other species. Larval and pupal specimens were collected carefully using a glass pipette and transferred to labelled vials with the house-hold number, locality, date of collection and type of breeding place. These breeding places were categorized as natural or man-made containers and a directory was prepared for dengue vector breeding sites including each breeding place. The directory was updated each month as new breeding places were examined.
