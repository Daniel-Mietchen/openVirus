 <italic>Investigation of correlations between entomological findings with climatic variables</italic>. Pearson correlation analysis was used to identify the associations among the meteorological variables, namely rainfall, number of rainy days, minimum and maximum temperature, minimum and maximum Relative Humidity (RH), average wind speed, with monthly captured 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> adult dengue vector mosquitoes initially. Then, associations of above environmental variables with entomological variables, namely monthly observed dry, wet, total positive containers for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes and containers positive for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> respectively were studied with three month lag period. Significant associations were further examined using multivariate regression model to determine the best predictor variables associated with relative abundance of the larval and adult densities.
