 <italic>Identification of correlations between entomological findings with dengue incidences</italic>. Different entomological indices such as House index (HI), Container index (CI) and Breteau index (BI) [
 <xref rid="pone.0231408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] were calculated using formulas given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231408.s005">S1 File</xref>. Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate relationships and correlations among studied entomological variables, namely monthly observed dry, wet, total positive containers for immature stages of dengue vector mosquitoes and containers positive for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> respectively together with the results of mosquito indices (HI, CI and BI) with reported dengue incidences in each study area.
