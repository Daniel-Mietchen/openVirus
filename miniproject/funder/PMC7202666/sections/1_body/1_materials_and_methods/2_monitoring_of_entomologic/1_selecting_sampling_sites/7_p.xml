<p>A simple random sampling approach was used to select 150 households in each selected GN division. Each household was labelled with a unique identification number. In addition, abandoned houses, dumping yards and religious places in the study areas were considered as open areas. They also were marked with an identification number. Community awareness was performed by visiting to each household in each study/control site prior to initiate the study.</p>
