<p>Number of dengue incidences reported in past ten years (2005–2014) in the District of Gampaha were collected from all the MOH officers and Regional Epidemiologist, Gampaha. High (n = 4) and low (n = 1) dengue transmission areas were identified based on mean reported dengue incidences in each MOH area. Four MOH areas with an average number of dengue incidences greater than 300 per year were selected as dengue high risk areas. When selecting sampling sites, one GN division reporting the highest number of dengue incidences during the period of 2012–2014 in each selected MOH area was selected. One MOH area with the lowest number of dengue incidences was selected as dengue low risk area. One GN division reporting the lowest dengue incidences during the same period of 2012–2014 was selected when selecting the sampling site in the selected control MOH area.</p>
