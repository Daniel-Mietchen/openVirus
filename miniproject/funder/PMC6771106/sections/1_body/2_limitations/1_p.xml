   <p id="Par34">We studied EBOV infection in the ARPE-19 human RPE cell line, in place of cells isolated from human eyes. This cell line is a well-characterized, robust model for studying human retinal pigment epithelium [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and thus our findings should provide reasonable fidelity to an ocular infection in an EVD survivor.

   <p id="Par35">MicroRNA expression was evaluated at one time-point post-infection. The time-point was selected in our previously published study [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], to be maximally informative of host cell responses to EBOV infection, and may be most applicable to EVD and early survivorship.

   <p id="Par36">Human RPE cells were studied in isolation, while the intraocular environment includes multiple cell populations. However, this approach allowed us to focus specifically on gene expression in a key intraocular target cell for EBOV.</p>

   <p id="Par37">Cells were infected with virulent EBOV, which caused recent EVD epidemics; less virulent 
    <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> species may induce different miRNA expression. Cells were not co-infected with other pathogens: co-infection influences EVD outcome, which might in part reflect altered miRNA expression, as demonstrated in other infections [
