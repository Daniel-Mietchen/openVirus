<p id="Par26">Putative target genes in EBOV-infected human RPE cells were predicted from the 15 highly differentially expressed miRNAs using algorithms: 2629 targets by Diana microT; 1799 targets by miRDB; and 14,315 targets by TargetScan (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Targets were also identified through interrogation of experimentally validated data: 44 targets by miRecords; and 9 targets by miRTarBase (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). 1440 genes were differentially expressed between EBOV- and mock-infected ARPE-19 cells (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Highly enriched gene ontology categories and KEGG pathways were established for the target genes, based on numbers represented within categories and pathways, and ranking of corrected p-values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a–c, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). The molecular network constructed from miRNA-target gene interactions included 363 highly connected molecules; most connected molecule was leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), and most connected miRNA was hsa-miR-190a (Fig.
