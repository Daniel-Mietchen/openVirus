<p id="Par33">Our work provides new information about the potential post-transcriptional regulation of the human RPE cell response to infection with EBOV. Review of the biological targets of the 15 highly-induced or repressed miRNAs indicates a broad range of potential regulatory activities, including effects on immune responses, cellular metabolism, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and autophagy in the host cells. MicroRNA expression varies by tissue, including within the eye [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; hence similar changes may not occur in other ocular tissues or tissues from other immune-privileged sites, such as testis. Future studies of the regulatory activities of these miRNAs in human RPE cells should delineate their involvement in the intraocular persistence of EBOV and EBOV-associated uveitis in EVD survivors.
