<p id="Par28">Another highly connected miRNA was miR-29b3p, which suppresses key immunological pathways by downregulating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This transcription factor plays an essential role in the anti-viral type IFN response. Multiple receptors—including toll-like receptors and retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I—stimulate NF-κB, which activates transcription of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes. 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> profoundly inhibits the type I IFN response in monocytes and other cell populations, through the action of viral proteins—VP24 and VP35—and suppression of RIG-I signaling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; however, EBOV also may suppress this pathway through activation of miR-29b-3p. Other viruses act similarly: the NF-κB pathway is not activated in human RPE cells infected with cytomegalovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. MicroRNA-29b is also activated in Japanese encephalitis virus infection, particularly in persons with neurological sequelae, and elevated serum levels may indicate severe disease [
