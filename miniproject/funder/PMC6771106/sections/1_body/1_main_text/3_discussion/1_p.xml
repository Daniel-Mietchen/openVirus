 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We have identified miRNAs produced in human RPE cells following infection with EBOV. Viruses take advantage of host miRNAs to adjust gene expression and create an environment that supports replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Human RPE cells make multiple molecular adjustments in response to infection with EBOV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and miR-190a is central to the cell response. This highly connected miRNA contributes to cell survival and latency in Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, by downregulating expression of tumor protein P53 inducible nuclear protein 1 and nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3, thereby preventing cell cycle arrest and inhibiting apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The same mechanism may be utilized by EBOV to promote viral replication in infected RPE cells. One other interacting miRNA—miR-101—prevents cell death in the context of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], pointing to a common strategy among viruses to promote survival of both the virus and its host cell.
