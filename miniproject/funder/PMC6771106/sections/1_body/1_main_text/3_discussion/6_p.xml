<p id="Par32">RNA viruses do not typically encode miRNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, our analysis of EBOV-infected RPE cells identified EBOV-miR-1-5p, which has been described by several investigator teams [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This ortholog of human miR-155 inhibits expression of importin-Î±5 and impacts type I IFN signaling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Molecular mimicry of miR-155 is also seen in Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus infection of B-cells, enabling the virus to drive the cell to a state that supports long-term latency and avoids apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Several other EBOV-derived miRNAs were identified in the infected RPE cells, but with very low read counts suggesting negligible biological activity.
