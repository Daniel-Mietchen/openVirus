  <title>Cooperative effects of mutations on viral polymerase activity in avian and human cells.</title>
  <p>Viral polymerase activity was measured by minigenome assays in avian DF-1 cells and human 293T cells. (A and C) Polymerase activity in ancestral G1/1997 (A) and EG/2013 backgrounds (C). Polymerase complexes carrying the indicated PB2 mutations, singly or in combination, were assayed in 293T cells at 33°C and in DF-1 cells at 37°C. The data are expressed relative to the results for G1/1997-wt (A) and EG/2013-wt (C). (B) (Upper panel) Transparent surface diagram of the G1/1997 polymerase complex color-coded showing PB2 (green), PB1 (pink), PA (blue) and the mutations identified in this study (red), including the putative complementary PB2 mutations located in the vicinity of the PB2-543 residue. (Lower panel) Polymerase activity of G1/1997 polymerase complexes carrying the putative complementary PB2 mutations, singly or coupled with E543D, in 293T cells at 37°C and at 33°C. The data are expressed relative to the results for G1/1997-wt. Each data point is the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Double and single asterisks indicate a P value &lt; 0.01 and &lt; 0.05, respectively.</p>
