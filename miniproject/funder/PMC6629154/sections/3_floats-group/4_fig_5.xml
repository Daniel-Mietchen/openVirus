  <title>Replication kinetics of EG/2013 and G1/1997 viruses carrying PB2 mutations in avian and human cells.</title>
  <p>(A-C) Avian DF-1 cells (A) and human Calu-3 cells (B and C) were infected with EG/2013 virus or the indicated PB2 revertants at an MOI of 0.005 and 0.001, respectively, and incubated at 37°C (A and B) or 33°C (C). (D-F) DF-1 cells (D) and Calu-3 cells (E and F) were infected with reassorted G1(3P+NP) virus carrying PB2 (wild-type or with the indicated mutations), PB1, PA and NP from G1/1997, with the other genes from EG/2013, at an MOI of 0.005 and 0.001, respectively, and incubated at 37°C (D and E) or 33°C (F). Virus titers at the indicated times post-infection were determined by FFU assays. Each data point is the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Colors of the arrows above the figures indicate the time periods when the mutations were identified during the evolution of G1-A/B, as shown in
