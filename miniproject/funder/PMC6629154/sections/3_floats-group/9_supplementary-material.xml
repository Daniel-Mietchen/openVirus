  <title>Phylogenetic tree of HA genes of viruses in the H9N2 G1-like subclade isolated in the Middle East and Central Asia, including the G1-A/B reassortant.</title>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from nucleotide sequences of the HA genes of the Middle Eastern and Central Asian reference strains in the GISAID database, the G1-like clade prototype strain G1/1997, the G1-A/B reassortant strain EG/2013, and the Y280-like clade prototype strain A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/1997. CK, DK, QL and TK in virus strain names denote chicken, duck, quail and turkey hosts. Virus particles are shown as ovals with horizontal bars representing the eight gene segments (from top to bottom: PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS). Gene segments in the descendent viruses are colored according to their corresponding source viruses to illustrate gene ancestry through reassortment. Yellow in segment 1 (PB2) indicates phylogeny-associated mutations that contribute to expansion of the viral host range to humans.</p>
