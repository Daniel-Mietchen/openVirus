  <title>Evolutionary pathway of the G1-A/B reassortant in Central Asia and the Middle East.</title>
  <p>(A) Virus particles are shown as ovals with horizontal bars that represent the eight gene segments (from top to bottom: PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS). The segments are colored according to the corresponding source viruses to indicate gene ancestry through reassortment. Yellow in gene segment 1 (PB2) indicates phylogeny-associated mutations that contribute to an expanded host range to humans. (B) Map of the Central Asia and the Middle East showing the phylogeny of G1-like subclades A and B and the G1-A/B reassortant in this study.</p>
