  <title>Location of PB2 mutations on the structure of the trimeric G1/1997 polymerase complex.</title>
  <p>(A and C) Transparent surface diagram of the G1/1997 polymerase complex composed of PB2 (green), PB1 (pink) and PA (blue) with E627V, D543E, A655V and K526R mutations (red). (A) The transcription pre-initiation form (PDB: 4WSB as the modeling template) and (C) the apo form (PDB: 5D98 as the modeling template) are shown. (B and D) Surface view of the PB2 structure in the transcription pre-initiation form (B) and the apo form (D). The left and right PB2 structures show the outer side and the inner side of the polymerase complex, as indicated, and differ by 180Â° in orientation.</p>
