  <title>Virulence and replication of EG/2013 and G1/1997 viruses carrying PB2 mutations in the respiratory tract of infected mice.</title>
  <p>(A and B) Four to five-week-old BALB/c mice (5 mice per group) were inoculated intranasally with 10
   <sup>4</sup> to 10
   <sup>6</sup> FFU EG/2013 and G1(3P+NP) viruses carrying the indicated PB2 mutations. (A) The body weights of the infected mice were monitored daily for 14 dpi. The mean ± SD of the percent of the initial body weight for each group of mice is shown. (B) Survival of the infected mice. Survival was calculated, including mice that were humanely sacrificed after they had lost more than 30% of their body weight within a few days. The time periods when the genotypes were identified are shown above (A). (C) Viral titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates of mice (5 mice per group) infected with 10
   <sup>4</sup> FFU EG/2013 and G1(3P+NP) viruses carrying the PB2 mutations at 3 dpi. Each bar marks the titer in an individual mouse (#1–5). (D, Upper row) Representative low magnification photomicrographs at 3 dpi of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of lungs from mice infected with the indicated viruses. (D, Lower row) Magnified views of photomicrographs in Upper row. (E) Representative photomicrographs at 3 dpi of immunohistochemically stained sections of lungs from mice infected with the indicated viruses. The time periods when the genotypes were identified are shown above D.
