<p>It has been reported that the G1-like subclades were introduced into Central Asia and the Middle East from East Asia after 1998 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. G1-like subclades A and B (G1-A and G1-B) have predominated in birds in these areas and a unique G1-A/B reassortant emerged after 2006 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The G1-A/B reassortant was first identified in Egypt in 2010 and swiftly became endemic in domestic poultry there [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The H5N1 virus has also circulated in Egypt in a wide range of birds [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and caused 67% of the recent human H5N1 infection cases worldwide since 2009 (308 cases, as of 21 September 2018, according to WHO). Egypt is now an epicenter for the generation of novel H9N2 and H5N1 viruses and possible reassortments between these two viruses.
