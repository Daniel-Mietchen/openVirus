<p>The evolutionary dynamics of the H9N2 and H5N1 viruses that co-circulate in the Middle East, centered on Egypt, needs to be understood to facilitate strategies for the control of these viruses. Several studies have reported on the infectivity and transmissibility of the Middle Eastern H5N1 viruses [
