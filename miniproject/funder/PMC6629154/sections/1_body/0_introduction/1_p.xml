<p>The avian influenza (AI) virus H9N2 subtype was first identified in South China in 1994 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. H9N2 viruses have now spread worldwide and, since 1997, have been prevalent in poultry along with the H5N1 virus. H9N2 infections cause a decline in egg production, with occasional high mortality in poultry [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human H9N2 infections have been reported repeatedly, posing a serious threat to public health [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The internal genes of H9N2 viruses are frequently packaged in zoonotic virus reassortants produced from co-infections by H9N2 and other subtype AI viruses (i.e., H5N1 Gs/GD lineage, H7N9, H10N8, H5N8 and H5N6 viruses) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This production of various subtype AI viruses containing H9N2 internal genes with their accumulated mutations raises a concern that H9N2 virus may generate novel reassortants and pandemic viruses.
