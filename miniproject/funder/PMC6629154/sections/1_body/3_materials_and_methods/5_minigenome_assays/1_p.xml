<p>293T and DF-1 cells were transfected with pCAGGS plasmids encoding the PB2, PB1, PA or NP genes of EG/2013 (H9N2), G1/1997 (H9N2), EG/2007 (H5N1) and Sh/2013 (H7N9) and a human or chicken polymerase-I driven plasmid expressing firefly luciferase as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A plasmid expressing 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase was also co-transfected to monitor transfection efficiencies. The transfected cells were incubated at 33°C or 37°C and lysed at 24 h post-transfection. The firefly luciferase activities were normalized relative to 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity.
