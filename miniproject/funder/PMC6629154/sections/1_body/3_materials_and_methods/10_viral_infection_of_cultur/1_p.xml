<p>DF-1 and Calu-3 cells (90% confluent in collagen-coated 24-well plates) were infected in triplicate with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.005 and 0.001, respectively. After 1 h at 37°C, the cells were washed with PBS and maintained in DMEM-F12 containing 0.2% BSA and 2 μg acetylated trypsin/ml (Sigma-Aldrich) at 33°C or 37°C. The supernatants were collected at the indicated times post-infection and viral titers were determined by assays of focus-forming units (FFU) as described previously [
