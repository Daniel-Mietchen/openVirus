<p>Four to five-week-old female BALB/c mice (Japan SLC), under mixed anesthesia (medetomidine-butorphanol-midazolam), were inoculated intranasally with 50 μl samples of 10-fold serial dilutions of viruses in PBS. The body weight and survival of each mouse was monitored daily for 14 d. Mice that lost more than 30% of their original weight within a few days were humanely euthanized. Lungs and nasal turbinates of mice infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU virus were collected 3 dpi and virus titers were assayed by FFU assays. For histopathological analysis, lungs of mice infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU were collected at 3 dpi, fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 μm sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Immunohistochemical straining of viral antigen was performed as described previously [
