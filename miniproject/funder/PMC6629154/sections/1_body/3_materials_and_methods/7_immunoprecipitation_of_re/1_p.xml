<p>For PB2-flag immunoprecipitation, 293T cells in 10 cm dishes were transfected with pCAGGS plasmids encoding PB2-flag, PB1 and PA genes of EG/2013 (H9N2) and G1/1997 (H9N2). Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection in cold PBS and lysed in 700 μl Tris lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL [pH 8.8], 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Igepal, 25% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl) with Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Promega) at 4°C for 40 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 800 g for 5 min. Anti-Flag M2 Agarose Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cleared lysates and they were mixed at 4°C for 2 h. The mixtures were washed 3 times with the Tris lysis buffer and purified PB2-flag, and PB1 and PA were analyzed by western blotting.</p>
