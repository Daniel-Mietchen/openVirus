<p>The sequences of the PB2 and HA gene segments from reference H9N2 strains were obtained from the GISAID database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gisaid.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA6 software for the neighbor-joining method, with the nucleotide sequences of representative strains of the H9N2 G1-like clade from Central Asia and the Middle East, including prototype G1/1997 and EG/2013 viruses, and of A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/1997 as the prototype of the H9N2 Y280-like clade virus. Although a few human and swine H9N2 virus infections have been reported in Central Asia and/or the Middle East, the human- and swine-derived H9N2 sequences were not included in these analyses, because they have not yet been deposited in a pubic database. Confidence levels for phylogenetic trees were calculated by performing 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
