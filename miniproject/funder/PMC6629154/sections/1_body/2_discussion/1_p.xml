<p>The influenza virus H9N2 G1-like clade continues to evolve and expand its geographic host range in Central Asia and the Middle East. These areas include most predominantly Islamic nations, which have significant poultry population but minimal swine production. In contrast, East Asia, centered on China, has large swine production [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to the increasing viral genetic diversity in a wide range of bird species, mainly poultry, it was inevitable that H9N2 G1 viruses would evolve to produce strains with distinct replication phenotypes. In particular, since the G1-A/B reassortant has been prevalent in domestic poultry in Egypt [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with four cases of human infections, Egypt has been an epicenter of H9N2 evolution. This has produced novel viruses that have accumulated mutations and a large gene pool to enable reassortment with other influenza viruses. However, the biological properties of the H9N2 virus and its evolution in the Middle East have remained poorly understood.
