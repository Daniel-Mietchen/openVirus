<p>In conclusion, this study showed that the influenza virus G1-A/B reassortant, that has been prevalent in Egypt, has diversified phylogenetically in the Middle East during its natural evolution and generated a distinct phenotype with an expanded host range to mammals, including humans. Our results highlighted the need for studies of H9N2 viruses to trace their evolutionary dynamics in this area and closely monitor possible genetic changes in these viruses. In addition, implementation of effective control measures may be needed to reduce the risk of a future pandemic.</p>
