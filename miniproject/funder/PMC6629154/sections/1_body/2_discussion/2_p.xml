<p>Here we have elucidated the phylogeny of the G1-like clade in Central Asia and the Middle East and investigated its host range-associated mutations. Our results showed that the G1-like clade strains in these areas accumulated multiple PB2 mutations during their evolution in poultry. Four of the conserved mutations acted cooperatively in a G1-A/B reassortant that had an increased replication capacity in mammalian species. To our knowledge, this study presents the first comprehensive data analyzing the relationship between the phylogeny of the H9N2 virus in the Middle East and its host range expansion to mammals.</p>
