<p>The cooperative effects of E627V, E543D/A655V and K526R on polymerase activity were then investigated. These mutations acted synergistically to increase G1/1997 polymerase activity by &gt; 2 logs in human cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g003">Fig 3A</xref>): the E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R quadruple mutation had the highest polymerase activity, at a level comparable to that of EG/2013-wt. The relative polymerase activities were G1/1997-wt &lt; E627V &lt; E627V/E543D/A655V &lt; E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R = EG/2013-wt. Conversely, the reverse mutations acted cooperatively to decrease EG/2013 polymerase activity by &gt; 2 logs in human cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The R526K/V627E/D543E/V655A mutation had the lowest polymerase activity; i.e., at an undetectable level in minigenome assays that was comparable to that of G1/1997-wt. The relative polymerase activities were EG/2013-wt &gt; R526K = V627E and D543E &gt; R526K/V627E &gt; R526K/V627E/D543E/V655A = G1/1997-wt. The &gt; 2 log difference in polymerase activity between the wild-type and quadruple mutant corresponded to that between EG/2013 and EG/2013-G1/PB2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that the increase in EG/2013 polymerase activity was mostly due to the quadruple mutation. In contrast, in avian cells, the quadruple mutation showed an appreciably lower effect in both the G1/1997 and EG/2013 backgrounds. These results suggested that E627V, E543D/A655V and K526R acted cooperatively to produce the high polymerase activity of the G1-A/B reassortant, which was more prominent in human cells than in avian cells.
