<p>The levels of viral vRNA, cRNA and mRNA syntheses were assayed by vRNA-oriented and cRNA-oriented RNP reconstitution assays in 293T and DF-1 cells. mRNA can be transcribed directly from vRNA in vRNA-oriented RNP reconstitution assays, whereas cRNA must be replicated to vRNA before it can be transcribed to mRNA in the cRNA-oriented RNP reconstitution assays. Therefore, cRNA-oriented RNP reconstitution assays enabled us to directly analyze the effect of polymerase-mediated replication activity [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Strand-specific qRT-PCR showed that, in human cells, G1/1997 RNPs reconstituted with the PB2 forward mutants produced higher levels of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA than wild-type, both in vRNA-oriented and cRNA-oriented RNP reconstitution assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). However, EG/2013 RNPs reconstituted with PB2 reverse mutants produced lower levels of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA than wild-type in vRNA-oriented and cRNA-oriented RNP reconstitution assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g004">Fig 4D–4F</xref>). These mutations had more dramatic effects on vRNA synthesis from cRNA templates than on cRNA synthesis from vRNA templates in the G1/1997 genetic background (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g004">Fig 4A vs 4C</xref>), despite the less dramatic effects observed in the EG/2013 genetic background. In contrast, the mutations had appreciably less effect on viral RNA synthesis in avian cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g004">Fig 4G–4L</xref>). The strand specificity of the qRT-PCR primers was confirmed using

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007919.s005">S5 Fig</xref>): the vRNA primer set detected only &lt;0.01% of both cRNA and mRNA, the cRNA primer set also detected only &lt;0.01% of vRNA and mRNA, and the mRNA primer set detected only &lt;0.01% of vRNA and minimally detected 1.5% of cRNA. In total, these results suggested that the E627V, K526R and E543D/A655V mutations acted cooperatively to increase both transcription and replication activity in the G1-A/B reassortant. This effect was more prominent in human cells than in avian cells.
