<p>In the apo form of the polymerase complex, our model indicated that PB2 residues 543 and 655 were located close together (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). This was in agreement with the results of our minigenome assays and infection studies showing that the two mutations needed to be coupled in the G1/1997 genetic background to produce an appropriate polymerase function. These results suggested that multiple mutations emerged coordinately to structurally optimize the polymerase complex for increased fitness in hosts. Although our structural study was based on a plausible model, future structural analyses based on crystallography, cryo-EM and better defined structural models are needed to investigate the detailed mechanism of polymerase mutations in different functional states, as described elsewhere [
