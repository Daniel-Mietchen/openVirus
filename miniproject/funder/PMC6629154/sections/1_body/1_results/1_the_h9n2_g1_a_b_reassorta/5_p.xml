<p>To investigate the different amount of the effects mediated by V627E and K627E, the effect of K627E was investigated in the EG/2013 background. As with V627E, K627E caused only 1.5-fold and 5.4-fold reductions in polymerase activity (

These results indicated that the levels of EG/2007 (H5N1) and Sh/2013 (H7N9) polymerase activity were mediated by E627K, but the higher polymerase activity of EG/2013 (H9N2) was not fully dependent on E627V. Western blotting analysis confirmed similar expression of wild-type PB2 and the K/V627E mutants (
