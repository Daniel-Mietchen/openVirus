<p>G1-A/B reassortants, including EG/2013, generally carry the PB2-E627V mutation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which has been recently identified as a mammalian-adaptation mutation in H5N1 clade 2.3.4 viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, this mutation has not been studied in the H9N2 background. The effect of the PB2-V627E reverse mutation on EG/2013 polymerase activity was investigated by minigenome assays at 37°C and 33°C, which are temperatures characteristic of the human lower and upper respiratory tract, respectively. For comparison, we investigated the effect of the PB2-K627E reverse mutation on the polymerase activity of EG/2007 (H5N1) and Sh/2013 (H7N9). The PB2-K627E reverse mutation decreased EG/2007 (H5N1) polymerase activity by &gt; 2 logs at 37°C and 33°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). A similar effect was observed in the Sh/2013 (H7N9) background, with a l-3 log reduction. In contrast, EG/2013 (H9N2) polymerase activity was barely affected by the PB2-V627E reverse mutation, with only 1.3-fold and 3.7-fold reductions at 37°C and 33°C, respectively.
