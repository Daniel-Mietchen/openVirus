<p>However, the apparently distinct antigenicity of the different virus subtypes prevented our direct comparison of the PB2 expression levels of EG/2007 (H5N1), sh/2013 (H7N9) and EG/2013 (H9N2). Therefore, the expression of PB2-flag, which was not affected by PB2 antigenic properties was analyzed further. The PB2-flag expression levels of EG/2007 (H5N1) and EG/2013 (H9N2) were similar, although they were higher than sh/2013 (H7N9) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, input). These data indicated that the K/V627E substitutions did not affect PB2 expression levels and that the higher polymerase activity of EG/2013 (H9N2) was not due to a higher PB2 expression level than in the other AI viruses. Taken together, these results suggested that other PB2 mutations, that had accumulated during the evolution of H9N2 G1-A/B, may contribute to EG/2013 polymerase activity in human cells.
