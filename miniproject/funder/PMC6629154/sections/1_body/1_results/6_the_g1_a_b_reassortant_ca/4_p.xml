<p>Pathology studies were carried out on the lungs of infected mice collected at 3 dpi. Ancestral genotype G1(3P+NP) and EG/2013
 <sub>V627E/D543E/V655A/R526K</sub> viruses caused a weak inflammatory response in the lungs of the infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). However, current genotype EG/2013-wt and G1(3P+NP)
 <sub>E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R</sub> viruses induced notably more severe bronchitis, bronchiolitis and localized bronchointerstitial pneumonia, characterized by occasional foci of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis, multifocal hemorrhage, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Intermediate group EG/2013
 <sub>V627E</sub> and G1(3P+NP)
 <sub>E627V</sub> viruses caused minimal to mild bronchitis or bronchiolitis in infected mice, indicating an intermediate phenotype. The degree of histopathological changes generally corresponded to the amount of H5 antigen detected by immunohistochemistry in the bronchial and bronchiolar areas of the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Collectively, these results confirmed that the PB2-E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R quadruple mutation produced the most fitness for viral replication in human cells and suggested that the quadruple mutation contributed to an expanded adaptability of the G1-A/B reassortant in mammalian species
