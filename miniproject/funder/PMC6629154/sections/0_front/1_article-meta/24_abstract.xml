 <p>The G1-like clade of H9N2 influenza viruses can undergo genetic reassortment with other influenza virus subtypes to produce novel zoonotic viruses, such as the Gs/GD lineage H5N1, H7N9, H10N8, and H5N8 viruses. Since 1998, the G1-like subclade of H9N2 influenza virus has been widely circulating in birds in Central Asia and the Middle East and a number of human cases have been reported. However, little is known about the biological properties of H9N2 viruses in this epicentre of infection. Our data showed that, during about two decades of evolution in nature, G1-like subclade strains evolved to produce strains with appreciably higher replication phenotypes in Central Asia and the Middle East, which led to their expanded host range, including to humans. Therefore, G1-like subclade strains in these areas may accumulate mutations to produce novel viruses and the large gene pool in these areas would enable reassortment with other influenza viruses. This study indicated the need for studies of H9N2 viruses in such areas to monitor their evolutionary dynamics and possible genetic changes.</p>
