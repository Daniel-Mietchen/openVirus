Despite concerns about the pandemic threat posed by H9N2, little is known about the biological properties of H9N2 in this epicentre of infection. Here, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of H9N2 in the Middle East and identified phylogeny-associated PB2 mutations that acted cooperatively to increase H9N2 replication/transcription in human cells. The accumulation of PB2 mutations also correlated with an increase in H9N2 virus growth in the upper and lower airways of mice and in virulence. These mutations clustered on a solvent-exposed region in the PB2-627 domain in proximity to potential interfaces with host factors. These PB2 mutations have been found at high prevalence during evolution of H9N2 in the field, indicating that they have provided a selective advantage for viral adaptation to infect poultry. Therefore, continuous prevalence of H9N2 virus in the Middle East has generated a far more fit or optimized replication phenotype, leading to an expanded viral host range, including to mammals, which may pose public health risks beyond the current outbreaks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The G1-like clade of H9N2 influenza viruses can undergo genetic reassortment with other influenza virus subtypes to produce novel zoonotic viruses, such as the Gs/GD lineage H5N1, H7N9, H10N8, and H5N8 viruses. Since 1998, the G1-like subclade of H9N2 influenza virus has been widely circulating in birds in Central Asia and the Middle East and a number of human cases have been reported. However, little is known about the biological properties of H9N2 viruses in this epicentre of infection. Our data showed that, during about two decades of evolution in nature, G1-like subclade strains evolved to produce strains with appreciably higher replication phenotypes in Central Asia and the Middle East, which led to their expanded host range, including to humans. Therefore, G1-like subclade strains in these areas may accumulate mutations to produce novel viruses and the large gene pool in these areas would enable reassortment with other influenza viruses. This study indicated the need for studies of H9N2 viruses in such areas to monitor their evolutionary dynamics and possible genetic changes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR15F4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsumoto</surname><given-names>Kazuhiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>15H05295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8305-6952</contrib-id><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Yohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>18K15171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>Yasuha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8305-6952</contrib-id><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Yohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003485</institution-id><institution>Heiwa Nakajima Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8305-6952</contrib-id><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Yohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from Japan Science Society</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>Yasuha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution>the JSPS Core-to-Core Program</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakaya</surname><given-names>Takaaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award008"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan</institution></funding-source><award-id>19H04841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8305-6952</contrib-id><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>Yohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by CREST (to KM) from Japan Science and Technology Agency (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/index.html">http://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/index.html</ext-link>; Grant Number JPMJCR15F4), partly by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research B (to YW), Young Scientists B (to YA) and Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (to YW) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html">https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html</ext-link>; Grant Numbers 15H05295, 18K15171 and 19H04841, respectively), and partly by grants from the Takeda Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.takeda-sci.or.jp/">http://www.takeda-sci.or.jp/</ext-link>; [to YW]), the Heiwa Nakajima Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hnf.jp/">http://www.hnf.jp/</ext-link>; [to YW]), and a Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jss.or.jp/en/">https://www.jss.or.jp/en/</ext-link>; [to YA]), and partly by the JSPS Core-to-Core Program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-c2c/index.html">https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-c2c/index.html</ext-link>; [to TN]).

H9N2 viruses have now spread worldwide and, since 1997, have been prevalent in poultry along with the H5N1 virus. H9N2 infections cause a decline in egg production, with occasional high mortality in poultry [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human H9N2 infections have been reported repeatedly, posing a serious threat to public health [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The internal genes of H9N2 viruses are frequently packaged in zoonotic virus reassortants produced from co-infections by H9N2 and other subtype AI viruses (i.e., H5N1 Gs/GD lineage, H7N9, H10N8, H5N8 and H5N6 viruses) [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This production of various subtype AI viruses containing H9N2 internal genes with their accumulated mutations raises a concern that H9N2 virus may generate novel reassortants and pandemic viruses.</p><p>H9N2 virus strains are classified in Eurasian and American lineages. The Eurasian lineage is divided into several clades, with the majority of strains classified in G1-like and Y280-like clades. G1-like clade viruses have mainly circulated in South China, Central Asia and the Middle East and are represented by the prototype A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 virus. The G1-like clade in Central Asia and the Middle East has diversified further into four co-circulating subclades (designated A-D), with occasional intra-subclade reassortments [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The Y280-like clade viruses have spread throughout China and are represented by the prototype A/duck/Hong Kong/Y280/1997 virus.</p><p>It has been reported that the G1-like subclades were introduced into Central Asia and the Middle East from East Asia after 1998 [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and spread among poultry in a number of countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Israel, Jordan and Egypt [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. G1-like subclades A and B (G1-A and G1-B) have predominated in birds in these areas and a unique G1-A/B reassortant emerged after 2006 [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The G1-A/B reassortant was first identified in Egypt in 2010 and swiftly became endemic in domestic poultry there [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus far, four cases of human H9N2 infections have been reported in Egypt [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The H5N1 virus has also circulated in Egypt in a wide range of birds [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and caused 67% of the recent human H5N1 infection cases worldwide since 2009 (308 cases, as of 21 September 2018, according to WHO). Egypt is now an epicenter for the generation of novel H9N2 and H5N1 viruses and possible reassortments between these two viruses.</p><p>The evolutionary dynamics of the H9N2 and H5N1 viruses that co-circulate in the Middle East, centered on Egypt, needs to be understood to facilitate strategies for the control of these viruses. Several studies have reported on the infectivity and transmissibility of the Middle Eastern H5N1 viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and characterized their human-adaptation signatures [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

The biological properties of these viruses remain largely unknown.</p><p>We previously reported that the H9N2 G1-A/B reassortant isolated in Egypt replicates to markedly high titers in human cells and in mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], indicating that the H9N2 virus may expand its host range to mammals. In this study, we investigated all phylogeny associated-mutations that have accumulated during H9N2 evolution in the Middle East and/or Central Asia, and the effect of these mutations on the biological properties of the H9N2 virus, including its adaptation to infect humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The H9N2 G1-A/B reassortant PB2 gene contributed to higher polymerase activity in human cells than other zoonotic influenza viruses</title><p>In our previous study, we found that a representative strain of the G1-A/B reassortant, A/chicken/Egypt/CL42/2013 (H9N2) (referred to here as EG/2013), replicated at a high level in human cells and in mice.

A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 (G1/1997) (H9N2) is the prototype virus of the G1-like clade. A/duck/Egypt/D1Br/2007 (EG/2007) (H5N1) is an ancestral strain of clade 2.2.1 that is unique to Egypt: most clade 2.2.1 field isolates, including EG/2007, have the PB2-E627K mutation [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A/Shanghai/1/2013 (Sh/2013) (H7N9) is an ancestral strain of a novel H7N9 virus that has six internal genes derived from an H9N2 virus: some human H7N9 isolates, including Sh/2013, have acquired the PB2-E627K mutation [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Minigenome assays showed that the EG/2013 (H9N2) polymerase complex (PB2, PB1, PA and NP) had significantly higher polymerase activity in 293T cells than that of the three other AI viruses in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To determine which polymerase subunits contribute to the high polymerase activity of EG/2013, the polymerase activity of polymerase complexes composed of different combinations of the polymerase subunits of EG/2013 and ancestral G1/1997 were examined.

Similar amounts of PB1 and PA in these polymerase complexes were co-immunoprecipitated with PB2, verifying that reassortment did not affect trimeric complex formation.

However, this mutation has not been studied in the H9N2 background. The effect of the PB2-V627E reverse mutation on EG/2013 polymerase activity was investigated by minigenome assays at 37&#x000b0;C and 33&#x000b0;C, which are temperatures characteristic of the human lower and upper respiratory tract, respectively. For comparison, we investigated the effect of the PB2-K627E reverse mutation on the polymerase activity of EG/2007 (H5N1) and Sh/2013 (H7N9). The PB2-K627E reverse mutation decreased EG/2007 (H5N1) polymerase activity by &#x0003e; 2 logs at 37&#x000b0;C and 33&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). A similar effect was observed in the Sh/2013 (H7N9) background, with a l-3 log reduction. In contrast, EG/2013 (H9N2) polymerase activity was barely affected by the PB2-V627E reverse mutation, with only 1.3-fold and 3.7-fold reductions at 37&#x000b0;C and 33&#x000b0;C, respectively.</p><p>To investigate the different amount of the effects mediated by V627E and K627E, the effect of K627E was investigated in the EG/2013 background. As with V627E, K627E caused only 1.5-fold and 5.4-fold reductions in polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), indicating that the effects of K627E and V627E on EG/2013 polymerase activity were similar. These results indicated that the levels of EG/2007 (H5N1) and Sh/2013 (H7N9) polymerase activity were mediated by E627K, but the higher polymerase activity of EG/2013 (H9N2) was not fully dependent on E627V. Western blotting analysis confirmed similar expression of wild-type PB2 and the K/V627E mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p><p>However, the apparently distinct antigenicity of the different virus subtypes prevented our direct comparison of the PB2 expression levels of EG/2007 (H5N1), sh/2013 (H7N9) and EG/2013 (H9N2). Therefore, the expression of PB2-flag, which was not affected by PB2 antigenic properties was analyzed further. The PB2-flag expression levels of EG/2007 (H5N1) and EG/2013 (H9N2) were similar, although they were higher than sh/2013 (H7N9) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007919.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

These data indicated that the K/V627E substitutions did not affect PB2 expression levels and that the higher polymerase activity of EG/2013 (H9N2) was not due to a higher PB2 expression level than in the other AI viruses. Taken together, these results suggested that other PB2 mutations, that had accumulated during the evolution of H9N2 G1-A/B, may contribute to EG/2013 polymerase activity in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>The G1-A/B reassortant has accumulated multiple PB2 mutations during its evolution in the Middle East</title><p>To trace evolution of the PB2 gene in the G1-A/B reassortant, we analyzed the phylogeny of PB2 genes, including the PB2 genes of the G1-like prototype A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/1997 and the descendant G1-like subclades that were isolated in Central Asia and the Middle East from 1998 to 2015, including EG/2013. The PB2 genes in viruses isolated in Central Asia and the Middle East clustered in several groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

The topology of the PB2 and HA gene phylogenetic trees indicated a major intra-subclade reassortment between G1-A and G1-B viruses. It has been reported that the G1-A/B reassortant emerged in Israel and Jordan, with the PB2, PB1, PA and NP genes from G1-A and the other genes from G1-B, and has become dominant there since 2006 [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

The G1-like subclades in Central Asia and the Middle East were mostly isolated from chickens, but also from birds, including turkeys, quails, ducks, ostriches, pheasants and pigeons. The isolates from each bird species were interspersed throughout the H9N2 phylogenetic tree without distinct clustering, indicating a wide dispersion of these viruses in birds in these geographic areas.</p><fig id="ppat.1007919.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007919.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Phylogeny of the PB2 gene in H9N2 G1-like subclades isolated in the Middle East and Central Asia.</title><p>(A) Phylogenetic tree of the PB2 genes of H9N2 G1-like subclades isolated in the Middle East and Central Asia, including the G1-A/B reassortant.

As a reference, a reassorted polymerase complex composed of PB2 from G1/1997 and PB1, PA and NP from EG/2013 (referred to here as EG/2013-G1/PB2) was included in these assays. In avian cells at 37&#x000b0;C, none of the single reverse mutations had a significant effect on EG/2013 polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). In contrast, in human cells at 33&#x000b0;C, the D543E and R526K reverse mutations decreased the EG/2013 polymerase activity to levels comparable to that of the V627E reverse mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The effect was greater when the mutation was combined with V627E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The K190R and T643S reverse mutations only showed moderate effects when combined with V627E. The polymerase activity of these single revertants was higher than that of the reference EG/2013-G1/PB2, indicating that multiple mutations contributed to the high polymerase activity of the G1-A/B reassortant.

These PB2 mutants had equivalent expression levels, although there were some small statistically insignificant changes in these levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007919.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). There was no apparent difference in PB2 expression between the wild-type and the mutants with appreciably reduced polymerase activity (i.e., V627E, D543E, R526K, K190R and T643S), indicating that their lower polymerase activity was not due to a decrease in PB2 expression. Together, these results suggested that the reverse mutations of the phylogeny-associated PB2 mutations in this study, singly and together with V627E, decreased EG/2013 polymerase activity in human cells to a greater degree at the lower 33&#x000b0;C temperature.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>PB2-E627V/E543D/A655V/K526R mutations acted cooperatively to produce the high polymerase activity of the G1-A/B reassortant in human cells</title><p>Based on the effects of the reverse mutations in the EG/2013 background, we selected three PB2 mutations (i.e., E627V, E543D and K526R) for further study and introduced them as forward mutations into the ancestral G1/1997 background to assess their effects on polymerase activity.

These areas include most predominantly Islamic nations, which have significant poultry population but minimal swine production. In contrast, East Asia, centered on China, has large swine production [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Regional clustering has led to the establishment of distinct influenza virus G1-like subclades (A-D), with subclade A and B strains most prevalent in the strains co-circulating in the Middle East [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to the increasing viral genetic diversity in a wide range of bird species, mainly poultry, it was inevitable that H9N2 G1 viruses would evolve to produce strains with distinct replication phenotypes. In particular, since the G1-A/B reassortant has been prevalent in domestic poultry in Egypt [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with four cases of human infections, Egypt has been an epicenter of H9N2 evolution. This has produced novel viruses that have accumulated mutations and a large gene pool to enable reassortment with other influenza viruses. However, the biological properties of the H9N2 virus and its evolution in the Middle East have remained poorly understood.</p><p>Here we have elucidated the phylogeny of the G1-like clade in Central Asia and the Middle East and investigated its host range-associated mutations. Our results showed that the G1-like clade strains in these areas accumulated multiple PB2 mutations during their evolution in poultry. Four of the conserved mutations acted cooperatively in a G1-A/B reassortant that had an increased replication capacity in mammalian species. To our knowledge, this study presents the first comprehensive data analyzing the relationship between the phylogeny of the H9N2 virus in the Middle East and its host range expansion to mammals.</p><p>In this study, the PB2 E627V, E543D, A655V and K526R mutations acted cooperatively and produced increased replication of the G1-A/B reassortant in human cells and mice. However, the PB2-R190K and S643T mutations only had marginal effects. This was consistent with the hypothesis that the H9N2 virus PB2 gene was a key determinant in the host adaptation of AI viruses to mammals [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The G1-like clade accumulated the E627V, E543D, A655V and R190K mutations during phylogenetic branching from the ancestral G1-like clade to form the G1-A subclade in the Middle East (1997&#x02013;1999) (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007919.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The S643T mutation occurred during the time G1-A was prevalent in Israel and Jordan (1999&#x02013;2006), and the K526R mutation occurred during the emergence of the G1-A/B reassortant in this area in about 2006. The resulting G1-A/B reassortant has retained all these mutations and has been prevalent in Egypt since 2010. This indicated that these phylogeny-associated PB2 mutations provided a selective advantage for adaptation of G1-like clade strains to poultry during its evolution in the field. Indeed, these mutations, singly and especially in combination, produced a moderate increase in G1/1997 polymerase activity and replication in avian cells, which may have led to the current prevalence of the G1-A/B reassortant in Egyptian poultry. H9N2 virus adaptation to poultry could have facilitated expansion of the viral host range, including infection of humans and other mammals [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The G1-like clade also has the ability to infect a wide range of host species, including wild birds, pigeons, pigs and humans [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which may have generated more complicated phenotypes in the field. Taken together, these findings suggested that the G1-A/B reassortant evolved to produce strains with diverse phenotypes in the Middle East, which led to its expanded host range, including to humans.</p><fig id="ppat.1007919.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007919.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Evolutionary pathway of the G1-A/B reassortant in Central Asia and the Middle East.</title><p>(A) Virus particles are shown as ovals with horizontal bars that represent the eight gene segments (from top to bottom: PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS).

PB2-E627V has been recently shown to increase H5N1 virus replication in human cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, PB2-K526R is known to be linked to human adaptation [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and has been found in human infections by Asian H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The K526R mutation has been occasionally found together with E627K and these two mutations have been shown to act cooperatively in mammalian adaptation in the H7N9 background [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. All AI viruses in birds in Asia retain 627E and 526K. In contrast, Middle Eastern avian H9N2 viruses have commonly accumulated both E627V and K526R during evolution of the G1-A/B reassortant, thereby increasing viral adaptation in birds and mammalian species. Also, the H5N1 clade 2.2.1 virus that is unique to Egypt has generally accumulated E627K in the field [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. An important question is what has driven the distinct evolutionary dynamics of the H9N2 and H5N1 viruses between the Middle East and Asia. It is possible that an early compensatory or enabling mutation(s) (e.g., A655V) in the Middle Eastern G1 lineage allowed the accumulation of adaptive mutations distinct from those observed in other avian influenza virus lineages. Selective pressure in the Middle East may differ from that in Asia. However, it is difficult to identify specific determinant(s) because multiple uncertainties have contributed to AI epidemics, including changes in environmental, behavioral, and social factors and changes in the poultry trade [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Also, the S543F mutation, but not the E543D mutation, was recently suggested to be linked to human adaption of H7N9 viruses by a prospective approach to deep mutational scanning [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A655V has not been previously described as an adaptation mutation in AI viruses, including H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 viruses.</p><p>The exact mechanism of the effects of the PB2 mutations identified in this study remains unknown. These mutations clustered on the surface of the PB2 627 domain, which is a solvent-exposed region of the polymerase complex in both its transcription pre-initiation form and apo form.

It is also possible that the mutations may not make direct contact with host factor(s), but may affect PB2 flexibility to enable other viral domains to promote interactions with host factor(s). In addition, in this study, the higher mortality and severe weight loss of mice infected with these influenza virus adaptation mutations was in agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing higher polymerase activity and viral RNA synthesis and virus titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates. This indicated that increased replication fitness contributed to high influenza virus virulence in mice. However, several studies reported that influenza A virus polymerase can produce additional viral RNA products, often called aberrant RNAs, which trigger an innate immune response [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, there remains the possibility that the more active mutant polymerases may produce more of these aberrant RNAs, which may be partially associated with the higher virulence of the adaptive mutants in this study in infected mice.</p><p>The H9N2 virus and the H5N1 clade 2.2.1 viruses have been prevalent in poultry in Egypt, which has provided the opportunity for reassortment between the two viruses. Fortunately, the emergence of H9N2/H5N1 reassortants has not been reported in Egypt thus far. However, we recently reported that Egyptian H9N2 and H5N1 viruses have a high genetic compatibility and a substantial potential to generate reassortants with greater fitness in mammalian species than the parental viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The results of this study suggested that, if an H5N1 clade 2.2.1 virus successfully recruited the G1-A/B PB2 gene, such reassortants may pose an infection threat beyond the current outbreaks in the Middle East. The G1-A/B reassortant has an increased replication ability in human cells at 33&#x000b0;C and in the upper respiratory tract of mice. This implied that an exposure to fewer G1-A/B reassortant viruses may establish an infection in the respiratory tract of a mammalian species, greatly increasing the likelihood of a co-infection and reassortment with a seasonal human or swine influenza virus in the upper airway. The G1-A/B reassortant has an HA-Q226L mutation (H3 numbering) that increased viral binding affinity to human respiratory epithelia [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In view of this concern, it should be noted that seroepidemiological studies have indicated substantial exposure of humans and pigs to both H5N1 and H9N2 viruses in Egypt [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A high level of genetic compatibility between H9N2 and seasonal H1N1 2009 viruses also has been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007919.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggested that the Middle East, with an epicenter in Egypt, is now a hot spot of H9N2 and H5N1 virus evolution, which may generate novel viruses presenting an increased public health risk.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that the influenza virus G1-A/B reassortant, that has been prevalent in Egypt, has diversified phylogenetically in the Middle East during its natural evolution and generated a distinct phenotype with an expanded host range to mammals, including humans. Our results highlighted the need for studies of H9N2 viruses to trace their evolutionary dynamics in this area and closely monitor possible genetic changes in these viruses. In addition, implementation of effective control measures may be needed to reduce the risk of a future pandemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Supplies, Japan.
