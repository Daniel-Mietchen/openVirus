<p>Women were evaluated by the high-risk obstetrics team when confirmed or probable ZIKV infection was identified. Clinical evaluations, laboratory tests, and ultrasound (US) examinations were performed according to the established standard of care. Serological tests (IgG/IgM) for DENV and CHKV were used when possible to rule out co-infection with other arboviruses. Amniocentesis at 20â€“26 weeks of gestation with ZIKV RT-PCR testing of amniotic fluid was offered to all the mothers with probable or confirmed ZIKV infection. If any abnormality was identified during prenatal US examination, fetal MRI was performed. In addition, neonatal urine, serum, and saliva were sent for ZIKV testing. If microcephaly or other neurodevelopment abnormalities were detected at birth, diagnostic molecular tests for TORCH infections and a case history of participants were used to rule out other possible causes of microcephaly.</p>
