<p>Pregnant women were eligible for recruitment when transferred to referral hospitals for the reasons specified above. At recruitment, we collected demographic data, including maternal birth date, birth country, ZIKV exposure country, presence of symptoms, and departure and return dates from ZIKV endemic area. Likewise, blood and/or urine ZIKV samples were collected and analyzed via RT-PCR commercial assay (RealStar® Zika Virus RT-PCR kit 1.0, Altona Diagnostics), ZIKV-IgG, and ZIKV-IgM (IIFT Arboviral fever Mosaic IgG and IgM, Euroimmun, Germany from 2016 to December 2017; and ELISA Virus Zika IgG and IgM, Euroimmun, Germany, from December 2017 to the end of study) (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00352-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). If ZIKV RT-PCR was negative but ZIKV-IgG tested positive, specimens were sent to the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII, Madrid, Spain) for ZIKV-PRNT. However, ISCIII was not able to perform specific PRNT for DENV; consequently, positive or equivocal ZIKV-PRNT titers were not compared with DENV-PRNT results. Neutralization titer ≥1/32 was considered indicative of the presence of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies. The date of ZIKV test was considered to be the date of diagnosis for ZIKV infection.
