<p>Screening for ZIKV occurred at a median (IQR) of 21 (14–30) gestational weeks. Median [IQR] time of mother’s exposure at risk for ZIKV during pregnancy was 86 (31–162) days. Twenty-four pregnant women (24/163; 14.7%) were classified as having confirmed ZIKV infection, of whom 14 tested positive for ZIKV RT-PCR, and ten tested positive for ZIKV-IgM and the ZIKV plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The rest of the participants were classified as probable maternal ZIKV infection (139/163; 85.3%). From the whole group, 70% were asymptomatic, and only 21% of women with probable ZIKV infection had symptoms compared to 83% of the 24 women with confirmed ZIKV infection (p&lt;0.0001). Rash was the most prevalent clinical finding (78%), followed by fever (67%) and arthralgia (64%). Amniocentesis was performed in 30 women (19%), mostly in the group with confirmed infections (16/24; 70%). Amniotic fluid ZIKV RT-PCR was positive in two of the cases with CZS, the rest tested negative. Additionally, among 114 women screened for DENV infection, 109 tested positive for DENV-IgG, and eight also tested positive for DENV-IgM during pregnancy. From the 72 women screened for chikungunya virus (CHKV), 27 tested positive for CHKV-IgG, and three of these women had a positive CHKV-IgM result. One woman was found positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as ZIKV, but had an HIV-uninfected infant who was healthy at birth and throughout follow-up. No other active infections were detected among participants.</p>
