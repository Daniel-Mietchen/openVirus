<p>This section details the results based on 142 women who delivered 143 live-birth children (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00352-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The median (IQR) duration of follow-up of the infants was 31 (IQR 13–50) weeks, with a maximum follow-up time of 798 days. During the follow-up, 9.8% (14/143) (95%CI: 5.5–15.9%) infants had adverse outcomes. There were three cases of CZS (two live-birth, one stillbirth), all born to mothers with ZIKV-confirmed infection. The overall incidence of CZS was 2.1% (95%CI: 0.4–6.0%), and 15.8% (3/19) (95%CI: 3.4–39.6%) among ZIKV-confirmed mothers. Eleven children had other potentially Zika-related outcomes (OPZRO): five (3.5%) were diagnosed with mild hearing loss using a sequence of automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) tests (one subsequently diagnosed with language impairment at 24 months of age) and six infants had abnormal neuroimaging results using either MRI or ultrasound CNS scans (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00352-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Other congenital infections were ruled out for all cases, including congenital CMV infection through viral load test in urine or saliva. None of the children with OPZRO presented with any abnormal neurological development after birth. None of the three CZS cases tested positive for ZIKV-IgM or ZIKV RT-PCR (blood, urine, CSF, and saliva) in the postnatal period. ZIKV-IgG was initially positive for the two live-born CZS cases, but seroreversion was observed in both after the first 12 months of life. Of note, the 22q11 deletion syndrome case detected was excluded from the OPZRO group because there is no evidence to associate this pathology with ZIKV infection among children.
