<p>To our knowledge, this is the first prospective cohort study of mothers and their children exposed to ZIKV in an endemic area due to travel, who were diagnosed and followed-up in an European country. The fact that the study was conducted in nine referral hospitals, most of them located in the two biggest cities of Spain (Madrid and Barcelona), likely facilitated the recruitment of most ZIKV-infected pregnant women in Spain during the study period. In addition, the participation of a diverse range of health professionals demonstrates the need for a multidisciplinary approach to researching this newly emerged congenital infection. In this manner, this study capitalized on the screening program in Spain during the ZIKV epidemics in Latin America. </p>
