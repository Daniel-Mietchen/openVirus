<p>The results show that the great majority of our participants had been born in ZIKV endemic countries (95.7%), mainly Latin American and Caribbean countries. It was found that 70% were asymptomatic, and 14.7% classified as confirmed ZIKV. Interestingly, the RT-PCR assay remained positive beyond the first fifteen days after arriving in Spain in 58% of women with confirmed ZIKV. This result is consistent with previous observations and likely to be associated with a prolonged viremia [

In addition, nearly 10% of the children born to mothers with confirmed or probable maternal ZIKV infection had neurologic and hearing adverse outcomes possibly associated with ZIKV exposure. This result supports published observations from a number of different countries such as United States [

 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but it is much lower than the 42% observed in the Rio de Janeiro cohort [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Regarding audiological tests, 3.5% of children had abnormal results, which is a smaller proportion compared to the from a Brazilian cohort [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but significant in relation to the results of a study in USA in which all ZIKV exposed infants of traveler pregnant women passed the test [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, this percentage is 7-fold higher compared to rates of hearing loss in the general child population of 5 per 1000 live births in Spain [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, it has to be noted that without longer-term follow-up we cannot infer the proportion of these children who will definitively have audiological adverse outcomes, or rule out the possibility of delayed hearing problems in children with normal results to date.
