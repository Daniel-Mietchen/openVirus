<p>It is important to note that similar to other studies, this cohort faced important challenges with respect to ZIKV laboratory diagnosis, including the short period for the detection of the ZIKV RNA [
 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and cross-reactivity in serological assays for ZIKV and DENV [
 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, this research faced the lack of a gold standard serological test to determine the exact onset of ZIKV infection and the ability to exclude other flavivirus infections such as DENV [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our national referral laboratory ISCIII in Madrid lacked the infrastructure to be able to perform any PRNT for other flaviviruses. Other limitations included difficulties in following up all the screened pregnant women, precluding comparison of pregnancy outcomes in ZIKV-infected women and in an uninfected control group. We were also unable to confirm the maternal ZIKV diagnosis in most cases, giving a much lower sample compared to other cohorts [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00352" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Finally, although we were able to assess frequency of OPZRO among exposed children with respect to audiological and neurological adverse outcomes, we had insufficient information regarding circumstances around elective or spontaneous abortions to be able to classify these outcomes.
