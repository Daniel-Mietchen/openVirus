Consequently, the government implemented ZIKV surveillance of all pregnancies, as part of antenatal and maternal care, including women coming from or having travelled to epidemic regions. Here, we report findings from the PedZikaRed study, which was set up in Spain to take advantage of this unique opportunity to study ZIKV infection during pregnancy and infant outcomes in a setting where ZIKV was not circulating. </p>
