<p>In conclusion, among children born to pregnant women with confirmed or probable ZIKV infection we found that nearly one in ten had neurologic and hearing adverse outcomes; where maternal ZIKV infection was confirmed, this risk increased slightly to 15.8%. All three of the CZS cases occurred when the mother was infected early in pregnancy. There is a need for continued and long-term follow-up of children born to infected mothers to assess the incidence and define the characteristics of any potential late-onset manifestations.</p>
