  <title>Virus growth of parental and WNV glycosylation mutant viruses.</title>
  <p>(A) mosquito cells (C6/36) (B) HD11 cells (C) DEF cells at 37°C and (D) DEF cells at 44°C inoculated at an MOI of 0. 1. Supernatants were collected at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi (C6/36 and HD11 cells) and 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi (DEF cells), diluted 1:10 and stored until titration using a standard plaque assay. Viral titers were reported in log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and plotted against hours post-inoculation. Viral titers were statistically analyzed via a one-way ANOVA and asterisks represent significant differences with a p-value of &lt;0.05. LODs are shown by dashed lines.
