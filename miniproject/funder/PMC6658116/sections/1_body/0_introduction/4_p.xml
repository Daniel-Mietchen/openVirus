<p>Many of the newly emergent and more virulent WNV strains, including the North American isolates, possess the E protein N-linked glycosylation motif (NYS) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous reports have focused on preclusion of E protein glycosylation by mutagenizing NYS to IYS and AYS both of which have not been associated with any WNV isolate[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the effect of naturally occurring WNV amino acid polymorphisms on maintenance of transmission cycles has not been investigated. Four glycosylation motif sequences found in naturally occurring isolates from North America, Australia, Europe and Africa (NYP, NYF, SYS, KYS, Aâ€™Del)[

An additional WNV glycosylation mutant virus (NYT) was generated that was designed to alter the amino acid at E-156 while maintaining a glycosylation competent motif. An SYP mutant was generated as a double mutant in order to serve as a control, where both the first (E-154) and third amino acid (E-156) residues were mutagenized. Avian host, vector competence and viral growth capacity of these WNV infectious clone-derived glycosylation mutant viruses were assessed
