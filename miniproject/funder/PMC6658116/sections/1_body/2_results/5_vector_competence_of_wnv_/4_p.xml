 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> were intrathoracically (IT) inoculated with NYS or mutant viruses, NYT, NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP, KYS and Aâ€™DEL to assess viral growth and transmission potential independent of the midgut infection barrier. No significant (p&gt;0.05) differences were observed in infection rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) or mean body titers (100% for all viruses; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) for any WNV in IT-inoculated mosquitoes. No significant differences (p&gt;0.05) were observed in transmission rates among the viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Mean viral saliva titers for NYS inoculated mosquitoes were not significantly (p&gt;0.05) different from NYT inoculated mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g006">Fig 6D</xref>); however, both NYS and NYT viruses had significantly higher mean saliva titers (p&lt;0.05) than NYP. Mean saliva NYP viral titers were also significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than those of NYF, SYP and KYS infected mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> passaging data revealed the stability of the introduced mutations at E154-156 after five passages in C6/36 cells, therefore viral sequencing was not performed on any mosquito samples.
