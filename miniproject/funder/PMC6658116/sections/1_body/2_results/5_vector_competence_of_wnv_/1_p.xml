 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> were orally exposed to WNV parental (NYS) and mutant viruses, NYT, NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP and KYS, in order to examine the effect of the variable glycosylation motifs on mosquito infectivity and subsequent transmissibility. Oral infectivity for the parental NYS virus (36%) was significantly lower (p&lt;0.005) than that of the NYT mutant (68%) and significantly higher (p&lt;0.005) than the NYP infection rate of 6% (

The infection rate for NYP was significantly lower (p&lt;0.005) than all the other viruses. Among the remainder of the nonglycosylated viruses, the SYS (56%) infection rate was significantly higher than NYF (p&lt;0.05) and KYS (p&lt;0.005). Oral infectivity between Aâ€™DEL* (10%) and NYS* (20%), performed at a lower oral input titer due to the restricted growth of the deletion mutant (A'DEL) in cell culture, were not significantly different.
