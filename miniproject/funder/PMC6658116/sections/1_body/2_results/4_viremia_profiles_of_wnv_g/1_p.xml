<p>The viremia response to the different mutants was evaluated in an alternative avian species, HOSPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In concordance with the AMCR viremia data, the NYF non-glycosylated mutant developed statistically indistinguishable mean peak viral loads compared to the glycosylated (NYS/NYT) viruses (p&gt;0.1). In contrast, despite developing high viremias in AMCRs, the SYS mutant was debilitated in the HOSPs, producing a ~500-fold lower mean peak viral titer when compared to the NYS virus (p&lt;0.05). The NYP mutant developed a mean peak viral load that was 91-fold lower but was not statistically significantly different from the NYS virus (p = 0.571). The KYS mutant mean peak viremia was 30,000-fold lower (p = 0.044) than NYS. The NYT mutant elicited a significantly higher initial viremia than the NYS virus at dpi 1 (p&lt;0.01); however, no significant differences were observed from dpi 2–7. In a separate study, the viremia potential of the A’DEL mutant was assessed compared to the NYS parental virus. Two of the six HOSPs inoculated with the A’DEL mutant failed to generate detectable viremias during the course of the 1–7 dpi serum sampling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). A two-day delay in viremia onset in the four HOSPs that became viremic was observed with the NYS titers significantly higher than the A’DEL titers at dpi 1–3; however, the A’DEL birds subsequently developed significant viremias from 3–7 dpi and peak titers for individual birds showed no difference compared to NYS inoculated HOSPs (p = 0.252) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007473.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Mortality rates were low in all groups and not significantly different between any virus infection group and thus have not been shown. Sequencing of HOSP serum samples was also not performed due to the aforementioned reason.
