<p>Four to seven-day-old 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (Sebring strain) and 
 <italic>Culex tarsalis</italic> (BFS), reared at 28°C, 16:8 (L: D) photo cycle with 5% sucrose solution, were used for vector competence assessments. The Sebring strain was originally collected in 1988 from Sebring County, Florida[

 <italic>tarsalis</italic> Bakersfield Field Station (BFS) strain was established from Bakersfield, Kern County, California and had been in colonization since 1952[

 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> were sugar-starved for 24 hours prior to the feed. Viruses (NYS, NYT, NYP, NYF, SYS, SYP, KYS) were diluted to 7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL and mixed with defibrinated chicken blood (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO) at a 1:1 ratio. Each group of mosquitoes was exposed to 2 mL of the virus: blood mix using a Hemotek feeding unit (Discovery Workshops, Accrington, UK,). After one hour of feeding, fully engorged females were held at 28°C with 5% sucrose under a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod through 14 days post-exposure (dpe). The A’DEL virus did not produce viral titers higher than 6.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL at the time of this study. Therefore, a separate experiment was performed where the NYS virus was also diluted to 6.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL for comparison and artificial oral infections with A’DEL and NYS were performed as described above. At 14 dpe, 25 mosquitoes were removed from each virus group, anesthetized by exposure to triethylamine, legs removed and saliva collected by capillary tube as previously described[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007473.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The hind leg was removed from each mosquito and was placed in 0.5mL of diluent along with a BB (Crossman Corporation, NY). Mosquito bodies were collected after salivation was completed and stored in 0.5mL of diluent with a BB. Mosquito bodies, legs and saliva were stored at -80°C until titrated by plaque assay. Only 0.2mL of each sample was 10- fold serially titrated and viral titers were calculated as log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL. A direct 2.5-fold conversion can be applied to identify titers from whole bodies, legs and expectorants, respectively.
