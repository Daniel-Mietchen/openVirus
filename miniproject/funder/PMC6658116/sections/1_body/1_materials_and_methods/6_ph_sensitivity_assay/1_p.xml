<p>The parental strain and WNV glycosylation mutants were diluted to 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/well and exposed to varying pH ranges (5.8â€“7.0) at 0.2 pH unit increments in triplicate for 10 minutes at which point the pH was brought to a neutral level (pH~7.4) by the addition of sterile PBS. Viral supernatants in the pH-neutralized buffer were 10-fold serial-titrated by plaque assay.
