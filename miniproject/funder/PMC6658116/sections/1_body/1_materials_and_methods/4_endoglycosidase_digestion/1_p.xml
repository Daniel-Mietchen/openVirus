<p>In order to confirm the glycosylation status of the WNV mutants, Vero cells were inoculated with the parental and mutant viruses at an MOI of 1. At 50 hours post-inoculation (hpi), supernatant was removed and cells were lysed. Cell lysates were treated with 500 units of Endoglycosidase F enzyme (New England Biolabs), an amidase that cleaves the N-linked glycosylation moiety from the glycoprotein. Briefly,10 μg of cell lysate was denatured with 1X Glycoprotein Denaturing Buffer (0.5% SDS, 40mM DTT) at 100°C for 10 minutes. Cell lysate was then treated with glycoBuffer 2, NP-40 and Endoglycosidase F(+) after which the mix was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The samples (1 μg) were separated electrophoretically on a 4–20% reducing SDS gel. Separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunostained with anti-WNV E mAb 3.67.</p>
