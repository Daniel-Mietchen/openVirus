<p>The peripheral lymphocytes were separated from anticoagulant blood. The concentration was diluted to 1.0 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml with PBS. For two-color staining, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with a mixture of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (IgG2a) and anti-CD4 (IgG2b), CD8 (IgG2a) followed by incubation with a mixture of PE-conjugated anti-pig IgG2a (for anti-CD3) and either Alexa Flour 647 mouse anti-pig IgG2b (for anti-CD4), FITC anti-pig IgG2a (for anti-CD8), respectively [
