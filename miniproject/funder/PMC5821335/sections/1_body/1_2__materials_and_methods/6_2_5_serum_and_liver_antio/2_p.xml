<p>To determine the oxidative injury in piglets induced by RV, the content of malonaldehyde (MDA) and activities of antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase, SOD; glutathione peroxidase, GSH-Px) in serum and liver were evaluated by using the MDA, SOD and GSH-Px kits, respectively, according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China). The optical densities of each index were recorded using a spectrophotometer (UV-2800A, UNICO, China) at 532nm, 550nm, and 412nm, respectively. The SOD and GSH-Px activities in serum and liver were expressed as U per milligram of protein (U/mg pro).</p>
