<p>Usually, the MDA level was elevated and antioxidant enzymes activity was reduced when the body was in response to oxidative stress. A previous study reported that the concentration of MDA was significantly increased in the serum of piglets suffering from RV enteritis, and the SOD activity was decreased [
