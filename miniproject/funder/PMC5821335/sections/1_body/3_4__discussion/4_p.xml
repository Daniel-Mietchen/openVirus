<p>IFN-γ is a cytokine that is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and bacterial infections. A previous study showed that it has protective effects against RV infection in children at the early stage [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192692.g002">Fig 2</xref>) that RV infection increases the IFN-γ concentration in the RVC group. After treatment with RDS, the IFN-γ concentration was significantly elevated. TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine, could cause damage to the body by inducing inflammation [
