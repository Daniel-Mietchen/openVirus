<p>The CD4+/CD8+ ratio is the ratio of T helper cells to cytotoxic T cells. The reduced ratio is associated with reduced resistance to infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0192692.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Previous study has declared that the CD4+/CD8+ showed a strong correlation with CD8+ count, but not with CD4+ count [
 <xref rid="pone.0192692.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Another study [
 <xref rid="pone.0192692.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] described that CD4+ T cells have an important role in the generation of rotavirus-specific intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is the principal effector of long-term protection against rotavirus infection, and CD8+ T cells have a role in the timely resolution of primary infection. Therefore, we inferred that the higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio could also play an important role in clearance of RV.
