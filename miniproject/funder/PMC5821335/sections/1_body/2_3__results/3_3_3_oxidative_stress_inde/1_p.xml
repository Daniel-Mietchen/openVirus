<p>The results of antioxidative levels in serum and livers were showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192692.g001">Fig 1</xref>. In serum, the MDA concentration in the RVC group was increased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with that in the MI group. The MDA concentrations in RDS groups were significantly decreased when compared with the RVC group. There was no statistically significant difference between the RDSH group and the MI group on the MDA level. A significant decrease (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in SOD and GSH-Px activities were noted in rotavirus control piglets when compared with mock infected piglets. The SOD activities in RDS groups were significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that in the RVC group. There was no significant difference in SOD activity between the RDSH group and the MI group. The GSH-Px activities in RDSM and RDSH groups were higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that in the RVC group. There was no significant difference between the RDSH group and the MI group.
