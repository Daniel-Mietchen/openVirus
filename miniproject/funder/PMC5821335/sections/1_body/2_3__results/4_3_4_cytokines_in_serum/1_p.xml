<p>It was reported that resveratrol possessed the ability to inhibit virus replication by regulating cytokine production. Therefore, the concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-10 in serum were detected. The results were showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192692.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The IFN-γ level in the RVC group was significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in comparison with that in the MI group. When compared with the RVC group, the IFN-γ concentrations in the RDSM and the RDSH groups were statistically increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The concentration of TNF-α in the RVC group was significantly increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with that in the MI group. With the increase of RDS concentration, the TNF-α level gradually decreased. Compared with the RVC group, the TNF-α concentration in the RDSH group was significantly decreased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In TNF-α production, there were no significant differences between the RDSH group and the MI group. The IL-4 concentration in the RVC group was significantly increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when compared with that in the MI group. The IL-10 level in the RVC group was significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that in the MI group. However, there were no significant differences between the RDS groups and the RVC group.
