However, very few studies have been performed to investigate the viral genetic changes within (intra-host) and between (inter-host) humans in a spatio-temporal scale. Viruses of different serotypes from various countries imported to Taiwan cause annual outbreaks. During 2001&#x02013;2003, two consecutive outbreaks were caused by dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) and resulted in a larger-scale epidemic with more severe dengue cases in the following year. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the viruses from both events were similar and related to the 2001 DENV-2 isolate from the Philippines. We comprehensively analyzed viral sequences from representative dengue patients and identified three consensus genetic variants, group Ia, Ib and II, with different spatio-temporal population dynamics. The phylodynamic analysis suggested group Ib variants, characterized by lower genetic diversity, transmission rate, and intra-host variant numbers, might play the role of maintenance variants. The residential locations among the patients infected by group Ib variants were in the outer rim of case clusters throughout the 2001&#x02013;2003 period whereas group Ia and II variants were located in the centers of case clusters, suggesting that group Ib viruses might serve as &#x0201c;sheltered overwintering&#x0201d; variants in an undefined ecological niche. Further deep sequencing of the viral envelope (E) gene directly from individual patient serum samples confirmed the emergence of variants belonging to three quasi-species (group Ia, Ib, and II) and the ancestral role of the viral variants in the latter phase of the 2001 outbreak contributed to the later, larger-scale epidemic beginning in 2002. These findings enhanced our understanding of increasing epidemic severity over time in the same epidemic area. It also highlights the importance of combining phylodynamic and deep sequencing analysis as surveillance tools for detecting dynamic changes in viral variants, particularly searching for and monitoring any specific viral subpopulation. Such subpopulations might have selection advantages in both fitness and transmissibility leading to increased epidemic severity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Virus genomes can show changes due to transmission between hosts. In evolutionary scale, replacements with new viral lineages are usually associated with alternating clinical burdens or epidemic potentials, but few studies have integrated viral dynamics from intra-host viral variations to macro-level clade (a monophyletic group) replacements. In this study, we combined both levels of research to study the changes in viral genomes during two consecutive dengue outbreaks (2001&#x02013;2003) in southern Taiwan. We identified a potential overwintering candidate virus group characterized by lower genetic diversity, transmission rate, number of intra-host variants and a more pervasive geographical distribution pattern. Deep sequencing data revealed the temporal dynamics of minor variants in different nucleotide positions, correlated with the phylogenetic analyses of consensus sequences derived from different patients. We thus propose that investigating the quasi-species complexity of viruses from intra-host and inter-host infections can provide a novel understanding of virus evolution. Such investigations could also be a useful method to monitor the dynamics of viral changes and be included in the virological surveillance.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology Foundation in Taiwan</institution></funding-source><award-id>NHRI-106A1-MRCO-1517175; MOST Grant #104-2314-B-002 -025, MOST Grant #105-2621-M-002-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Chwan-Chuen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology Foundation in Taiwan and the (NHRI-106A1-MRCO-1517175) Republic of China (MOST Grant #104-2314-B-002 -025, MOST Grant #105-2621-M-002-007).

Currently, an estimated 2.5 billion people are at risk for virus infection and 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections occur annually [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The World Health Organization in 2015 predicted that dengue infections would continue to increase due to global warming and frequent international travel [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most people infected with DENV are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of dengue fever (DF). Only about 6% of dengue patients present with severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Although there is no specific treatment for dengue, case fatality rates can be approximately 1% with proper case management [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>DENV includes four serotypes, designated as DENV-1 to 4, and belong to the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> in the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The viral genome is approximately 10.7 kilobases (kb) in length and contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding three structural proteins: capsid (C), precursor membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E) proteins, and seven non-structural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5, flanked by 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; untranslated regions (UTR) [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Increased epidemic scale and disease severity have been associated with accumulation of genetic changes scattered throughout the entire viral RNA genome in circulating viral strains. Consequently, multiple genotypes, strains or variants within a serotype can co-circulate in the same geographical area. However, the viral population dynamics are complex, involving both the emergence and the death of viral lineages that may differ in transmissibility, virulence, and fitness as well as the intricate patterns of gene flow within and between the alternating hosts of human and mosquito [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Dengue is not endemic in Taiwan, unlike other endemic areas in Southeast Asia with multiple serotypes co-circulating at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

However, during the years of 2001&#x02013;2003, two consecutive outbreaks caused by DENV-2 occurred in Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan, which resulted in 5,311 DF and 252 DHF/DSS cases, and 21 deaths. The epi-curve showed that case numbers in 2002 surpassed those in the 2001 outbreak (5,336 vs. 227, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

Group Ib was a minor population persistently circulating through the epidemic with low genetic diversity, transmission rate and number of intra-host variants confirmed by deep sequencing.

Kaohsiung City (the second largest metropolis in Taiwan) and its neighboring Fengshan District (an extended area of Kaohsiung City) had a population density of about 10,200 people/km<sup>2</sup> in 2002. In Taiwan, the District is composed by &#x0201c;Li&#x0201d; (equivalent to the village), the basic administrative unit in Taiwan, thus we used &#x0201c;Li&#x0201d; as the spatial unit as in our previous studies [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Kaohsiung has both a seaport and an airport for international travelers who may bring DENV into the city whereas Pingtung City (population of 215,584 persons in 2002 covering 65.067 square kilometers) is an older city with many old buildings providing excellent mosquito breeding habitats. Both Kaohsiung and Pingtung also have a higher percentage of foreign laborers from dengue-endemic countries as well as a high population density able to maintain viral transmission locally. Dengue outbreaks in these two study areas occur when two conditions are met: the introduction of the virus to the general population by dengue viremic travelers and appropriate meteorological factors favoring <italic>Aedes</italic> breeding [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Failure to implement mosquito control permitting virus circulation occasionally allows DENV over-wintering to occur. Compared with dengue-endemic countries, Taiwan is unique in having had only one overwintering serotype of DENV between 2001 and 2002.

They proposed inter-host viral diversity increases with population density through transmission chains [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. To further understand how viral variants emerged from infected human hosts and their relationship with transmission intensity, the population density and numbers of dengue cases from their residential districts, numbers of variants, and the patient&#x02019;s past immunity to the infection (primary vs secondary DENV infection) were investigated. We analyzed 64 samples from three districts including Lingya, Qianzhen and Fengshan District, where a large number of dengue cases were concentrated in 2001&#x02013;2002 epidemics. In addition, we used the official geographical division &#x0201c;Li&#x0201d; as the spatial unit to analyze potential correlations between spatial or epidemiological characteristics and quasi-species. Case number refers to annual patient numbers in the particular Li where the virus was isolated. The results showed that the group Ib variants had significantly lower numbers than Ia (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).

In addition, the proportion of variants in group II increased sharply, which correlated with striking increases in the case numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), indicating that transmission intensity might play an important role in increasing viral diversity as well as the magnitude of an epidemic.

In this study, we applied the deep sequencing technique to obtain 104 viral E gene sequences amplified directly from acute patients&#x02019; serum samples and phylodynamic analysis identified three genetic variants (groups Ia, Ib and II).

Furthermore, the clade replacement and co-existence of different viral variants strongly implied that viruses contributing to the second peak of the 2002&#x02013;2003 outbreak were likely to have evolved from viruses that circulated in 2001 in Kaohsiung, not from another introductive event.</p><p>Deep sequencing technologies capable of sequencing individual molecules directly from PCR amplicons shows unprecedented resolution for studying quasi-species within viral populations. Previous studies utilizing this new technology demonstrated that the purifying selection of dengue viral evolution with variants consistently showed higher intra-host genetic diversity than inter-host diversity [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Three genetic variants (group Ia, Ib and II) identified by phylodynamic analysis revealed three amino acid changes (E-46, NS5-271 and, NS5-357). The bottleneck transmission resulted in mutation fixation and clade replacement has been observed in a previous DENV-3 study [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, the transition to &#x02265;20% of variants at these specific positions emphasizes that the epidemic process might have selected and amplified variant(s) with higher epidemic potential during this outbreak. It is very likely that epidemiological conditions such as high transmission intensity and high viral load might result in the fixation of the nonsynonymous substitution at the C1073T position in the E protein. This mutation is a significant genetic marker correlated with both clinical and epidemiological severities in this study and a previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, that the combination of a consensus sequence to identify the major viral variant among quasi-species and deep sequencing to analyze the breadth of quasi-species variants may make it possible to monitor and identify emerging variants with higher epidemic potential prior to a larger-scale transmission or outbreak.</p><p>The process of clade replacement may be influenced by the host immune status (primary or secondary DENV infection) and the transmission intensity within communities [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Under these circumstances, viral fitness changes during transmission of alternating host species at a population level or through disease progression at an individual level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s010">S3 Fig</xref>). Intra-host infections with higher numbers of quasi-species variants could offer an advantage for arboviruses to adapt as they cycle between two very different host species. Detailed analysis of the spectrum of quasi-species variants within an individual patient&#x02019;s serum found that groups containing high numbers of variants (&#x02265;20), regardless of a Ia, Ib, or II variant, exclusively emerged from the patients experiencing secondary DENV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">Fig 8D and 8E</xref>) which is consistent with a previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Guzman et al. proposed the role of the immune-escape mutant for contributing to the rapidly increasing fatality rates in Cuba in 2000 [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Supported by a previous study [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we hypothesized that viruses carrying 46I could be less optimally neutralized than 46T viruses by cross-reactive, neutralizing antibodies elicited during prior DENV infections. This difference in cross-reactive, neutralizing antibodies may subsequently confer a selective advantage to the 46I virus in a community that experienced prior dengue infections. Our study similarly suggests that heterotypic antibodies drive the evolution of dengue viruses and increase a variant population that may lead to increased severity of the epidemic.</p><p>We confirmed the ancestral role of the group Ia variants as contributing to the subsequent larger epidemic beginning in 2002. Between the two peaks of the outbreaks (week 8 to 13 in 2002), there were no confirmed indigenous dengue cases. However, it is noteworthy mentioning that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic dengue patients do retain their transmissibility to mosquitoes, and even have higher transmissibility to mosquitoes than symptomatic patients [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. With such a high asymptomatic rate of dengue virus infection [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it is likely that the overwintered Ib variants might cause asymptomatic infections and maintain silent transmission in the population. Transitional Ib virus variants exhibited several features possibly favoring overwintering: low transmissibility (lower R), low quasi-species complexity (lower genetic divergence since emergence), less potential to cause severe disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s005">S5 Table</xref>), and circulating in a non-cluster region (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">8C</xref>). Additionally, the Ib variant maintained a higher virus load compared to those of the Ia and II variants in acute-phase patients&#x02019; plasma, which might imply the stability and maintenance role of Ib viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s011">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, group Ib variants may play a key overwintering role by maintaining a population in a certain ecological niche in the urban setting during dengue epidemics.</p><p>This study has three major limitations. First, we focused on viral population dynamic changes within only human hosts. We were not able to obtain virus from mosquitoes due to the limitation of the mosquito surveillance system and the low isolation rate. Second, we only collected the plasma samples from dengue patients. We did not have plasma samples from pre-clinical or asymptomatically infected persons so that we could not investigate the virus dynamics in pre-clinical and asymptomatically patients&#x02019; specimens to address the role of silent transmission during the epidemic process. Third, we performed deep sequencing targeting only the E protein gene (rather than full-length viral genome) to increase sample sizes and to increase the quality of sequences obtained directly from patients&#x02019; plasma. Fourth, mosquito density may influence the intensity of dengue transmission. Unfortunately, due to a lack of a mosquito surveillance data, we are not able to conduct additional analysis.</p><p>Few amino acid substitutions have been shown to associate with increased epidemic scale and disease severity caused by several arboviruses, such as such as West Nile, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Possible mechanisms may exist to maintain viral populations under stressful environmental conditions (e.g., winter season), then subsequently expand viral transmission to increase the population diversity, followed by selection of a viral variant with higher replication and/or transmissibility potential. Arboviruses capable of overcoming these barriers, such as a variant virus associated with greater pathogenesis and disease severity potential, could evolve under a combination of favorable epidemiological conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we identified three amino acid substitutions, T46I in the E protein, I271T, and V357E in the NS5 protein (<xref rid="pntd.0006827.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). E-46 position is located in the D0 beta strand of domain I on the protein surface; domain I is the structurally central domain of E protein which plays an important role in protein stability [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Threonine, a polar amino acid, was substituted by isoleucine which is non-polar but retains the property of having a chiral carbon in the side chain. This T46I change would stabilize the protein structure [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, this residue is located in a T-helper cell epitope [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Mutation in this residue may affect neutralizing antibody binding to viruses and T-cell recognition by the human host. Additionally, the previous study indicated that genetic variations in human-derived viral quasispecies mainly occurred in structural proteins (prM, E, and NS1), whereas mosquito-derived variations occurred in NS3 and 3&#x00374; UTR [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We thus hyphothesize that the T46I mutation emerged under human immune pressure during epidemic transmission. Viruses with the point mutation may have potentially evaded immune responses and this may have resulted in higher virulence and transmissibility when compared to non-mutant viruses. There is only one amino acid difference (46 in E) between group Ib and group II virus-consensus sequences, and group Ib has lower transmissibility and lower numbers of DHF cases compared with group II viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s005">S5 Table</xref>). Two other amino acid changes are located at positions 271 and 357 in the NS5 protein. The NS5 protein contains the N-terminal methyltransferase and the C-terminal RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains involved in viral replication [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Amino acid positions 271 and 357 are located in the inter-domain linker region (residues 264 to 273 in DENV-2) and inter-domain interface (residues 349 to 358 in DENV-2), respectively. These two inter-domain regions determine the flexibility of the NS5 protein essential for virus replication [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Additionally, V357E changes from nonpolar (valine) to negative charge amino acid (glutamate) are located in a conserved &#x003b2; nuclear localization signal (&#x003b2;NLS) motif of the RdRp domain. This segment not only plays a role in transporting NS5 into the nucleus but also interacts with the NS3 helicase [<xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Taken together, these two substitutions in NS5 may influence viral replication in different hosts. How these three amino acid substitutions might influence the transmissibility and virulence of viruses will be addressed in a future study. Based on our results, we hypothesize that Ib (with two amino acid changes in NS5, 271T and 357E, compared with Ia) has better replication ability and spread to the west-north of the cluster region in 2001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Additionally, Ib caused low case numbers of symptomatic infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s005">S5 Table</xref>) that was barely detected by the existing surveillance system. In the winter period, when the mosquito density and biting behavior decrease, better replication could help viruses maintain in mosquitos. With low transmission rates, the virus accumulated variants slowly in both intra-host (low intra-host variant numbers) and inter-host (low genetic diversity).</p><p>In conclusion, our study tracked viral dynamics associated with inter-host and intra-host genetic changes encompassed with spatio-temporal trends using phylodynamic analysis and deep sequencing. These observations have direct implications for the evolution of DENV as well as other arboviruses and underscore the value of such investigations to map the high-resolution of viral quasi-species dynamics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Primers for DENV-2 ORF sequencing.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006827.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>DENV viral strain sequences analyzed in the current study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006827.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Log marginal likelihoods of various models by different methods.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006827.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s004"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Primers used in dengue envelope protein deep sequencing.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006827.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s005"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Patients infected by group Ia, Ib and II viruses showed differences in degree of illness for the severe form of dengue.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006827.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s006"><label>S6 Table</label><caption><title>Information and viral sequences used in this study for the 2001&#x02013;2003 epidemics.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006827.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s007"><label>S7 Table</label><caption><title>Correlations between intra-host diversity, immune status of hosts and disease severity.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0006827.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0006827.s008"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analyses of DENV-2 viruses in Taiwan, 2001&#x02013;2003.</title><p>Maximum-likelihood tree with bootstrap values was constructed from the 73 E gene (1485 nt), using 63 DENV-2 viruses and 10 other serotypes of DENVs isolated in Taiwan and other countries.
