<p>DENV includes four serotypes, designated as DENV-1 to 4, and belong to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> in the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. The viral genome is approximately 10.7 kilobases (kb) in length and contains a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding three structural proteins: capsid (C), precursor membrane/membrane (prM/M) and envelope (E) proteins, and seven non-structural proteins: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5, flanked by 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTR) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Increased epidemic scale and disease severity have been associated with accumulation of genetic changes scattered throughout the entire viral RNA genome in circulating viral strains. Consequently, multiple genotypes, strains or variants within a serotype can co-circulate in the same geographical area. However, the viral population dynamics are complex, involving both the emergence and the death of viral lineages that may differ in transmissibility, virulence, and fitness as well as the intricate patterns of gene flow within and between the alternating hosts of human and mosquito [
