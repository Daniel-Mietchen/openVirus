 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most people infected with DENV are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of dengue fever (DF). Only about 6% of dengue patients present with severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Although there is no specific treatment for dengue, case fatality rates can be approximately 1% with proper case management [
