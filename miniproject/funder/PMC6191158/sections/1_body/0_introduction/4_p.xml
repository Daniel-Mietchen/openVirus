<p>In this study, we tracked the viral phylodynamic changes between (inter-host) and within dengue patients (intra-host) over different times and areas, based on the complete ORF and E gene sequences. Three quasi-species variants (Ia, Ib, and II) were identified. Each variant had a different spatio-temporal viral population dispersion pattern. Group Ib was a minor population persistently circulating through the epidemic with low genetic diversity, transmission rate and number of intra-host variants confirmed by deep sequencing. This study highlighted that the combination of phylodynamic and deep sequencing analysis can be an important surveillance tool for detecting dynamic changes in viral population diversity and expansion, as well as characterizing differences in fitness and transmissibility of a particular dominant variant sub-population arising by the selection through an epidemic process.</p>
