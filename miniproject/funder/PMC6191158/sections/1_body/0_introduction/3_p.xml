<p>Dengue is not endemic in Taiwan, unlike other endemic areas in Southeast Asia with multiple serotypes co-circulating at the same time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Surveillance data from the Taiwan Centers of Disease Control (Taiwan-CDC) supports the premise that dengue viruses are imported into Taiwan mainly from Southeast Asia with 75% of imported cases from Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand [

However, during the years of 2001â€“2003, two consecutive outbreaks caused by DENV-2 occurred in Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan, which resulted in 5,311 DF and 252 DHF/DSS cases, and 21 deaths. The epi-curve showed that case numbers in 2002 surpassed those in the 2001 outbreak (5,336 vs. 227, respectively,
