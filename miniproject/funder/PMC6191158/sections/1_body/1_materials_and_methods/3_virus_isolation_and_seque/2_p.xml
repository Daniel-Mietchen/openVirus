<p>Dengue viral RNA was extracted directly from patientâ€™s plasma or RT-PCR confirmed C6/36 cultured supernatant using a QIAmp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase kit (ThermoFisher), using random hexamers (Promega). Virus-specific PCR was performed using a Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase Kit (ThermoFisher) and consensus sequences were obtained using the conventional Sanger sequencing method [
