<p>Plasma from the patients’ acute phase specimens (within 5 days post onset of fever) collected in 2002 was selected according to defined temporal and spatial characteristics, whereas all the 2001 samples were included in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>). DENV-RT-PCR-positive patient’s plasma was inoculated onto C6/36 cells derived from 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) and grown at 28°C in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ThermoFisher) containing Mitsuhashi-Maramorosch medium (HiMedia) plus Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ThermoFisher) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher). For virus isolation, the patient’s plasma was inoculated onto C6/36 cells and maintained in the same media with 2% FBS. At 5–10 days after inoculation, the culture supernatant was harvested when C6/36 cells showed more than 50% cytopathic effect (CPE). RT-PCR was used to confirm the presence of virus in the C6/36 cultured supernatant. Forty-three DENV-2 isolates from C6/36 cells, stored at -80°C, were used to obtain the consensus sequence of the complete ORF in this study (methods as described below).
