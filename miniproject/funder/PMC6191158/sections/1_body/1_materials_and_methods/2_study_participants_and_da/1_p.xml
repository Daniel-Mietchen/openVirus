<p>From September 2001 through March 2003, laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas accounted for 90.4% (5062/5602) of total dengue cases in Taiwan, were included in this study. Cases, reviewed by Dengue Clinical Committee in Taiwan, were classified as DF or DHF based on the clinical guidelines published by World Health Organization-1997 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Laboratory diagnosis of current DENV infection was based on dengue virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The study was approved by the Institute Review Board (IRB) of the hospitals participating in this study, mainly Yuan General Hospital, Huei-Te Hospital and Pingtung Christian Hospital and the IRB of National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH-REC No. 200903086R) as described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The blood samples were collected from children under age 18 with approved written consent from guardians and adults with approved written consent. Plasma was separated and stored at -80Â°C. A total of 2,234 blood samples (some included paired or triple specimens from the same individual) were collected from 1,565 dengue-confirmed patients during the study period. Secondary DENV infections were determined by dengue-specific IgM and IgG capture ELISA (Inbios DENV Detect IgM Capture ELISA kit and DENV Detect
 <sup>TM</sup> IgG Capture ELISA kit) performed as previously described [
