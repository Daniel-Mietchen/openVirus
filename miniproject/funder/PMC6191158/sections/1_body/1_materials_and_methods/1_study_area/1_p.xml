<p>The study areas are 12 Districts of Kaohsiung City (including 11 Districts from the old Kaohsiung administrative Districts and Fengshan District) and Pingtung City, the capital of Pingtung County, the two cities located in southern Taiwan with a tropical climate suitable for 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes to transmit DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Kaohsiung City (the second largest metropolis in Taiwan) and its neighboring Fengshan District (an extended area of Kaohsiung City) had a population density of about 10,200 people/km
 <sup>2</sup> in 2002. In Taiwan, the District is composed by “Li” (equivalent to the village), the basic administrative unit in Taiwan, thus we used “Li” as the spatial unit as in our previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Kaohsiung has both a seaport and an airport for international travelers who may bring DENV into the city whereas Pingtung City (population of 215,584 persons in 2002 covering 65.067 square kilometers) is an older city with many old buildings providing excellent mosquito breeding habitats. Both Kaohsiung and Pingtung also have a higher percentage of foreign laborers from dengue-endemic countries as well as a high population density able to maintain viral transmission locally. Dengue outbreaks in these two study areas occur when two conditions are met: the introduction of the virus to the general population by dengue viremic travelers and appropriate meteorological factors favoring 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> breeding [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Failure to implement mosquito control permitting virus circulation occasionally allows DENV over-wintering to occur. Compared with dengue-endemic countries, Taiwan is unique in having had only one overwintering serotype of DENV between 2001 and 2002. This situation offered the best chance to investigate DENV dynamics during two consecutive over-wintering epidemics in Kaohsiung and Pingtung.
