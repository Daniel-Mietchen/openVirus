<p>We analyzed geo-coding information about dengue cases by QGIS 2.0 from previous studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We generated matrices of distance between the samples to examine virus movement. The matrices of distance showed the geographic relatedness of each sample, considering their dates and places of collections and viral genetic sequences. GEO SPHERE package in BEAST v2.2 was applied to implement Bayesian phylogeographical analysis using a diffusion on a sphere model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Bayesian MCMC analyses using the HKY+G nucleotide substitution model with a strict molecular clock were run for 10
 <sup>9</sup> steps for E genes of group Ia and Ib virus variants, and 9*10
 <sup>8</sup> steps for group II virus variants. The direction of virus movement was labeled based on the locations of the most recent common ancestor (MRCAs) inferred from the MCC trees by QGIS.
