<p>Virus-specific cDNAs flanking the E gene region from 77 plasma samples were deep sequenced and analyzed to estimate and compare the complexity of viral populations (quasi-species; noted in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s002">S2 Table</xref> and listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s006">S6 Table</xref>). Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 140 μl of plasma and cDNA synthesized following the procedure described in the “Virus isolation and sequencing” section above. One μl of cDNA from each sample was subjected to PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (ThermoFisher) with primer sets targeting the E protein gene to construct the cDNA library. Primer sets were designed to amplify the E protein gene along with Illumina overhang adapter (

These products were then amplified by 15 additional cycles using sample-specific Illumina dual i5 and i7 index adapters to label each sample. The resulting amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads (ThermoFisher) and further quantified using a Qubit 3.0 NGS Starter Kit (ThermoFisher). The purified amplicons were then clustered and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq Platform (Illumina) at Technology Commons, College of Life Science, National Taiwan University. For quality control, sequences were removed from analysis if quality scores (Phred) were below 30 using CLC Genomics Workbench 6.0 software (CLC Bio). All sequences were mapped based on consensus sequences of the 2001 DENV-2 Kaohsiung isolates and adaptor sequences were removed using CLC. Sequence files were analyzed using program R. LoFreq was used to detect minor viral variants to study the intra-host heterogeneity of viral variants (quasi-species). LoFreq models sequencing error rate and implements a Poisson distribution to probe the statistical significance of nucleotide variants at each position [
