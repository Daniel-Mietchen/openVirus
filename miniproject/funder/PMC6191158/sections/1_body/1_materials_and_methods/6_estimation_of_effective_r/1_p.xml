<p>We used the birth-death skyline model, implemented in the BEAST 2.2 birth-death skyline serial package, to estimate the transmissibility of viral variants [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The birth-death skyline serial analysis describes a birth-death process, assuming that each infected individual might transmit with a rate λ and eventually becomes noninfectious with a rate δ. An individual virus was sampled with a probability ρ and included in the dataset. We used the DNA substitution model HKY+G with a strict molecular clock and Gamma distribution. The iteration numbers included 5*10
 <sup>7</sup> MCMC for group Ia variants and at least 9.5*10
 <sup>8</sup> for groups Ib and II variants to ensure ESS higher than 200. The R values of the three viral variant groups were estimated with 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals. The sampling rate was set at 0.29 (1,565 cases were included in this study among 5,446 confirmed dengue cases).
