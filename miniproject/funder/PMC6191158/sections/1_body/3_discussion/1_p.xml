<p>Phylodynamic inferences based on viral sequence data with spatio-temporal dynamics can reveal the characteristics of viral transmission in a local urban setting [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this study, we applied the deep sequencing technique to obtain 104 viral E gene sequences amplified directly from acute patients’ serum samples and phylodynamic analysis identified three genetic variants (groups Ia, Ib and II). Although the clade replacement of group Ia by group II during the two consecutive outbreaks was consistent with previous findings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], our deep sequencing results were the first to reveal the population dynamics associated with emergence and co-existence of different genetic variants within human hosts. Furthermore, the clade replacement and co-existence of different viral variants strongly implied that viruses contributing to the second peak of the 2002–2003 outbreak were likely to have evolved from viruses that circulated in 2001 in Kaohsiung, not from another introductive event.
