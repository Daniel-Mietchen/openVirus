<p>Deep sequencing technologies capable of sequencing individual molecules directly from PCR amplicons shows unprecedented resolution for studying quasi-species within viral populations. Previous studies utilizing this new technology demonstrated that the purifying selection of dengue viral evolution with variants consistently showed higher intra-host genetic diversity than inter-host diversity [

Three genetic variants (group Ia, Ib and II) identified by phylodynamic analysis revealed three amino acid changes (E-46, NS5-271 and, NS5-357). The bottleneck transmission resulted in mutation fixation and clade replacement has been observed in a previous DENV-3 study [

Furthermore, the transition to ≥20% of variants at these specific positions emphasizes that the epidemic process might have selected and amplified variant(s) with higher epidemic potential during this outbreak. It is very likely that epidemiological conditions such as high transmission intensity and high viral load might result in the fixation of the nonsynonymous substitution at the C1073T position in the E protein. This mutation is a significant genetic marker correlated with both clinical and epidemiological severities in this study and a previous study [

Therefore, that the combination of a consensus sequence to identify the major viral variant among quasi-species and deep sequencing to analyze the breadth of quasi-species variants may make it possible to monitor and identify emerging variants with higher epidemic potential prior to a larger-scale transmission or outbreak.
