<p>The process of clade replacement may be influenced by the host immune status (primary or secondary DENV infection) and the transmission intensity within communities [

Intra-host infections with higher numbers of quasi-species variants could offer an advantage for arboviruses to adapt as they cycle between two very different host species. Detailed analysis of the spectrum of quasi-species variants within an individual patient’s serum found that groups containing high numbers of variants (≥20), regardless of a Ia, Ib, or II variant, exclusively emerged from the patients experiencing secondary DENV infection (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we hypothesized that viruses carrying 46I could be less optimally neutralized than 46T viruses by cross-reactive, neutralizing antibodies elicited during prior DENV infections. This difference in cross-reactive, neutralizing antibodies may subsequently confer a selective advantage to the 46I virus in a community that experienced prior dengue infections. Our study similarly suggests that heterotypic antibodies drive the evolution of dengue viruses and increase a variant population that may lead to increased severity of the epidemic.
