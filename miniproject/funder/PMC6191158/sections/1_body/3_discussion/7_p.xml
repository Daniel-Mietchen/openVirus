<p>In this study, we identified three amino acid substitutions, T46I in the E protein, I271T, and V357E in the NS5 protein (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). E-46 position is located in the D0 beta strand of domain I on the protein surface; domain I is the structurally central domain of E protein which plays an important role in protein stability [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Threonine, a polar amino acid, was substituted by isoleucine which is non-polar but retains the property of having a chiral carbon in the side chain. This T46I change would stabilize the protein structure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Furthermore, this residue is located in a T-helper cell epitope [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Mutation in this residue may affect neutralizing antibody binding to viruses and T-cell recognition by the human host. Additionally, the previous study indicated that genetic variations in human-derived viral quasispecies mainly occurred in structural proteins (prM, E, and NS1), whereas mosquito-derived variations occurred in NS3 and 3ʹ UTR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We thus hyphothesize that the T46I mutation emerged under human immune pressure during epidemic transmission. Viruses with the point mutation may have potentially evaded immune responses and this may have resulted in higher virulence and transmissibility when compared to non-mutant viruses. There is only one amino acid difference (46 in E) between group Ib and group II virus-consensus sequences, and group Ib has lower transmissibility and lower numbers of DHF cases compared with group II viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s005">S5 Table</xref>). Two other amino acid changes are located at positions 271 and 357 in the NS5 protein. The NS5 protein contains the N-terminal methyltransferase and the C-terminal RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains involved in viral replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Amino acid positions 271 and 357 are located in the inter-domain linker region (residues 264 to 273 in DENV-2) and inter-domain interface (residues 349 to 358 in DENV-2), respectively. These two inter-domain regions determine the flexibility of the NS5 protein essential for virus replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Additionally, V357E changes from nonpolar (valine) to negative charge amino acid (glutamate) are located in a conserved β nuclear localization signal (βNLS) motif of the RdRp domain. This segment not only plays a role in transporting NS5 into the nucleus but also interacts with the NS3 helicase [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Taken together, these two substitutions in NS5 may influence viral replication in different hosts. How these three amino acid substitutions might influence the transmissibility and virulence of viruses will be addressed in a future study. Based on our results, we hypothesize that Ib (with two amino acid changes in NS5, 271T and 357E, compared with Ia) has better replication ability and spread to the west-north of the cluster region in 2001 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Additionally, Ib caused low case numbers of symptomatic infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s005">S5 Table</xref>) that was barely detected by the existing surveillance system. In the winter period, when the mosquito density and biting behavior decrease, better replication could help viruses maintain in mosquitos. With low transmission rates, the virus accumulated variants slowly in both intra-host (low intra-host variant numbers) and inter-host (low genetic diversity).
