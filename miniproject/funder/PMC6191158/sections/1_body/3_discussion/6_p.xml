<p>Few amino acid substitutions have been shown to associate with increased epidemic scale and disease severity caused by several arboviruses, such as such as West Nile, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika [

Possible mechanisms may exist to maintain viral populations under stressful environmental conditions (e.g., winter season), then subsequently expand viral transmission to increase the population diversity, followed by selection of a viral variant with higher replication and/or transmissibility potential. Arboviruses capable of overcoming these barriers, such as a variant virus associated with greater pathogenesis and disease severity potential, could evolve under a combination of favorable epidemiological conditions [
