<p>We confirmed the ancestral role of the group Ia variants as contributing to the subsequent larger epidemic beginning in 2002. Between the two peaks of the outbreaks (week 8 to 13 in 2002), there were no confirmed indigenous dengue cases. However, it is noteworthy mentioning that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic dengue patients do retain their transmissibility to mosquitoes, and even have higher transmissibility to mosquitoes than symptomatic patients [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it is likely that the overwintered Ib variants might cause asymptomatic infections and maintain silent transmission in the population. Transitional Ib virus variants exhibited several features possibly favoring overwintering: low transmissibility (lower R), low quasi-species complexity (lower genetic divergence since emergence), less potential to cause severe disease (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">8C</xref>). Additionally, the Ib variant maintained a higher virus load compared to those of the Ia and II variants in acute-phase patientsâ€™ plasma, which might imply the stability and maintenance role of Ib viruses (
