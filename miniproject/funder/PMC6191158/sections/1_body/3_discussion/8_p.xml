<p>In conclusion, our study tracked viral dynamics associated with inter-host and intra-host genetic changes encompassed with spatio-temporal trends using phylodynamic analysis and deep sequencing. These observations have direct implications for the evolution of DENV as well as other arboviruses and underscore the value of such investigations to map the high-resolution of viral quasi-species dynamics.</p>
