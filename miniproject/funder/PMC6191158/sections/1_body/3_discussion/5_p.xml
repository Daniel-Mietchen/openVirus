<p>This study has three major limitations. First, we focused on viral population dynamic changes within only human hosts. We were not able to obtain virus from mosquitoes due to the limitation of the mosquito surveillance system and the low isolation rate. Second, we only collected the plasma samples from dengue patients. We did not have plasma samples from pre-clinical or asymptomatically infected persons so that we could not investigate the virus dynamics in pre-clinical and asymptomatically patients’ specimens to address the role of silent transmission during the epidemic process. Third, we performed deep sequencing targeting only the E protein gene (rather than full-length viral genome) to increase sample sizes and to increase the quality of sequences obtained directly from patients’ plasma. Fourth, mosquito density may influence the intensity of dengue transmission. Unfortunately, due to a lack of a mosquito surveillance data, we are not able to conduct additional analysis.</p>
