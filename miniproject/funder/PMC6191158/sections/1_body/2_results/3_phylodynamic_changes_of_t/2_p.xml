<p>The effective reproduction number (R) provides an important epidemiological parameter to measure the viral transmissibility. The birth-death skyline serial model was implemented to estimate R for the three groups of viral variants. The estimated R values corresponded well to the number of confirmed dengue cases during the entire epidemic period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Both R values of group Ia and Ib viral variants surpassed 1.00 during the first outbreak in 2001 and decreased to below 1.00 after 2001. Only group Ibâ€™s R value rose above 1.00 in mid-2002 when the case number reached a peak in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g006">Fig 6</xref> and the group II variants (R &gt;1) replaced the group Ia as the dominant variant during 2002. Notably, low transmissibility of the Ib variant after 2001 partially explained its lack of isolation from dengue patients. Therefore, the three independent measures (lower genetic distance, substitution rate, and transmissibility) show clearly that group Ib viral variants not only co-circulated with Ia and II viral variants but also continuously persisted throughout these two separate DENV-2 outbreaks from 2001 to 2003.
