<p>Since the three groups of viruses had different spatio-temporal population dynamics, we applied phylodynamic analysis to compare their genetic distances, substitution rates, and transmission capabilities (R). When genetic distances for the E gene relative to the inferred common ancestor were plotted against time, the persistent Ib variants showed a lower rate of accumulating substitutions through time (with decreasing trend in the genetic distance) compared to those of groups Ia and II variants (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s009">S2 Fig</xref>). The mean evolutionary rates in the E gene of group Ib, calculated by Bayesian analyses, were also consistently lower than those of the other two variant groups (Ib: 1.06E-3; Ia: 2.76E-3; II: 2.27E-3;
