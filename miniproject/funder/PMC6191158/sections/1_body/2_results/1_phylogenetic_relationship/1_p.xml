<p>Phylogenetic analyses using the maximum likelihood (ML) method showed that all DENV-2 strains used in this study belong to cosmopolitan genotype A (genotype IV A) and are closely related to the strains circulating in the Philippines in 2001 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s008">S1 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we found that a group of viruses isolated in 2001 clustered with those from 2002 (i.e., TW/915, TW/1030), whereas the rest of the 2001 DENV-2 viruses formed an independent clade. Regardless if the sequence was from E or ORF genes, time-scaled Bayesian MCC analysis generated similar results with high posterior probabilities from both data sets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, respectively). These clusters were defined as groups Ia, Ib and II. The consensus sequence of these three groups showed genetic markers across the complete ORF (

Viruses classified as group Ib maintained a 2001-like amino acid signature at position E-46: threonine at position 46, compared to isoleucine in group II viruses; additionally, the Ib viruses also had two 2002-like signatures in NS5 protein (
