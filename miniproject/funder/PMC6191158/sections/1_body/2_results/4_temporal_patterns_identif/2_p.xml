 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows the proportions of nucleotide variants obtained by deep sequencing among three variant groups during two consecutive outbreaks. The proportion of the C1073T substitution was increased in the group Ia quasi-species sequence during the first 2001 outbreak (5.90%, 20.5% and 21.1% of C1073T were found in strains-1019, -1052 and -1054, respectively). The C1073T substitution was also detected in the group Ib virus variants in 2002 (strain-1185; 7.29%). For the T1227A substitution (where Ib and II shared a 1227A signature), the proportion of 1227A substitution in the Ia strains-1019, -1052 and -1054 increased from 6.87% to 22.3%. A similar temporal pattern was also observed at the T2064C substitution for the group II-variants, from 32.3% of strain-915 to 100% of all other 2002 group II-like viruses.
