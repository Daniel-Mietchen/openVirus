<p>How different genetic variants (group Ia, Ib, and II) emerged through transmission was further investigated within human hosts using deep sequencing. The E gene was selected as the target gene to study intra-host viral populations for the following reasons. First, E gene nucleotide sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) exhibited a similar topology of the phylogenetic tree as using complete ORF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) in our phylogenetic analysis. Second, there are three specific markers in E protein that can be used to distinguish different clades instead of NS5 or other genes (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Fourth, the E protein on the outer virion surface plays an important role for virus entry and eliciting protective immunities after infection.
