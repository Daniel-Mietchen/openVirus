<p>Previous studies suggested that the increase of quasi-species complexity is associated with population density and the presence of heterotypic antibodies elicited by secondary DENV infection in the affected population [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006827.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Salje et al. proposed a method for transmission chains estimated by phylogenetic and serological data in Thailand. They proposed inter-host viral diversity increases with population density through transmission chains [

To further understand how viral variants emerged from infected human hosts and their relationship with transmission intensity, the population density and numbers of dengue cases from their residential districts, numbers of variants, and the patient’s past immunity to the infection (primary vs secondary DENV infection) were investigated. We analyzed 64 samples from three districts including Lingya, Qianzhen and Fengshan District, where a large number of dengue cases were concentrated in 2001–2002 epidemics. In addition, we used the official geographical division “Li” as the spatial unit to analyze potential correlations between spatial or epidemiological characteristics and quasi-species. Case number refers to annual patient numbers in the particular Li where the virus was isolated. The results showed that the group Ib variants had significantly lower numbers than Ia (p&lt;0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Both group Ia and Ib had significantly lower cases numbers in residential “Li” compared with group II (p&lt;0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). There was no significant difference in population density of a particular “Li” between three variant groups (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref>), which possibly contributed to the pervasive dispersal pattern of the viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In addition, the proportion of variants in group II increased sharply, which correlated with striking increases in the case numbers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006827.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), indicating that transmission intensity might play an important role in increasing viral diversity as well as the magnitude of an epidemic. Although wide distributions of variant numbers from all three groups of viral variants were observed, the group with highest variant numbers (≥20) were exclusively isolated from the secondary DENV patients (
