<p>To further understand the dynamic change of Ia, Ib and II groups of viruses, we analyzed each viral group based on the onset dates and residential locations of the dengue patients. Group Ib co-circulated with the other two groups throughout the 2001–2003 epidemic. At the peak of the 2001 outbreak, group Ia and Ib viruses accounted for 75% and 25% of the isolates, respectively (
