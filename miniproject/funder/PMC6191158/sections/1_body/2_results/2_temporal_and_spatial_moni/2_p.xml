<p>We applied the continuous diffusion model to investigate the geographical dispersion of the three virus groups using the phylogeographic analysis program implemented in BEAST. The group Ia viruses clustered with the group Ib variants during the early stage of the epidemic but moved slightly toward the southeast in 2001 (

The group II viruses first emerged to the east of the epicenter, clustered with Ia and Ib virus variants, and then diffused irregularly outward from the center. The phylogeographic analysis also revealed that group Ia and II variants were the dominant virus populations in the 2001 and 2002â€“2003 outbreaks, respectively. Additionally, group Ib viruses were persistently present as a minor population in both outbreaks.
