  <title>Viral loads and viral population variants found in the three virus groups, Ia, Ib and II.</title>
  <p>(A) Viral load in the group II viruses was lower than the other two groups of viruses during the acute phase (0 to 3 days after onset of illness), viral load decreased significantly after the acute phase (defervescence phase, 4â€“8 days after onset of illness). (B) Group Ib had significantly lower variant numbers than group Ia during the acute phase. * indicated p&lt;0.05. Statistical analysis (two-tailed student t-test) comparing the different virus groups was completed.</p>
