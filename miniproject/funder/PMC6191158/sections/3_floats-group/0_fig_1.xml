  <title>Spatio-temporal distributions of DENV-2 isolated and sequenced from patients in Taiwan, during 2001â€“2003.</title>
  <p>(A) The number of laboratory-confirmed, indigenous dengue cases and their major viral serotype found in Kaohsiung city from January 2000 to April 2015. The total numbers of laboratory-confirmed dengue cases, cases diagnosed with dengue fever (DF, blue) or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF, red) are shown separately. (B) The isolated DENV-2 strains at each of the respective time points (upper panel), compared to the total numbers of confirmed dengue cases (5305, including 5064 DF and 241 DHF cases) embedded in the epidemic curve for the same period (lower panel). Two consecutive outbreaks occurred in the period from the 35th week, 2001 to the 11th week, 2003: 232 confirmed cases, including 222 DF and 10 DHF cases in 2001; and 5073 confirmed cases, including 4842 DF and 231 DHF cases. (C)(D) Spatial distributions of dengue cases in 2001 (C) and 2002 (D). Red dots represent viral isolates that were investigated in this study; gray plot represents dengue cases reported from Taiwan-CDC.</p>
