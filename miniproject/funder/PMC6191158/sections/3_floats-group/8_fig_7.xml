  <title>Deep sequencing of evolving viral populations.</title>
  <p>Proportions of quasi-species variants of each virus isolate (x-axis) are illustrated by three nucleotide positions in E-1073, -1227 and -2064. Proportions of Thymine (T) at position 1073 (upper), Adenine (A) at position 1227 (middle) and Cytosine (C) at position 2064 (lower) are shown separately in three panels, respectively, by black dots. Their corresponding putative nucleotide substitution counterparts - 1073C, 1227T, and 2064T are shown in gray dots. Three phylogenetic groups of DENV-2 variants are highlighted by different colors (Ia-blue, Ib-green, and II-purple) on the x-axis. Viruses are arranged by the chronological order of their isolation dates within each group. The vertical dashed line separates viruses isolated in 2001 (left side) versus those in 2002 (right side).</p>
