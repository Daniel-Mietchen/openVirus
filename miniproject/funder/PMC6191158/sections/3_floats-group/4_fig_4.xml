  <title>Differences in the pattern of geographical distribution of group Ia, Ib and II variants.</title>
  <p>Dots on the map indicate locations of patientsâ€™ residential areas. The intensity of color for each dot represents the chronology for the three groups of viral variants during their circulating period (A-C). The arrow on the map indicates the direction of virus spread based on the locations of MRCAs inferred in the MCC trees (A and B). Compared with groups Ia and Ib, the group II viral variants do not show a simple linear spreading route but did spread from the center of the clusters. Total isolates were plotted as dots in the indicated period, in colors blue, green and purple representing the groups Ia, Ib and II, respectively. The red shaded area illustrates all laboratory-confirmed dengue cases in the respective periods; the darker shading reflects higher case numbers.</p>
