  <title>Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree of the E and ORF genes.</title>
  <p>(A) A MCC tree based on the E genes of 104 DENV-2 viruses isolated during 2001â€“2003 in southern Taiwan together with those from the Philippines as a reference group. Based on the tree and nucleotide signatures, group I [nt-1073C; threonine (T) at E-46] and group II [nt-1073T; isoleucine (I) at E-46] were identified. Posterior probabilities were labeled on distinct nodes. Heatmap next to the tree indicates three corresponding nucleotide positions in the E gene for each of the different isolates. (B) MCC tree based on ORF of 43 Taiwan DENV-2 isolates. Two distinguishable virus variants were further noted in group I viruses: Ia viruses have isoleucine (I) at the NS5-271 position and valine/glutamate (V/E) at the NS5-357 position, whereas Ib viruses have threonine (T) at NS5-271 and glutamate (E) at NS5-375.</p>
