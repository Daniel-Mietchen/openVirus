  <title>Genetic distances by isolation date among three groups of DENV-2 viral variants.</title>
  <p>Genetic distance, based on the E gene of each group of viral variants, was analyzed by linear regression. Solid lines show the estimated regression intervals. Group Ib variants had lower evolution rates (substitutions/site/year), with fewer genetic changes, compared with those of group Ia and II variants. The difference in estimated rates between the E protein and the ORF (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006827.s009">S2 Fig</xref>) of Ia variants may be due to insufficient sample size and the fact that most genetic variations of group Ia viruses were found in the E gene.
