  <title>Temporal distributions of the three groups of DENV-2 viruses.</title>
  <p>Dynamic changes of the three groups of DENV-2 variants isolated from patients over time. At the peak of 2001 outbreak, the group Ia and Ib variants accounted for about 75.86% and 24.14% of the isolates, respectively. The earliest Ib variant was identified in November 2001, whereas the first confirmed dengue case occurred in July 2001. The group Ib variants remained circulating after 2001 outbreak, whereas the group II variants became dominant viruses during the outbreak period from February 2002 to September 2002, accounting for more than 85.19% of the isolates. After October 2002, 95.24% of the isolates belonged to group II.</p>
