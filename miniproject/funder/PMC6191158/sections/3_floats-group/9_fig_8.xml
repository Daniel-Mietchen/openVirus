  <title>Factors associated with viral diversity: Population sizes, associated cases and population densities and secondary infection.</title>
  <p>(A) Distributions in the numbers of three groups of DENV-2 variants. The number of variants in group Ib was significantly lower than in group Ia viral variants. (B) Distribution of Li-specific population densities. (C) Li-specific numbers of dengue cases. Numbers of dengue cases associated with the group Ia and Ib variants were significantly lower than with group II. The Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test was used and significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were labeled with an asterisk. The horizontal bar in the middle of the violin plots indicates the median values of the three groups. Proportions of primary and secondary DENV infections within each group of viruses classified according to the numbers of the two groups: (1) low variant (&lt; 20) (D), and (2) high variant (≥20) (E), boundary by medium value (medium is 20). (E). Primary DENV infection accounted for percentages of dengue cases in the low variant group, particularly in Ia variants. However, secondary DENV infection increased its percentages in the low variant groups of Ib and II viruses and eventually accounted for 100% of the secondary infection group for all the Ia, Ib and II groups with a high variant number.</p>
