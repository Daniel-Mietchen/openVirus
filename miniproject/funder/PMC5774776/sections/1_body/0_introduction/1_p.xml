<p>Ending HIV will require resilient supply chains to ensure uninterrupted access to diagnostics and antiretroviral treatment (ART). Stockouts of testing kits and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) may prevent countries from reaching the international 90-90-90 targets, i.e. for 90% of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) to know their HIV status, to put 90% of those diagnosed on ART and to keep the viral load suppressed in 90% of those on ART by 2020 [

Supply disruptions of other HIV-commodities can also do a lot of damage: stockouts of diagnostic tests cause gaps in testing activities and delays in treatment initiation, while stockouts of cotrimoxazole interfere with successful prevention of opportunistic infections [
