<p>The target population were ART-providing facilities in Kinshasa and zonal warehouses. For the study, facilities were sampled based on health zone and number of PLHIV under care. We did not include the military and the police health zones. From each of the 33 remaining health zones, we selected all the facilities with more than 200 patients on ART, the largest facility with 100 to 200 patients and the largest one with fewer than 100 patients on ART (if existent). This purposive sampling of low burden facilities was done to include facilities of different sizes and serving as many patients as possible, while considering feasibility and budget. We also targeted the 33 zonal warehouses.</p>
