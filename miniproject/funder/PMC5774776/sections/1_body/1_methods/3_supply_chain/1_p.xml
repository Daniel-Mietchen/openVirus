<p>In the DRC, HIV commodities are almost exclusively funded and procured by international donor agencies such as the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) and the United States Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Supply chains are highly fragmented, with multiple tiers and supply chains run by different actors [
 <xref rid="pone.0191294.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The DRC National Medicine Supply Programme oversees the overall medicine supply system, while the National HIV department develops the national HIV treatment guidelines and forecasts demand of HIV commodities. At the time of the survey, this forecast was based on provincially compiled pharmacy consumption reports, the national ART patient database, as well as data gathered by GFATM and PEPFAR. Supply chains for HIV commodities were managed largely in parallel by the two major donor agencies and their multiple implementing partners through a two-tiered system (PEPFAR) and a three-tiered system (GFATM). At the time of the survey, many facilities received support from both agencies at the same time for different activities and supplies, leading to frequent overlap and gaps.
