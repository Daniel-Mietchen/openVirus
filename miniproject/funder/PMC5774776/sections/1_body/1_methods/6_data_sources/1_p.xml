 <xref rid="pone.0191294.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For the facilities included in the study, the number of patients on ART was retrieved from the patient registers kept at the facilities. Outcome data were collected on two standard paper questionnaires—one for health facilities and one for warehouses—in April and May 2015. The questionnaires can be found under supporting information (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191294.s003">S2</xref> Texts). Study teams of two persons each were trained for two days on the use of the questionnaire, including test visits to two facilities per team. At arrival at the facility or warehouse, the teams administered the questionnaire to the person in charge of the pharmacy. The point prevalence of stockouts was determined through physical check of the availability of the items in the pharmacy shelves. Data collected from existing registers were used to determine the duration in days of a stockout up to the day of the survey visit. The facility coping practise in case of a stockout was recorded as reported by the responsible pharmacist. Senior medical MSF staff conducted supervision visits of the teams during the survey. The data used for this analysis consist of a selection of the originally collected data (
