<p>Side effects due to TDF-3TC-EFV are less frequent and the pill burden is lighter as compared to AZT-3TC-NVP [

 <xref rid="pone.0191294.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Substituting drugs might also give a false sense of supply security, because even if patients continue on ART, the change does interfere with the supply of the alternative drugs. Giving other ARV in case of absence of TDF-3TC-EFV may have contributed to stockouts of TDF-3TC and AZT-3TC-NVP.
