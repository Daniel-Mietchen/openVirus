<p>The survey results suggest that two types of stockouts occurred in the facilities during the analysis: stockouts of an item for which there were national shortages and stockouts of items available in country. Due to the national shortage of TDF-3TC-EFV, it is not possible to draw conclusions on availability of this regimen under routine conditions. A similar cross-sectional study in Kinshasa from 2016 showed that TDF-3TC-EFV was available in a larger proportion of facilities after the national shortages had been corrected [

Only 2% (1/43) of high burden facilities and 10% (5/50) of low burden ones had a stockout of the first-line regimen on the visit day. 10% (4/39) of high-burden and 6% (2/36) of low-burden facilities were out of stock of AZT-3TC-NVP. 16% (5/31) and 23% (3/13) of high-and low-burden facilities respectively had stockouts of TDF-3TC on the visit day. The comparison suggests that the national shortages in 2015 led to increased stockouts in facilities, but that ART stockouts still occur when there are no national stock problems.
