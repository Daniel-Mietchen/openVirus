<p>The results of this study have been presented at national multi-stakeholder meetings. The data and additional analyses by the ministry of health and its partners have led to proposals for corrective actions. In the second half of 2015, the two main donors (GFATM and PEPFAR) reallocated the different health zones of Kinshasa for support by only one donor at a time, but optimal ongoing coordination will be necessary to avoid duplication and gaps. Due to the limitation of this cross-sectional design, repeated analysis and regular monitoring are needed to describe trends for the stockouts unrelated to the national shortage and to monitor management of future regimen introductions. Further research is also needed to assess the situation in more remote parts of the country.</p>
