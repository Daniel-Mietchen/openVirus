<p>The second type of stockouts observed in 2015 were of items that were available at national level and even frequently in a nearby warehouse, but absent in the facility. While the national stockout during this period led to increased facility stockouts of TDF-3TC-EFV and the substituting regimens, the high proportions of stockouts of test kits and CTX indicate a structural, systematic problem in supply chain. These findings show that medicines often do not reach patients due to problems in the final part of the supply chain, despite the short distances between facilities and warehouses in Kinshasa. In the 2016 analysis, most items were stocked out less often than in 2015. However, not one of the investigated items was available in all high-or low-burden facilities, indicating ongoing supply challenges due to chronic and structural supply chain problems.</p>
