<p>This study has several limitations. First, the stockouts were measured on the day of the survey visit, which produces a point estimate and does not reflect an average stockout rate. In case of a stockout, we used stock cards to estimate stockout duration, but this duration could only be measured until the visit date, and stockouts might have lasted longer. Also, when commodities were available, their expiry date was not verified as part of the study. This means that even when available, some items might have not been usable. A second limitation is the fact that the included low-burden facilities were not randomly sampled from the facilities in the province of Kinshasa, leading to selection bias. Thus, even if approximately 82% of the patients on ART in Kinshasa received treatment in the included facilities, it cannot be assumed that this survey is representative for Kinshasa. This is illustrated by the median [IQR] patient burden, which in high burden facilities is 429 [287–670] in the population and 450 [317–686] in the selection. However, in low-burden facilities the median patient burden is 4 [

 <xref rid="pone.0191294.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in the population and 61 [27–132] in the study selection. The included low-burden facilities, serving a higher number of patients than the median, are likely to commonly stock more different ARV regimens. In line with our findings, these facilities could thus have been at a higher risk of a stockout, but better equipped to give a substitution regimen. Third, aside from supply problems resulting from the change of first-line regimen, the survey did not evaluate the causes of stockouts or the drivers of coping mechanisms in different facilities. Similarly, the survey did not assess the impact of the stockouts on patients’ lack of adherence and clinical outcomes. Finally, the study coincided with the transition from AZT-3TC-NVP to TDF-3TC-EFV as the first-line ARV regimen of choice in the DRC. The initial supply of TDF-3TC-EFV early 2015 was meant to treat only pregnant and breastfeeding women, as decided by the National HIV department. Lack of communication led facilities to switch more patients, leading in turn to a national stockout which lasted until December 2015.
