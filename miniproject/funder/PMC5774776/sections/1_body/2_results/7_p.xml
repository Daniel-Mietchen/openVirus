<p>Out of 92 facilities visited, 16% commonly provided one ARV (n = 15), 38% two ARVs (n = 35) and 46% all three surveyed ARVs (n = 42). Those facilities providing more ARVs where at higher risk of stockouts, but those with three ARVs were better placed to provide a substitution regimen. Out of those facilities commonly stocking only one ARV, 20% had a stockout (3/15) on the day of the survey visit, of which 1 (33%) managed to substitute the missing ARV. Among those facilities commonly providing two ARVs, 48% (17/35) had a stockout, of which 29% (5/17) provided a substitute. Among those commonly stocking three ARVs, 67% (28/42) had at least one ARV missing, out of which 68% (19/28) provided a substitution regimen.</p>
