The study objective was to assess the magnitude and duration of stockouts of HIV medicines and diagnostic tests in public facilities in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. This was a cross-sectional survey involving visits to facilities and warehouses in April and May 2015. All zonal warehouses, all public facilities with more than 200 patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (high-burden facilities) and a purposive sample of facilities with 200 or fewer patients (low-burden facilities) in Kinshasa were selected. We focused on three adult ART formulations, cotrimoxazole tablets, and HIV diagnostic tests. Availability of items was determined by physical check, while stockout duration until the day of the survey visit was verified with stock cards. In case of ART stockouts, we asked the pharmacist in charge what the facility coping strategy was for patients needing those medicines. The study included 28 high-burden facilities and 64 low-burden facilities, together serving around 22000 ART patients. During the study period, a national shortage of the newly introduced first-line regimen Tenofovir-Lamivudine-Efavirenz resulted in stockouts of this regimen in 56% of high-burden and 43% of low-burden facilities, lasting a median of 36 (interquartile range 29&#x02013;90) and 44 days (interquartile range 24&#x02013;90) until the day of the survey visit, respectively. Each of the other investigated commodities were found out of stock in at least two low-burden and two high-burden facilities. In 30/41 (73%) of stockout cases, the commodity was absent at the facility but present at the upstream warehouse. In 30/57 (54%) of ART stockout cases, patients did not receive any medicines. In some cases, patients were switched to different ART formulations or regimens. Stockouts of HIV commodities were common in the visited facilities. Introduction of new ART regimens needs additional planning.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>United Kingdom's Department for International Development</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5518-9600</contrib-id><name><surname>Gils</surname><given-names>Tinne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005850</institution-id><institution>International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5518-9600</contrib-id><name><surname>Gils</surname><given-names>Tinne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5518-9600</contrib-id><name><surname>Gils</surname><given-names>Tinne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>La Fondation Veuve Emile Metz-Tesch</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5518-9600</contrib-id><name><surname>Gils</surname><given-names>Tinne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was conducted through the Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT), a global partnership led by the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases at the World Health Organization (WHO/TDR).&#x000a0;The training model is based on a course developed jointly by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and Med&#x000e9;cins sans Fronti&#x000e8;res (MSF).

Stockouts of testing kits and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) may prevent countries from reaching the international 90-90-90 targets, i.e. for 90% of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) to know their HIV status, to put 90% of those diagnosed on ART and to keep the viral load suppressed in 90% of those on ART by 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Stockouts of ARVs lead to delays in treatment initiation, unstructured treatment interruptions, and disengagement of patients with care [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These situations have negative consequences for individuals and populations, as they increase the risk of opportunistic infections, treatment failure, viral resistance and death [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers any stockout of a routinely used ARV in an ART dispensary over the course of a year an early warning indicator for ART resistance [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Supply disruptions of other HIV-commodities can also do a lot of damage: stockouts of diagnostic tests cause gaps in testing activities and delays in treatment initiation, while stockouts of cotrimoxazole interfere with successful prevention of opportunistic infections [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Most countries, including those in Sub-Saharan Africa, aim for universal HIV treatment and provide access to cheap, one-pill-a-day regimens for the majority of the PLHIV [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, an evaluation by the WHO of 1703 ART clinics in 35 countries showed that ARV stockouts are frequent: 36% reported at least one stockout in a 12&#x02013;month reporting period between 2005 and 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Stockouts appeared to be more frequent in Sub-Saharan African countries than in other global regions [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The West and Central African region has made slow progress towards the 90-90-90 targets, despite accounting for 1 in 3 AIDS related deaths globally [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The need for acceleration of the HIV/AIDs response in this region, including fixing supply chains, has been recognised by the United Nations (UN) at the 2016 General Assembly [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>As a response to rising reporting of global shortages, WHO has passed a resolution calling to assess the nature and magnitude of stockouts and shortages and to install early warning systems for prevention of local and national stockouts [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Yet country-wide data of facility stockouts are often non-existent, not available in the public domain or biased by self-reporting of the health workers under evaluation [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), country-wide information about stockouts of HIV commodities is not available. Indications of severe interruptions in ART and cotrimoxazole supply have however been reported by patient groups in Kasa-Vubu and North-Kivu [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Kinshasa, teams of M&#x000e9;decins sans Fronti&#x000e8;res (MSF) have provided missing medicines during stockouts. No previous study has looked at stockouts in facilities in Kinshasa in a systematic way.</p><p>This study thus aimed to assess the magnitude and duration of stockouts of HIV commodities in public facility dispensaries and zonal warehouses in the province of Kinshasa, and to describe coping mechanisms to deal with stockouts at the level of the facilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Design</title><p>This was a cross-sectional survey including data collected through visits to facility pharmacies and warehouses in Kinshasa in April and May 2015.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Setting</title><p>The DRC is the largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a population of over 75 million, of which 40% live in urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

In 2015, national treatment coverage was 33%, and only 3% of patients on ART had a viral load test done.

Supply chains are highly fragmented, with multiple tiers and supply chains run by different actors [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The DRC National Medicine Supply Programme oversees the overall medicine supply system, while the National HIV department develops the national HIV treatment guidelines and forecasts demand of HIV commodities. At the time of the survey, this forecast was based on provincially compiled pharmacy consumption reports, the national ART patient database, as well as data gathered by GFATM and PEPFAR. Supply chains for HIV commodities were managed largely in parallel by the two major donor agencies and their multiple implementing partners through a two-tiered system (PEPFAR) and a three-tiered system (GFATM). At the time of the survey, many facilities received support from both agencies at the same time for different activities and supplies, leading to frequent overlap and gaps.</p><p>Each province has a provincial warehouse that is run as a semi-independent entity contracted by donors for storage and distribution of medicines to the different health zones. The province of Kinshasa has 35 health zones, each with a zonal warehouse serving health facilities.

The study timing was not deliberately planned during this period but it created an opportunity to document the impact of the transition on ART availability in the facilities.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Study population</title><p>The target population were ART-providing facilities in Kinshasa and zonal warehouses. For the study, facilities were sampled based on health zone and number of PLHIV under care. We did not include the military and the police health zones. From each of the 33 remaining health zones, we selected all the facilities with more than 200 patients on ART, the largest facility with 100 to 200 patients and the largest one with fewer than 100 patients on ART (if existent). This purposive sampling of low burden facilities was done to include facilities of different sizes and serving as many patients as possible, while considering feasibility and budget. We also targeted the 33 zonal warehouses.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Variables and operational definitions</title><p>The variables included were the point prevalence of stockouts of a set of HIV commodities in the visited sites. A stockout was defined as no physical availability of the selected commodity in the facility pharmacy at the time of the survey visit. A complete first-line ART regimens consist of three active ingredients. Sometimes, two or more active ingredients are combined into a single tablet (also called a fixed-dose combination) to reduce the pill burden and improve adherence [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We have written the fixed-dose-combinations as the names of the active ingredients separated with a hyphen, and we have written the formulations with only one active ingredient as separate words. We selected the following ARVs for analysis: the two fixed-dose-combinations for first-line adult treatment; Tenofovir-Lamivudine-Efavirenz (TDF-3TC-EFV) and Zidovudine-Lamivudine-Nevirapine (AZT-3TC-NVP), and the Tenofovir-Lamuvidine (TDF-3TC) combination tablets commonly used as a first-line regimen (with Nevirapine) or a second-line regimen (with Lopinavir/ritonavir). These regimens were selected because at least 90% of ART patients in Kinshasa are treated with one of the included ART formulations [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We also assessed the availability of tablets of cotrimoxazole (CTX) for adults, which contain a combination of the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and of Determine&#x02122; HIV-1/2 rapid diagnostic tests (HIV test) [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In case of stockouts, we registered the duration until the day of the survey visit and, in cases of ART stockouts, the solutions the facility would propose to patients needing the unavailable ART. We differentiated between giving no ART at all (ask to return later, refer to another facility) and substitution with another formulation or regimen. High-burden facilities were those that reported more than 200 patients on ART and low-burden facilities those that reported 200 or fewer patients on ART in March 2015 according to the national database.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data sources</title><p>For the 33 included health zones, the number of patients on ART was retrieved from the national database [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For the facilities included in the study, the number of patients on ART was retrieved from the patient registers kept at the facilities.

Study teams of two persons each were trained for two days on the use of the questionnaire, including test visits to two facilities per team. At arrival at the facility or warehouse, the teams administered the questionnaire to the person in charge of the pharmacy. The point prevalence of stockouts was determined through physical check of the availability of the items in the pharmacy shelves. Data collected from existing registers were used to determine the duration in days of a stockout up to the day of the survey visit.

This is a problem for individual and public health because it puts more people at risk of HIV transmission and viral resistance and it increases morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with low immunity [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>When stockouts occurred, the staff at the facilities substituted the missing ARV with other ARV formulations or regimens, referred patients to other centres, or asked them to return later. Similar coping strategies have been described in response to ART stockouts in Tanzania, leading to increased cost for patients, higher risk of treatment interruption and emergence of resistant strains [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. TDF stockouts occurring in 2012 in South Africa led to initiation of patients with less optimal regimens, patients having to return more frequently and an increase in missed drug pick-ups [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Side effects due to TDF-3TC-EFV are less frequent and the pill burden is lighter as compared to AZT-3TC-NVP [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Substitution between the two regimens may lead to negative clinical consequences for patients [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Substituting drugs might also give a false sense of supply security, because even if patients continue on ART, the change does interfere with the supply of the alternative drugs. Giving other ARV in case of absence of TDF-3TC-EFV may have contributed to stockouts of TDF-3TC and AZT-3TC-NVP.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the stockouts were measured on the day of the survey visit, which produces a point estimate and does not reflect an average stockout rate. In case of a stockout, we used stock cards to estimate stockout duration, but this duration could only be measured until the visit date, and stockouts might have lasted longer. Also, when commodities were available, their expiry date was not verified as part of the study. This means that even when available, some items might have not been usable. A second limitation is the fact that the included low-burden facilities were not randomly sampled from the facilities in the province of Kinshasa, leading to selection bias. Thus, even if approximately 82% of the patients on ART in Kinshasa received treatment in the included facilities, it cannot be assumed that this survey is representative for Kinshasa. This is illustrated by the median [IQR] patient burden, which in high burden facilities is 429 [287&#x02013;670] in the population and 450 [317&#x02013;686] in the selection. However, in low-burden facilities the median patient burden is 4 [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in the population and 61 [27&#x02013;132] in the study selection. The included low-burden facilities, serving a higher number of patients than the median, are likely to commonly stock more different ARV regimens. In line with our findings, these facilities could thus have been at a higher risk of a stockout, but better equipped to give a substitution regimen. Third, aside from supply problems resulting from the change of first-line regimen, the survey did not evaluate the causes of stockouts or the drivers of coping mechanisms in different facilities. Similarly, the survey did not assess the impact of the stockouts on patients&#x02019; lack of adherence and clinical outcomes. Finally, the study coincided with the transition from AZT-3TC-NVP to TDF-3TC-EFV as the first-line ARV regimen of choice in the DRC. The initial supply of TDF-3TC-EFV early 2015 was meant to treat only pregnant and breastfeeding women, as decided by the National HIV department. Lack of communication led facilities to switch more patients, leading in turn to a national stockout which lasted until December 2015.</p><p>The survey results suggest that two types of stockouts occurred in the facilities during the analysis: stockouts of an item for which there were national shortages and stockouts of items available in country. Due to the national shortage of TDF-3TC-EFV, it is not possible to draw conclusions on availability of this regimen under routine conditions. A similar cross-sectional study in Kinshasa from 2016 showed that TDF-3TC-EFV was available in a larger proportion of facilities after the national shortages had been corrected [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Only 2% (1/43) of high burden facilities and 10% (5/50) of low burden ones had a stockout of the first-line regimen on the visit day. 10% (4/39) of high-burden and 6% (2/36) of low-burden facilities were out of stock of AZT-3TC-NVP. 16% (5/31) and 23% (3/13) of high-and low-burden facilities respectively had stockouts of TDF-3TC on the visit day. The comparison suggests that the national shortages in 2015 led to increased stockouts in facilities, but that ART stockouts still occur when there are no national stock problems.</p><p>Implementation of guidelines changes, like the introduction of TDF-3TC-EFV are likely to happen every few years, as evidence for better treatment becomes available. Supply chain problems at scale-up and decentralisation of ART have been documented before [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In South Africa, facility stockouts also increased during introduction of TDF-3TC-EFV as a first-line regimen in 2013 and there was a national stockout of second-line regimens in 2015 due to unanticipated scale-up [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As such critical periods for the management of supply chains will continue to occur at introduction of new ART regimens, the need for engagement of all actors, extensive supply planning and firm orders has been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191294.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In DRC, introduction of rapidly changing WHO recommendations for superior drug regimens needs to be accompanied by similar preparation.</p><p>The second type of stockouts observed in 2015 were of items that were available at national level and even frequently in a nearby warehouse, but absent in the facility. While the national stockout during this period led to increased facility stockouts of TDF-3TC-EFV and the substituting regimens, the high proportions of stockouts of test kits and CTX indicate a structural, systematic problem in supply chain. These findings show that medicines often do not reach patients due to problems in the final part of the supply chain, despite the short distances between facilities and warehouses in Kinshasa. In the 2016 analysis, most items were stocked out less often than in 2015. However, not one of the investigated items was available in all high-or low-burden facilities, indicating ongoing supply challenges due to chronic and structural supply chain problems.</p><p>The lack of data from the last level in the supply chain has contributed to a neglect of attention to the last mile and denial of stockout existence in many countries. In South Africa stockouts are reported by citizens through a free telephone number and traced up the supply chain, with all cases published on a public website [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191294.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This has contributed to greater attention to the supply chain by government and improved transparency and quality control. Similar civil society engagement in DRC, with funding for promotion and tools, like a free phone number, might be valuable [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Actions are also necessary to ensure &#x02018;last mile&#x02019; delivery. Simplifying the supply chain by reducing the tiers, installing informed push systems or direct delivery to the last mile have shown benefit in other settings [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Information technology can be used to report stock levels in real time to assist supply planning and provide early warning for stockouts [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0191294.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Clinical and supply guidance from country programmes should inform facilities on best coping mechanisms in case of stockouts to prevent treatment interruption and suboptimal treatment.</p><p>As pointed out by Bogaert et al., the lack of publicly available data on stockouts and problems surrounding definitions of stockouts and shortages have led to limited global quantification of stockouts and the identification of their causes. In that qualitative study, European stakeholders identified manufacturing, economic, supply and distribution problems, as the main causes of stockouts [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The WHA69.25 resolution &#x0201c;Addressing the Global Shortage of Medicines and Vaccines&#x0201d;, which followed increased global reporting of drug shortages, echoed those challenges [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A report commissioned by the European Association of Euro-Pharmaceutical Companies distinguished between predictable and unpredictable causes of stockouts [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the DRC, predictable, mainly logistical challenges like just-in-time inventories, poor forecasting and transport problems, seem to be the most important drivers explaining stockouts [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On top of that, more than in most developing countries, medicines stockouts are exacerbated by unpredictable causes such as political unrest, financial crisis and recurrent epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Creation of reliable in-country supply chains has been recognised by the UN as a priority to reach 90-90-90 targets in West-and Central Africa [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>At the time of this survey, no internationally recognised definition of drug stockouts existed and we based ourselves on the WHO definition for stockouts of ART as early warning indicators for drug resistance [<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The definition used for this survey is consistent with the patient-focussed definition for stockouts resulting from a WHO convened stakeholder meeting in response to WHA69.25: &#x0201c;The complete absence of the medicine, health product or vaccine at the point of service delivery to the patient&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0191294.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The results of this study have been presented at national multi-stakeholder meetings. The data and additional analyses by the ministry of health and its partners have led to proposals for corrective actions. In the second half of 2015, the two main donors (GFATM and PEPFAR) reallocated the different health zones of Kinshasa for support by only one donor at a time, but optimal ongoing coordination will be necessary to avoid duplication and gaps. Due to the limitation of this cross-sectional design, repeated analysis and regular monitoring are needed to describe trends for the stockouts unrelated to the national shortage and to monitor management of future regimen introductions. Further research is also needed to assess the situation in more remote parts of the country.</p><p>This study provides quantitative data on stockouts of HIV commodities occurring in the field, where the last mile is neglected and where transition from one to another ARV regimen puts an additional strain on supply systems. In the DRC, like in other countries in West-and Central Africa, supply chains need fixing to catch up with global targets to end HIV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191294.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>Stockout survey: Aggregated responses (French).</title><p>(DTA)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191294.s001.dta"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191294.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Stockout questionnaire for facilities (French).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191294.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0191294.s003"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Stockout questionnaire for warehouses (French).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0191294.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was conducted through the Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT), a global partnership led by the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases at the World Health Organization (WHO/TDR).
