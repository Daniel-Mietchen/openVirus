Therefore, to avoid the need for annual reformulation and readministration of seasonal influenza virus vaccines, we are developing a novel chimeric hemagglutinin (cHA)-based universal influenza virus vaccine, which is comprised of sequential immunization with antigens containing a conserved stalk domain derived from a circulating pandemic H1N1 strain in combination with &#x0201c;exotic&#x0201d; head domains. Here, we show that this prime-boost sequential immunization strategy redirects antibody responses toward the conserved stalk region. We compared the vaccine efficacy elicited by distinct vaccination approaches in the preclinical ferret model of influenza. All ferrets immunized with cHA-based vaccines developed stalk-specific and broadly cross-reactive antibody responses. Two consecutive vaccinations with live-attenuated influenza viruses (LAIV-LAIV) conferred superior protection against pH1N1 and H6N1 challenge infection. Sequential immunization with LAIV followed by inactivated influenza vaccine (LAIV-IIV regimen) also induced robust antibody responses. Importantly, the LAIV-LAIV immunization regimen also induced HA stalk-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> effector T cell responses in peripheral blood that were recalled by pH1N1 viral challenge. The findings from this preclinical study suggest that an LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimen would be more efficient in providing broadly protective immunity against influenza virus infection as compared to other approaches tested here.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>universal influenza virus vaccine</kwd><kwd>live-attenuated influenza vaccine</kwd><kwd>ferret</kwd><kwd>stalk antibody</kwd><kwd>chimeric hemagglutinin</kwd><kwd>heterosubtypic protection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000865</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">OPP1084518</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000060</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">U19 AI109946</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">P01 AI097092</award-id><award-id rid="cn002">HHSN272201400008C</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="11754"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type A influenza viruses (both H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) and type B influenza viruses continue to co-circulate globally in humans causing seasonal epidemics that result in morbidity and mortality worldwide (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Current licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines formulated as inactivated influenza virus vaccine (IIV), live-attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV), or recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins are proven to protect against infection by influenza virus (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), but they only provide suboptimal protection against infection by seasonal influenza viruses (ranging from 10 to 60%) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Antigenic shift or drift of the surface glycoproteins [HA and neuraminidase (NA)] can result in an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strain and circulating strains which leads to substantial decreases in vaccine effectiveness (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). To match the continuous antigenic evolution of influenza viruses, current seasonal influenza virus vaccines are reformulated and readministered annually (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) based on the influenza virus vaccine strains selected by the World Health Organization. Although current influenza virus vaccines induce protection against infection by antigenically similar influenza viruses, they provide suboptimal protection against unpredictable emerging pandemic strains. Once a pandemic virus emerges, it takes ~5&#x02013;6 months from vaccine strain selection to distribution of a strain-matched pandemic vaccine (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). During this time frame, the population may be left vulnerable.</p><p>To mitigate these concerns, there is a strong public health interest to develop a broadly protective or universal influenza virus vaccine to induce durable and broadly cross-reactive antibody responses, which would confer cross-protection against all influenza viruses and would alleviate potential disease burden once a pandemic influenza virus strain emerges (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Designing immunogens and vaccination strategies that focus the humoral immune response on the highly conserved HA stalk region is regarded as a promising strategy to achieve this goal. Compared to current, licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines which predominately induce potent strain-specific antibodies against the immunodominant HA head domain (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), several innovative vaccine candidates were proven to induce protective antibody responses against the immuno-subdominant HA stalk domain (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and confer heterosubtypic protection in mice (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and ferrets (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Toward the goal of a universal influenza virus vaccine, we have developed group 1 hemagglutinin-specific influenza virus vaccines based on chimeric HAs (cHAs) composed of a stalk domain derived from a circulating influenza virus strain and head domains from &#x0201c;exotic&#x0201d; subtypes of influenza viruses that do not circulate in humans. Through sequential immunizations, repeated exposure to these cHAs redirects antibody responses toward the conserved stalk domain (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Importantly, most adults have pre-existing stalk antibodies from prior influenza virus infection or vaccination so it is expected that our immunization approach will boost anti-stalk antibody responses after one or two vaccinations with cHAs (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Recent reports also indicated that LAIV could successfully prime immune responses against infection by exotic viruses (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our recent study demonstrated that a cHA-based vaccination regimen with a prime immunization with LAIV followed by booster immunization with Adjuvant System 03 (AS03)-adjuvanted inactivated split influenza virus (LAIV-IIV) vaccine conferred superior protection against 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infection compared to two doses of AS03-adjuvanted split influenza virus (IIV-IIV) vaccine in the preclinical ferret model (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Due to comparable antibody responses between LAIV-IIV and IIV-IIV regimens, we hypothesized that cell-mediated immunity may also contribute to protection. The vaccination regimens that we selected from our previous study, i.e., cH8/1N1 LAIV followed by cH5/1N1 IIV w/or w/o AS03 adjuvant and cH8/1N1 IIV followed by cH5/1N1 IIV w/ AS03 adjuvant, have advanced to a human Phase I trial (<italic>ClinicalTrials.gov</italic> # NCT03300050).</p><p>Nasal spray delivery of LAIV vaccines was reported to elicit stronger and longer-lasting immunity (both robust B-cell and T-cell responses) than IIV vaccination in children (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In this preclinical study, we compared one or two dose regimen of cHA-based LAIV vaccines to a LAIV-IIV vaccination regimen to provide protective immunity against pH1N1 virus challenge. Moreover, we also examined the breadth of protective immunity induced by our sequential immunization approach against challenge by a heterosubtypic H6N1 virus encoding an antigenically distinct HA stalk. Our results demonstrated that our sequential immunization approach with a cHA-based LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimen afforded the best protection against pH1N1 and H6N1 influenza virus infections, induced broadly cross-reactive and HA stalk-specific antibody responses, and could induce HA stalk-specific T cell immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chimeric HA-Based LAIV-LAIV and LAIV-IIV Vaccination Regimens Induce Stalk-Reactive Immunity in Ferrets</title><p>The objective of this preclinical study was to assess the protective immunity induced by immunization with group 1 hemagglutinin-specific influenza virus vaccines based on chimeric hemagglutinins (cHAs) in a ferret model of influenza. The experimental designs and immunization strategies are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Since most human adults have a primed repertoire of B cells with specificity to the HA stalk domain (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), we included an influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 (B-cH9/1) to mimic pre-existing HA stalk immunity. We then compared the ability of our sequential immunization strategies to boost antibody titers against the group 1 hemagglutinin stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). LAIV vaccines were reported to induce more robust humoral and cellular immune responses in children (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), but not in adults (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and the results of our previous study (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) demonstrated that LAIV followed by AS03 adjuvanted-split inactivated influenza virus vaccines (IIV) [LAIV-IIV] and IIV-IIV vaccination regimens effectively induced stalk-specific immunity in ferrets. To see whether LAIV alone may be sufficient to induce protective immunity, we included immunization groups that received one or two doses of cHA-based LAIV vaccines. The LAIV strains used in this study were first characterized by a pathotyping pilot study. Our results showed that the cH11/1 N1 LAIV (cH11/1 LAIV) virus is attenuated in ferrets as compared to wild-type A/California/04/09 (Cal/09) virus in terms of absence of body weight loss and undetectable viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract as shown in our previous study (cH8/1 LAIV) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref> (cH11/1 LAIV). cH8/1 LAIV and cH11/1 LAIV vaccine strains were selected for this study as the first and second booster immunizations, respectively. We excluded the cH5/1 LAIV component in the vaccination regimen to avoid potential safety concerns over administering an H5 virus to humans. In addition, since our previous studies demonstrated that addition of the AS03 adjuvant to the cHA-based influenza split IIV vaccine substantially improved antibody titers against the HA stalk (both IgG and IgA in serum) and against the N1 neuraminidase (NA) in mouse (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and ferret models (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), AS03 was included in all IIV vaccines in this preclinical study.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the pH1N1 viral challenge study design. The timeline and experimental groups for the pH1N1 challenge study are outlined. Ferrets in the cHA vaccination groups were unprimed or primed with an influenza B-cH9/1 virus. All cHA vaccination groups except for the mock animals received a booster immunization of cH8/1 LAIV on day 21, followed by a second booster immunization on day 49 with cH11/1 LAIV or cH5/1 IIV vaccine (with adjuvant AS03) to boost stalk-specific antibodies.

All ferrets were challenged with pH1N1 (Cal/09) influenza A virus on day 91, and sample specimens were collected on days 1, 3, and 4 post-challenge infection.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-10-00756-g0001"/></fig><p>Four-month-old neutered male ferrets were initially primed with a replication competent influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 (B-cH9/1 live virus), followed by booster vaccination(s) with cH8/1 LAIV, cH8/1 LAIV followed by cH11/1 LAIV (LAIV-LAIV), or cH8/1 LAIV followed by AS03-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV (LAIV-IIV). Since human adults have a primed HA stalk-specific B-cell repertoire (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), ferrets that were not primed with the B-cH9/1 live virus were also included in the experimental design to examine the impact of pre-existing H1 stalk immunity. To assess the protective efficacy of these vaccination regimens, the ferrets were challenged with pH1N1 (Cal/09) virus. Sera were collected at the indicated time points and vaccine-induced antibody responses were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were measured on day 91 (pre-challenge). Ferrets immunized with the influenza B-cH9/1 virus developed H9-specific HI titers ranging from 40 to 320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). All animals which received the booster cH8/1 LAIV vaccination developed H8-specific HI titers ranging from 10 to 320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Following the second booster immunization with cH11/1 LAIV or cH5/1 IIV, the ferrets developed H11-specific or H5-specific HI titers that ranged from 20 to 160 or 20 to 80, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2C,D</xref>). Importantly, during the course of the immunization schedule, all ferrets remained serologically negative for the pH1N1 influenza virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2A</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Vaccine-specific antibody titers measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay.

B-cH9/1 virus-primed ferrets induced anti-H1 stalk IgG titers of 1:1100 to 1:1600 at day 21 (pre-boost #1). At day 49 (pre-boost #2), anti-stalk antibodies were boosted in animals that received one dose of LAIV vaccines. The B-cH9/1 virus primed groups generally had 3-fold higher stalk-specific antibody titers than the unprimed groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, for the Prime-LAIV-Mock and Prime-LAIV-LAIV groups, immunization with cH8/1 LAIV boosted stalk-specific IgG titers, which reached a plateau (~1:10,000) at day 49 and remained unchanged following the second booster immunization (day 91). In the absence of the B-cH9/1 prime immunization, sequential immunization with LAIV-LAIV induced anti-stalk IgG titers that were similar to those induced by sequential immunization with Prime-LAIV-LAIV on day 91, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 1:15,222. Sequential immunization with Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccines induced the highest H1 stalk-specific IgG titers which peaked on day 91 at a titer of 1:30,444 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition to the H1 stalk-reactive IgG responses, we also monitored serum anti-stalk IgA titers induced by these different vaccination regimens. The serum stalk-reactive IgA responses shared a similar trend as the serum IgG response albeit at one log lower titers. Although the Prime-LAIV-IIV immunization induced the highest serum anti-H1 stalk IgA responses, there were no significant differences in the H1 stalk-reactive IgA antibody titers induced by the Prime-LAIV-LAIV, Prime-LAIV-IIV, and Mock-LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Nasal IgA was reported to correlate with protection against influenza virus infection in human cohorts (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), especially for nasal delivered vaccines such as LAIV; therefore, we also measured the anamnestic stalk-specific mucosal IgA antibody titers in nasal washes on day 3 post-pH1N1 (Cal/09) influenza virus challenge infection. All vaccinated ferrets, except for the mock-immunized animals, developed nasal IgA antibody responses, albeit, varied titers were observed within each immunization group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2B</xref>). The LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimens induced greater anti-N1 NA IgG antibody levels as compared to the mock immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination also induced significantly higher H2-reactive IgG titers than mock immunization (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02). Notably, LAIV-LAIV immunization also induced higher H2-specific IgG antibody titers than the LAIV group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). A similar pattern of antibody responses was observed between H1 and H18 (a more distantly related group 1 HA as compared to H1), albeit H18 titers were lower in all vaccination groups. Again, the Prime-LAIV-IIV regimen induced higher H18-reactive IgG antibodies (GMT of 1:2691) than the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C)</xref>. However, only low antibody titers specific for the group 2 H3 HA were detected in all immunized groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, our results indicated that cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV and/or Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination approaches boosted HA stalk-specific and broadly cross-reactive IgG antibody responses against group 1 HA (H1, H2, and H18), but did not induce cross-group (group 2, H3) reactive antibodies.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Breadth of antibody responses measured by ELISA.

Nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples were harvested on days 1 and 3 post-challenge to examine the kinetics of virus replication in the upper respiratory tract. All animals were then humanely euthanized on day 4 post-challenge infection for collection of respiratory tract specimens and analysis of viral titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, the mock-immunized animals had the highest viral titers in nasal wash samples on days 1 and 3 post-pH1N1 virus infection, with GMT of 5.88 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> and 4.72 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> PFU/mL, respectively. Strikingly, both LAIV-LAIV vaccinated groups significantly suppressed viral replication in the upper respiratory tract on days 1 and 3 post-pH1N1 challenge infection, irrespective of the B-cH9/1 prime immunization. Moreover, the Prime-LAIV-Mock and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated ferrets had decreased viral titers on day 1 post-challenge infection with titers of 1.56 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> and 4.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup> PFU/mL, respectively, and almost undetectable viral titers on day 3 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar trends were also observed for the oropharyngeal swab viral titers, albeit at lower viral titers. Again, animals which received Prime-LAIV-LAIV, LAIV-LAIV, or the Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimen showed greater reduction of oropharyngeal swab viral titers on day 1 post-infection than those animals that received a single dose of LAIV or the mock immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, all vaccinated groups were completely protected against viral replication throughout the respiratory tract, whereas the pH1N1 influenza virus replicated efficiently in the nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung of the mock-immunized control ferrets, with GMTs of 4.14 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>, 2.82 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>, and 7.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> PFU/gram tissue, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C,E,F</xref>).

To confirm this observation, the LAIV-LAIV (group 1) and LAIV-IIV (group 2) vaccine regimens were selected for a follow-up vaccination study. Since our previous study demonstrated that IIV-IIV vaccination also elicited high stalk-reactive antibody titers (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), here we further examined whether H1 stalk-specific antibodies were sufficient to prevent infection by a heterosubtypic H6N1 influenza virus. An additional IIV-IIV vaccination group in which cH8/1 was delivered as IIV (Group 3) was included. A control group of ferrets was sequentially immunized with two doses of quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (QIV-QIV) to mimic the standard of care for human immunizations (Group 5). Lastly, an A/Ann Arbor/6/1960-based H3N2 LAIV immunization group was included to examine the potential contribution of cellular immune responses toward internal proteins (i.e., NP, M1, NS1, etc.) to protection against influenza virus infection (Group 7). Mock-immunized ferrets received allantoic fluid (Group 6). The detailed vaccination regimens are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. Since A/teal/HK/W312/97 (tk/97) H6N1 virus was reported to replicate efficiently in ferrets (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we selected this avian influenza virus as the challenge virus in this study. This H6N1 (tk/97) virus encodes an H6 (group 1 HA) stalk, which is antigenically distinct from the H1 (also group 1) stalk immunogen included in all vaccines used in this study. Vaccine-induced HI titer, H1 stalk-specific, and the breadth of antibody responses in sera were measured and reported in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figures</xref>.

Notably, the Prime-IIV-IIV regimen also elicited high stalk-reactive IgG and IgA and N1-specific antibodies in sera similar to the results from our previous study (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); on the contrary, the H3N2 LAIV vaccinated animals did not induce substantial H1 stalk-reactive IgG and IgA and N1-specific antibody responses in serum and/or nasal washes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). HI titers were also measured on day 77 (pre-challenge). Ferrets immunized with the influenza B-cH9/1 virus developed H9-specific HI titers ranging from 80 to 320, except for one outlier from the prime only group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). All animals which received the cH8/1 LAIV booster immunization and two ferrets which received the cH8/1 IIV booster immunization developed H8-specific HI titers ranging from 40 to 320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). The animals which received the H3N2 LAIV vaccine also developed H3-specific HI titers of 320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Following the second booster immunization with cH11/1 LAIV or cH5/1 IIV, the ferrets developed H11-specific or H5-specific HI titers that ranged from 5 to 80 or 40, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7D,E</xref>). Moreover, all ferrets were also confirmed to be serologically negative against the H6N1 influenza virus used for the challenge infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>).

The H6 HA includes an HA stalk that is phylogenetically distinct from the H1 HA stalk but also belongs to the group 1 HAs. Following the sequential immunizations, ferrets were intranasally challenged with 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of an H6N1 (tk/97) avian influenza virus. Nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples were harvested on days 1 and 3 post-challenge infection, and animals were euthanized on day 4 post-challenge for collection of tissue specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Body weight changes were also monitored during the infection period. Overall, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated groups did not experience any body weight loss resulting from virus infection as compared to the other immunization groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S6A</xref>). As expected, high viral titers were detected in nasal wash samples of mock-immunized animals, with GMT of 3.15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU/ml. Promisingly, nasal wash viral titers could not be detected from the LAIV-LAIV vaccination group on day 1 post challenge infection. All the other vaccinated groups suppressed virus replication in the upper respiratory tract by 1&#x02013;2 logs at day 3 post-challenge infection. Our results indicated that the cHA-based Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimen inhibited virus replication as evidenced by low viral GMT of 2.66 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup> PFU/mL for the day 3 nasal wash samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). Similar trends in virus titers were also obtained for the oropharyngeal swab samples, but toward lower titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). Virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts were also evaluated on day 4 post-challenge. Encouragingly, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated ferrets also effectively suppressed virus replication in the nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). Similar trends in virus titers was also observed for the olfactory bulb samples, with olfactory bulb virus titers for the Prime-LAIV-LAIV, Prime-LAIV-IIV, and H3N2 LAIV vaccinated ferrets below the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). Interestingly, the H3N2 LAIV immunization suppressed virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract which was likely due to T cell-mediated immune responses against the internal viral proteins, but independently of HA stalk-specific antibody responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S3B,C</xref>). Unfortunately, the H6N1 (tk/97) virus used in this study did not replicate consistently in the lower respiratory tract (trachea and lung) as virus replication was only detected in a few animals from the prime-only, QIV-QIV, or mock-immunized groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S6B,C</xref>). In summary, the cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimen conferred the best protection against H6N1 virus infection.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Viral shedding post H6N1 (10<sup>6</sup> PFU) challenge infection.

Therefore, we examined T cell responses elicited by the best cHA-based vaccination regimens (Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV) at day 4 post-viral challenge to assess the recall of cellular responses that may have contributed to the observed protection against pH1N1 or H6N1 influenza virus infection. To analyze influenza virus-specific T cell responses to the H1 stalk domain, we designed a panel of peptides based on A/California/04/09 (Cal/09) sequences, which potentially correspond to predicted CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes. Overall, the ten Cal/09 HA stalk-based peptides shared 53&#x02013;88% identity with the H6N1 (tk/97) strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). Nucleoprotein (NP)-specific T cell responses were measured following stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a pool of Cal/09 (H1N1) virus NP 15-mer peptides that overlapped by 11 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the NP encoded by Cal/09 and tk/97 virus strains share 93% identity. CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> effector T cells in PBMCs or mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) were analyzed by flow cytometry after peptide stimulation. An HIV gp120 peptide was included as a control. The gating strategy is diagrammed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S7A</xref>. The Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimen induced higher HA stalk-specific T cell (both CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>) responses among PBMCs as compared to the naive immunized group. No apparent differences for NP-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed. Low T cell responses for the na&#x000ef;ve group were observed upon stimulation with irrelevant gp 120 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). From the H6N1 challenge study, we observed that the Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated ferrets induced slightly higher frequency of H1 stalk-specific effector T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup>IFN&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>) than the na&#x000ef;ve immunized animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>).

The H3N2 LAIV vaccinated control group also stimulated NP-specific, but not HA stalk-specific, T cell responses (both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>), which supports the concept that the LAIV backbone induces cell-mediated immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>). In addition to circulating PBMCs, we also examined whether the H6N1 challenge infection recalled T cell responses within draining lymph nodes.

Our recent studies demonstrated that cHA-based LAIV-IIV vaccination regimens conferred better protection against pH1N1 viral challenge than that provided by sequential immunization with cHA-based IIV-IIV or trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV)-TIV in a preclinical ferret model (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The aims of this preclinical study were to assess whether HA stalk-specific antibody responses could be further enhanced by sequential immunization with cHA-based LAIV vaccines, and to examine the breadth of protective immunity induced by our sequential immunization regimen. As expected, we confirmed that Prime-LAIV-IIV and Prime-IIV-IIV vaccination regimens induced comparable broadly-reactive and HA stalk-specific humoral immune responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S3, S4</xref>); however, lower stalk-reactive IgG titers in serum and IgA titers in nasal wash samples were observed for the Prime-IIV-IIV vaccination regimens than in our previous study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S3</xref>) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which may be attributed to the genetic diversity of the outbred ferret model. The results from the Prime-LAIV-IIV regimens also indicated that immunization with the cH9/1 influenza virus primed strong H1 stalk-specific and broad antibody responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Recently, Isakova-Sivak et al. reported that two doses of cHA-based LAIV vaccines (Len/57-based) induced greater broadly-reactive and HA stalk-reactive IgG antibodies when compared to immunization with Len/57-based LAIV expressing wild-type HAs in mice (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Our data echo their results. Additionally, Hoft et al. demonstrated that children immunized with a seasonal LAIV vaccine (FluMist) induced stronger influenza virus-specific secretory IgA responses than those immunized by IIV (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our results also showed that ferrets immunized with cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccines induced superior IgA titers in nasal washes at 3 days post pH1N1 or H6N1 challenge than all the other immunized groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3D</xref>). With respect to the protective immunity elicited by our Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination approach, our findings suggest that serum and mucosal antibody responses in combination with cell mediated immunity are required to provide complete protection against influenza virus infection. The quality and level of stalk-specific antibodies elicited by the vaccine may also determine the breadth and duration of protection against distinct drifted or pandemic strains of influenza virus. A recent study demonstrated in the mouse model that in the absence of immunodominant B cells, plasma B cells recognizing subdominant B cell epitopes may selectively expand, increase germinal center (GC) reactions, and differentiate into long-lived memory B cells (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). A recent study also demonstrated that immunization with an H5N1 LAIV vaccine primed GC B cell reactions and stimulated the generation of plasmablast and memory B cells in MLN, and that booster immunization with inactivated subunit vaccine recalled these H5-specific B cell responses in axillary lymph nodes, spleen and peripheral blood in African green monkeys (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Although the precise protective mechanisms underlying the humoral immunity induced by our vaccination regimen are still unclear, recent studies have highlighted the contribution of Fc-dependent mechanisms to protection by broadly-reactive neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It will be interesting to further dissect the development of long-lived B and T cell responses induced by sequential immunization with our cHA-based vaccines. Along these lines, immunological reagents and assays are being developed for the ferret model (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which is an animal model of influenza that was highlighted in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s strategic plan for the development of universal influenza vaccines (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>As expected, vaccination with the H3N2 LAIV vaccine did not induce H1 stalk-specific antibody responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S3</xref>); however, H3N2 LAIV vaccination suppressed viral replication in the upper respiratory tract following H6N1 virus challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), which was likely due to cell mediated immune responses against the conserved internal proteins. Contrary to another recent report (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we did not detect replication of the tk/97 H6N1 virus in the lower respiratory tract despite detecting viral replication in the nasal turbinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S6B,C</xref>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is differences in methods to quantify influenza virus titers. Herein, virus titers were quantified by traditional plaque assay on MDCK cells, whereas in the previous report virus titers were quantified by 50% egg infectious dose (EID<sub>50</sub>) per gram of tissue. Of note, the A/teal/HK/W312/97 (tk/97) H6N1 influenza virus used for the second vaccination/challenge experiment encodes a glutamate residue at position 627 of the PB2 which is a host determinant for influenza virus replication in avian species (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings have emphasized that cellular immune responses contribute to protection against influenza virus infection. Consistently, two recent clinical studies demonstrated that vaccinees who received LAIV vaccines significantly increased T cell responses (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Influenza virus-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the airway (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and lung-resident CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (Trm) (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) appear critical for cross-protection against influenza virus infection. In addition, a recently identified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset, the follicular helper T cells (Tfh), has been reported to coordinate GC reactions to stimulate the expansion of plasmablast and memory B cells, thus inducing high quality influenza virus-specific antibody responses (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). To what extent our universal influenza virus vaccine approach stimulates such T cell responses will be the subject of future immunological studies. Although our findings demonstrated that our cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimens induced stalk-specific humoral immunity and cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S7</xref>) which conferred cross-protection against influenza virus infection, the results obtained with this animal model of influenza, while encouraging, have yet to provide a good correlation between any immune readouts and protection. Interestingly, fewer peripheral Cal/09 HA- and/or NP-specific T cells were recalled in the Prime-LAIV-LAIV immunized group at day 4 post-H6N1 challenge infection. This may be accounted by the low homology between the Cal/09 (H1N1) versus tk/97 (H6N1) hemagglutinin stalk peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced the re-inclusion of LAIV vaccines into the list of recommended vaccines for the 2018&#x02013;2019 influenza season (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This change in clinical practice by the ACIP supports our efforts to translate our universal influenza virus vaccine that includes an LAIV component to clinical trials, especially for the pediatric and adult populations. In particular, incorporation of our universal vaccine approach into childhood immunization practice may confer &#x0201c;immunologic imprinting&#x0201d; of HA stalk immunity that provides more desirable immunologic responses to future immunization with influenza virus vaccines and provide broader protection against influenza virus infection (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) recently published a position statement in which they outlined the critical elements of a universal influenza virus vaccine: (i) provide &#x02265; 75% protection against symptomatic disease caused by infection with group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses, and (ii) afford &#x02265; 12 months protection in all populations (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In summary, the results of this preclinical study suggest that, of the sequential immunization approaches examined, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination approach is the most promising vaccination regimen to confer protection against infection by influenza A viruses encoding a group 1-type hemagglutinin. However, the immune response following the tested vaccine regimens in ferrets might be substantially different than the immune response in humans with pre-existing immunity. It will therefore be important to compare these approaches in clinical trials before final conclusions are drawn. Although, herein, we have not addressed all criteria noted above, the current findings encourage the development of universal influenza virus vaccine components that target group 2 influenza A viruses and influenza B viruses. The findings reported herein are consistent with our previous findings (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and collectively demonstrate that influenza virus vaccines that focus immune responses on the HA stalk domain are a viable approach to a universal influenza virus vaccine. Ideally, our vaccine candidates will be able to induce not only stalk-reactive antibodies against all influenza subtypes, but also influenza virus-specific cellular immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells, Viruses, and Proteins</title><p>Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells used for plaque assays were maintained in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 100 U/mL penicillin plus 100 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin (1x P/S).

The dosage of either cH8/1 or cH11/1 LAIV used in this study was 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> PFU per animal. Some groups of ferrets were intramuscularly boosted with 0.5 mL dose of AS03 adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV. The serum was separately collected at the indicated time points. Notably, the H6N1 challenge study focused on the best-in-class vaccination approaches (LAIV-LAIV and LAIV-IIV) for a more stringent evaluation of the protective immune responses elicited by these cHA-based vaccines. A &#x0201c;standard of care&#x0201d; group of ferrets which received two human doses of QIV (QIV-QIV Fluarix, GSK) and a single dose of H3N2 LAIV vaccination group were also included. The challenge infection dose of either Cal/09 pH1N1 virus or A/teal/HK/W312/97 (tk/97) H6N1 virus was 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/per ferret in 1 mL of PBS. For evaluation of vaccine effectiveness from both challenge studies, nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from anesthetized ferrets at day 1 and 3 post-challenge infection. At day 4 post-challenge infection, anesthetized ferrets were euthanized by exsanguination followed by intracardiac injection of Sleepaway euthanasia solution (Fort Dodge, Sodium Pentobarbital).

In brief, for serum IgG, each well of 96-well plate was coated with 0.1 &#x003bc;g of antigen in sodium bicarbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

Serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted in blocking solution (starting dilution from 1:100) and added into plates and incubated for 2 h at RT. Next, plates were washed three times with PBST and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-ferret IgG (Alpha Diagnostic International) at a dilution of 1:5000 was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at RT, followed by four times PBST washes and developed by SigmaFast OPD (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride). After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 M hydrochloric acid and plates were read at a wavelength of 490 nm in a plate reader (Biotek Synergy H1). The average plus three standard deviations of blank wells was calculated as a cut-off endpoint value. The same procedure was used to measure IgA titers in nasal washes and serum.

While plates were being blocked, virus stock was 2-fold serially diluted in blocking buffer (starting dilution from 1:5). After blocking for 1 h, 100 &#x003bc;l amount of the diluted virus was transferred into fetuin-coated plates and incubated for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C.

After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 M phosphoric acid and plates were read at a wavelength of 410 nm in a plate reader (Biotek). 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of virus (in this case, approximately half the maximal OD reading value) was used for subsequent NI assays. For NI assay, ELISA plates were coated and blocked in a same manner used for the NA assay. While plates were blocking, ferret serum samples (from the pre-challenge time point) were 2-fold serially diluted in a separate 96-well plates using blocking buffer, starting with a 1:50 dilution, at a final volume of 125 &#x003bc;l. One hundred and twenty five microliter of virus stock (at a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> PFU) was added on top of the diluted serum and briefly tapped for mixture, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. Two hundred microliter of the virus/serum mixture were transferred in parallel to the fetuin-coated plates, after which the plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h. The rest of the NI assay protocol was identical to that of the NA assay. The readouts obtained from the plate reader were plotted in Prism 7.0 software, normalized by the average of the negative control (defined as 0%) and the average of positive control (virus only, defined as 100%).
