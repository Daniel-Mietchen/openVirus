  <p>H1 stalk- and N1-specific antibody titers measured by ELISA and/or ELLA. The IgG antibody responses were measured on days 0, 21, 49, and/or 91. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> H1 stalk serum IgG and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> H1 stalk serum IgA mean endpoint titers Â± standard error of the mean (SEM) against cH6/1 protein were indicated. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> N1 serum total IgG titer against N1 (Cal/09) protein by ELISA is plotted on the y-axis. Each point indicates the GMT for each individual animal (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 or 8/ group). The white bars indicate the averaged endpoint titer of each experimental group. The black dashed line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Fetuin-based enzyme-linked lectin assays were used to measure NA-inhibiting-antibody titers as reductions in the N1 NA enzymatic activities of the H7N1 viruses. The percentage of NA-inhibiting curves were graphed in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2C</xref>. Corresponding IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were determined as the 50% reduction in the NA enzymatic activities of H7
   <sub>mal</sub>N1
   <sub>Cal09</sub> virus strain. Data in 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple comparison test (multiple time points). Data in 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> were compared to mock vaccinated animals with one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test (single time point). ns, no significant difference. The asterisks refer to the level of significance: 
   <sup>*</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
   <sup>**</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; 
   <sup>***</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001.
