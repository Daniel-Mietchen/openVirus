  <p>Vaccine-specific antibody titers measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Pre-challenge (day 91) hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against 
   <bold>(A)</bold> cH9/1, 
   <bold>(B)</bold> cH8/1, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> cH11/1, and 
   <bold>(D)</bold> cH5/1 viruses were measured prior to pH1N1 influenza A virus challenge infection. Y-axis indicates HI titers against the different virus strains. LAIV-LAIV vaccinated animals are shown as blue circles. Single dose of LAIV vaccinated animals are shown as red triangles. LAIV followed by AS03-adjuvanted IIV vaccinated animals are shown as green circles. Mock-immunized animals are shown as black circles. Empty symbols denote unprimed. Closed symbols denote B-cH9/1 virus prime immunization. White bars indicate the geometric mean titers (GMT) with individual scatter dot plots. Each point indicates the titer for each individual ferret (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 or 8 /group). The black dashed line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test. The asterisks refer to the level of significance.
