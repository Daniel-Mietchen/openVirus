   <bold>(C)</bold> H18, and group 2 
   <bold>(D)</bold> H3 were measured prior to pH1N1 challenge infection (day 91). LAIV-LAIV vaccinated animals are shown as blue circles. Single dose of LAIV vaccinated animals are shown as red triangles. LAIV followed by AS03-adjuvanted IIV vaccinated animals are shown as green circles. Mock-immunized animals are shown as black circles. Empty symbols denote unprimed. Closed symbols denote B-cH9/1 prime immunization. White bars indicate the GMT with individual scatter dot plots. Each point indicates the endpoint titer for each individual ferret (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 or 8/group). Data were compared to Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccinated animals with one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test. ns, no significant difference. The asterisks refer to the level of significance,
