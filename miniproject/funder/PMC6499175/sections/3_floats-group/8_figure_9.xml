  <p>Analysis of antigen-specific T cell responses in PBMCs by flow cytometry. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Ten peptide sequences corresponding to predicted T cell epitopes within the Cal/09 (H1N1) stalk domain were identified by computational analysis. Alignments of the HA stalk peptides between Cal/09 (H1N1) and tk/97 (H6N1) are summarized. Non-conserved amino acids are indicated. Influenza virus HA stalk-specific, NP-specific and gp-120-specific T cell responses from PBMCs are shown for the Prime-LAIV-LAIV (blue circles), Prime-LAIV-IIV (green circles), or naïve animals (white diamonds) following challenge infection with pH1N1 influenza virus 
   <bold>(B)</bold> or H6N1 influenza virus 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. X-axis indicates influenza HA stalk-specific, NP-specific, and irrelevant peptide gp120-specific CD3

   <sup>+</sup> T cells. Fold changes in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFN-γ expressions over the MFI of naïve animals were calculated and plotted on the y-axis. One sample for a Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated ferret in 
   <bold>(C)</bold> was contaminated and was not included in the analysis. Each point indicates the fold-change in MFI of activated T cells for each individual ferret. The black dashed line indicates the averaged baseline responses of naïve animals. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple comparison test (different peptides stimulation). The asterisks refer to the level of significance:
