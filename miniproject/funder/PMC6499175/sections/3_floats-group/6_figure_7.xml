  <p>Vaccine-specific antibody titers measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Pre-challenge (day 77) hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers against 
   <bold>(A)</bold> cH9/1, 
   <bold>(B)</bold> cH8/1, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> H3N2, 
   <bold>(D)</bold> cH11/1, 
   <bold>(E)</bold> cH5/1, and 
   <bold>(F)</bold> H6N1 viruses were measured prior to H6N1 influenza A virus challenge infection. Y-axis indicates HI titers against the different virus strains. LAIV-LAIV vaccinated animals are shown in blue. LAIV followed by AS03-adjuvanted IIV vaccinated animals are shown in green. Two doses of AS03-adjuvanted IIV vaccinated animals are shown in red. Prime only, two doses of QIV, and single dose of H3N2 LAIV vaccinated animals are shown in light blue, purple, and orange, respectively. Mock-immunized animals are shown as black. All cHA-vaccinated ferrets were primed with influenza B-cH9/1 virus. White bars indicate the GMT with individual scatter dot plots. Each point indicates the titer for each individual ferret (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). The black dashed line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test. ns, no significant difference. The asterisks refer to the level of significance.
