  <p>Viral shedding post H6N1 (10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU) challenge infection. Viral titers of each vaccinated group or mock animals were measured by plaque assay. LAIV-LAIV vaccinated animals are shown in blue. LAIV followed by AS03-adjuvanted IIV vaccinated animals are shown in green. Two doses of AS03-adjuvanted IIV vaccinated animals are shown in red. Prime only, two doses of QIV, and single dose of H3N2 LAIV vaccinated animals are shown in light blue, purple, and orange, respectively. Mock-immunized animals are shown in black. All cHA-vaccinated ferrets were primed with influenza B-cH9/1 virus. White bars indicate the GMT with individual scatter dot plots. Each point indicates the titer for each individual ferret (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). The black dashed line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Nasal wash and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Oropharyngeal swab viral titers were measured on days 1 and 3 post infection. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Nasal turbinate and 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Olfactory bulb viral titers in the upper respiratory tract were determined on day 4 post challenge. Groups in 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple comparison test (multiple time points). Groups in 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and 
   <bold>(D)</bold> were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's multiple comparison test (single time point). The asterisks refer to the level of significance:
