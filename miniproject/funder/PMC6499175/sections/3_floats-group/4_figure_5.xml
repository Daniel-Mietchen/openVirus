  <p>Viral replication post pH1N1 (10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU) challenge infection. Viral titers of each vaccinated group or mock animals were measured by plaque assay. LAIV-LAIV vaccinated animals are shown as blue circles. Single dose of LAIV vaccinated animals are shown as red triangles. LAIV followed by AS03-adjuvanted IIV vaccinated animals are shown as green circles. Mock-immunized animals are shown as black circles. Empty symbols denote unprimed. Closed symbols denote B-cH9/1 virus prime immunization. White bars indicate the GMT with individual scatter dot plots. Each point indicates the titer for each individual ferret (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 or 8/group). The black dashed line indicates the limit of detection for the assay. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Nasal wash and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Oropharyngeal swab viral titers were measured on days 1 and 3 post infection. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Nasal turbinate, 
   <bold>(D)</bold> olfactory bulb viral titers in the upper respiratory tract, and 
   <bold>(E)</bold> trachea, 
   <bold>(F)</bold> lung (left medial bronchus of the upper lobe) viral titers in the lower respiratory tract were determined on day 4 post challenge. Groups in 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were compared to mock vaccinated animals with one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test. The asterisks refer to the level of significance.
