  <p>Overview of the pH1N1 viral challenge study design. The timeline and experimental groups for the pH1N1 challenge study are outlined. Ferrets in the cHA vaccination groups were unprimed or primed with an influenza B-cH9/1 virus. All cHA vaccination groups except for the mock animals received a booster immunization of cH8/1 LAIV on day 21, followed by a second booster immunization on day 49 with cH11/1 LAIV or cH5/1 IIV vaccine (with adjuvant AS03) to boost stalk-specific antibodies. Mock immunization controls received plain allantoic fluid (mock group). All ferrets were challenged with pH1N1 (Cal/09) influenza A virus on day 91, and sample specimens were collected on days 1, 3, and 4 post-challenge infection.</p>
