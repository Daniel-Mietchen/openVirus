  <p>Overview of the H6N1 viral challenge study design. The timeline and experimental groups for the H6N1 challenge study are outlined. All cHA-based vaccinated ferrets were prime immunized with B-cH9/1 virus, followed by booster immunization with cH8/1 LAIV or AS03-adjuvanted cH8/1 IIV on day 35, followed by a second booster immunization with cH11/1 LAIV or AS03-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV on day 56. In addition, a prime-only, QIV-QIV, H3N2 LAIV, or mock-vaccinated ferrets were included as control groups. All ferrets were challenged with the H6N1 (tk/97) influenza A virus on day 77, and sample specimens were collected on days 1, 3, and 4 post-challenge infection.</p>
