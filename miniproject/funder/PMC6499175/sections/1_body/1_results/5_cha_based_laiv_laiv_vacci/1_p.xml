<p>In addition to humoral immunity, cellular immune responses may also play a crucial role for cross-protective and long-lasting protective immunity. Therefore, we examined T cell responses elicited by the best cHA-based vaccination regimens (Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV) at day 4 post-viral challenge to assess the recall of cellular responses that may have contributed to the observed protection against pH1N1 or H6N1 influenza virus infection. To analyze influenza virus-specific T cell responses to the H1 stalk domain, we designed a panel of peptides based on A/California/04/09 (Cal/09) sequences, which potentially correspond to predicted CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and/or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes. Overall, the ten Cal/09 HA stalk-based peptides shared 53–88% identity with the H6N1 (tk/97) strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>). Nucleoprotein (NP)-specific T cell responses were measured following stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with a pool of Cal/09 (H1N1) virus NP 15-mer peptides that overlapped by 11 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the NP encoded by Cal/09 and tk/97 virus strains share 93% identity. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> effector T cells in PBMCs or mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) were analyzed by flow cytometry after peptide stimulation. An HIV gp120 peptide was included as a control. The gating strategy is diagrammed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S7A</xref>. The Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimen induced higher HA stalk-specific T cell (both CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>) responses among PBMCs as compared to the naive immunized group. No apparent differences for NP-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were observed. Low T cell responses for the naïve group were observed upon stimulation with irrelevant gp 120 peptide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). From the H6N1 challenge study, we observed that the Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated ferrets induced slightly higher frequency of H1 stalk-specific effector T cells (CD3
 <sup>+</sup>IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup>, CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD8
 <sup>+</sup>IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup>) than the naïve immunized animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>). The Prime-LAIV-IIV regimen induced more NP-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup>IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses than the Prime-LAIV-LAIV or H3N2 LAIV vaccinated group. The H3N2 LAIV vaccinated control group also stimulated NP-specific, but not HA stalk-specific, T cell responses (both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup>), which supports the concept that the LAIV backbone induces cell-mediated immunity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9C</xref>). In addition to circulating PBMCs, we also examined whether the H6N1 challenge infection recalled T cell responses within draining lymph nodes. Accordingly, we measured HA stalk-specific and NP-specific T cell responses in mediastinal lymph nodes after 4 days post-H6N1 viral challenge. Based on gating of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccinated group induced slightly higher percentages of HA stalk-specific and NP-specific T cells (both CD4
 <sup>+</sup>IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup>IFNγ
 <sup>+</sup>) than the Prime-LAIV-IIV, H3N2 LAIV and mock immunized groups (
