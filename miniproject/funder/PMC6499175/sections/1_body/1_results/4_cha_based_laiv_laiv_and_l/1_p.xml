<p>Finally, we assessed the protective efficacies of these distinct vaccination regimens against challenge infection by an H6N1 influenza virus. The H6 HA includes an HA stalk that is phylogenetically distinct from the H1 HA stalk but also belongs to the group 1 HAs. Following the sequential immunizations, ferrets were intranasally challenged with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU of an H6N1 (tk/97) avian influenza virus. Nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples were harvested on days 1 and 3 post-challenge infection, and animals were euthanized on day 4 post-challenge for collection of tissue specimens (

Overall, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated groups did not experience any body weight loss resulting from virus infection as compared to the other immunization groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S6A</xref>). As expected, high viral titers were detected in nasal wash samples of mock-immunized animals, with GMT of 3.15 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/ml. Promisingly, nasal wash viral titers could not be detected from the LAIV-LAIV vaccination group on day 1 post challenge infection. All the other vaccinated groups suppressed virus replication in the upper respiratory tract by 1–2 logs at day 3 post-challenge infection. Our results indicated that the cHA-based Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimen inhibited virus replication as evidenced by low viral GMT of 2.66 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU/mL for the day 3 nasal wash samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). Similar trends in virus titers were also obtained for the oropharyngeal swab samples, but toward lower titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). Virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts were also evaluated on day 4 post-challenge. Encouragingly, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated ferrets also effectively suppressed virus replication in the nasal cavity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). Similar trends in virus titers was also observed for the olfactory bulb samples, with olfactory bulb virus titers for the Prime-LAIV-LAIV, Prime-LAIV-IIV, and H3N2 LAIV vaccinated ferrets below the limit of detection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). Interestingly, the H3N2 LAIV immunization suppressed virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract which was likely due to T cell-mediated immune responses against the internal viral proteins, but independently of HA stalk-specific antibody responses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S3B,C</xref>). Unfortunately, the H6N1 (tk/97) virus used in this study did not replicate consistently in the lower respiratory tract (trachea and lung) as virus replication was only detected in a few animals from the prime-only, QIV-QIV, or mock-immunized groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S6B,C</xref>). In summary, the cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimen conferred the best protection against H6N1 virus infection.
