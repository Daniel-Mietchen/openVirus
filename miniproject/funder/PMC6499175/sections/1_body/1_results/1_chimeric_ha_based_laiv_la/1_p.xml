<p>The objective of this preclinical study was to assess the protective immunity induced by immunization with group 1 hemagglutinin-specific influenza virus vaccines based on chimeric hemagglutinins (cHAs) in a ferret model of influenza. The experimental designs and immunization strategies are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Since most human adults have a primed repertoire of B cells with specificity to the HA stalk domain (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), we included an influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 (B-cH9/1) to mimic pre-existing HA stalk immunity. We then compared the ability of our sequential immunization strategies to boost antibody titers against the group 1 hemagglutinin stalk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). LAIV vaccines were reported to induce more robust humoral and cellular immune responses in children (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), but not in adults (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and the results of our previous study (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) demonstrated that LAIV followed by AS03 adjuvanted-split inactivated influenza virus vaccines (IIV) [LAIV-IIV] and IIV-IIV vaccination regimens effectively induced stalk-specific immunity in ferrets. To see whether LAIV alone may be sufficient to induce protective immunity, we included immunization groups that received one or two doses of cHA-based LAIV vaccines. The LAIV strains used in this study were first characterized by a pathotyping pilot study. Our results showed that the cH11/1 N1 LAIV (cH11/1 LAIV) virus is attenuated in ferrets as compared to wild-type A/California/04/09 (Cal/09) virus in terms of absence of body weight loss and undetectable viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract as shown in our previous study (cH8/1 LAIV) (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref> (cH11/1 LAIV). cH8/1 LAIV and cH11/1 LAIV vaccine strains were selected for this study as the first and second booster immunizations, respectively. We excluded the cH5/1 LAIV component in the vaccination regimen to avoid potential safety concerns over administering an H5 virus to humans. In addition, since our previous studies demonstrated that addition of the AS03 adjuvant to the cHA-based influenza split IIV vaccine substantially improved antibody titers against the HA stalk (both IgG and IgA in serum) and against the N1 neuraminidase (NA) in mouse (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and ferret models (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), AS03 was included in all IIV vaccines in this preclinical study.
