<p>Four-month-old neutered male ferrets were initially primed with a replication competent influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 (B-cH9/1 live virus), followed by booster vaccination(s) with cH8/1 LAIV, cH8/1 LAIV followed by cH11/1 LAIV (LAIV-LAIV), or cH8/1 LAIV followed by AS03-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV (LAIV-IIV). Since human adults have a primed HA stalk-specific B-cell repertoire (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), ferrets that were not primed with the B-cH9/1 live virus were also included in the experimental design to examine the impact of pre-existing H1 stalk immunity. To assess the protective efficacy of these vaccination regimens, the ferrets were challenged with pH1N1 (Cal/09) virus. Sera were collected at the indicated time points and vaccine-induced antibody responses were evaluated (
