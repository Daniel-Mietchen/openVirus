<p>The kinetics of H1 HA stalk-specific antibody responses were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). B-cH9/1 virus-primed ferrets induced anti-H1 stalk IgG titers of 1:1100 to 1:1600 at day 21 (pre-boost #1). At day 49 (pre-boost #2), anti-stalk antibodies were boosted in animals that received one dose of LAIV vaccines. The B-cH9/1 virus primed groups generally had 3-fold higher stalk-specific antibody titers than the unprimed groups (

Notably, for the Prime-LAIV-Mock and Prime-LAIV-LAIV groups, immunization with cH8/1 LAIV boosted stalk-specific IgG titers, which reached a plateau (~1:10,000) at day 49 and remained unchanged following the second booster immunization (day 91). In the absence of the B-cH9/1 prime immunization, sequential immunization with LAIV-LAIV induced anti-stalk IgG titers that were similar to those induced by sequential immunization with Prime-LAIV-LAIV on day 91, with a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 1:15,222. Sequential immunization with Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccines induced the highest H1 stalk-specific IgG titers which peaked on day 91 at a titer of 1:30,444 (

The serum stalk-reactive IgA responses shared a similar trend as the serum IgG response albeit at one log lower titers. Although the Prime-LAIV-IIV immunization induced the highest serum anti-H1 stalk IgA responses, there were no significant differences in the H1 stalk-reactive IgA antibody titers induced by the Prime-LAIV-LAIV, Prime-LAIV-IIV, and Mock-LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimens (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), especially for nasal delivered vaccines such as LAIV; therefore, we also measured the anamnestic stalk-specific mucosal IgA antibody titers in nasal washes on day 3 post-pH1N1 (Cal/09) influenza virus challenge infection. All vaccinated ferrets, except for the mock-immunized animals, developed nasal IgA antibody responses, albeit, varied titers were observed within each immunization group (

 <sub>50</sub> value of 566 and 310, respectively (
