<p>To assess the breadth of antibody responses induced by the cHA-based vaccinations, total IgG antibody titers against H1, H2, H18 (group 1), and H3 (group 2) HAs were measured on day 91 by ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimen boosted higher H1-specific IgG titers than the Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination group, reaching a GMT of 1:51,200. The LAIV-LAIV vaccination strategy also induced notable H1-specific IgG titers, reaching a GMT of 1:30,444 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). For cross-reactive antibody responses, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV group induced comparable cross-reactive H2-specific IgG titers with the Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimens. Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination also induced significantly higher H2-reactive IgG titers than mock immunization (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). A similar pattern of antibody responses was observed between H1 and H18 (a more distantly related group 1 HA as compared to H1), albeit H18 titers were lower in all vaccination groups. Again, the Prime-LAIV-IIV regimen induced higher H18-reactive IgG antibodies (GMT of 1:2691) than the other groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C)</xref>. However, only low antibody titers specific for the group 2 H3 HA were detected in all immunized groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, our results indicated that cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV and/or Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination approaches boosted HA stalk-specific and broadly cross-reactive IgG antibody responses against group 1 HA (H1, H2, and H18), but did not induce cross-group (group 2, H3) reactive antibodies.
