<p>To evaluate the efficacy of protection elicited by the distinct vaccine regimens, all ferrets were challenged by intranasal infection with 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU of a pH1N1 influenza virus isolate (Cal/09) on day 91 post-prime immunization. Nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples were harvested on days 1 and 3 post-challenge to examine the kinetics of virus replication in the upper respiratory tract. All animals were then humanely euthanized on day 4 post-challenge infection for collection of respiratory tract specimens and analysis of viral titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, the mock-immunized animals had the highest viral titers in nasal wash samples on days 1 and 3 post-pH1N1 virus infection, with GMT of 5.88 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 4.72 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/mL, respectively. Strikingly, both LAIV-LAIV vaccinated groups significantly suppressed viral replication in the upper respiratory tract on days 1 and 3 post-pH1N1 challenge infection, irrespective of the B-cH9/1 prime immunization. Moreover, the Prime-LAIV-Mock and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinated ferrets had decreased viral titers on day 1 post-challenge infection with titers of 1.56 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 4.5 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU/mL, respectively, and almost undetectable viral titers on day 3 post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar trends were also observed for the oropharyngeal swab viral titers, albeit at lower viral titers. Again, animals which received Prime-LAIV-LAIV, LAIV-LAIV, or the Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimen showed greater reduction of oropharyngeal swab viral titers on day 1 post-infection than those animals that received a single dose of LAIV or the mock immunization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, all vaccinated groups were completely protected against viral replication throughout the respiratory tract, whereas the pH1N1 influenza virus replicated efficiently in the nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung of the mock-immunized control ferrets, with GMTs of 4.14 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>, 2.82 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, and 7.6 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/gram tissue, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5C,E,F</xref>). Undetectable levels of viral replication were observed in the olfactory bulb for all immunized animals except for one mock-immunized animal with a titer of 2.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU/gram tissue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated that the Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccinations induced superior HA stalk-specific antibody responses and provided better protective immunity against pH1N1 virus infection.
