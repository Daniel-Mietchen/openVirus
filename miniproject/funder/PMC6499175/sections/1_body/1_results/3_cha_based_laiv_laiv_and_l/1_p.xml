<p>The results from the first study (pH1N1 influenza virus challenge) suggested that an LAIV component induced robust HA stalk-specific antibody responses and conferred the greatest level of protection against infection by pH1N1 influenza virus. To confirm this observation, the LAIV-LAIV (group 1) and LAIV-IIV (group 2) vaccine regimens were selected for a follow-up vaccination study. Since our previous study demonstrated that IIV-IIV vaccination also elicited high stalk-reactive antibody titers (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), here we further examined whether H1 stalk-specific antibodies were sufficient to prevent infection by a heterosubtypic H6N1 influenza virus. An additional IIV-IIV vaccination group in which cH8/1 was delivered as IIV (Group 3) was included. A control group of ferrets was sequentially immunized with two doses of quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (QIV-QIV) to mimic the standard of care for human immunizations (Group 5). Lastly, an A/Ann Arbor/6/1960-based H3N2 LAIV immunization group was included to examine the potential contribution of cellular immune responses toward internal proteins (i.e., NP, M1, NS1, etc.) to protection against influenza virus infection (Group 7). Mock-immunized ferrets received allantoic fluid (Group 6). The detailed vaccination regimens are summarized in

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we selected this avian influenza virus as the challenge virus in this study. This H6N1 (tk/97) virus encodes an H6 (group 1 HA) stalk, which is antigenically distinct from the H1 (also group 1) stalk immunogen included in all vaccines used in this study. Vaccine-induced HI titer, H1 stalk-specific, and the breadth of antibody responses in sera were measured and reported in the

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Notably, the Prime-IIV-IIV regimen also elicited high stalk-reactive IgG and IgA and N1-specific antibodies in sera similar to the results from our previous study (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); on the contrary, the H3N2 LAIV vaccinated animals did not induce substantial H1 stalk-reactive IgG and IgA and N1-specific antibody responses in serum and/or nasal washes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>). HI titers were also measured on day 77 (pre-challenge). Ferrets immunized with the influenza B-cH9/1 virus developed H9-specific HI titers ranging from 80 to 320, except for one outlier from the prime only group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). All animals which received the cH8/1 LAIV booster immunization and two ferrets which received the cH8/1 IIV booster immunization developed H8-specific HI titers ranging from 40 to 320 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). The animals which received the H3N2 LAIV vaccine also developed H3-specific HI titers of 320 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>). Following the second booster immunization with cH11/1 LAIV or cH5/1 IIV, the ferrets developed H11-specific or H5-specific HI titers that ranged from 5 to 80 or 40, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7D,E</xref>). Moreover, all ferrets were also confirmed to be serologically negative against the H6N1 influenza virus used for the challenge infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7F</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicated that cHA-based Prime-LAIV-IIV and Prime-LAIV-LAIV regimens afforded robust serum and mucosal antibody responses that could provide heterosubtypic immunity.
