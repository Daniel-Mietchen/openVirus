 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) of influenza viruses has recently become a promising strategy for the rational design of universal influenza virus vaccines. Our recent studies demonstrated that cHA-based LAIV-IIV vaccination regimens conferred better protection against pH1N1 viral challenge than that provided by sequential immunization with cHA-based IIV-IIV or trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV)-TIV in a preclinical ferret model (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The aims of this preclinical study were to assess whether HA stalk-specific antibody responses could be further enhanced by sequential immunization with cHA-based LAIV vaccines, and to examine the breadth of protective immunity induced by our sequential immunization regimen. As expected, we confirmed that Prime-LAIV-IIV and Prime-IIV-IIV vaccination regimens induced comparable broadly-reactive and HA stalk-specific humoral immune responses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S3, S4</xref>); however, lower stalk-reactive IgG titers in serum and IgA titers in nasal wash samples were observed for the Prime-IIV-IIV vaccination regimens than in our previous study (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S3</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which may be attributed to the genetic diversity of the outbred ferret model. The results from the Prime-LAIV-IIV regimens also indicated that immunization with the cH9/1 influenza virus primed strong H1 stalk-specific and broad antibody responses (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Recently, Isakova-Sivak et al. reported that two doses of cHA-based LAIV vaccines (Len/57-based) induced greater broadly-reactive and HA stalk-reactive IgG antibodies when compared to immunization with Len/57-based LAIV expressing wild-type HAs in mice (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Our data echo their results. Additionally, Hoft et al. demonstrated that children immunized with a seasonal LAIV vaccine (FluMist) induced stronger influenza virus-specific secretory IgA responses than those immunized by IIV (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Our results also showed that ferrets immunized with cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccines induced superior IgA titers in nasal washes at 3 days post pH1N1 or H6N1 challenge than all the other immunized groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S2B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3D</xref>). With respect to the protective immunity elicited by our Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination approach, our findings suggest that serum and mucosal antibody responses in combination with cell mediated immunity are required to provide complete protection against influenza virus infection. The quality and level of stalk-specific antibodies elicited by the vaccine may also determine the breadth and duration of protection against distinct drifted or pandemic strains of influenza virus. A recent study demonstrated in the mouse model that in the absence of immunodominant B cells, plasma B cells recognizing subdominant B cell epitopes may selectively expand, increase germinal center (GC) reactions, and differentiate into long-lived memory B cells (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). A recent study also demonstrated that immunization with an H5N1 LAIV vaccine primed GC B cell reactions and stimulated the generation of plasmablast and memory B cells in MLN, and that booster immunization with inactivated subunit vaccine recalled these H5-specific B cell responses in axillary lymph nodes, spleen and peripheral blood in African green monkeys (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Although the precise protective mechanisms underlying the humoral immunity induced by our vaccination regimen are still unclear, recent studies have highlighted the contribution of Fc-dependent mechanisms to protection by broadly-reactive neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It will be interesting to further dissect the development of long-lived B and T cell responses induced by sequential immunization with our cHA-based vaccines. Along these lines, immunological reagents and assays are being developed for the ferret model (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which is an animal model of influenza that was highlighted in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s strategic plan for the development of universal influenza vaccines (
