<p>As expected, vaccination with the H3N2 LAIV vaccine did not induce H1 stalk-specific antibody responses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S3</xref>); however, H3N2 LAIV vaccination suppressed viral replication in the upper respiratory tract following H6N1 virus challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>), which was likely due to cell mediated immune responses against the conserved internal proteins. Contrary to another recent report (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we did not detect replication of the tk/97 H6N1 virus in the lower respiratory tract despite detecting viral replication in the nasal turbinates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figures S6B,C</xref>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is differences in methods to quantify influenza virus titers. Herein, virus titers were quantified by traditional plaque assay on MDCK cells, whereas in the previous report virus titers were quantified by 50% egg infectious dose (EID
 <sub>50</sub>) per gram of tissue. Of note, the A/teal/HK/W312/97 (tk/97) H6N1 influenza virus used for the second vaccination/challenge experiment encodes a glutamate residue at position 627 of the PB2 which is a host determinant for influenza virus replication in avian species (
