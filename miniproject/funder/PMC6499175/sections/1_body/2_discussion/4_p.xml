<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced the re-inclusion of LAIV vaccines into the list of recommended vaccines for the 2018–2019 influenza season (

This change in clinical practice by the ACIP supports our efforts to translate our universal influenza virus vaccine that includes an LAIV component to clinical trials, especially for the pediatric and adult populations. In particular, incorporation of our universal vaccine approach into childhood immunization practice may confer “immunologic imprinting” of HA stalk immunity that provides more desirable immunologic responses to future immunization with influenza virus vaccines and provide broader protection against influenza virus infection (

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) recently published a position statement in which they outlined the critical elements of a universal influenza virus vaccine: (i) provide ≥ 75% protection against symptomatic disease caused by infection with group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses, and (ii) afford ≥ 12 months protection in all populations (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In summary, the results of this preclinical study suggest that, of the sequential immunization approaches examined, the Prime-LAIV-LAIV vaccination approach is the most promising vaccination regimen to confer protection against infection by influenza A viruses encoding a group 1-type hemagglutinin. However, the immune response following the tested vaccine regimens in ferrets might be substantially different than the immune response in humans with pre-existing immunity. It will therefore be important to compare these approaches in clinical trials before final conclusions are drawn. Although, herein, we have not addressed all criteria noted above, the current findings encourage the development of universal influenza virus vaccine components that target group 2 influenza A viruses and influenza B viruses. The findings reported herein are consistent with our previous findings (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and collectively demonstrate that influenza virus vaccines that focus immune responses on the HA stalk domain are a viable approach to a universal influenza virus vaccine. Ideally, our vaccine candidates will be able to induce not only stalk-reactive antibodies against all influenza subtypes, but also influenza virus-specific cellular immune responses.
