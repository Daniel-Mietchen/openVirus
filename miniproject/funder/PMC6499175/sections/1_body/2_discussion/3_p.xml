<p>Recent findings have emphasized that cellular immune responses contribute to protection against influenza virus infection. Consistently, two recent clinical studies demonstrated that vaccinees who received LAIV vaccines significantly increased T cell responses (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Influenza virus-specific memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the airway (

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells (Trm) (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) appear critical for cross-protection against influenza virus infection. In addition, a recently identified CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell subset, the follicular helper T cells (Tfh), has been reported to coordinate GC reactions to stimulate the expansion of plasmablast and memory B cells, thus inducing high quality influenza virus-specific antibody responses (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). To what extent our universal influenza virus vaccine approach stimulates such T cell responses will be the subject of future immunological studies. Although our findings demonstrated that our cHA-based Prime-LAIV-LAIV and Prime-LAIV-IIV vaccination regimens induced stalk-specific humoral immunity and cellular immunity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S7</xref>) which conferred cross-protection against influenza virus infection, the results obtained with this animal model of influenza, while encouraging, have yet to provide a good correlation between any immune readouts and protection. Interestingly, fewer peripheral Cal/09 HA- and/or NP-specific T cells were recalled in the Prime-LAIV-LAIV immunized group at day 4 post-H6N1 challenge infection. This may be accounted by the low homology between the Cal/09 (H1N1) versus tk/97 (H6N1) hemagglutinin stalk peptides (
