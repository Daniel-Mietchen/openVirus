<p>Peripheral whole blood samples were obtained from anesthetized ferrets by intracardiac puncture and collected in Vacutainer EDTA (K2) tubes on the last day of the virus challenge experiment. Whole blood was gently layered onto HistoPaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 1:1 ratio and immediately centrifuged at 400x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at RT with the lowest accelerating and brake off for descending. The buffy coat containing the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was collected and washed with enriched RPMI (eRPMI) media (RPMI1640 media containing 5% FBS and 10 mM HEPES [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid)]. Contaminating red blood cells (RBC) present in the single-cell suspensions were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Affymetrix eBioscience). Mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) were excised, dissociated with digestion media [eRPMI media containing 30 μg/mL of DNase I (grade II, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mg/mL of Type IV collagenase (Thermo Fisher)] for 30 min at 37°C. Next, the enzyme digested-lymph nodes were mechanically rinsed and passed through 70 μm nylon cell strainers (BD falcon). Contaminating RBCs were lysed and washed out prior to cryopreservation. Purified single-cell suspensions of PBMC and MLN leukocytes were immediately cryopreserved following isolation from tissues for flow cytometric analyses.
