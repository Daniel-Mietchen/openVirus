<p>We phenotyped the T cell responses following the procedure described in our previous report (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). In brief, single-cell suspensions of PBMCs or MLN leukocytes were thawed and resuspended in cRPMI media containing 10 μg/mL of the protein-transport inhibitor Brefeldin A from 
 <italic>Penicillium brefeldianum</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were, respectively stimulated with 0.1 μg of pooled NP peptides, irrelevant gp120 peptide, or 0.1 μg for each HA stalk peptide overnight. The next day, the cells were washed twice using flow cytometry staining buffer containing 2% FBS and 0.01% sodium azide in PBS) and centrifugation at 450x 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C. Cells were first stained with a viability dye, LIVE/DEAD Aqua Fixable dead-cell stain kit (Thermo Fisher), according to the manufacturer's instruction, followed by surface staining with specific T cell markers [CD4 (clone 02, Sino Biological Inc) and CD8 (OK-T8, Affymetrix eBioscience)] for 30 min at 4°C. Then, cells were washed, fixed by intracellular Fixation buffer for 20 min at 4°C, and permeabilized using permeabilization buffer (Affymetrix eBioscience). Next, the cells were intracellular stained with anti-CD3 (CD3-12, Abcam) and anti-biotin conjugated IFN-γ (CC302, LifeSpan BioSciences) antibodies for 30 min at RT. Antibodies to CD4, CD8, and CD3 were directly conjugated to distinct fluorochromes to distinguish T cell subsets. The anti-biotin IFNγ antibody was detected by a secondary antibody (anti-Strepavidin-APC, Affymetrix eBioscience). After the T cell staining, the cells were washed twice and resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer for data acquisition using a BD 13-colors LSR-II instrument with 488-, 633-, and 405-nm lasers and FACS Diva software. All data files were analyzed using FCS Express software, version 6.04.0034.
