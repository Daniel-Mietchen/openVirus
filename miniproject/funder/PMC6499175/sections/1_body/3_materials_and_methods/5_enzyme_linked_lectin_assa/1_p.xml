<p>The inhibition of N1NA enzymatic activity in serum was measured by ELLA. To determine the optimal concentration of virus used for neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay, the NA activity induced by PR8 x H7N1 virus (H7HA from H7HA from dk/mallard/Alberta/24/2001 (H7N1) and N1 NA from Cal/09 strain) was first examined as our previous study described (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Briefly, each well of 96-well plate was coated with fetuin (Sigma) (150 μl at 50 μg/mL) in sodium bicarbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed once with PBST and blocked with 200 μl of blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA) for 1 h at RT. While plates were being blocked, virus stock was 2-fold serially diluted in blocking buffer (starting dilution from 1:5). After blocking for 1 h, 100 μl amount of the diluted virus was transferred into fetuin-coated plates and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Next, after 3 times PBST washes, HRP-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA, from 
 <italic>Arachis hypogaea</italic>, Sigma) (100 μl at 5 μg/ml) were added to the plates and held for another 2 h incubation at RT. The supernatants were aspirated, washed three times by PBST and developed by 3, 3′, 5, 5′ tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate (Biolegend). After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 M phosphoric acid and plates were read at a wavelength of 410 nm in a plate reader (Biotek). 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of virus (in this case, approximately half the maximal OD reading value) was used for subsequent NI assays. For NI assay, ELISA plates were coated and blocked in a same manner used for the NA assay. While plates were blocking, ferret serum samples (from the pre-challenge time point) were 2-fold serially diluted in a separate 96-well plates using blocking buffer, starting with a 1:50 dilution, at a final volume of 125 μl. One hundred and twenty five microliter of virus stock (at a concentration of 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU) was added on top of the diluted serum and briefly tapped for mixture, and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Two hundred microliter of the virus/serum mixture were transferred in parallel to the fetuin-coated plates, after which the plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The rest of the NI assay protocol was identical to that of the NA assay. The readouts obtained from the plate reader were plotted in Prism 7.0 software, normalized by the average of the negative control (defined as 0%) and the average of positive control (virus only, defined as 100%). Percent inhibition was calculated by subtracting the NA activity from 100. The corresponding 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>s) were defined as the reciprocal serum dilutions inhibiting 50% of viral NA enzymatic activity.
