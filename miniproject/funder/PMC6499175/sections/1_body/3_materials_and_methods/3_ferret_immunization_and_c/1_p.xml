<p>Outbred 4 to 5-month-old castrated male Fitch ferrets were confirmed to be seronegative for circulating H1N1, H3N2, and B influenza viruses prior to purchase from Marshall BioResources (North Rose, NY). All animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the ISMMS. Ferrets were randomly assigned to the different treatment groups. The number of ferrets (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4 or 8) included in each experimental group is indicated in the figure legends.

 <sup>6</sup> PFU of B-cH9/1 virus as in our previous approach (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Importantly, this priming strategy prevents the establishment of immunity against influenza A virus internal proteins and does not interfere with a later pH1N1 or H6N1 viral challenge. The intervals of prime-boost vaccinations and detailed immunization regimens were indicated in

 <sup>7</sup> PFU per animal. Some groups of ferrets were intramuscularly boosted with 0.5 mL dose of AS03 adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV. The serum was separately collected at the indicated time points. Notably, the H6N1 challenge study focused on the best-in-class vaccination approaches (LAIV-LAIV and LAIV-IIV) for a more stringent evaluation of the protective immune responses elicited by these cHA-based vaccines. A “standard of care” group of ferrets which received two human doses of QIV (QIV-QIV Fluarix, GSK) and a single dose of H3N2 LAIV vaccination group were also included. The challenge infection dose of either Cal/09 pH1N1 virus or A/teal/HK/W312/97 (tk/97) H6N1 virus was 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/per ferret in 1 mL of PBS. For evaluation of vaccine effectiveness from both challenge studies, nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from anesthetized ferrets at day 1 and 3 post-challenge infection. At day 4 post-challenge infection, anesthetized ferrets were euthanized by exsanguination followed by intracardiac injection of Sleepaway euthanasia solution (Fort Dodge, Sodium Pentobarbital). Tissue specimens (olfactory bulbs, nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung) were collected from each individual ferret to quantify viral titers by plaque assays.
