<p>The HAI assays were performed as described in our previous study (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). In brief, the sera were treated with 
 <italic>receptor-destroying enzyme</italic> (RDE) (
 <italic>Denka Seiken</italic>) for 16–18 h at 37°C, followed by addition of 2.5% sodium citrate for 30 min at 56°C to block non-specific sialic acid binding. PBS was then added to each sample which resulted in an assay starting dilution of 1:10. Working stocks for each influenza virus strain were prepared by diluting the virus stock to a final HA titer of 8 HA units/50 μL in FTA Hemagglutination Buffer (Phosphate Buffered Saline, pH. 7.2; BD BBL). Twenty five microliter of pre-diluted RDE-treated sera were then mixed with 25 μL of the working stock of each influenza virus strain at 96 V-well microtiter plates and incubated for 30 min at RT to allow any HA-specific antibodies present in the serum to neutralize the influenza virus. Next, 50 μL of a 0.5% suspension of turkey red blood cells was added and incubated for 45 min at 4°C. The HI titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that inhibited red blood cell hemagglutination by influenza virus.
