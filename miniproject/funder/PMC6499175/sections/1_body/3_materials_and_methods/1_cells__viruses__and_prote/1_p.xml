<p>Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells used for plaque assays were maintained in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) and 100 U/mL penicillin plus 100 μg/mL streptomycin (1x P/S). Virus stocks were grown in 8-day-old specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories) at 37°C for 2 days or at 33°C for 3 days, and were then chilled down to 4°C overnight. Allantoic fluid was harvested, centrifuged at 290 × g for 5 min, and titrated by plaque assays as previous study described (

Recombinant proteins utilized in this study consist of chimeric H6/1 [containing H6 head domain from A/mallard/Sweden/81/02 combined with an H1 stalk domain of A/California/04/09 (Cal/09)], H1 (Cal/09), H2 (A/mallard/Netherlands/5/99), H3 (A/Hong Kong/4801/14), H6 (A/mallard/Sweden/81/02), H18 (A/bat/Peru/33/10), and N1 (Cal/09). Recombinant proteins were expressed in High Five cells grown in serum free SFX medium (HyClone) using the baculovirus expression system (
