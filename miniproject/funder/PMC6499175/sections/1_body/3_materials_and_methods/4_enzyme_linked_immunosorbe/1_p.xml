<p>HA-specific antibodies in serum and nasal wash samples, and N1-specific antibodies in serum were measured by ELISA with the above-mentioned recombinant proteins. The ELISA was conducted as described in our previous study (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In brief, for serum IgG, each well of 96-well plate was coated with 0.1 μg of antigen in sodium bicarbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with 220 μl of blocking solution (PBST containing 3% goat serum (Gibco) and 0.5% milk powder) for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted in blocking solution (starting dilution from 1:100) and added into plates and incubated for 2 h at RT. Next, plates were washed three times with PBST and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-ferret IgG (Alpha Diagnostic International) at a dilution of 1:5000 was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at RT, followed by four times PBST washes and developed by SigmaFast OPD (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride). After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 M hydrochloric acid and plates were read at a wavelength of 490 nm in a plate reader (Biotek Synergy H1). The average plus three standard deviations of blank wells was calculated as a cut-off endpoint value. The same procedure was used to measure IgA titers in nasal washes and serum. However, a starting dilution of 1:2 was used for the nasal wash samples. HRP-labeled anti-ferret IgA antibody (Novus Biologicals) was used at a 1:3000 concentration as secondary antibody.
