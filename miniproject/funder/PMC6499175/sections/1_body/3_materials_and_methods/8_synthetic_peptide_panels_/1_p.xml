<p>Predicted HA stalk-specific peptides were designed based on potential T cell epitopes which have been posted on IEDB database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iedb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.iedb.org/</ext-link>) and examined in the cellular immune responses of mice or humans to influenza virus (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Briefly, we identified predicted epitopes on influenza virus HA region by searching the IEDB database which included 736 records with supporting systematic analysis (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). We then compared these predicted epitopes with previously published epitopes from human (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) and/or mouse models (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) of infection. Based on the most conserved overlapped sequences, we selected specific epitope sequences for peptide synthesis. Herein, we generated a panel of ten peptides to span the major predicted epitopes in the HA stalk region of the Cal/09 (H1N1) strain (
 <italic>GenScript peptide services)</italic>. Each peptide was composed of 15 to 17-mers that overlapped by 10 amino acids (aa) to cover the predicted region as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9A</xref>. Each peptide was reconstituted as 1 mg/mL stock using a dimethyl sulfoxide. Each peptide was freshly pooled in complete RPMI media (cRPMI, RPMI 1640, 1X P/S, 10% heat-inactivated, certified FBS (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1x non- essential amino acid and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol) at a final working concentration of 4 μg/ml prior to use. Moreover, a pool of Cal/09 (H1N1) virus nucleoprotein (NP) 15-mer peptides that overlapped by 11 aa was included to examine NP-specific T cell responses (Miltenyi Biotec). An irrelevant peptide from HIV-1 envelop protein gp120 (aa
 <sub>283−297</sub>) (strain BRU, Bachem Inc) was also included as a negative control. The amino acid sequences for NP encoded by Cal/09 and tk/97 were retrieved from GenBank (accession numbers FJ966083 and AF250480, respectively).
