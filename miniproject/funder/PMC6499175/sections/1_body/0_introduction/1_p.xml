<p>Type A influenza viruses (both H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) and type B influenza viruses continue to co-circulate globally in humans causing seasonal epidemics that result in morbidity and mortality worldwide (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Current licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines formulated as inactivated influenza virus vaccine (IIV), live-attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIV), or recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins are proven to protect against infection by influenza virus (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), but they only provide suboptimal protection against infection by seasonal influenza viruses (ranging from 10 to 60%) (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Antigenic shift or drift of the surface glycoproteins [HA and neuraminidase (NA)] can result in an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strain and circulating strains which leads to substantial decreases in vaccine effectiveness (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). To match the continuous antigenic evolution of influenza viruses, current seasonal influenza virus vaccines are reformulated and readministered annually (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) based on the influenza virus vaccine strains selected by the World Health Organization. Although current influenza virus vaccines induce protection against infection by antigenically similar influenza viruses, they provide suboptimal protection against unpredictable emerging pandemic strains. Once a pandemic virus emerges, it takes ~5â€“6 months from vaccine strain selection to distribution of a strain-matched pandemic vaccine (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). During this time frame, the population may be left vulnerable.
