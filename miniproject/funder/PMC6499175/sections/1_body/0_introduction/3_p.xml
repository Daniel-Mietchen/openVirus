<p>Nasal spray delivery of LAIV vaccines was reported to elicit stronger and longer-lasting immunity (both robust B-cell and T-cell responses) than IIV vaccination in children (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In this preclinical study, we compared one or two dose regimen of cHA-based LAIV vaccines to a LAIV-IIV vaccination regimen to provide protective immunity against pH1N1 virus challenge. Moreover, we also examined the breadth of protective immunity induced by our sequential immunization approach against challenge by a heterosubtypic H6N1 virus encoding an antigenically distinct HA stalk. Our results demonstrated that our sequential immunization approach with a cHA-based LAIV-LAIV vaccination regimen afforded the best protection against pH1N1 and H6N1 influenza virus infections, induced broadly cross-reactive and HA stalk-specific antibody responses, and could induce HA stalk-specific T cell immunity.
