<p>We next sought to investigate whether Flt3-L overexpression during IAV infection could ameliorate the outcomes of secondary bacterial infections. To this end, Flt3-L-treated, IAV-infected mice were secondarily infected with 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, a major opportunistic pathogen implicated in bacterial superinfection. In this system, a low dose of 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (10
 <sup>3</sup> colony forming units, CFUs) is sufficient for local bacterial outgrowth and systemic translocation; both bacterial pneumonia and bacteraemia contributing to death [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Interestingly, albeit it did not reach significance, Flt3-L-treated mice had lower bacterial counts in the lungs than mice treated with the control plasmid (

 <italic>left panel</italic>). Furthermore, Flt3-L overexpression led to a significant reduction in bacterial dissemination from the lungs, as revealed by the lower number of viable bacteria in the spleen (

 <italic>right panel</italic>). Expression of Th17-related cytokines is important to control the outgrowth of respiratory bacteria in the context of prior influenza infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. No significant differences in the expression of genes encoding for Th17-inducing cytokines (
 <italic>Il19p23</italic>, 
 <italic>Il1b</italic>) and the Th17-related cytokine 
 <italic>Il17a</italic> were observed in co-infected mice, either treated or not with Flt3-L (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). To determine the effect of Flt3-L overexpression on pulmonary damage, we scored lung histology slides. All co-infected mice showed histological evidence of lung inflammation evidenced by interstitial inflammation and alveolar lesions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Compared to the control group, Flt3-L-treated mice had less marked alveolar lesions, less diffuse alveolar inflammation (mainly composed of neutrophils and lymphocytes) and less interstitial thickening (scored in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, 
 <italic>right panel</italic>). Few bronchial lesions were observed at this time point and no major differences were noticed between the two groups. We then determined whether the positive effect of Flt3-L on bacterial loads and lung pathology extended to ameliorated morbidity and mortality outcomes. Indeed, after the bacterial challenge, co-infected mice that received the Flt3-L plasmid lost weight but less rapidly relative to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, 
 <italic>left panel</italic>). Interestingly, restoration of Flt3-L expression during IAV infection led to a significant delayed mortality compared to controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, 
 <italic>right panel</italic>). Taken as a whole, these results suggest that Flt3-L treatment during influenza infection partially protects against secondary bacterial infection as reflected by decreased bacterial counts (reduced systemic dissemination), reduced pneumonia and prolonged survival.
