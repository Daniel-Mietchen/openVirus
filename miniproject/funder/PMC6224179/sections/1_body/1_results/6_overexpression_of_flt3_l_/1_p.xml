<p>Several studies have found that the immunosuppression arising after burns or sepsis can be corrected by restoring the DC compartment, e.g. by DC transfer or inoculation of Flt3-L [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We first looked at whether the cDC population could be restored during influenza infection. To this end, an Flt3-L-encoding plasmid was i.v. injected into animals one day before IAV infection in order to enhance systemic production of Flt3-L. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, the serum Flt3-L concentration was higher in treated, mock and IAV-infected, mice than in control animals. An analysis of DC progenitors in the BM revealed an increased number of CDPs and total pre-DCs in Flt3-L-treated animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). It is noteworthy that their numbers were similar in mock-treated and IAV-infected animals. Interestingly, Flt3-L overexpression was associated with a decreased CD135 expression on pre-DCs in both animal groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007360.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). A pre-DC analysis highlighted elevated numbers of all subsets in response to Flt3-L regardless of infection, although the increase was greatest for the cDC1-biased preDCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Enhanced Flt3-L synthesis during influenza infection was also associated with an increased number of total cDCs (cDC1 and cDC2 subsets) in the lungs of mock-treated and IAV-infected animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). It is noteworthy that, in contrast to the BM compartment, Flt3-L overexpression induced a greater expansion of cDC in mock-treated animals relative to IAV-infected animals. Administration of the Flt3-L-encoding plasmid did not influence the number of monocyte-derived DCs and neutrophils in the lung compartment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007360.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In contrast, and interestingly enough, Flt3-L overexpression significantly reduced the number of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes upon IAV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). We next investigated whether restoration of the cDC compartment in the lungs affects viral replication. Overexpression of Flt3-L had a moderate and not significant effect on viral load (slightly enhanced) and did not impact the expression of IFN-stimulating genes (

 <italic>e</italic>. 
 <italic>Isg15</italic>, 
 <italic>Oas3</italic>), the expression of which being generally related to the viral burden (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). A recent study from Ellis and colleagues showed that the early recruitment of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes during IAV infection is critical in epithelial barrier damage and secondary bacterial invasion [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In line with the diminished number of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007360.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), Flt3-L plasmid prevented the reduced gene expression of 
 <italic>Tjp1</italic> (tight junction protein 1) and 
 <italic>Ocln</italic> (occludin); these proteins being associated with lung barrier functions. In parallel, Flt3-L overexpression increased the transcript expression of 
 <italic>Areg (</italic>amphiregulin), a protein that is essential for restoring epithelial integrity and tissue repair during influenza infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Overall, Flt3-L overexpression during IAV infection boosted the BM cDC differentiation, restored the number of pulmonary cDCs and lowered the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes; the latter effect might explain higher expression of genes involved in lung barrier integrity.
