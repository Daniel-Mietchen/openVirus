<p>The regulation of DC homeostasis during infection is of major importance because DCs are essential for the initiation of innate and acquired immune responses. Many studies reported DC depletion during systemic infections such as sepsis (for a review, [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]). Along with impaired DC function, this DC depletion is a major cause of immunosuppression and predisposition to bacterial infections [

Our observation of a transient depletion of cDCs - cDC1 and cDC2 - in the lungs of IAV-infected mice contrasts with previous reports showing a recruitment of cDC2 and the absence or a slight decrease of cDC1 [

Importantly, we showed for the first time that IAV infection strongly affects cDC progenitor differentiation in the BM, a phenomenon associated with an impaired production of Flt3-L. Overexpression of Flt3-L during IAV infection enhanced cDC differentiation in the BM, restored the cDC counts in the lungs and lowered inflammatory monocytesâ€™ infiltration and lung injury. Importantly, Flt3-L overexpression provided partial protection against secondary bacterial infection.
