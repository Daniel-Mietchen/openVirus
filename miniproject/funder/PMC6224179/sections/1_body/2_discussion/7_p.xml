<p>Immunological (defective innate response) and physical (altered pulmonary barrier) mechanisms lead to bacterial outgrowth and dissemination post-influenza [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our data show that Flt3-L overexpression during IAV infection caused a modest decrease of bacterial load in the lungs but significantly lowered lung damage in co-infected mice (reduced alveolitis) and decreased systemic bacterial dissemination. Importantly, these effects were associated with a reduced body weight loss and delayed mortality. Our results argued against a role of Flt3-L on anti-viral response (identical viral burden) and Th17-related anti-pneumococcal response. We rather suggest that Flt-3-L might reinforce the physical barrier in the lungs. In line with this hypothesis, Flt3-L overexpression enhanced the expression of transcripts encoding proteins associated with barrier functions and tissue repair. Mechanistically, the beneficial effect of Flt3-L might be due to the reduced recruitment of CCR2
 <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes, a cell population involved in lung epithelial damage and bacterial dissemination post-influenza [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. How Flt3-L alters the trafficking of this deleterious cell population and whether lung cDCs play a role in this process remain to be investigated. The clinical relevance of our finding is still unclear. Bacterial superinfection post-influenza involves complex mechanisms affecting the antibacterial host defense and the pulmonary barrier function [

Emerging evidence indicates that myelopoiesis-triggering factors can be used to prevent severe infections in immunocompromised individuals [

In the same vein, overproduction of GM-CSF has recently been shown to reverse numeric and functional defects of macrophages during influenza infection and to protect against secondary bacterial infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Of interest, GM-CSF might also favor barrier functions during IAV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007360.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. We speculate that therapeutic administration of Flt3-L, in association with other growth factors such as GM-CSF, might represent a promising approach for the treatment of secondary bacterial infections post-influenza.
