<p>For IAV copy number quantification, reverse transcription was carried out by using primer specific for the viral 
 <italic>M1</italic> gene (5’-TCT AAC CGA GGT CGA AAC GTA-3’), SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) and RNAse OUT (ThermoFisher Scientific). A plasmid template harboring the virus M1 negative strand (pPolI-M1, backbone pUC18) was serially diluted (10-folds) to draw a standard curve (Ct value/viral copy number) ranging from 3.8 x10
 <sup>9</sup> (Ct ~5) to 380 copies (Ct ~25); allowing virus quantification in samples by interpolation of the Ct values.
