  <title>Influenza A virus infection leads to a time-dependent decrease of lung cDCs and DC progenitors in the BM.</title>
  <p>(A) Mice were infected i.n. with H3N2 virus. The frequency (
   <italic>left panel</italic>) and absolute number (
   <italic>right panel</italic>) of lung total cDCs (Siglec-F
   <sup>-</sup>CD11c
   <sup>+</sup>MHCII
   <sup>+</sup>CD64
   <sup>-</sup>), cDC2 (CD172α
   <sup>+</sup>CD24
   <sup>low</sup>) and cDC1 (CD172α
   <sup>-</sup>CD24
   <sup>high</sup>) subsets were assessed by flow cytometry at different time points post-infection. Means ± SEM from two experiments (n = 11) are represented. (B) Mock-treated and IAV-infected mice were sacrificed at different time point post-infection and the absolute number of BM MDPs, CDPs and pre-DCs were quantified by flow cytometry. Means ± SEM of biological replicates from at least three independent experiments are represented (n = 6–15). (C) The mean of fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CD135 expression on BM pre-DCs was analyzed at different time point post-infection. Data were pooled from two independent experiments (n = 6–8). (D) Mice were infected i.n. with WSN (H1N1) virus. The absolute number of CDPs and pre-DCs were assessed by flow cytometry at 7 dpi. Means ± SEM from two experiments (n = 10) were shown. *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.
