 <p>Secondary bacterial infections constitute a leading cause of mortality during influenza epidemics and pandemics. Acute infections trigger the mobilization of myeloid cells from the bone marrow (BM) to the infected tissues, a process referred to as emergency myelopoiesis. Influenza infection leads to a profound alteration in the pulmonary myeloid cell compartment characterized by the recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells. The consequences of IAV infection on BM myelopoiesis have yet to be described in detail. Here, we report that influenza infection leads to reduced number of conventional dendritic cells (cDC) in the lungs (with a peak at day 7) and severely impairs DC differentiation in the BM, for the benefit of monopoiesis. The altered cDC differentiation was independent of pro-inflammatory cytokines and was not due to an intrinsic dysfunction of cDC precursors. Defective DC differentiation during influenza was associated with a decrease in the production of the key cDC differentiation factor, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3-L). Overexpression of Flt3-L during influenza enhanced the number of BM cDC progenitors and restored lung cDC compartment. This phenomenon was associated with a lowered number of lung inflammatory monocytes and reduced lung damages. Importantly, Flt3-L overexpression partially protected against secondary pneumococcal infection characterized by reduced bacterial loads, improved pathological outcomes and prolonged survival. Our results provide new clues as to how influenza infection influences the differentiation of cDCs, and highlight the potential therapeutic value of Flt3-L in a disease in desperate need of better treatments.</p>
