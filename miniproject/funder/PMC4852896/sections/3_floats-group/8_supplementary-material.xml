  <title>Sexual transmission parameter value effects on epidemic length.</title>
  <p>The effects of two-fold changes in convalescent period (1/ 
   <italic>α</italic>) and in per sex act sexual transmission probability (
   <italic>η</italic>) on the average duration of Monte Carlo simulated Ebola virus epidemics. Box and whisker plots show the mean and variance for the length of those epidemics (number of days symptomatic cases remained in the population) which sustained 50 or more total cases (out of 1000 simulations). Statistical significance of comparisons were corrected for multiple tests following the Games-Howell method, and all are reported in
