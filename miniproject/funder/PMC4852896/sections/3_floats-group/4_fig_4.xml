  <title>Impact of convalescent period on the tail of the EVD epidemic.</title>
  <p>Monte Carlo simulations of the weekly incidence of new cases (A, B, C) and the sporadic occurrence of sexual transmission events at the epidemic tail (D, E, F), assuming no sexual transmission (A, D), and sexual transmission with a 3 (B, E) and 6 months (C, F) convalescent period and a per sex act transmission probability fixed at 0.001. Light red lines show the result of 200 simulated trajectories, with corresponding mean (thick purple line) and standard errors (thin purple lines). Black dots denote incident cases in Sierra Leone as reported by the WHO [
   <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The dark red lines in (D), (E), and (F) highlight a single representative trajectory, and the blue dots along the horizontal axis indicate a sexual transmission event. Histograms of the day of the last EVD case from 1,000 simulated epidemics in absence of sexual transmission (G) and for a convalescent period of 3 (H) and 6 (I) months.
