  <title>Sexual transmission parameter value effects on epidemic length.</title>
  <p>Pairwise effects of two-fold changes in convalescent period (1/ 
   <italic>α</italic>) and in per sex act sexual transmission probability (
   <italic>η</italic>) on the average duration of Monte Carlo simulated Ebola virus epidemics. Out of 1000 simulations for each set of parameters (
   <italic>α</italic> and 
   <italic>η</italic>), the mean length (number of days) of the epidemics having at least 50 total cases (n = number of simulations) is given in the diagonal. Statistical significance of each pairwise comparison is given above the diagonal (t statistic (df) and p-value) and were corrected for multiple tests using the Games-Howell method. The relative reduction in the length of the epidemic (% fewer days) is given below the diagonal. The red and blue values are those referenced in the results of the manuscript.
