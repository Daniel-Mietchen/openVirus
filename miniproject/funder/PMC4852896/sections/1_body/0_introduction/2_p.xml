<p>Follow-up studies on survivors of the 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] outbreaks in Uganda have raised awareness of what is now being termed “post-Ebola syndrome” (post-Ebola sequelae)–debilitating illnesses from myalgia to uveitis—which can persist for at least 21 months after the onset of symptoms. Though the virus is no longer detected in the blood after acute EVD symptoms disappear, active (replicating) virus has been documented in ocular fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and semen [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Transmission to sexual partners was never confirmed in earlier outbreaks, but was suspected to have occurred in at least one instance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, cases of sexual transmission of other hemorrhagic fever infections, notably by the closely related Marburg virus, have been suspected in the past [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and presenting molecular evidence of sexual transmission from a survivor 179 days after onset of symptoms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], suggest that sexual transmission from convalescent men can and does occur.
