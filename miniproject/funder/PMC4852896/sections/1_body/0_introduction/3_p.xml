<p>Sexual transmission of Ebola virus from convalescent survivors is likely a rare event, but researchers have warned that it should be considered in epidemiological models that are used to predict the trajectory of an outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Without aiming to make a predictive model but rather to understand what aspects of the epidemic may be affected by inclusion of sexual transmission, we devised a novel formulation of the mathematical model for EVD transmission: SEICR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-convalescent-recovered), which includes a component for convalescent sexual transmission from convalescent survivors who maintain active Ebola virus replication. We illustrated the model by fitting it to weekly EVD incidence from Sierra Leone, the largest population of recovering survivors from the current West Africa epidemic. We performed sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of key unknown parameters, such as the duration of the convalescent period and the transmission probability per sexual contact. Considering the stochastic nature of such rare sexual transmission events, we also performed Monte Carlo simulations to explore the impact of sexual transmission on the epidemic tail in Sierra Leone.
