<p>Recent reports suggesting the potential for sexual transmission of Ebola virus from convalescent survivors have raised a number of important questions regarding its impact on the final phase of the epidemic in West Africa [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Even once the worst hit countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), rare cases may still arise from the large number of remaining survivors. Importantly, sexual transmission is dependent on the frequency of infections rather than the density of available hosts, allowing chains of transmission to persist at low susceptible densities where non-sexual transmission would typically fail to occur [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Perhaps the most crucial element for bringing the epidemic to an end is maintaining vigilance in the community by preventing—or quickly responding to—new chains of transmission. Thus, it is important to investigate the potential impact of convalescent sexual transmission on the transmission dynamics in general, and on the tail of the epidemic in particular, to understand how long that vigilance might remain critical.
