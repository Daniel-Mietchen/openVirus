<p>We extended an accepted modeling framework that has been widely used to describe the epidemic trajectories of EVD outbreaks and epidemics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study using mathematical modeling to assess the potential impact of sexual transmission of Ebola virus on the epidemic in West Africa. In addition, given the generality of the model, this is also the first model that investigates the impact of including a secondary transmission route from convalescent individuals. Similar compartmental models have been formalized to account for more realistic infectious periods, including both infectious relapse [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and progression through classes of varying stages of infectivity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, none of these models included a change in transmission mode between the primary and subsequent infectious classes. This model, then, may also have implications for other pathogens with this kind of secondary transmission route (e.g. some adenoviruses [
