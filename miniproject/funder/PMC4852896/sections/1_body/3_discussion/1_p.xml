<p>Our study shows that the length of the convalescent period will determine whether or not sexual transmission of Ebola virus from recovering patients will have a profound effect on the length of time it will take for the epidemic to completely fade. For Sierra Leone, we found that an average convalescent period of 3 months, and a per sex act transmission probability of 0.1%, could extend the EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone by an average of 83 days (95% CI: 68â€“98 days). Such a scenario would be consistent with the occurrence of a small number of sexual transmission events during the end-phase of the epidemic. However, assuming an average convalescent period of 6 months led to simulated epidemics whose tails were much more variable, and much longer, despite a lack of significant increase in the total number of cases. So far, the reported cases of sexual transmission of EVD remain rare [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hence, the per sex act transmission probability of Ebola virus from male convalescent survivors is unlikely to be higher than 0.1%, and might well be below this value. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that the duration of the EVD epidemic is heavily influenced by the period during which convalescent men can transmit sexually, calling for a better understanding of the persistence and duration of infectivity of Ebola virus RNA in convalescent patients.
