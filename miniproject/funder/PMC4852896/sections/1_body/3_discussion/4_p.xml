<p>Awareness of the potential for sexual transmission has led to WHO issuing recommendations that ask convalescent men to abstain from sexual activity as much as possible and to use condoms for up to 6 months after the onset of symptoms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Condom use and social awareness of the risks of sexual transmission during convalescence should reduce the per sex act transmission probability (
 <italic>η</italic>) and the frequency of sex acts (
 <italic>q</italic>), respectively. Our results suggest that while such interventions should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, they will not necessarily reduce the overall number of cases nor the length of time during which the public health community must stay vigilant in responding to these sporadic cases because they will not affect the time during which convalescent survivors can shed infectious virus (1/
 <italic>α</italic>). This is especially poignant since adherence to these recommendations will never be 100%, particularly after the threat from symptomatic individuals passes. Thus, our results suggest that the current requirement for declaring a region free from EVD (42 days following either death or a second negative RT-PCR test of the blood from the last known patient), may be too short. Sierra Leone was first declared free from EVD on 7 November 2015 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] highlights the need for the 90-day period of enhanced surveillance after the declaration has been made. The WHO report that 10 such “flare-ups”, or cases with no apparent link to the original acute symptomatic transmission chains, have been identified throughout the region, and are suspected to have resulted from contact with infectious survivors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, none of these events have caused a major resurgence of new cases. This is likely primarily due to the continuing vigilance, awareness, and resources provided by public health infrastructures, and is reflected by the basic reproduction number in presence of control interventions,
