<p>The number of sexual transmission events expected from the baseline scenario (
 <italic>η</italic> = 0.001 and 1/ 
 <italic>α</italic> = 3 months) is 31.2, the majority of which will occur around the peak of the epidemic (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g002">2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g003">3D</xref>) and thus likely go undetected. Doubling either 
 <italic>η</italic> or 1/ 
 <italic>α</italic> results in nearly equal increases in the incidence and cumulative number of sexual transmission events (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g002">2C, 2D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g003">3C and 3D</xref>), with either leading to roughly double the number of sexually transmitted cases over the course of the whole epidemic (&gt; 60 cases). It should be noted that the total number of cases increases more than by simply the number of sexual transmission events, because each sexual transmission event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. The day of last case is affected more by the convalescent period than the per sex act transmission probability (represented by vertical lines in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g002">2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g003">3A</xref>), a result confirmed by the sensitivity analysis (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). The tail of the epidemic will depend on a small number of events that are likely to be affected by stochastic processes, thus we used Monte Carlo simulations to explore this behaviour.
