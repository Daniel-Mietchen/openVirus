<p>The two key unknown parameters of sexual transmission are the per sex act transmission probability, 
 <italic>η</italic>, and the rate at which convalescent survivors fully recover, 
 <italic>α</italic>. Both parameters were found to have very small effects on the peak number of infected or exposed patients (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g002">2A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g003">3A</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g004">4A, 4B and 4C</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s002">S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s003">S3</xref> Figs). The duration of the convalescent period has a large impact on the peak number of convalescent individuals, while 
 <italic>η</italic> does not (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The total number of recovered individuals is reached more slowly the longer the convalescent period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), which is not an effect caused by 
 <italic>η</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g003">Fig 3b</xref>). While the convalescent periods (1/ 
 <italic>α</italic> = [3–9 months]) and the values of 
 <italic>η</italic> (
 <italic>η</italic> = [0.0005–0.002]) we explored create very few extra cases (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g002">2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g003">3B</xref>), sensitivity analyses revealed that a higher per sex act transmission probability, 
 <italic>η</italic>, a higher proportion of sexually active convalescent individuals, 
 <italic>p</italic>, or a higher frequency of sex acts, 
 <italic>q</italic>, have larger impacts on the total number of cases than would proportional increases in the convalescent period (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Sensitivity analyses also revealed that these sexual transmission parameters could produce a small delay in the epidemic peak, more so than would changes in the convalescent period (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).
