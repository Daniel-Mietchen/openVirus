<p>Assuming a conservative baseline scenario (

 <italic>α</italic> = 3 months; 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the reproductive number of a convalescent infection, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0,
  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub>, is 0.0024. This corresponds to only 0.12% of the overall 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> of 2.0224. Increasing the convalescent period from 3 to 6 months, the contribution of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0,C</sub> (0.0051) to the overall 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> rises to 0.25%. The equation for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0,C</sub> (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Methods</xref>) illustrates that doubling the per sex act transmission probability has the same impact as doubling the convalescent period. It is important to note that the relative contribution of sexual transmission to the overall reproductive number rises as the effective reproductive number drops during the epidemic due to the effects of control interventions and decreasing density of susceptible hosts (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).
