<p>To understand the differential impacts of the convalescent period (1/ 
 <italic>α</italic>) and the per sex act transmission probability (
 <italic>η</italic>) on the epidemic tail, the effect of two-fold reductions in 
 <italic>η</italic> on the average duration of the epidemic under both 3 and 6 month convalescent periods were compared (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Cutting the per sex act transmission probability in half led to statistically significant reductions in the length of the epidemic, but this was 3-fold less effective than equivalent changes in the convalescent period (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s004">S4 Fig</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s005">S1 Table</xref>), corroborating the results of the deterministic sensitivity analyses (above). We also note that reducing 
 <italic>η</italic> did not greatly reduce the enormous variance observed with the longer convalescent period.
