<p>We performed stochastic simulations of the EVD transmission model to investigate the epidemic dynamics when the number of new cases becomes small, i.e, during the tail of the epidemic. Comparing model simulations while assuming a convalescent period of 3 months to those without sexual transmission confirmed the deterministic results that sexual transmission from convalescent survivors does not lead to a significant increase in the cumulative number of infected cases (non-STI: 11,092 +/- 627 cases; STI: 10,944 +/- 642 cases; Wilcox rank sum test: W = 491990, p = 0.53), nor the size (non-STI: 77 +/- 4.1 new cases per day; STI: 75 +/- 4.2 new cases per day; W = 493710, p = 0.62) or timing (non-STI: day 187 +/- 0.9; STI: day 187 +/- 0.9; t = 0.19, df = 1017.4, p = 0.85) of the epidemic peak incidence (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g004">Fig 4D, 4E, 4G and 4H</xref>). The width of the tail (s.d. = 151 days) was such that 23.4% of the 529 simulated epidemics that accumulated at least 50 cases still experienced symptomatic individuals 730 days (two years) after the start of the epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Strikingly, when the convalescent period was extended from 3 months to 6 months, the projected length of the epidemic increased to a mean of 1088 days (+/- 15.5), with 84.0% of the 538 sustained epidemics taking over two years to end (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004676.g004">Fig 4F and 4I</xref>). However, the average number of new cases produced remained small (11,869 +/- 663 cases; W = 482790, p = 0.18). Importantly, there is greater variance in the tail of the epidemic when sexual transmission is considered, and this uncertainty grows with the length of the convalescent period (
