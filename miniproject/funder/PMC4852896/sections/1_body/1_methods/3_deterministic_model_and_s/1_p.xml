<p>We solved the system of ODEs numerically using the function ‘
 <italic>ode’</italic> from the ‘
 <italic>deSolve’</italic> package in the R software environment for statistical computing [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We compared the following response variables of the model: the epidemic peak number of exposed, 
 <italic>E</italic>, acute, 
 <italic>I</italic>, and convalescents, 
 <italic>C</italic>, cases; the cumulative number of EVD cases, deaths, and recoveries; the date at the epidemic peak; the daily and cumulative incidence of sexual transmission; and the date at which the last symptomatic case either died or entered into convalescence (“day of last case”). We defined the day of last case as the time when the number of symptomatic and infectious individuals, 
 <italic>I</italic>, dropped below 0.5. We considered the following parameters for the sensitivity analysis: the per sex act transmission probability of Ebola virus from convalescent men (
 <italic>η</italic>), the proportion of convalescent survivors who are sexually active men (
 <italic>p</italic>), the rate at which they engage in sexual intercourse (
 <italic>q</italic>), and the rate at which convalescent patients recover completely and shed no further replicating Ebola virus from their body (
 <italic>α</italic>). The sensitivity of the response variables to changes in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was explored simultaneously as a comparison. We generated 1000 parameter combinations from the uniform ranges, log-transformed [0.5x – 2x] for the parameter values for 
 <italic>η</italic>, 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>q</italic>, and 
 <italic>α</italic>, given in
