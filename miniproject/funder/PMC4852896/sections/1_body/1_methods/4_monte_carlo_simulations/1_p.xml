<p>We performed stochastic simulations of the SEICR model with and without sexual transmission using Gillespie’s algorithm [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We specifically investigated the following response variables from the simulations: the cumulative number of EVD cases, the size and date of the epidemic’s peak incidence (daily number of new symptomatic infections), and the date of last case (last day that symptomatic infections, 
 <italic>I</italic>, fell below 1). Summary statistics were based on the results of 1000 simulation runs for each transmission scenario. We calculated the average of the peak and total cumulative number of EVD cases by including all simulations runs, i.e., also the simulations that rapidly go extinct. In contrast, the average dates of the epidemic peak and last case were based on the simulated epidemic trajectories over which 50 or more cases were accumulated.
