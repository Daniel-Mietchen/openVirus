<p>Since the number of sexual transmission events was likely to be small and little information is currently available on the nature of each transmission event, we fitted only the non-sexual (SEIR) deterministic EVD transmission model to weekly incidence of confirmed and probable cases in Sierra Leone as reported in the WHO patient database [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004676.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The data set was extended with weekly incidence from the situation report for the most recent weeks when no data was available in the patient database. In order to account for variability in the accuracy of reporting, we assumed that the number of reported cases follows a negative binomial distribution with mean as predicted by the model and dispersion parameter 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We derived maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of the following model parameters [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004676.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]: the baseline transmission rate

 <sub>0</sub>, the time 
 <italic>τ</italic> at which transmission starts to drop, the rate 
 <italic>k</italic> at which transmission decays, and the dispersion parameter 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>. For the fitting procedure, we assumed that there were no sexual transmission events, i.e., we set 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>S</sub> to zero. The basic reproductive number in absence of sexual transmission is
