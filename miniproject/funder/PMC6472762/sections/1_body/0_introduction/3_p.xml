<p>The ability of HIV to establish long-lasting viral reservoirs in CD4 T cells initiates rebound viremia during ART treatment [

 <xref rid="pone.0214800.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This represents a distinct aspect of HIV-1 pathogenesis and a critical factor that contributes to the inability to cure HIV-1 infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0214800.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Viral persistence is attributed to latently-infected CD4 T cells that contain transcriptionally silent forms of the virus that are not susceptible to ART drugs or immune factors (1). Traditionally, resting CD4 T memory cells are regarded as the major T cell population that harbor latent HIV-1, which become infected at the time of activation, and viral latency occurs when these cells revert to a resting condition [
