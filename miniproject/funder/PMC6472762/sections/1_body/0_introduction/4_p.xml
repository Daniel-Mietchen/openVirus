<p>CD4 T cell counts are the primary prognostic marker for HIV-related diseases and is the main indicator for ART therapy [
 <xref rid="pone.0214800.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. When CD4 T cell numbers decline below 200 cells/ul, the immune system is compromised, resulting in a poor disease prognosis and lack of response to ART therapy [

The ratio of these T cells in HIV patients can be influenced by age, gender, and ethnicity The various T-cell subpopulations likely play an important role in modulating not only HIV-specific immunity, but the overall immune response during infection [
