In this study, to enhance the understanding of T cell characteristics and disease progression in newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients in Yunnan, a comprehensive study was conducted that included patient samples collected across the entire province from 2015 to 2018. The aim of this study was to provide a meaningful reference for AIDS prevention and control strategies in Yunnan.
