<p>Advanced age is also a strong predictor of accelerated HIV-1 progression and increased AIDS-related mortality [

 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in patients aged ≤29 years old was higher than those aged &gt; 30 years, suggesting that the number of T-lymphocytes decreases with increasing age. However, compared to patients aged 30–59, the group aged ≥ 60 showed a renewed increase in CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that CD4
 <sup>+</sup>T cell damage was more chronic in patients aged 30–59 after HIV infection. Knowledge of these parameters is important in Yunnan given that the population of HIV-infected adults is progressively aging, due to more effective treatments that lower the viral load and increase life expectancy [
