<p>In this study, it was found that the absolute numbers of CD3
 <sup>+</sup>, CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4, CD3
 <sup>+</sup> CD8
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD45
 <sup>+</sup>T cells in infected women are higher than those in infected men. These biologically-based gender differences may arise from differential gene expression associated with the X chromosome [

 <sup>+</sup> T-cells would be expected to lead to differential responses to ART therapy within the province, given the evidence for the significance of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in the response to ART therapy [
