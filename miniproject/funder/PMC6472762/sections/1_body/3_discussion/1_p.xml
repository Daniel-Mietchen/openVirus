This suggests that HIV-infected patients in the Yunnan district are more likely to be diagnosed during the late stages of HIV infection (due to the progressive decline of CD4 numbers) compared to those in Xiamen and Taizhou. In addition, the lower CD4 counts may explain the greater risk of disease development and risk of progression to AIDS, reported to occur more rapidly in Yunnan compared to other regions [
