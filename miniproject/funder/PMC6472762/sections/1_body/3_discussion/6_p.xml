<p>One limitation of this study should be noted. The Han ethnic group accounted for the majority of study participants (349/408; 86%), and samples only consisted of infected individuals in the Kunming area, and are thus not fully representative of Yunnan. Sample selection bias and the small sample size may therefore influence our findings. Further studies comparing our findings to a range of ethnic groups should be conducted.</p>
