<p>In conclusion, it is shown that low levels of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in patients newly diagnosed with HIV/AIDS are found in the Yunnan province. Furthermore, T-cell subsets in these HIV patients were shown to be influenced by gender, age, and ethnicity which may contribute to disease progression. From this information, the most at-risk populations can be predicted and this can be used to inform HIV surveillance and management strategies. Older members of the Han nationality and men over 60, for example, may be more susceptible to HIV than younger Yi women. Of course, this requires prospective research and some actual prediction models, which can hopefully be conducted in future studies. Routine screening for HIV/AIDS in these populations can ensure timely and adequate clinical management in Yunnan, improving patient quality of life and reducing HIV morbidity.
