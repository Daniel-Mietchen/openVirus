<p>The proportion of patients with late stage diagnoses remains high in China, making effective treatments and viral remission difficult to achieve [

 <xref rid="pone.0214800.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Approximately 52% of newly diagnosed patients in this retrospective study were predicted to have been infected for more than 7 years at the time of diagnosis. These patients have reached a later disease-stage and have become highly susceptible to opportunistic infections. Approximately 24% of patients in the study were predicted to have been infected for 5â€“7 years, with the remaining 24% of patients estimated to have been infected for less than 5 years. Since late diagnosis greatly increases the risk of HIV exposure and spread, early diagnosis efforts and CD4 cell count testing should be priorities amongst high-risk populations within the Yunnan province. Regular assessment and monitoring of newly identified HIV-positive individuals should be accompanied by timely CD4 testing and rapid initiation of treatment. The National Free Antiretroviral Therapy Program (NFATP) in China has addressed the problem of poor access to ART therapy and has greatly reduced mortality among patients. Prompt CD4 testing is a critical step for successful HIV treatment, making it vital to reducing the rates of HIV/AIDS in this region.
