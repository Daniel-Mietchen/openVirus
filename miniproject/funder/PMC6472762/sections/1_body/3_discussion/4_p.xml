<p>It was observed that CD3
 <sup>+</sup> and CD3
 <sup>+</sup>/CD45 T cell percentages in the Han population were significantly higher than those of the ethnic minorities. HIV infects CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes through binding of its viral envelope to cell surface expressed CD4 and to its co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 [

 <xref rid="pone.0214800.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. CCR2-64I (A/A genotype) and SDF1-3'A are also known to protect against HIV infection, while CX3CR1 expression is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0214800.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Chen and coworkers observed a high allele frequency of HIV-resistance genes CCR2b-64I and SDF1-3'A in the Han, Yi, and Hani ethnic populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0214800.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In this study, the Yi and Hani ethnic groups accounted for 44% of the minority populations, and the T cell percentages were higher in these infected ethnic minority groups relative to the Han group. This suggests that differences in HIV-resistance genotypes may also be an important factor involved in the delay to HIV progression.
