 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts of HIV-infected individuals in the study population were 224 cells/μl. The CD4 T-cell counts of the patients ranged from 1 to 1079 cells/μl. Of these individuals, 97 patients (23.8%) had baseline CD4 cell counts &gt;350 cells/μl, while 99 patients (24.3%) had baseline CD4 cell counts ranging from 200–350 cells/μl. 93 patients (22.8%) had baseline CD4 cell counts 100–200 cells/μl, and 119 patients (29.1%) had CD4 T cell levels &lt;100 cells/μl (
