<p>In the context of HIV, ethnicity is associated with differences in CD4 T counts, the rate of CD4 decline, viral escape, and systemic immune activation [

 <sup>+</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup>/CD45 cells were significantly higher in Han patients (1815 ± 987, 73.94 ± 11.61%, and 58.18 ± 15.42%) compared to ethnic minority patients (1417 ± 1130, 65.58 ± 14.55%, and 45.53 ± 16.02%) (P&lt;0.001). The percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>/CD45 cells was significantly higher in ethnic patients (19.67 ± 18.55%) compared to Han patients (13.04 ± 9.69%) (P&lt;0.001). Although absolute numbers of Han patients had modestly higher numbers of CD3

 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD45
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, the differences between the groups were not significant. These values may contribute to the hotspots of HIV-1 infection in Yunnan ethnic minorities including both Western and Northeast regions where the largest number of HIV sufferers occurs [
