<p>HIV disproportionately afflicts young people both in China and worldwide. All newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients were divided into three groups based on age: ≤29, 30–59, or ≥60 years. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0214800.g005">Fig 5</xref> summarizes the lymphocyte subsets present in each of these three age groups. Statistically significant differences in the absolute numbers of CD3

 <sup>+</sup>T cells were found between the three age groups. The numbers of CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD45
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were highest in the age ≥60 group. Significant differences were observed in the counts of CD3
 <sup>+</sup>, CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup>, and CD45
 <sup>+</sup>, and the ratio of CD3
 <sup>+</sup>/CD45
 <sup>+</sup> to CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD4
 <sup>+</sup>/CD45
 <sup>+</sup> cells between the ≤29 and 30–59 groups. Other parameters decreased as age increased, however the differences did not show statistical significance.
