<p>Although the results of this study implied that vertical transmission of DENV might exist in Guangzhou, there is no solid evidence supporting the inference as no adequate sequences are available for analysis. The coverage of the sequence has a great impact on the study. Patients with dengue sometimes have negative infections. The patient is not aware that the infection with dengue virus has led to a decrease in the reported sequence, and a small number of viruses have not been sequenced and uploaded to the database. These can all lead to the wrong propagation path. Therefore, local centers for disease control and prevention should work closely with disease control and prevention departments of Southeast Asian countries to observe how DENV is prevalent in these countries, thereby identifying sources of propagation for DENV in China and exploring the epidemiological characteristics of dengue fever to provide a basis for dengue prevention strategies. As the Belt and Road Initiative moves forward, Asian, European and African countries expect to increase transport connections for international trade, strengthen people-to-people exchanges and remove barriers to investment and trade. Given that, the conventional entry-exit inspection and quarantine divided by national administrative regions is falling short, leading to an increased risk of dengue and Zika fever in the countries along the Belt and Road. There is an urgent need to raise public awareness about disease prevention and control, as well as intensified measures against dengue and Zika fever. It is necessary to establish joint prevention and control mechanisms for infectious diseases so that China and other relevant countries can work together to effectively combat infectious diseases and safeguard health security with their technologies and resources.</p>
