<p>Since 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is the main medium for DENV transmission, the localization of DENV largely depends on the formation of localized and virus-carrying eggs and the survival of DENV in the eggs and offspring mosquitoes through winter[
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A previous study demonstrated that DENV can survive in eggs and spread to offspring mosquitoes. Transovarial transmission of DENV is strongly temperature-related as it determines whether the eggs and young offspring can wait out the winter season. As an example, Yunnan Province has reported the localization of DENV as it has a subtropical monsoon climate and provides a natural habitat for 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Similar to Yunnan Province, Guangzhou has hot, humid summers and mild, dry winters, which create a favorable environment for the breeding of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Moreover, as the greenhouse effect continues to warm the planet slowly, overwintering becomes easier for mosquitoes. Peri-urban areas in Guangzhou have plenty of dirty gullies, open spaces, and rented houses that require effective management to improve the living environment. Additionally, local residents who like indoor and outdoor planting, fish farming, and water harvesting also provide places for mosquito breeding. To reduce mosquito breeding sites, effective urban sanitation management should be implemented. For example, stagnant water should be cleared in a timely manner to ensure the smooth operation and maintenance of the city's drainage system; in crowded places, mosquito prevention and control measures should be taken for the public good. Personal hygiene also plays a critical role in dengue prevention. Residents should avoid keeping fish and aquatic plants and regularly clean up stagnant water in their houses. An individual with a fever or other dengue fever-like symptoms should promptly seek medical attention. Hospitals should strive to improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of dengue fever. Suspected DENV-infected patients should be isolated to prevent further transmission. We should pay closer attention to localized DENV in Guangzhou and strictly implement relevant dengue prevention and control measures.
