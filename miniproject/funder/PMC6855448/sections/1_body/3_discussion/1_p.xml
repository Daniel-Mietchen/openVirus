<p>In the present study, blood samples were drawn from DENV-infected patients who were diagnosed with dengue fever by hospitals in Guangzhou during 2018, and an analysis was performed on the DENV strains isolated from these blood samples. Through gel electrophoresis analysis, the isolated sequences were classified into two serotypes, namely, DENV-1 and DENV-2. Furthermore, DENV-1 strains were divided into three clusters, and the DENV-2 strains were divided into two clusters according to the ML trees. The ancestral reconstruction analysis showed that the sample sequences largely originated from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. This suggests that the dengue virus that we are popular in Guangzhou is still based on input. As the capital city of Guangdong Province and the trade center in Southeast China, Guangzhou is exposed to a relatively high risk of the disease, as DENV may enter the city along with imported goods and migrant workers. In addition, DENV continuously flows into China because Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and other Southeast Asian countries are popular destinations for Chinese tourists, especially those living in Guangdong Province. Therefore, entry-exit inspection and quarantine should be implemented effectively for dengue prevention and control. For instance, suspected and confirmed cases of DENV infection should be isolated and treated properly to reduce the risk of imported dengue fever. In addition, health education also plays an important role in dengue prevention and control. To reduce the risk of DENV infection, public health authorities should provide the necessary materials for tourists to gain a better understanding of dengue prevention and remind them not to visit an endemic area during epidemic seasons.</p>
