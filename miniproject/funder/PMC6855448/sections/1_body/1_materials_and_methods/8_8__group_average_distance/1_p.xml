<p>We differentiated the DENV-1 and DENV-2 data sets based on genotypes. In order to avoid the impact of old viruses on genetic distance calculation, we only extracted the genotypes of sequence samples from Guangdong Province in the past five years. The MEGA software was used to compare sample sequences of different clusters and compare them to sequences not in the cluster.</p>
