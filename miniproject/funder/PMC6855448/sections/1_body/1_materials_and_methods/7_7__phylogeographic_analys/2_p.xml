<p>Each dataset was analyzed with TempEst v1.5 to investigate its temporal signal and "clocklikeness" of ML phylogenies before applying the assumption of a molecular clock into the phylogenetic analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0224676.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ML trees generated by RAxML were inputted, and the sample dates of the sequences were defined. After estimation of the best-fitting root, a linear regression was performed on the root-to-tip distances of samples versus the date of the isolate, and significant outliers (sequences) were rejected as they did not fit into the assumption of the molecular clock.
