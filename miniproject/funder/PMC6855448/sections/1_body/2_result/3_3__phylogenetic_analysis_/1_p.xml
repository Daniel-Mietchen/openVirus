<p>Obviously, the sample sequences were classified in independent clusters with high bootstrap values (70â€“100%), indicating robust support for the tree topology. DENV-1 was used to construct 3529 sequences of ML tree, and 3542 of DENV-2. From the ML tree of the global dataset, the sample sequences positive for DENV-1 were divided into three clusters, and the DENV-2 positive sample sequences were grouped into two clusters (for detailed clustering results, see
