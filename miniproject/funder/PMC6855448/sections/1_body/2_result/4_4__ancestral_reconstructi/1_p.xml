<p>All sample sequences were clearly clustered into one branch (with the classification of branches based on posterior probabilities and the number of 0.8 and higher as trustworthy). In this study, all sample sequences in the first, second, and third clusters belonged to DENV-1. According to the MCC tree reconstructed from Cluster I, the 17 isolates were clustered in one branch (posterior probability = 0.9985), which is the same as the Thailand and Taiwanese 2015 sequences (posterior probability = 0.9998). Our paleogeography analysis results showed that the sample virus originated in Taiwan. In 2015, the virus affected the region radically and was later imported into Guangzhou between 2015 and 2018. The MCC tree of Cluster II indicated that the sample sequences were clustered in the branch (accession: MG767211) with a sequence obtained from Guangzhou in 2017 (posterior probability = 0.9999), with no other clusters in the same branch. The results from the paleogeography analysis suggested that Guangzhou was the location where the most recent common ancestor was found, while an earlier ancestor appeared in Singapore. The MCC tree of Cluster III suggested that the sample sequences were clustered in the same branch with the Taiwanese 2015 and 2016 sequences, as well as the cluster of the Singaporean 2016 sequences (posterior probability = 0.9992). Through paleogeography analysis, the sample virus might be spread along a propagation path and imported into Guangzhou from Taiwan in 2018 or before. The fourth and fifth clusters belonged to DENV-2. As shown in the MCC tree of Cluster IV, the sample sequences were clustered in the same branch with the Malaysian 2013 sequence (posterior probability = 0.9999), indicating that the most recent ancestor of the sample sequences emerged from Malaysia. According to the propagation path map, the sample virus entered Guangzhou during 2013–2018. The MCC tree of Cluster V suggested that the sample sequences were clustered in the same branch with the Indian 2015 sequences and the Taiwanese 2015 sequence cluster (posterior probability = 0.8465). According to the propagation path, the sample virus was imported into Guangzhou during 2015–2018. It is difficult to infer a highly accurate propagation path as no more sequences are available from the GenBank database. The propagation path map of all sample viruses is included in
