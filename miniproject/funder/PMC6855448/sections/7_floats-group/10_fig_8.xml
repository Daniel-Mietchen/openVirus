  <title>Maximum clade credibility tree of the sequence of cluster IV.</title>
  <p>A| A root-to-tip analysis was performed in TempEst v1.5. An ML tree was built using the sample dataset to determine the R2 value; R2 &gt; 0 indicates a positive correlation between the dataset and the molecular clock. B| Sequences from different geographic regions are represented by different colors. The location on the branch is the most recent ancestor position, and the value is the posterior probability. The purple branch indicates that Indonesia is the most recent ancestor of the sequences; the blue branch corresponds to Malaysia; the orange branch corresponds to Zhongshan City; the green branch corresponds to East Timor; and the red branch corresponds to Guangzhou. The dotted line box represents the sample sequence obtained in this experiment.</p>
