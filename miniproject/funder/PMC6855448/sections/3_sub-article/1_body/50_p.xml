<p>It would have been very helpful for the authors to evaluate dengue virus from other years as well.  Restricting the study to a single year – even an outbreak year – limits usefulness of the data collected.  For instance, did the virus evolve in 2018 in such a way as to be different from previous years?  If so, what are the virologic differences across the viral genome?</p>
