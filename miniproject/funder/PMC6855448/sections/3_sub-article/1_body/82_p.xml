<p>Reviewer #1: Liao et al. studied 34 DENV strains, including 29 DENV-1 strains and 5 DENV-2 strains, isolated from blood samples from dengue fever patients at Guangzhou in 2018. They amplified the envelope genes of these isolates by RT-PCR and performed phylogenetic analysis. The found DENV isolates of 2018 in Guangzhou were mainly imported from Southeast Asian countries. Propagation paths based on phylogeographical analysis suggested potential local DENV transmission in Guangzhou.</p>
