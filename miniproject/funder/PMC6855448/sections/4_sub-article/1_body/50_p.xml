<p>Answer: 3,529 sequences of DENV-1 were used for the study, and 3,542 sequences of DENV-2 were used for the study. Our dataset downloads all DENV-1 and DENV-2 sequences from genbank and screens the downloaded sequences (removing sequences with incomplete information such as lack of acquisition time and location, missing E gene sequences). The sequence of the data set is representative.</p>
