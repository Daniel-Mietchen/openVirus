<p>Answer: The propagation path map is the result of the phylogeographic analyses. The BEAST software is used to calculate the nearest common ancestor position of each sequence, and the result is a "tree" file, a "log" file, and the like. SPREAD v1.0.6 software can read these files and generate a propagation path map. Related steps have been added to the manuscript. The changed part is in the 182-184 lines of the manuscript. </p>
