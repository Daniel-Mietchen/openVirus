<p>Answer: This is not clearly described in the manuscript.. We collected 170 samples of suspected dengue patients from the hospital (not yet diagnosed), and then the hospital tested the 170 samples and determined that 55 of them were positive samples. We cultured 55 samples according to the hospital's test, and finally obtained only 34 dengue viruses and conducted subsequent studies. The changed part is in the 101-103 lines of the manuscript.</p>
