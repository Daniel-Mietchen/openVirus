<p>Answer: This is a written error that has been corrected in the manuscript. “blood sample” has been modified to “blood samples” in the assay. We collected 170 samples of suspected dengue patients from the hospital (not yet diagnosed), and then the hospital tested the 170 samples and determined that 55 of them were positive samples. We cultured 55 samples according to the hospital's test, and finally obtained only 34 dengue viruses and conducted subsequent studies. </p>
