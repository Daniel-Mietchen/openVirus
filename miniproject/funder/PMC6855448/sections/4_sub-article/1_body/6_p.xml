<p>Answer: Yes, we take your questions into account when building the ML tree. After searching for the sequence of dengue virus in Genbank, we separated the sequence into two data sets, DENV-1 and DENV-2. Sequences in the dataset are sorted out to remove invalid sequences (E gene is incomplete, no separation sites, no separation time, etc.) so that our dataset can contain many sequences from different countries. Our dataset contains sequences from other southern China, such as Yunnan (another region in China where dengue epidemics), Fujian, Taiwan, etc. The results of the analysis show that there are no clusters in the second cluster sequence that have other sequences in other provinces in China, and the calculation of the ancestral position also shows this result. The ancestors of other sample clusters showed that most of them were imported from Southeast Asian countries, which also indicates that the dengue virus prevalent in Guangzhou is still dominated by input. </p>
