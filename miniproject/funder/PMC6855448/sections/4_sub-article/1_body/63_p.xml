<p>Answer: The data set used to construct the maximum likelihood tree in this study was downloaded from NCBI and can be used for all DENV-1 and DENV-2 sequences analyzed, including Chinese sequences, and we screened these large numbers of sequences. Finally, the database used in the study was formed. The data set contains Chinese sequences such as Yunnan Province, Fujian Province, and Taiwan Province. The results in such a data set show that the sample sequence is not clustered with other Chinese sequences in a cluster. So the results of the ancestral position did not show that they were from other provinces in China. </p>
