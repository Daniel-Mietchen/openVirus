<p>Answer: As with the answer to the second question, we downloaded a large number of sequences and processed them. The data set used to construct the ML tree of DENV-1 contains a total of 3529 sequences. The data set used to construct the ML tree of DENV-2 contains a total of 3542 sequences. The sequences number used to construct the ML tree will be written in the supplemental material. Already added this data in the article.
