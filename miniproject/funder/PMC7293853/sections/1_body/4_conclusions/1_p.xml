<p>Using nest boxes occupied by BFDV-positive birds, as well as two control groups, we aimed to test whether and for how long BFDV can be detected in nest boxes, and if detection is related to presence of infection with or shedding of BFDV. We had two main goals, namely to test a non-invasive method for pathogen surveillance in the nest, and to shed light on indirect transmission dynamics of a pathogen of global conservation concern. We were able to show that during breeding, BFDV was significantly more likely to be detected in nest boxes of BFDV-positive 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic> than in control boxes. We detected BFDV in nest swabs of 80% of boxes occupied by parental females which were excreting BFDV antigen, suggesting that the method we are presenting detects BFDV shedding rather than just infection with BFDV. The method we used is simple, inexpensive and non-invasive, with the potential to detect hosts that are in a state of active BFDV infection with viral shedding. It could potentially be applied to other pathogens which are persistent in the environment, thus aiding pathogen surveillance and preventing the spread of wildlife diseases, reducing risk to biodiversity and human health. Additionally, at least in our study system, we show that BFDV does not seem to be as persistent in the nest as previously thought, suggesting that indirect transmission of this pathogen via contaminated nest boxes may not be likely. Further studies are, however, needed to generalise these findings across other host species and geographic regions.
