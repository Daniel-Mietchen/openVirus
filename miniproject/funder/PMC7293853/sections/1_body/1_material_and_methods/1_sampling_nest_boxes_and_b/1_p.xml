<p>Our study was carried out under Deakin University animal ethics approval (B31-2015), Australian Bird and Bat Banding authority 2319 and complied with the laws of Victoria (research permit 10007969). We collected 1500 nest swabs from 241 nest boxes used by 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic>, from 2016 to 2018. The boxes were located at four locations in Victoria, Australia: Bellbrae (38.33152°S, 144.18677°E), Gundrys Road (38.34407°S, 144.21313°E), Meredith (37.84567°S, 144.07718°E) and Steiglitz (37.87573°S, 144.17980°E). They were constructed of 19 mm thick treated pine (
 <italic>Pinus radiata</italic>) and were 24 cm wide, 28 cm deep and 42 cm high with an entrance diameter of 7.5 cm and a sliding side door to permit easy access by researchers (

 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic>) wood chips was put inside each box to a depth of about 10 cm (
