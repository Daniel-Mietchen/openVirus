<p>We used the following standardised protocol. Nest swabs were collected from each nest box before, during and after each of two breeding seasons, between September 2016 and January 2018. The swabs used were sterile, individually wrapped cotton tip swabs with plastic handles (Westlab, Mitchell Park, Australia). We swabbed active nests, that is, nests containing eggs or nestlings. We also took swabs from paired controls, which were randomly assigned unoccupied nest boxes in the same field site as their paired active box. Swab samples were taken fortnightly during the breeding season, and monthly between breeding seasons. When sampling a nest box, the cotton tip swab was first pulled along all four nest box walls approximately five centimetres above the nesting material, a height at which both adult and juvenile 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic> would frequently be in contact with the nest box walls. The same swab was then inserted at three random locations into the nesting material at the base of the box. The swab tip was then placed in an empty 1.5 ml Eppendorf Safe-Lock Tube (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany), stored at 4 °C, and then transferred to −80 °C storage within eight hours. In nest boxes that did not contain nesting material (as some breeding birds removed all the Red Gum wood chips), the same movements were performed with the swab, but only the wooden floor of the nest box could be swabbed.
