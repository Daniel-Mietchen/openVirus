<p>For nest boxes that contained infected (hereafter ‘BFDV-positive’) birds, equal numbers of ‘control boxes’ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>) were selected: ‘control group 1’ contained nest boxes occupied by non-infected (hereafter ‘BFDV-negative’) birds (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Table S2</xref>). These boxes were chosen randomly from boxes containing nests where we had complete BFDV data of blood and cloacal swabs for both parents, and complete blood data for all nestlings, and all these samples were BFDV-negative as determined by qPCR. ‘Control group 2’ consisted of nest boxes unoccupied by breeding birds in the years we conducted this study, and which had been selected as paired controls for active nests during the breeding season. For unoccupied nest boxes during the breeding season the sample size was 10 instead of 11, as one box was occupied by Sugar Gliders (
 <italic>Petaurus breviceps</italic>) for several weeks and could not be swabbed during this period. Nest boxes of both control groups were at the same field sites, so were located in the same habitats as the nest boxes containing BFDV-positive birds.
