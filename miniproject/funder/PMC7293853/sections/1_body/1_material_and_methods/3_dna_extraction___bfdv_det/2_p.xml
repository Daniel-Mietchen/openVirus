<p>For BFDV detection in nest swabs, we used the same probe-based qPCR method as for BFDV detection in blood and cloacal swab samples (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>). The qPCR was performed using the PikoReal Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA). Positive controls (DNA of confirmed BFDV-positive 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> blood samples) and no-template controls were added to each qPCR plate, and all samples were run in duplicate. Samples that tested BFDV-positive in both wells were re-run to confirm BFDV presence. We set a conservative detection threshold (hereafter named ‘threshold
 <sub>36</sub>’) at Cq 36 based on an earlier study with the same method (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al., 2019</xref>), meaning that we considered samples as BFDV-positive if they had Cq values (cycle at which probe fluorescence crosses the arbitrarily set detection baseline) of under 36 in both wells. Based on the repeatability of our results (qPCR results were repeatable up to a detection threshold of Cq 38 in the study presented here), we also tested a higher threshold of Cq 38 for nest swabs (hereafter named ‘threshold
 <sub>38</sub>’), meaning that weaker qPCR signals were counted as BFDV-positive.
