<p>When testing birds for BFDV, we first tested blood samples of all breeding birds and their nestlings, because reporting BFDV prevalence based on blood samples is a widely used and validated method for BFDV surveillance (

We then tested cloacal swabs from parents that were BFDV-positive in blood samples, as well as from all other birds in the same nest as these infected birds, and from all birds in the control nests. For analysis of blood samples and cloacal swabs, we used threshold
 <sub>36</sub> based on repeatability on qPCR results for these sample types (
