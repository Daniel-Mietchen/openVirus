<p>To compare differences in BFDV presence on nest swabs between the three test groups (nest swabs from before, during and after breeding), we used the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact probability test for a two-rows by three-columns contingency table. For pairwise comparisons of groups, we used the Fisher’s exact test with a 2x2 contingency table. All percentages are reported ± 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise stated.</p>
