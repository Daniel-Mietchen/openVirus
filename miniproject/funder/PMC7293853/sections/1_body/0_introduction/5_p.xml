<p>Here, we investigated BFDV presence and persistence in occupied and unoccupied nest boxes using paired controls and repeated measures over two breeding seasons. We determined BFDV prevalence and viral shedding of birds occupying nest boxes as part of a long-term study in breeding 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic> and their offspring (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2019</xref>). Both species have been shown to be susceptible to BFDV infection, with 34.5% prevalence in wild 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> in Australia (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>), subject to substantial variation with age and subspecies (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2014</xref>), and 14.8% prevalence in introduced 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic> in New Zealand (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Ha et al., 2007</xref>). In wild 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic>, 
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al. (2019)</xref> found that BFDV infection status was not correlated between parents and their offspring, as in some nest boxes, one or more nestlings were BFDV-positive, although their parents were BFDV-negative. This pattern suggests infection of nestlings by indirect transmission from contaminated nesting material. We had three main aims: (1) Test whether and for how long BFDV can be detected using nest box swabs, (2) Investigate whether detectability in swabs is related to occupation of the box, and whether birds breeding in the box are infected with or shedding BFDV, and (3) Investigate whether presence of BFDV in nest boxes changes across the breeding season before, during and after occupation by breeding birds. This study will be an important step towards a non-invasive method for pathogen surveillance in nest boxes, and will shed light on the dynamics of indirect transmission.
