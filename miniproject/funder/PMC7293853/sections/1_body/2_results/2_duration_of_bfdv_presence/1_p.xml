<p>For the one nest which contained a BFDV-positive bird and which had BFDV-positive nest swabs during as well as after breeding (threshold
 <sub>36</sub> used for detection, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2A</xref>), the BFDV-positive swab during breeding was collected on October 10, 2016. BFDV-positive blood and cloacal swab samples of the female parent were taken 45 days later, on November 24, 2016, and the BFDV-positive nest swab after the breeding season was collected 68 days after that, on January 31, 2017. The time span between the two positive nest box swabs was 113 days (3.7 months). Using the threshold
 <sub>38</sub> for BFDV detection, one more box with a BFDV-positive bird and one unoccupied box had BFDV-positive nest swabs both during and after the breeding season (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S2</xref>). The time spans between samplings of these two BFDV-positive nest swabs were 67 days (2.2 months) for the box with the BFDV-positive bird, and 79 days (2.6 months) for the unoccupied box.
