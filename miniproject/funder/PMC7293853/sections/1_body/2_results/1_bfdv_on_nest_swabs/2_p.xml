<p>During breeding, significantly more nest swabs were BFDV-positive in nest boxes which contained BFDV-positive birds (4 out of 11) than in boxes containing BFDV-negative birds (0 out of 11, Fisher’s exact P (one-tailed) = 0.045, P (two-tailed) = 0.09). The difference between nest boxes occupied by BFDV-positive birds and unoccupied boxes was not significant (1 out of 10, Fisher’s exact P (one-tailed) = 0.19, P (two-tailed) = 0.31). Before the breeding season, there was no difference in the number of BFDV-positive nest swabs between the three test groups (Fisher’s exact P
 <sub>A</sub> = 1.0, P
 <sub>B</sub> = 1.0), as all had BFDV-negative nest swabs. After the breeding season, there was also no difference in the number of BFDV-positive nest swabs (Fisher’s exact P
 <sub>A</sub> = 1.0, P
 <sub>B</sub> = 0.656), as only one nest with BFDV-positive birds had a BFDV-positive swab, and all other swabs were BFDV-negative. The number of BFDV-positive nest swab samples increased when we shifted the detection threshold of the qPCR to the more sensitive threshold
 <sub>38</sub> (
