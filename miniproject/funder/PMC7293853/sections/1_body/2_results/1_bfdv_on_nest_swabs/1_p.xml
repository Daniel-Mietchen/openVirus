<p>Of 82 nests tested, 11 nests (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic>, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic>) contained either one nestling or at least one parent which was BFDV-positive using the conservative threshold
 <sub>36</sub> (11 of 82, 13.4%, 6.9–22.7; 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We detected BFDV in six of 122 blood samples of parents (1.8%, 1.8–10.4), one of 352 (0.3%, 0.0–1.6) of one week old nestlings and four of 227 (1.8%, 0.5–4.5) of four week old nestlings. With one exception where both parents were BFDV-positive, we found only one infected bird (parent or nestling) in each BFDV-positive nest (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All parents that were BFDV-positive in blood were young females; the only male parent that was BFDV-positive in these nests had a BFDV-positive cloacal swab, but BFDV-negative blood (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the remaining 71 nests, all parents and nestlings were BFDV-negative. For all 11 nest boxes occupied by a BFDV-positive parent or nestling (hereafter treated as one group, ‘BFDV-positive birds’), nest box swabs were BFDV-negative before breeding started. Four of the 11 (36.4%, 95% CI [10.9–69.2]) nests had BFDV-positive nest swabs during breeding, and one nest (9.1%, 95% CI [0.2–41.3]) was still BFDV-positive after the breeding season, using threshold

During breeding, BFDV-positive nest swabs were found in four of the six nests (66.7%, 95% CI [22.3–95.7]) containing parents with BFDV-positive blood samples, in two of the three nests (66.7%, 95% CI [22.3–95.7]) containing parents with BFDV-positive cloacal swabs, but in none of the five nests which contained BFDV-positive nestlings (0.0%, 95% CI [0.0–52.2],
