<p>Although our nest swab results were strongly associated with the infection status of the parents occupying the boxes, particularly in terms of their likelihood of shedding virus, there were some discrepancies. For example, two boxes occupied by BFDV-positive adults with antigen excretion did not have BFDV-positive nest swabs. Such discrepancies may represent limitations of our methodology, for example during sample collection, as not all nesting material in each box was touched with the nest swabs, but only the material in three random locations in the boxes, and BFDV may have thus not been picked up. Alternatively, the inhibitor removal conducted before conducting the lab assays may not have worked on all swabs: 
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al. (2018)</xref> used the same inhibitor removal system as we did in our study, and reported that a very small percentage (&lt;2%) of samples had to be excluded from the study, as not all inhibitors could be removed. In our study, the number of nest swabs that were BFDV-positive varied depending on the qPCR detection threshold chosen. Using the more sensitive threshold, we picked up more weakly BFDV-positive swabs, which resulted in a BFDV-positive nest swab of one nest with BFDV-negative birds before the breeding season, and BFDV-positive nest swabs of two unoccupied control nests after the season. One explanation for this may be that BFDV-positive birds inspected, but did not select, these nest boxes earlier in the season. For example, 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> often do not choose the same nest box in consecutive seasons, but search for a different nest box (
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, we cannot exclude the small possibility that this result arose from false positives due to contamination of swabs, as we did not include blank extraction controls in all qPCR assays. We however note that our sampling design, using two types of control nest boxes, repeated sampling of each nest box over three time periods, and basing conclusions on a conservative qPCR threshold (threshold
 <sub>36</sub>), should reduce concerns about biased results and false positives. Our findings, with all boxes testing BFDV-negative before the breeding season for example, seem logical despite the small possibility of false positives, which gives further reassurance regarding our key results and conclusions. Our comparative results with two different virus detection thresholds show that analysis parameters should be chosen carefully, as they may change the interpretation of results.
