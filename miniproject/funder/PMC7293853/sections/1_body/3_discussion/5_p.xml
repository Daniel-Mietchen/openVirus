<p>Overall, BFDV prevalence in breeding birds and their offspring in our study (13.4% of nests, 1.8% of parental blood samples) was much lower than previously reported for 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> (34.5%) (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2015</xref>). With one exception where both parents in one nest were BFDV-positive, we only found one BFDV-positive individual (parent or nestling) in each box. 
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al. (2019)</xref> found the same when analysing BFDV infection in 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> parents and their offspring in the nest, and consequently they suggested that infection of nestlings with BFDV-negative parents may have occurred through contaminated nesting material. Alternatively, the BFDV-positive birds in our study may have been infected through ectoparasitic vectors instead of through the nesting material itself, as BFDV has been found in mites on cockatoos (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Portas et al., 2017</xref>). Exposure to high doses of BFDV is thought to be required to establish infection (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Raidal &amp; Peters, 2018</xref>). This may explain why in most nests only one bird was BFDV-positive, as viral contamination may not generally be sufficiently high to reach such doses. In populations with higher BFDV prevalence, nesting material could still be an important avenue of transmission.
