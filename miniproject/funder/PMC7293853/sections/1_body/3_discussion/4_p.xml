<p>Despite the low likelihood of detecting BFDV in the nest box after the breeding season, indirect transmission may still occur, just within a shorter time window. Some parrot species inspect nest hollows year-round (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Higgins, 1999</xref>), and competition over nest hollows is high, particularly in parrots (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Heinsohn, Murphy &amp; Legge, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Martens &amp; Woog, 2017</xref>). Preventative measures against BFDV may thus still need to be implemented in recovery programs for endangered species. On the other hand, in a recent study by 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Fogell et al. (2019)</xref> on BFDV, hygiene measures did not improve fledging success in an endangered psittacine species. Additionally, a study on avian infections with the bacterium 
 <italic>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</italic> showed that indirect transmission by environmental contamination led to only mild infections, possibly due to exposure to low infectious doses of 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>, resulting in hypothesised immunisation against future infections (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Dhondt et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies which compare BFDV strains of infected birds in the nest (nestlings, breeding adults), and strains found in the nesting material itself (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2019</xref>), are needed for a better understanding of transmission routes between birds in the nest, and between nesting material and birds, and the resulting possible positive (immunisation) (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Dhondt et al., 2007</xref>) or negative (chronic infection) (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2014</xref>) effects on hosts.
