<p>We found a high percentage (80%) of BFDV-positive nest swabs derived from nests occupied by BFDV-positive females with antigen excretion, and from nests occupied by parents with BFDV-positive cloacal swabs (66.7%), but an absence of BFDV on nest swabs derived from nests with BFDV-positive nestlings. This suggests that results from nest swabs are more strongly associated with shedding of BFDV by infected birds (feathers, cloaca) rather than BFDV presence in blood alone. Antigen excretion into feathers is considered to be an indicator for active BFDV infection with virus replication (
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Sarker et al., 2016</xref>), and contaminated feather dander is thought to be one of the main BFDV transmission routes (
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Raidal, Sabine &amp; Cross, 1993</xref>). More generally, antigen excretion is a major contributor to disease outbreaks originating from environmental contamination, as has been shown in cholera and other diseases (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Joh et al., 2009</xref>). While we could not test antigen excretion in nestlings or males, all females that were excreting antigen in our study were younger than three years. In 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic>, prevalence is highest in subadult birds (&lt;1 year old) (

 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Martens et al., 2019</xref>). Female 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> start to procreate when they are still subadults, but this is very rarely observed in males (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Eastwood et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Krebs, 1998</xref>). In 
 <italic>P. elegans</italic> and 
 <italic>P. eximius</italic> at least, subadult females may thus play an important role in BFDV transmission in the nest. On the other hand, nest swabs from nests containing BFDV-positive nestlings were all BFDV-negative. In nestlings, BFDV incubation times from exposure to onset of clinical signs can range from 36Â h (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Doneley, 2003</xref>) to four weeks (
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Raidal &amp; Cross, 1995</xref>), and in some cases, nestlings are thought to be protected temporarily by maternal antibodies (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 1992</xref>). Nestlings in our study were possibly not shedding BFDV yet. There are, however, no studies investigating the time span between BFDV infection and onset of shedding. We do not know whether the four nestlings that had tested BFDV-positive at four weeks of age in our study were still BFDV-positive when leaving the nest, and could not test whether they were shedding BFDV.
