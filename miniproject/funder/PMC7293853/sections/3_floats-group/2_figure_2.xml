  <title>Number of nest boxes, in all three test groups, with BFDV-positive nest swabs before, during and after breeding, and percentage of BFDV-positive nest swabs in nests with BFDV-positive adults or nestlings, and BFDV shedding parents, during the breeding season.</title>
  <p>(A) number of nest boxes (out of total of 33 for the three test groups, 11 per group) with BFDV-positive nest box swabs before, during and after the breeding season, analysed with detection threshold 
   <sub>36</sub>. For unoccupied nest boxes during the breeding season, the sample size was 10 instead of 11. (B) percentage of nest boxes with BFDV-positive (‘BFDV+’) nest swabs ± 95% confidence intervals, which were occupied by BFDV shedding parents (as detected with HA; only females could be tested for shedding, see Materials &amp; Methods), by BFDV-positive parents, or by BFDV-positive nestlings (as detected with qPCR of blood samples), during the breeding season. Shedding parents are also BFDV-positive as detected by qPCR, and are also part of the bar showing ‘nests with BFDV+ parent’. The number at the base of bars indicates number of nest boxes with BFDV-positive nest box swabs out of the total number of nest boxes occupied by BFDV-positive or shedding parents or nestlings.
