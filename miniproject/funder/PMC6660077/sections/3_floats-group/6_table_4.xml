     <td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Continuous quality assurance should be practiced, including by ensuring laboratory staff proficiency, by regularly running well-characterized quality assurance specimens (recent, longterm and negative) and by monitoring the reactivity of kit-supplied specimens (controls and calibrators) over time. Participation in an external quality assurance programme like EQAPOL [
