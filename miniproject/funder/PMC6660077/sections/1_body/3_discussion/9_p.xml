<p>Differences in ODn measurements between the Maxim and Sedia LAg assays on the same specimens largely resulted from differences in the reactivity of calibrators supplied by the manufacturers. This resulted in systematically lower ODn measurements on the Maxim assay than on the Sedia assay, and consequently longer MDRIs and larger FRRs at any given ODn recency discrimination threshold. While performance for surveillance purposes was extremely similar, different thresholds were optimal and different values of MDRI and FRR were appropriate for use in survey planning and incidence estimation. The two assays cannot be treated as interchangeable, should not be mixed within one study, and care should be taken when interpreting and comparing results. We summarize our recommendations based on this comparative evaluation in
