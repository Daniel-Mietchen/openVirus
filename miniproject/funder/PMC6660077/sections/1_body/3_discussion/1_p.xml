<p>The Maxim and Sedia LAg assays produce meaningfully different ODn results on the same specimens, largely as a result of higher readings obtained from the Maxim-supplied kit calibrators, and consequently, at any given ODn threshold, RITAs based on the two assays have different MDRIs and FRRs. It is inappropriate to utilize published MDRI and FRR estimates for one assay in survey planning and incidence estimation where the other assay is being used, or to switch from one assay to the other within a study.</p>
