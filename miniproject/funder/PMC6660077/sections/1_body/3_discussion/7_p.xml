<p>It should also be noted that the triplicate ‘confirmatory’ testing protocol mandates confirmatory testing when an initial ODn result is below 2.0, which may be problematic for RITAs that use ODn thresholds above the ‘standard’ threshold of 1.5. It would also be a different subset of specimens reflexed to confirmatory testing on the two assays. Consideration should be given to a modified testing protocol in which confirmatory testing is performed on a larger subset of (or even all) specimens.</p>
