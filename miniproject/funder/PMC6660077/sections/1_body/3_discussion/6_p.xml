<p>Despite the systematic differences in calibrator readings and consequently in the ODn values obtained, performance of the two assays for incidence surveillance was virtually indistinguishable—as long as appropriate assay- and context-specific MDRI and FRR estimates were used. As a result, different ODn thresholds were nominally optimal (i.e. produced the lowest variance on the incidence estimate). In all three hypothetical surveillance scenarios, ODn thresholds between about 1.5 and 3.25 (in combination with viral load), produced the best precision. It is critical, however, that appropriate MDRI and FRR estimates be used for the assay, recency discrimination threshold and other RITA components chosen in order to obtain accurate incidence estimates. Since there was no clear performance advantage to either assay in any of the scenarios, we do not recommend the choice of one over the other. However, RITAs based on either assay should be optimized in order to maximize the precision of incidence estimates, by choosing appropriate thresholds. RITAs based on both the Maxim and Sedia LAg perform well compared to those based on other assays for identifying recent HIV-1 infection [
