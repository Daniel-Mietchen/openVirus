<p>It is possible to derive an approximate conversion factor (of 1.172) between ODn values of the two assays from the slopes of the regression curves shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>. It has further been suggested that a threshold of 1.5 on Maxim is equivalent to a threshold of 2.0 on Sedia, based on testing of a set of specimens, with reactivity spanning the dynamic range, with both assays (personal communication, B. Parekh). Our analysis does indeed show that these thresholds yield very similar MDRIs when used alone (248 days vs. 254 days), but the FRRs are also different. Applying a conversion factor to the Sedia results of repeat-tested specimens does not perfectly predict the Maxim ODn values obtained, and a preferable approach is therefore to use appropriately-estimated MDRIs and FRRs for any given RITA based on either assay.
