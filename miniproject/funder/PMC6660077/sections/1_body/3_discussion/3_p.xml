<p>Our reproducibility analyses show little benefit to the normalization procedure, with both the Maxim and Sedia assays showing greater variability in ODn values than in the raw optical densities on blinded replicate specimens subjected to repeat testing. Further, the correlation between Maxim and Sedia ODs was greater than between ODn measurements on the same specimens. However, at the time of each of these evaluations, kits and reagents were sourced at the same time, kits were from a small number of lots, and operators were highly experienced with assays. The purpose of the calibrators and normalization procedure is to reduce lot-to-lot variability and ensure stability of results over time and between manufacturers and laboratories. This goal requires that calibrators be highly consistent over time and between manufacturers, which is not currently the case. The NIAID-supported External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) LAG program found similar differences in calibrator reactivity and average ODn values between the two assays (Keating et al., forthcoming). External quality assurance is critical for ensuring consistency between laboratories and kit manufacturers.</p>
