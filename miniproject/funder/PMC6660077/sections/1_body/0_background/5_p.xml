<p>In this study we confirm the systematic differences in reactivity between the Maxim and Sedia assays, while additionally conducting the first large-scale evaluation of the Maxim assay, including a comparative assessment of performance relative to the Sedia LAg assay, previously evaluated on the same specimen panel by the Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays (CEPHIA) [

 <xref rid="pone.0220345.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Unlike the the study by Schlusser et al. published in 2017, we were able to robustly estimate performance characteristics, thanks to the use of a blinded 2,500-specimen panel (the CEPHIA Evaluation Panel), designed for this purpose and which represents a diversity of HIV-1 subtypes, observations at a range of times post-infection, and the inclusion of both treatment-na√Øve and virally suppressed specimens.
