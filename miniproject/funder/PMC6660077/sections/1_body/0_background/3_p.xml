<p>The performance of a test for recent infection is reflected in two key characteristics: the mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) and the false-recent rate (FRR). MDRI is the average time an individual spends in the ‘recent infection’ state as defined by a biomarker or set of biomarkers, having been infected for less than a cutoff time denoted 
 <italic>T</italic>. FRR (also referred to as the false-recent ratio and the proportion falsely recent) is the proportion of individuals infected for longer than 
 <italic>T</italic> who nevertheless exhibit the ‘recent’ biomarker. The accuracy of cross-sectional incidence estimates depends on applying correct context-specific test property estimates, while the precision of incidence estimates is sensitive to both MDRI and FRR. Choice of a recency discrimination threshold on a biomarker therefore implies a tradeoff between these two properties—maximizing MDRI and minimizing FRR [
