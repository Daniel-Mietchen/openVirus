<p>We have further developed a sophisticated approach for assessing real-world performance by estimating context-specific MDRIs and FRRs, taking into account study design and epidemiological factors such as the HIV-1 subtype mix in the infected population, the rate of viral suppression (primarily associated with ART, but also resulting from the small number of individuals capable of naturally suppressing viral replication in the absence of ART, known as ‘elite controllers’) and the distribution of times-since-infection in the surveyed population (see [
