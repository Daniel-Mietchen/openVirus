<p>HIV incidence is a more sensitive indicator of epidemiological trends and intervention impact than prevalence; however, it is harder to estimate. Longitudinal follow-up of HIV-negative cohorts is considered the gold standard for estimating incidence, but is expensive, time-consuming, logistically challenging and results are difficult to generalize to the population level [
