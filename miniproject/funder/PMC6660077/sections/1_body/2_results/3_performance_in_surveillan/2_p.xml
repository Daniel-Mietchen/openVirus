 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows context-specific FRR against context-specifc MDRI, for RITAs that included a viral load threshold of &gt;1,000c/mL and where we assume that ART exposure testing reduces false recency in treated subjects to zero. Note that the MDRI values on the x-axis encode different ODn thresholds for the two assays. This figure visualises the tradeoff between MDRI and FRR as the ODn threshold is increased, under the assumptions of the three scenarios. The FRR rises at slightly lower MDRIs for Sedia-based RITAs than for Maxim-based RITAs, in all three scenarios. To maintain FRRs below 2%, both assays require a choice of ODn threshold that produces maximal MDRIs of about 400 to 450 days. In the supplemental material, we show context-adapted FRRs against ODn thresholds (
