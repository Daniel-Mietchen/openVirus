 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the precision of the incidence estimate attained for a range of ODn thresholds in combination with a viral load threshold of &gt;1,000c/mL. At each ODn threshold, assay-specific context-adapted MDRIs and FRRs were computed for use in the incidence calculation. Context-specific MDRI and FRR estimates, and RSEs on incidence estimates, are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220345.s002">S2 Table</xref>. In the South Africa-like scenario,
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, the lowest value of RSE on incidence attained with the Maxim-based algorithm was 11.7% at ODn ≤3.0, and with the Sedia-based algorithm was 12.0% at the same ODn threshold. In the Kenya-like scenario, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, the minimal RSE for Maxim was 27.2%, achieved at ODn ≤2.75, and for Sedia was 28.2% at ODn ≤3.0. In the North American key population-like scenario, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, the lowest RSE for Maxim was 26.9% at ODn ≤3.25 and for Sedia was 28.9% at ODn ≤3.0. These nominally optimal thresholds were slightly different under the alternative assumption shown in
