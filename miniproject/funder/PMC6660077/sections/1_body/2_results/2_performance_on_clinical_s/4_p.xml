<p>While naïvely-estimated FRRs at a given threshold were not identical between the Maxim and Sedia assays, the differences were not statistically significant. The FRRs in ART-naïve subjects (without using viral load) were 3.26% and 2.17% for Maxim and Sedia, respectively, at ODn ≤1.5, and 1.69% and 1.12%, respectively when using viral load &gt;1000c/mL. These estimates are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220345.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Among treated subjects FRRs were extremely high when the RITA did not include a viral load threshold. In early-treated subjects (time from infection to treatment initiation ≤6 months), the FRRs for Maxim and Sedia were 98% and 96%, respectively, and in later-treated subjects (time from infection to treatment initiation &gt;6 months), FRRs were 38% vs. 33%, respectively. Using a supplemental viral load threshold reduced these FRRs to 0, given that all treated subjects in the EP were virally suppressed.
