 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows results of testing clinical specimens in the EP and the impact of the higher Maxim calibrator readings. ODn values in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g001">Fig 1B</xref> are concentrated below the diagonal line, especially at lower ODn values in the range of plausible recency discrimination thresholds. In fact, correlation was stronger for non-normalized OD readings than for normalized ODn readings. The slope for OD in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g001">Fig 1A</xref> is closer to unity than the slope for ODn in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, which also shows poorer correlation. The linear regression slopes were statistically significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The Bland-Altman plots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220345.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref> show that the Maxim assay tends to produce lower OD readings than the Sedia assay on the low end of the dynamic range, and higher readings at the top end. When the calibrators are used to normalize, Maxim ODn values exhibit clear downward bias throughout the dynamic range.
