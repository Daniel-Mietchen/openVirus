<p>MDRI was estimated using treatment-naïve, non-elite controller subjects, with EDDI intervals ≤120 days. Using ODn ≤1.5, the MDRI for Maxim, without using a supplemental viral load, was 248 days (95% CI: 224,274), while the MDRI for Sedia was 215 days (95% CI: 192,241), resulting in a difference estimate of 32.7 days (95% CI: 22.9,42.8). Applying a supplemental viral load threshold of &gt;1,000c/mL resulted in MDRI estimates of 201 days (95% CI: 180,224) and 171 days (95% CI: 152,191), respectively and a difference of 30.9 days (95% CI: 21.7,40.7).</p>
