<p>Reproducibility on the three blinded control specimens was similar, with CVs on OD and ODn (across 25 replicates) slightly higher for Sedia. The Maxim assay produced lower ODn values on average, and a much lower mean ODn on the low-reactivity specimen (labelled BC-3), of 0.54 vs. 1.02 on the Sedia assay. In accordance with the manufacturesâ€™ instructions for use, specimen BC-3 was subjected to triplicate confirmatory testing on both assays. The reported ODs were those obtained from the initial screening runs, and the mean and CV on ODn results were computed on the 25 final values.</p>
