<p>As reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220345.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the mean OD for all Maxim calibrators was 0.75 and for Sedia was 0.65, a difference in means of 0.107 (95% CI: 0.090,0.123, p-value from Welch two-sample t-test &lt; 0.001). When restricted to only the calibrators used for normalization—i.e., the median value of the three ODs obtained from triplicate testing on each plate—the coefficients of variation (CVs) of Maxim and Sedia calibrators were 9.3% and 14.2%, respectively. The distributions of calibrator reactivity are shown in
