<p>We evaluated the performance of recent infection testing algorithms (RITAs)—so called when multiple criteria are used to define a ‘recent’ infection—based on the Maxim and Sedia LAg assays. A RITA typically consists of a screening assay to ascertain HIV infection followed by a single immunoassay (e.g. Maxim LAg or Sedia LAg) as primary marker of ‘recent infection’, followed by a quantitative viral load and sometimes antiretroviral (ARV) drug exposure testing. The addition of viral load and ARV exposure criteria to RITAs are critical in populations with significant ART coverage, since immunoassays tend to produce very high false-recent rates in virally suppressed subjects.</p>
