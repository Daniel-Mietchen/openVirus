<p>We investigated a wide range of ODn threholds. In practice, the most commonly-used viral load threshold is &gt;1000c/mL, and this threshold was used for the primary results presented here. Alternative viral load thresholds of 75, 400, 1,000, and 5,000c/mL were investigated and are reported in the supplemental material. The assumption that testing for ARVs accurately classifies all treated subjects as long-term infections is relaxed in sensitivity analyses reported in the supplemental material. Context-specific MDRI and FRRs were obtained for each RITA under each scenario in order to evaluate the precision of incidence estimates expected. The precision of incidence estimates is highly sensitive to FRR, and in most cases values above about 1% result in poor precision.</p>
