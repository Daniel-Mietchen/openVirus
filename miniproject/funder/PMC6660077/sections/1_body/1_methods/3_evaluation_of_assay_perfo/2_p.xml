<p>As noted above, we defined the performance of a RITA for incidence surveillance as the precision of the incidence estimates obtained. In order to evaluate performance, we therefore specified three hypothetical surveillance scenarios defined by HIV-1 prevalence, incidence, the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in the population, ART coverage and viral suppression rates, as well as a survey sample size. Scenario A represents an epidemic similar to that of South Africa, Scenario B is similar to the Kenyan epidemic and Scenario C represents a concentrated (key population) epidemic. The assumptions defining each of the scenarios are summarised in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220345.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For each scenario and RITA (representing a threshold combination), we estimated context-specific MDRIs and FRRs.
