 <xref rid="pone.0220345.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for MDRI and FRR estimation, as well as to obtain the expected relative standard error (RSE) on incidence estimates (i.e. the standard error as a proportion of the point estimate), given RITA properties, hypothesized incidence, prevalence and survey sample size. We demonstrate the recommended procedure by taking into account uncertainty in both the calibration data and contextual parameters specified in the three scenarios.
