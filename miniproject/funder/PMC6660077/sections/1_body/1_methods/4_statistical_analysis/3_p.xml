<p>Naïve FRR estimates (i.e., not adated to epidemiological context), and their confidence intervals, were obtained by estimating the binomial probability that an untreated individual would produce a ‘recent’ result on the RITA when infected for longer than 
 <italic>T</italic>. To obtain context-specific FRR estimates, we obtained a weighted average of FRR estimates for the treated and untreated HIV-positive subpopulations, weighted according to treatment coverage. To estimate FRR in untreated individuals we fitted 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>) for all times post-infection and weighted that function by the probability density function of times-since-infection in the untreated population, parameterized as a Weibull survival function whose shape and scale parameters were chosen to produce a weighting function consistent with recent incidence, prevalence and treatment coverage. We estimated the FRR in treated individuals as the binomial probability that a treated individual infected for longer than 
 <italic>T</italic> produces a recent result.
