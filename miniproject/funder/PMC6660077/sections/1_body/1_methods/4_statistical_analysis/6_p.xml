<p>While we have declared hypothetical scenarios in which epidemiological parameters are ‘known’, we demonstrate the procedure that would be recommended in real-world settings by taking into account uncertainty in these parameters. To evaluate reproducibility of FRR estimates, we bootstrapped (30,000 iterations) both the calibration data and contextual parameters, the latter drawn from truncated normal distributions with means and standard deviations as defined for the scenarios above.</p>
