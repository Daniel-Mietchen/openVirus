<p>The majority of subjects (68%) had sufficient clinical background data to produce Estimated Dates of Detectable Infection (EDDIs). These are infection time ‘point estimates’ accompanied by plausible intervals of first detectability, obtained by systematically interpreting diverse diagnostic testing histories according to the method previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0220345.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A subject’s EDDI represents the date on which a viral load assay with a 50% limit of detection of 1 RNA copy/mL would be expected to first detect the infection, and consequently MDRI estimates are ‘anchored’ to this reference test.
