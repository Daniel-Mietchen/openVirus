 <xref rid="pone.0220345.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] that were obtained from 928 unique subjects, spanning a wide range of times since infection, and most infected with HIV-1 subtype B (57%), C (27%), A1 (10%), and D (5%). The panel contains 25 blinded replicates of 3 control specimens with antibody reactivity characteristic of recent, intermediate, and long-standing infection for reproducibility assessment, and specimens from ART-suppressed and naturally suppressed subjects to assess the impact of viral suppression on FRR.
