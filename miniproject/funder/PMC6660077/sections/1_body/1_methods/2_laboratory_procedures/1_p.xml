<p>The CEPHIA EP was tested with the Maxim and Sediaâ„¢ HIV-1 Limiting Antigen Avidity EIA (LAg) assays, according to their respective product inserts [
 <xref rid="pone.0220345.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220345.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both assays are microtitre-based with the solid phase of the microtitre plate coated with a multi-subtype recombinant HIV-1 antigen. This antigen is coated in a limiting concentration to prevent crosslinking of antibody binding, making it easier to remove weakly-bound antibody. Specimen dilutions are incubated for 60 minutes and then a disassociation buffer is added for 15 minutes to remove any weakly-bound antibody. A goat anti-human, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG is added and this binds to any remaining IgG; a tetramethylbenzidine substrate is added and a colour is generated which is proportionate to the amount of HRP. An optical density (OD) is measured for each sample and this is normalized by use of a calibrator specimen. On each plate, the calibrator is tested in triplicate, with the median of the three ODs used to normalize specimen readings, producing normalized optical density (ODn) measurements.
