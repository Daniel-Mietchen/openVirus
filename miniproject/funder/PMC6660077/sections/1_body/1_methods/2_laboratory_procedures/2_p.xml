<p>The procedures for both assays are essentially the same, and both manufacturers source the recombinant antigen from the CDC as part of their licensing agreement. However, other components of the assay, such as the type of plates used, the control and calibrator materials, etc., were sourced or produced by the individual manufacturers. The testing procedure for both assays requires that specimens producing an initial ‘screening’ OD of ≤2.0 be subjected to triplicate ‘confirmatory’ testing. The median ODn of the triplicate results then serves as the final result [

In the Maxim evaluation, a small number of specimens erroneously did not receive the triplicate confirmatory testing (12 out of 952), but a simulation investigation showed that this minor protocol deviation did not substantially affect results. It is further recommended that specimens producing an initial ODn ≤0.4 be subjected to serological confirmation of HIV infection.
