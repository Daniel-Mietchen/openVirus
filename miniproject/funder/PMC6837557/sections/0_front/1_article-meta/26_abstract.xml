 <p>Influenza, the flu, is a highly infectious respiratory disease that can cause serious health complications. Characterised by seasonal outbreaks, a key challenge for policy-makers is implementing measures to successfully lessen the public health burden on an annual basis. Seasonal influenza vaccine programmes are an established method to deliver cost-effective prevention against influenza and its complications. Transmission models have been a fundamental component of vaccine programme analysis, informing the efficient use of limited resources. However, these models generally treat each influenza season and each strain circulating within that season in isolation. By developing a mathematical model explicitly including multiple immunity propagation mechanisms, then fit to influenza-related vaccine and epidemiological data from England via statistical methods, we sought to quantify the extent that epidemiological events in the previous influenza season alter susceptibility at the onset of the following season. The findings suggest that susceptibility in the next season to a given influenza strain type is modulated to the greatest extent through natural infection by that strain type in the current season. Residual vaccine immunity has a lesser role. Prospectively, the adoption of influenza transmission modelling frameworks with immunity propagation would provide a comprehensive manner to assess the impact of seasonal vaccination programmes.</p>
