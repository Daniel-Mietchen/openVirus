<p>Amongst the three exposure history parameters (
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic>, 
 <italic>ξ</italic>), the parameter having a notable impact on the transmission dynamics was the modification to susceptibility due to natural infection in the previous influenza season (
 <italic>a</italic>). If infected by a given strain last influenza season, the inferred weighted median estimate of 0.7883 corresponds to an approximate 21% reduction in susceptibility to the current influenza season variant of that strain type. Strikingly, there was little carry over of prior season vaccine efficacy (
 <italic>ξ</italic>), with the majority of the posterior distribution massed near 0. Similarly, being previously infected by one of the type B influenza viruses conferred little immunity against the other type B lineage virus in the next influenza season.
