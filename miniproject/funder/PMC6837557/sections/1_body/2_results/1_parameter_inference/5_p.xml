<p>We verified model robustness by performing parameter fits using two subsets of the historical influenza season data, spanning the time periods 2012/13-2015/16 and 2012/13-2016/17 respectively. Fitting to these differing influenza season ranges, outcomes generally exhibited qualitative consistency; in particular, amongst the three mechanisms for immunity propagation, current influenza season susceptibility was modulated greatest by natural infection in the previous influenza season. The only notable quantitative differences when fitting to the two shortened time frames (compared to the distributions inferred when fitting to the complete time period) were elevated transmissibility levels (
