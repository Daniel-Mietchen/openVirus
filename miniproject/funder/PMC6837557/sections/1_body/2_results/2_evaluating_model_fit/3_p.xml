<p>A more detailed comparison of predicted and observed subtypes in each influenza season allowed us to analyse discrepancies in more detail (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007096.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The model predictions are shown with a violin plot to capture the variability in the distribution due to parameter uncertainty; while the observed data has confidence intervals (calculated from bootstrapping) due to the finite sample sizes. In general there was good agreement between the data and model, especially for years where particular subtypes dominated (e.g. A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2013/14 and 2015/16, A(H3N2) in 2014/15 and 2016/17, and B/Yamagata in 2012/13 and 2017/18). However, there were also discrepancies, most notably in 2015/16 where the majority of the B-influenza cases were predicted to the wrong lineage; a potential consequence of pursuing model parsimony, with preference for ensuring the generic behaviour for B/Yamagata across all other influenza seasons in the study period was correct, rather than seeking to capture every changing nuance when fitting to the data. It was also clear that the model generally performed less well when there were very low levels of a given subtype in a particular year.
