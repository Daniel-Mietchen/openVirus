<p>Considering type A influenza, we clearly captured the alternating pattern of dominance by A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes for the years 2012/13 to 2016/17; but more importantly the model was able to predict the unexpected result that A(H3N2) dominated in both 2016/17 and again in 2017/18. For influenza B, we obtained modest agreement for the overall magnitude of GP consultations as a result of type B, but this was not always in complete agreement with the subtype composition (
