<p>To assess the goodness-of-fit between our model and the available data, we performed 1,000 independent simulations using parameter sets drawn from the ABC inference procedure. Therefore, although the model is deterministic, we generated variability in epidemic composition due to the posterior distribution for the underlying parameters. The incidence of each of the four influenza types over each influenza season was converted to attributed GP consultations (per 100,000), with both incidence and GP consultation outputs compared to the data (
