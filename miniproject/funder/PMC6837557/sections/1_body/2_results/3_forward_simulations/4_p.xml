<p>Comparing subtype distributions when vaccine efficacies were either sampled from historical estimates or fixed at ‘expected’ values, we found that under randomly sampled vaccine efficacies incidence of B/Yamagata tended to exceed B/Victoria in each influenza season (holding in more than 70% of simulations, Fig. R in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007096.s001">S1 Text</xref>). However, we obtained greater levels of variation for the influenza A subtypes. In an ‘expected’ vaccine efficacy setting (single bars), less than half of total influenza A cases in any influenza season were attributed to the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype (rather than A(H3N2)), whereas under variable vaccine efficacies (distributed bars) A(H1N1)pdm09 incidence was greater than A(H3N2) incidence in 30-50% of all simulations (Fig. R in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007096.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Furthermore, in each future influenza season the majority of simulations (∼60-75%) performed with seasonally variable vaccine efficacies resulted in overall incidence rates exceeding the equivalent seasonal incidence estimates generated under ‘expected’ vaccine efficacy conditions.
