<p>An alternative approach is to use the single (best-fit) parameter set, but to sample the vaccine efficacies from historical estimates. The most striking factor was the amount of variability that comes as a direct results of uncertainty in the vaccine efficacies. All between-season patterns were swamped by the within-season variability, leading to distributions that were remarkably consistent between influenza seasons. The only notable exception was 2018/19, where the definitive knowledge of the 2017/18 influenza season had a clear impact on the predictions for 2018/19 leading to broadly higher levels of influenza A and lower levels of influenza B (
