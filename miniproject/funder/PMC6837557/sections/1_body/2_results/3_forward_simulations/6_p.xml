<p>Maintaining a high vaccine efficacy, both influenza types had consistent incidence estimates. Whilst combined influenza B incidence was low, ranging approximately between 600-1700 cases per 100,000 each influenza season, seasonal influenza A incidence frequently reached 25,000-30,000 cases per 100,000. Although we, once more, predict periodic behaviour for the portion of influenza A viruses in circulation ascribed to the subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), under these optimistic vaccine efficacy conditions it was influenza seasons ending in odd numbered years having a relatively even split between the two subtypes; whereas for influenza seasons ending in even numbered years the A(H3N2) subtype dominated A(H1N1)pdm09 (
