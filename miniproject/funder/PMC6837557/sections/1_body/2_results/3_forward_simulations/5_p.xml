<p>The impact of vaccine efficay on projected incidence is further exemplified by the stark contrast in predictions when comparing the pessimistic scenario (A(H1N1)pdm09: 23.00%; A(H3N2): 0.00%; B/Victoria: 24.70%; B/Yamagata: 0.00%) to the optimistic scenario (A(H1N1)pdm09: 73.00%; A(H3N2): 61.00% B/Victoria: 92.00%; B/Yamagata: 92.00%). Under pessimistic vaccine efficacy conditions, both influenza types underwent vast fluctuations in incidence from one influenza season to the next. Type A was more severe in odd numbered years (e.g. 2028/29). Similarly, in even numbered years (e.g. 2029/30) type B incidence exceeded type A incidence. For the pessimistic vaccine efficacy scenario (compared to the other fixed vaccine efficacy scenarios) we also observe the strongest re-emergence of the alternating behaviour between dominant influenza A subtypes (
