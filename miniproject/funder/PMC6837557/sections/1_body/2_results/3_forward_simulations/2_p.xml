<p>When maintaining ‘expected’ vaccine efficacy (A(H1N1)pdm09: 55.25%; A(H3N2): 30.45% B/Victoria: 55.90%; B/Yamagata: 52.60%) across all future influenza seasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007096.g007">Fig 7(a)</xref>, single bars), we witness minor variability in predicted influenza incidence for both influenza types. Total influenza B incidence ranged between 2,700-10,250 cases per 100,000 each influenza season, and seasonal influenza A incidence consistently reached 25,000-40,000 cases per 100,000. Furthermore, we predict periodic behaviour for the portion of influenza A viruses in circulation ascribed to the subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), mirroring the observed pattern from 2012/13 to 2016/17. Influenza seasons ending in even numbered years (e.g. 2029/30) had a relatively even split between the two subtypes; whereas for influenza seasons ending in odd numbered years (e.g. 2028/29) the A(H3N2) subtype dominated the A(H1N1)pdm09, with influenza A viruses apportioned to A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 subtypes being 70-85% and 15-30%, respectively.
