<p>Understanding the processes that drive seasonal influenza transmission patterns is an important public-health question, given the economic cost and burden to human health afflicted by the condition [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During recent years there has been marked progress in synthesising real-world data to inform mathematical model parameterisation. Yet, prior studies have tended to model each influenza season and each strain circulating within that season independently [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, the presence of strain and immunity interactions have been omitted. Using data subsequent to the 2009 pandemic for England, we have developed a dynamic multi-strain SEIR-type transmission model for seasonal influenza, explicitly incorporating immunity propagation mechanisms between influenza seasons. With a view to minimising the number of independent parameters, we fit a parsimonious mechanistic model to seasonal-level data on strain competition. In spite of the multi-strain complexity and time scale of the study period (six influenza seasons), predictions from the model attain a strong qualitative resemblance (in terms of strain composition and overall quantity of GP consultations) to the empirical subtype data from England. We attribute much of the discrepancies to the homogeneous way in which we have treated immunity propagation, as in practise this is driven by complex patterns of waning and cross immunity as well as somewhat irregular genetic drift.
