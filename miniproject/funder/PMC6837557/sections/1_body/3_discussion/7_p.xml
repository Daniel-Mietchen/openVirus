<p>While historic immunity is predicted to play an important role in determining annual strain composition (leading to subtype patterns between influenza seasons), our projections of the dynamics forward in time exemplify how variability in vaccine efficacy hampers our ability to make long-term predictions. Spanning our pessimistic to optimistic vaccine efficacy scenarios, we generally attained a model predicted incidence (per influenza season) of 30-50%. With volunteer challenge studies indicating that the majority of those infected by influenza are asymptomatic [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], our model predicted influenza incidence pairs satisfactorily with previous influenza burden estimates covering England [

Additionally, influenza burden estimates in the USA (provided by the CDC) covering the 2017/18 and 2018/19 influenza seasons ascribe more than 48.8 million and 37.4-42.9 million influenza associated illnesses respectively, which is in the realms of 10-15% of the national population suffering symptomatic infection [
