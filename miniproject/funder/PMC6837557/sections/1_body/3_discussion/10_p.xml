<p>Second, on the basis of model parsimony, within the immunity propagation model component we limited the number of mechanisms linking prior influenza season exposure history to susceptibility in the subsequent influenza season. Though we did include a parameter corresponding to immunity proliferating across influenza B lineages between influenza seasons, we did not include influenza A heterosubtypic immunity amongst the immunity propagation mechanisms. Recent work has found H1 and H3 influenza infection in humans induces neuraminidase-reactive antibodies displaying broad binding activity spanning the entire history of influenza A virus circulation (in humans) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; these developments motivate continued work and data acquisition to elicit the timespan over which cross-reactive antibodies (arising from natural influenza infection) may significantly reduce susceptibility to unrelated influenza A subtypes and influenza B lineages.
