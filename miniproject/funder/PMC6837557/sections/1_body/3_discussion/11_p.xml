<p>Third, we assumed the mechanism underpinning propagation of immunity from influenza vaccination in the previous influenza season behaved linearly. We recognise a linear dependency is a strong generalisation. Given the vaccine-induced protection to an influenza virus strongly depends on the level of mismatch of the strain contained in the vaccine and the circulating strain, a vaccine that is very protective in the current influenza season might be ineffective the following year due to the influenza virus undergoing antigenic mutation. Thus, alternative non-linear formulations for the vaccine-derived immunity propagation process warrant consideration, if there is sufficiently detailed data to underpin the models.</p>
