<p>We view the dynamic influenza transmission model presented here as a foundation stage for influenza modelling constructs incorporating strain and immunity interactions. Heterogeneity in social contact patterns and the role of age in influenza transmission potential and severity of health outcomes are important considerations, with children identified as the main spreaders of influenza infection [

In addition, coupling the transmission model together with economic evaluation frameworks will permit cost-effectiveness appraisals of prospective vaccination programmes.
