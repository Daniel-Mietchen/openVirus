<p>In the case of finding minimal support for carry over cross-reactivity protection between influenza B lineages (parameter 
 <italic>b</italic>), we have reported the best parameter fits under the modelling assumptions made. Considered collectively, the inferred parameter fits signify that, at the population level, a combination of transmissibility rates, season-specific ascertainment probabilities and modifications to susceptibility by lineage-specific immunity propagation (parameter 
 <italic>a</italic>) and within-season vaccination are sufficient to obtain the closest correspondence to the data under the modelling assumptions, without requiring a prominent amount of influenza B cross-reactive immunity propagation. In other words, if there was presence of propagation of protection between influenza B lineages, it was dwarfed by other processes within the biological system. The lack of propagation of cross-reactivity protection between influenza B lineages may be unforeseen, as it has been documented that there is potential for viral interference between the influenza B virus lineages; infection with one influenza B virus lineage may be beneficial in protecting against subsequent infection with either influenza B virus lineage [

However, these experiments (using a ferret model of human influenza) had a short separation between primary and challenge virus infections (at most 28 days), whereas our timescale of interest is of the order of six months (spanning between peak infection in one influenza season to the initiation of the seasonal epidemic in the next influenza season).
