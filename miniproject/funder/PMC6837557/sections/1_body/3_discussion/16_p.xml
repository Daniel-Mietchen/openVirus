<p>In summary, through the use of mathematical modelling and statistical inference, our analysis of seasonal influenza transmission dynamics in England quantifies the contribution of distinct immunity propagation mechanisms. We find that susceptibility in the next influenza season to a given influenza strain type is modulated to the greatest extent through natural infection by that strain type in the current influenza season, with residual vaccine immunity having a lesser role and inconsequential support for carry over type B cross-reactivity. As such, the approach utilised here offers a preliminary basis for long-term influenza modelling constructs incorporating strain and immunity interactions, although forecasts are strongly influenced by vaccine efficacy. We suggest that the adoption of influenza transmission modelling frameworks with immunity propagation mechanisms provides a comprehensive manner to assess the impact of seasonal vaccination programmes.</p>
