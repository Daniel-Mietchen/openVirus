<p>The extent of immunity propagation stemming from earlier influenza infection and vaccination occurrences may conceivably be quantified through serological surveys, potentially the most direct and informative technique available to infer the dynamics of a populationâ€™s susceptibility and level of immunity [

In this fashion, an age-stratified pilot serology study was recently initiated (in England) utilising the RCGP RSC to collect serological specimens and associated patient data to measure seropositivity and seroincidence due to seasonal influenza [
