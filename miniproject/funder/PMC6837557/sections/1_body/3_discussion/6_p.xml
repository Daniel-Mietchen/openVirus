<p>Ascertainment probabilities are key for linking population levels of influenza infection to GP-reported incidence. For greater parsimony we have assumed that ascertainment is independent of subtype, which could be an over-simplification in some years; but allowing ascertainment to depend on both influenza season and subtype would over-fit the model. Across all considered influenza seasons, we found ascertainment probabilities were of a similar order (and concurred with the magnitudes of inferred ascertainment probabilities in [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Chiefly in this instance, for those infected and symptomatic the propensity to consult a GP may have been abnormally raised, which would result in an increased ascertainment probability relative to prior influenza seasons.
