<p>Inferred transmissibility of type A influenza strains exceeded those of type B, which reflects type A being the predominant class of influenza virus in circulation over the studied time period [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, concentrating on the parameters relevant to immunity propagation, we uncover evidence against vaccination stimulating similar long-term immunity responses as for natural infection. These conclusions corroborate previous immunological studies showing that infection with influenza virus can induce broader and longer-lasting protection than vaccination [
