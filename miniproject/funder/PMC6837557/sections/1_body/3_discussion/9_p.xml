<p>The development of the influenza transmission model presented here was built upon a collection of simplifying assumptions. A limitation of the model is fixing the influence of prior exposure history to a single influenza season. Studies of repeated vaccination across multiple influenza seasons suggest that vaccine effectiveness may be influenced by more than one prior influenza season [

Extending exposure history and susceptibility interaction functionality to encompass immunity propagation dependencies beyond one prior influenza season would assist efforts evaluating the potential effect of repeat influenza vaccinations in the presence of vaccine interference [
