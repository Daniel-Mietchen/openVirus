<p>Prior modelling studies have typically treated each influenza season and each strain circulating within that season independently. Though there are instances of model conceptualisations incorporating waning immunity for natural infection and vaccination, these assumed one generic influenza virus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], or treated one or both of the influenza A and influenza B types as sole entities rather than explicitly distinguishing between the two common influenza A subtypes and two co-circulating influenza B lineages [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we present a multi-strain, non-age structured, susceptible-latent-infected-recovered (SEIR) type transmission model for influenza incorporating a mechanism to link prior influenza season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following influenza season. Incorporation of a mechanism for the building and propagation of immunity facilitates investigation of the impact of exposure in the previous influenza season, through natural infection or vaccination, on the disease transmission dynamics and overall disease burden in subsequent years. Accordingly, we sought insights to aid understanding of the longer-term dynamics of the influenza virus and its interaction with immunity at the population level.
