Yet, predictions of vaccine impact are difficult due to stochasticity in the annual strain composition, the potential misalignment between vaccine and the dominant co-circulating strains and the interaction between multiple influenza seasons. Analysis informing the efficient use of limited resources is therefore vital, with the use of quality-assured analytical models advocated [
