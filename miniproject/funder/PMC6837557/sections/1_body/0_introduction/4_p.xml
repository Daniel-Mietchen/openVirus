<p>The previous ten years have seen the fruitful development of influenza transmission models tied to available real-word and experimental data sources [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, combining parameterised transmission models with health economic evaluations permits assessments of changes to vaccination programmes, providing evidence to inform vaccine policy decisions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. An eminent study by Baguelin 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] connected virological data from England and Wales to a deterministic epidemiological model within a Bayesian inference framework. The transmission model was subsequently interfaced with a health economic analysis model, leading to the recommendation of introducing a paediatric seasonal influenza vaccination programme in the United Kingdom [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Subsequent studies have analysed the effect of mass paediatric influenza vaccination on existing influenza vaccination programmes in England and Wales [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], evaluated cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent vaccines versus trivalent vaccines [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and cost effectiveness of high-dose and adjuvanted vaccine options in the elderly [
