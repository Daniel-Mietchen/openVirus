<p>In this study, we examine the contribution of the differing sources of immunity propagation between years on seasonal influenza transmission dynamics. To this end, we amalgamate multiple sources of epidemiological and vaccine data for England covering the last decade, and fit model outcomes to the available longitudinal data of seasonal rates of general practice (GP) consultations for influenza-like-illness (ILI), scaled by virological surveillance information. We demonstrate that natural infection plays a more prominent role in propagation of immunity to the next influenza season compared to residual vaccine immunity. We conclude by inspecting forward projections under disparate vaccine efficacy assumptions to determine long-term patterns of seasonal influenza infection.</p>
