<p>Simulations began in the 2009/2010 influenza season and ran for a specified number of seasons with one parameter set. For the 2009/2010 influenza season, only the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain was present in our simulation (in accordance with the strain composition data where proportions of samples for the remaining three strains were very low,
