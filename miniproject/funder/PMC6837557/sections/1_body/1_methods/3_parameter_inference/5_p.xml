<p>We fit to the 2012/13 influenza season onward, which omitted the influenza seasons (2009/10 and 2011/12) that had no influenza B lineage typing data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007096.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This selected time frame contained a regime in which the dominant circulating influenza A subtype generally switched annually between H1N1(2009) and H3N2, while for type B influenza the Yamagata lineage incidence typically exceeded Victoria lineage incidence.
