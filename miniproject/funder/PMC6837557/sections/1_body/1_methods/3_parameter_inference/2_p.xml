<p>One may notice the ascertainment probabilities were the sole group of parameters that could vary between influenza seasons, and we acknowledge that one may feasibly apply temporal (influenza season) dependencies to the transmission rates and immunity propagation parameters. Nevertheless, despite the integration of additional parameters potentially improving the fit to the data, we would be running the risk of the model containing more parameters than can be justified by the data (overfitting). Instead, our intention was to extract a signal across the considered time frame, if present, identifying the most prominent transmission rates (comparing across the four influenza viruses) and immunity propagation mechanisms.</p>
