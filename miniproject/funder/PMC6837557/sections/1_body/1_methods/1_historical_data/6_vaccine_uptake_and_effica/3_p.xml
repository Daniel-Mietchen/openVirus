<p>There has been substantial variation in vaccine efficacy between influenza seasons and also within influenza seasons across strains, with estimates spanning 23-92% (

Further, there have been two instances of a mismatch between the vaccine and circulating viruses causing the vaccine to be ineffective (i.e. 0% efficacy) against a particular strain group (B/Yamagata in the 2010/11 influenza season, A(H3N2) in the 2017/18 influenza season). As a sole exception, for the 2009/10 influenza season we used the pandemic vaccine to inform efficacy against A(H1N1)pdm09 (rather than the seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy), with the effectiveness against all other strain types set to zero [
