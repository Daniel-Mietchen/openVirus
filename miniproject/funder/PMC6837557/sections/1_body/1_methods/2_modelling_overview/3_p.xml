<p>Following the visualisation convention used in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we display a directed acyclic graph representing the model structure and incorporation of the data streams (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007096.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The model takes the form of a deterministic continuous-time set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which determines the within-season epidemiological dynamics, and a discrete-time map, informing the propagation of immunity from one influenza season to the next.
