<p>A novel aspect of our model framework was the potential for exposure to influenza virus in the previous influenza season, through natural infection or vaccination, to modulate current influenza season susceptibility. Accordingly, we tracked immunity derived from natural infection and vaccination separately (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007096.g002">Fig 2</xref>, process A), requiring ten distinct exposure history groupings. Three susceptibility modifying factors of interest were: (i) modified susceptibility to strain 
 <italic>m</italic> given infection by a strain 
 <italic>m</italic> type virus the previous influenza season, denoted 
 <italic>a</italic>; (ii) carry over cross-reactivity protection between influenza B lineages, denoted 
 <italic>b</italic> (to account for infection with one influenza B virus lineage being potentially beneficial in protecting against subsequent infection with either influenza B virus lineage [
