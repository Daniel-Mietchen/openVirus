<p>In the model extension, we fit an additional parameter (
 <italic>δ</italic>) representing the proportion of those who began the influenza season in an exposure history group linked to natural infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007096.g003">Fig 3</xref>: rows 2-5, 7-10), and who were also unexposed to influenza virus during the current season (who at the end of the current influenza season remained susceptible), that retained their pre-existing natural infection acquired immunity. Those keeping immunity arising from natural infection were mapped to the relevant prior infection exposure history group dependent upon current influenza season vaccination status. The remaining proportion (1 − 
 <italic>δ</italic>) transitioned in the same manner as in the original model, reverting to either the naive exposure history group or vaccinated only exposure history group (Fig. T in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007096.s001">S1 Text</xref>). For clarity, we did not introduce a mechanism to confer vaccine-induced immunity beyond one influenza season (i.e. vaccine-induced immunity could be retained for, at most, a single additional influenza season).
