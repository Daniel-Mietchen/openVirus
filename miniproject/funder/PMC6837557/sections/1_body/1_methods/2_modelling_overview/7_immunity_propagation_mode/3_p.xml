<p>On a related note, we applied a further assumption in order to parameterise susceptibility values amongst exposure groups capturing those both vaccinated and naturally infected in the prior influenza season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007096.g003">Fig 3</xref>: rows 7-10). For this collection of exposure histories, susceptibility to a subset of strains may conceivably be collectively modified via natural infection and vaccination immunity propagation pathways. In these instances, we treated the immunity propagation mechanisms independently, with the modified susceptibility set by the dominant immunity propagation entity (i.e. min(
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>), min(
 <italic>b</italic>, 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>)). In other words, we took a pessimistic stance by assuming no boosting of the immunity propagation response as a result of dual influenza virus exposure (from both natural infection and vaccination).
