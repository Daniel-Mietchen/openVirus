<p>Our model captures the four strains targeted by the quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, namely, two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), and two influenza B lineages, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata. The multi-strain model construction permits exploration of cross-reactive immunity mechanisms and their impact on the disease dynamics. Multiple infections per influenza season and/or co-infection events were not permitted. In other words, it was presumed that individuals may only be infected by one strain of influenza virus per influenza season, analogous to natural infection eliciting short-term cross immunity to all other strain types [
