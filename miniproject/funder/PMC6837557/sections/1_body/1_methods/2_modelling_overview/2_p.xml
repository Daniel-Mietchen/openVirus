<p>Influenza transmission dynamics are highly complex, with many temporal and structural heterogeneities that will influence the precise pattern of recorded infection. Consequently, our aim was to capture the general trends in the data, such as the pattern of high and low infection levels, rather than the precise values for each influenza season. We, therefore, deliberately chose a parsimonious mechanistic modelling framework, without age-structure, to highlight the impact of immunity propagation.</p>
