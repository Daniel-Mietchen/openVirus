<p>We assumed a ‘leaky’ vaccine, offering partial protection to every vaccinated individual, thus acting to reduce the overall susceptibility of the given group receiving vaccination. The ‘leaky’ vaccine action contrasts with an ‘all-or-nothing’ vaccine assumption, which assumes complete protection to a subset of the vaccinated individuals but no protection in the remainder of vaccinated individuals [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Explicitly, under a ‘leaky’ vaccine action with a vaccine efficacy against strain 
 <italic>m</italic> of 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>, the relative susceptibility of the vaccinated group towards strain 
 <italic>m</italic> is 1 − 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>. Additionally, we assumed those administered vaccines had unmodified transmission (i.e. for those infected, those receiving the ‘leaky’ vaccine were equally as infectious as those who did not). Vaccination is modelled irrespective of infection status (susceptible, latent, infected and recovered individuals), as vaccine history impacts the immunity levels in the next influenza season.
