<p>Epidemiological states were compartmentalised based on present influenza season vaccine status (indexed by 
 <italic>N</italic> for non-vaccinated or 
 <italic>V</italic> for vaccinated). We obtained weekly time-varying vaccine uptake rates, 
 <italic>ν</italic>, at the population level by computing a weighted average of the individual age group uptake values, thereby accounting for the population distribution in each given influenza season. We assumed the rate of vaccination 
 <italic>ν</italic> to be constant over each weekly period. Vaccine efficacy depended upon the extent to which the strains in the vaccine matched the circulating strain in that influenza season (
