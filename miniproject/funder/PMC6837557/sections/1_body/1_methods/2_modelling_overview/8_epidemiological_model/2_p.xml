<p>The epidemiological model is a deterministic, non-age, multi-strain structured compartmental based model capturing demography, influenza infection status (with susceptible-latent-infected-recovered, SEIR, dynamics) and vaccine uptake. For influenza, it is commonplace to also consider a risk-stratified population, divided into individuals at low or high risk of complications associated with influenza. However, it is health outcomes, rather than epidemiological processes, that are contingent upon risk status [
