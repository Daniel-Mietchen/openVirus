<p>We used the parameter set returning the lowest error (in the inference procedure) to explore potential strain dynamics up to the 2029/30 influenza season. Vaccination attributes (uptake and efficacy) for the 2009/10 to 2017/18 influenza seasons were taken from the observed data. For the forecasted seasons (2018/19 influenza season to the end of each simulation), we studied four scenarios arising from different hypotheses concerning future vaccine efficacy: (i) randomly sampled from all previous vaccine efficacy values (1,000 simulation replicates); (ii) ‘expected’ scenario (single simulation), strain-specific vaccine efficacies set at the median attained efficacy across 2010/11-2017/18 seasonal influenza vaccines (note, efficacy estimates from 2009/10 influenza season were not included as for 2009/10 we used pandemic influenza vaccine efficacy estimates); (iii) pessimistic scenario (single simulation), strain-specific vaccine efficacies set at the minimum attained efficacy across 2010/11-2017/18 seasonal influenza vaccines; and (iv) optimistic scenario (single simulation), strain-specific vaccine efficacies set at the maximum attained efficacy across 2010/11-2017/18 seasonal influenza vaccines. In addition, vaccine uptake in all projected influenza seasons matched that of the 2017/18 influenza season.</p>
