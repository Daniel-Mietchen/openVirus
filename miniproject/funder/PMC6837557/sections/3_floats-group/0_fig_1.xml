  <title>Empirical, strain-stratified data for ILI GP consultations attributable to influenza per 100,000 population.</title>
  <p>In both panels, stacked horizontal bars in the left-half depict the cumulative total of ILI GP consultations attributable to type A influenza per 100,000 population (red shading denoting the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype, orange shading the A(H3N2) subtype). In the right-half of each panel stacked horizontal bars present similar data for type B influenza (cyan shading denoting the B/Victoria lineage, dark blue shading the B/Yamagata lineage). 
   <bold>(a)</bold> Influenza seasons 2009/10 to 2017/18 (inclusive). In the 2009/10 and 2011/12 influenza seasons, all samples identified as influenza B were untyped (represented by black filled bars). 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Influenza seasons 2012/13 to 2017/18 (inclusive), the time span for which we performed parameter inference.
