  <title>Results of the ABC scheme, fitting to the empirical data.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(a)</bold> Summary metric threshold value upon completion of each generation of the inference scheme. The inset panel displays the latter quarter of generations. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Inferred parameter distributions estimated from 10,000 retained samples following completion of 600 generations of the inference scheme. Vertical red lines indicate the (non-weighted) median values for the model constants estimated from the inference procedure. Particularly noteworthy outcomes include: transmissibility of type A viruses exceeding type B viruses; prior season influenza B cross-reactivity and vaccine carry over had little impact on present season susceptibility; the highest ascertainment probability occurred in the 2017/18 influenza season.
