  <title>Schematic showing the links between the vaccination, immunity propagation, epidemiological and observation model components.</title>
  <p>We adopt the visualisation conventions of [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007096.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with ellipses indicating variables, and rectangles indicating data. Dotted arrows indicate relationships between prior influenza season epidemiological outcomes and immunity propagation factors. Solid arrows indicate within-season processes. Circled capitalised letters indicate the relationships connecting the variables or data involved. These relationships are: process A, propagation of immunity as a result of exposure to influenza virus in the previous influenza season (through natural infection or vaccination); process B, modulation of current influenza season virus susceptibility; process C, estimation of influenza case load via the SEIR model of transmission; process D, ascertainment of cases through ILI recording at GP.
