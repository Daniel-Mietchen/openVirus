<p>Reporting-based failures constitute a major factor in the occurrence of autochthonous transmission. A delay in case identification has already been indicated as a contributing factor in contexts of extended viral circulation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and remains the most important factor for the occurrence of foci of limited transmission. Our current findings are consistent with our previous work based on a mechanistic approach [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Reporting delay is the combination of two elements: (1) how promptly the case-patient seeks medical care and (2) how responsive surveillance partners (e.g., medical analysis laboratories, hospitals, general practitioners, etc.) are in reporting cases. Any action which can positively impact one or the other of these two elements can contribute to the improvement of the arbovirosis surveillance system. Examples of such actions include the continuing effort to raise awareness of this surveillance system in healthcare professionals, the ongoing endeavour to consolidate a robust network of reporting diagnostic laboratories [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and raising patient awareness of the importance of seeking medical consultation for non-specific febrile syndromes. The latter action however is more challenging as it is covers both the promotion of travel health consultation—which is not sought by the majority of tourists visiting at risk areas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]—and the information provided to travellers in key locations such as airports. One avenue for research in this area would be to study whether socioeconomic determinants can explain delay or absence in seeking consultation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], with a view to implementing targeted awareness-raising actions. Moreover, the surveillance system does not allow for the exhaustive detection of all imported viremic infections because of the existence of subclinical infections which are able to infect mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and which may constitute the source of autochthonous transmission. This may partly explain why, for several autochthonous transmission events studied in France to date, a primary case could not be identified despite reinforced surveillance which carried out door-to-door surveys to identify cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Preparing for such a contingency (i.e., lack of primary case identification because of subclinical infections) requires maintaining a high level of vigilance so that any autochthonous transmission event can be promptly detected. Moreover, reducing the risk of transmission implies keeping vector populations as low as possible through encouraging the general public to reduce mosquito breeding sites, as larval control remains the main sustainable measure of prevention and control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To a lesser extent, meteorological and environmental factors are associated with autochthonous transmission. The influence of temperature and consequently, the value of using Growing Degree Days (GDD) to describe vector population dynamics has already been reported in different European settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the present work constitutes the first time that this indicator has been used together with epidemiological data. GDD can be considered a proxy of the vector population density and reflects the importance of this parameter for estimating transmission risk. The presence of wooded areas is a landscape factor that could explain a favourable environment for

It is important to highlight that such areas were associated with anthropization in the present work, since they were located in the vicinity of the places where cases stayed. These green areas, or vegetated areas, are located either inside or are in direct proximity to peri-urban and residential areas which are known to provide suitable conditions for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> proliferation. Numerous rainwater collection containers dedicated to gardening are present and represent the most productive breeding sites for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in temperate settings. Moreover, vegetation cover maintains relative humidity and provides shelter for adult mosquitoes to rest. Plant residues constitute a major food resource for mosquito larvae [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and plant sugars are needed as an energy source for both male and female mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Finally, the presence of gardens, terraces and other green areas promotes outdoor living and therefore greater human exposure to the exophilic species that is
