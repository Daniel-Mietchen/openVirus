<p>Social, surveillance, environmental and meteorological data were missing for some observations as no imported cases were identified for four events of autochthonous dengue transmission (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Two of these four events led to more than one autochthonous case. For these clusters, a likely place of transmission was identified and the associated focal point of transmission consequently set at the centre of the transmission area. This hypothesis seems reasonable since all clusters occurred in an area with a radius of less than 300 meters. For events with only one autochthonous case, two scenarios were formulated, the first (Sc1) at the residence of the autochthonous case, while the second (Sc2) considered the absence of georeferenced information. For meteorological data, the time of introduction was set at 30 days prior to the date of symptoms onset of the first autochthonous case. This period was chosen as it is the mean time interval between the occurrence of the first autochthonous case for the five dengue transmission events for which an imported index case was identified and the date of return of imported primary dengue cases (n = 5, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We only relied on dengue cases as this situation (i.e., a single autochthonous case in the absence of any identified imported case) only occurred for dengue.
