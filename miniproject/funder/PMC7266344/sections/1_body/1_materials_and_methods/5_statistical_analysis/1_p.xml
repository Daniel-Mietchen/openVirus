<p>To identify factors associated with the emergence of autochthonous transmission events of DENV and CHIKV in mainland France, we based our analysis on all imported cases identified by the national surveillance system within the study area during the study period. For every imported case, we considered each place where the case was present for at least an hour during viremia as an observation. This implies that a single notified case could result in more than one observation, depending upon the caseâ€™s movements and the number of places where the case stayed during the infectious period. Only observations in localities known to be colonized by

 <italic>albopictus</italic> during stays of notified cases were included.
