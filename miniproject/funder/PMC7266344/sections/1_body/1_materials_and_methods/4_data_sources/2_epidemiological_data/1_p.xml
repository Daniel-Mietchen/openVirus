<p>Dengue and chikungunya case data were obtained through the national surveillance system for arbovirosis, which comprises active human surveillance based on the reporting of suspected cases of dengue and/or chikungunya to public health authorities, followed by timely biological diagnosis. The human surveillance system was previously described by Paty and coll. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Only confirmed or probable imported cases were included in the present analysis. We used the earliest date of presence of the case during viremia (EDP) in the study area to calculate the different delays (i.e., sampling, reporting, etc.). EDP could be either the date of symptom onset or the return date from travel (in the case of symptom onset outside the study area). The sampling delay was defined as the period of time between EDP and the first date of blood sampling for biological testing. The reporting delay was defined as the period of time between EDP and the moment health authorities received report of the case. The exposure duration was defined as the time interval between EDP and the end of viremia of the imported case. Imported cases arriving in the study area 7 days or more after the date of symptom onset were excluded since they were considered to be no longer viremic.
