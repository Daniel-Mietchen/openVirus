<p>Normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVI) were derived from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellite imagery data (level 2A) processed by the THEIA Land Data Centre. For each georeferenced observation, an image was selected for NDVI calculation, with the image shooting date as close as possible to the date of symptom onset of the case and with cloud cover less than 10%. Mean NDVI were calculated within buffers of 300m around each geo-located observation.</p>
