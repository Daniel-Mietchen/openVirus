<p>The RD of imported cases was the factor with the greatest explained deviance: between 48.9 and 52.8% according to the chosen scenario (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008320.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The proportion of variance explained was of the same order of magnitude for meteorological and land cover variables with values between 10 and 15% according to the specific model and scenario. Results of Sc1 and Sc2 were very similar. However, the sectoral analysis showed that explanatory variables related to land use were more sensitive to a lack of observations. For meteorological variables, no major difference was observed between the two constructions of GDD (i.e., at EDP and 10 days after EDP).
