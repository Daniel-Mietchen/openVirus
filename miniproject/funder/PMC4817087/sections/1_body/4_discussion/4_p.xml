<p>Our study is one of few large and detailed assessments of active HCV infection among HIV-infected populations in SSA. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform both screening tests in all patients. Furthermore, the presence of injection drug use might have been underreported because patients might have felt uncomfortable disclosing this information. Sampling bias, a potential explanation for the low prevalence of HCV infection in our study setting, seemed unlikely because we included consecutive ART-eligible patients at primary care outpatient clinics. Finally, due to the low number of confirmed HCV infections, we were unable to identify related risk factors in our cohort.</p>
