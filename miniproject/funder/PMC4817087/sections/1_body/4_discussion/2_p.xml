<p>Although numerous studies have shown a relatively high prevalence of positive anti-HCV serology results in HIV-infected populations, several recent reports underlined the very low prevalence of confirmed, chronic HCV infection in Southern and East Africa. Similar to our study, the prevalence of replicating HCV infection was below 1% in a large clinical trial in Malawi and in an observational cohort in Uganda [

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the gap between the prevalence of anti-HCV antibody and RNA-positivity, including cross-reactions of HCV serological assays to auto-antibodies or antibodies produced in the context of the polyclonal B-cell activation triggered by other infections [

 <xref rid="OFW049C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="OFW049C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Of note, 1 patient in our study population had a negative Oraquick, a positive ELISA, and a first viral load of 50 IU/mL. However, HCV viral load was not detectable in a second measurement, which argues for a false-positive ELISA and a contamination during the first HCV amplification procedure.
