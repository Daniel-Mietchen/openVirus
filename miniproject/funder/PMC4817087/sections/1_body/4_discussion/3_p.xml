<p>Although HCV transmission patterns have been widely described in high-income countries, few data are available from the African continent. Because injection drug use is uncommon in many African countries, and no report has yet shown HCV epidemics in men who have sex with men in SSA, most HCV transmissions are thought to occur through the vertical or percutaneous routes [

 <xref rid="OFW049C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], molecular clock analyses showed that medical interventions before 1960, and to a lesser extent traditional practices, were linked to the transmission of HCV [
 <xref rid="OFW049C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such associations have not been described in southern Africa to date. In our study, HCV coinfection was very rare even though most patients had 1 or more potential risk factors such as tattoos, scarifications, and piercings. These results contrast with those of a recent report from Ghana, where Layden et al [
 <xref rid="OFW049C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that confirmed HCV infection was present in at least 74% of those with a positive antibody test and that the most important risk factors included traditional scarring and circumcision. Thus, despite the widespread presence of traditional risk factors for blood-borne infections across the continent, the prevalence of HCV infection in the general population seems to differ widely across regions, being generally higher in parts of Central and West Africa compared with East and Southern Africa. The main reasons for these epidemiological trends, including the near absence of HCV infection in the 2 countries included in our study, remain unclear.
