<p>Among individuals infected with HIV in 2 southern African cohorts, HCV seroprevalence ranged from 0.1% to 2.5% depending on the antibody test used. However, no active HCV infections were observed despite the presence of traditional risk factors for percutaneous transmission of blood-borne infections in a majority of patients. These data underscore the importance of confirming active HCV infection and challenge the recommendation to scale up HCV screening for all individuals infected with HIV in the region.</p>
