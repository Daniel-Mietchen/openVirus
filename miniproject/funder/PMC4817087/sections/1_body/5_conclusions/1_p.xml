<p>Due to the limitations of anti-HCV assays, illustrated in our study by the 2.5% prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies with the ELISA test, and until Oraquick and other similar tests have been validated in the setting of HIV-HCV coinfection in SSA, epidemiological estimates of HCV prevalence should be confirmed by the detection of HCV RNA. Resources to screen for and treat HCV are limited in most SSA settings; therefore, national governments should assess local epidemiological data before implementing HCV testing in all individuals infected with HIV.</p>
