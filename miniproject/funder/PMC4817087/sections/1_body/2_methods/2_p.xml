<p>All patients were screened for anti-HCV antibodies using the oral Oraquick point-of-care test (OraSure Technologies Inc., Bethlehem, PA), which is known to have good diagnostic accuracy in individuals infected with HIV [
 <xref rid="OFW049C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a random selection of 118 patients in Lusaka, we performed a second screening test on serum samples using an anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay (Access 2 Analyzer, Beckman Coulter). Blood was collected in serum separator tubes, centrifuged within 6 hours, and serum was aliquoted into 2 mL microtainer tubes for storage at −80°C until the date of testing. All patients with a positive antibody test were retested with Oraquick in whole blood via finger-prick sampling. A confirmation quantitative HCV-RNA test (Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Test) was performed in all patients with any positive antibody screening test result. All tests were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
