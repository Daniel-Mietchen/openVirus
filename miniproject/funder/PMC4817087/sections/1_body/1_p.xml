<p>Based on anti-HCV antibody prevalence estimates, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HCV screening of all risk groups, including HIV-infected populations [
 <xref rid="OFW049C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Due to the high rates of false-positive HCV serological tests reported from SSA, this costly strategy may not prove universally efficient. In order to inform the implementation of HCV-testing guidelines, more data on the prevalence of replicating HCV infections in SSA are needed. We screened antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV-infected individuals in large outpatient clinics in Zambia and Mozambique for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies, confirmed results with HCV viral load testing, and examined potential risk factors for blood-borne infections.
