<p>In total, 1812 individuals infected with HIV were included in the study (Mozambique, n = 1057; Zambia, n = 755). Median age was 32 years (IQR, 26–39) and 65.5% were female. Median pre-ART CD4 count was 255 cells/µL (IQR, 133–370), and 37.8% of patients had WHO stage 3 or 4 HIV diseases. Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="OFW049TB1">1</xref> describes the main demographic characteristics of the study populations and potential risk factors for blood-borne infections, by country. In both countries, traditional risk factors for blood-borne infections were very common: over 50% of the study population had a history of body piercing, whereas tattoos or traditional scarification were observed in 85% of Zambians and 93% of Mozambicans. However, the proportion of participants who had a history of blood transfusions was low in both countries. No history of past or present injection drug use was reported in any of the clinics.
