<p>In Mozambique, zero of 1057 patients tested had a positive anti-HCV Oraquick test. Among 755 HIV-infected Zambians screened, 1 was identified as positive using the Oraquick test, resulting in a seroprevalence of 0.13% (95% CI, .02â€“.94). The only patient with a positive test had a negative HCV-RNA confirmation test (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFW049F1">1</xref>). Among the 118 patients in Zambia who underwent a second screening test based on the ELISA assay, 3 were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. Two of them had a negative HCV viral load, and 1 had a first HCV viral load of 50 IU/mL but a negative result in a second sample. Thus, in the sample of patients tested with both screening assays, anti-HCV antibody seroprevalence was 2.5%. Oraquick was repeated in the serum of the 4 patients with any positive antibody test and confirmed the result from the oral test in all of them.
