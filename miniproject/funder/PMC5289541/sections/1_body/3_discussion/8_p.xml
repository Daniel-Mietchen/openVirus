<p>In conclusion, this work has reported the existence of a large and fast expanding HIV-1 transmission cluster affecting newly diagnosed MSM in the city of Valencia. Given that factors such as high-risk sexual behaviors and unawareness of HIV status may hamper the control of the HIV epidemic in MSM, it is necessary to reinforce the campaigns for HIV prevention, such as condom distribution programs and HIV testing in the Valencian MSM community. The results obtained also stress the importance and interest of implementing surveillance strategies that use viral sequencing information derived from the genotypic analysis of resistance mutations in HIV-infected patients.</p>
