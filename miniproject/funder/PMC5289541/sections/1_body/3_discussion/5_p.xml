<p>Usually, the analysis of transmission clusters is performed after removing major resistance-associated positions from the multiple alignment, in order to prevent spurious clusters resulting from convergent evolution. In this work, these positions were not removed in the identification and characterization of the CV-cluster because most of the sequences included in the analyses derive from treatment-na√Øve patients. Specifically, none of the 143 patients clustering in the initial group was reported to be or have been under antiretroviral treatment. Furthermore, only two sequences in the CV-cluster presented major resistance mutations. For this reason, we can discard artifactual clustering as a possible explanation for the identification of this cluster.</p>
