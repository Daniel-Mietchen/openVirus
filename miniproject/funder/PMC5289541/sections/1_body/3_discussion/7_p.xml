<p>The phylogenetic analysis of sequences obtained during routine evaluation of resistance mutations for antiretroviral drugs can provide crucial information about the detailed local, regional and global HIV epidemics [

The identification of transmission clusters is just one of the many possible benefits of the molecular surveillance of infectious diseases, particularly HIV, in which traditional epidemiological analysis based on contact tracing or direct interviews with newly diagnosed individuals are hampered by social and personal attitudes, resulting in lack of useful information for further prevention. This cluster, which was not noticed by local or regional public health officials, was detected and characterized from basic patient information, completely anonymous for the researchers. It also illustrates the need to enhance prevention and information campaigns in a specific risk group.
