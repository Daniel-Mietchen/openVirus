<p>The criteria used for defining transmission clusters vary among studies, with many of them combining high phylogenetic support with genetic distance thresholds. Although in this work we did not consider large pairwise genetic distances as an exclusion criterion, the distribution of pairwise genetic distances obtained fell within the inclusion criteria of most studies [
