<p>This transmission cluster started its expansion in the city of Valencia around 2001, five years after the introduction of HAART. However, most infections appear to have occurred after 2010, accounting for more than 12% of the HIV-1 subtype B sequences sampled in Valencia since then. This dynamic parallels the increase of HIV diagnosis among MSM in Europe in the last few years [

The transmission efficiency of this HIV-1 lineage in the Valencia population, whose growth rate had not reached a steady state by 2014 (last year in our sampling), reveals shortcomings in the HIV control measures in Spain, and particularly in the CV, at least for some specific, vulnerable groups such as MSM.
