<p>In order to assess the presence of resistance-associated mutations, 1806 PR/RT sequences were obtained from different newly HIV diagnosed people at seven different hospitals and two HIV counseling and testing centers (CIPS) from the three provinces in the CV between 2004 and 2014: six hospitals (Hospital Clínico de Valencia, Hospital General de Valencia, Hospital Universitario Doctor Peset, Hospital de Manises, Hospital La Ribera, Hospital Francesc de Borja) and one CIPS in Valencia, one CIPS in Alicante and one hospital (Hospital General de Castellón) in Castellón) (

The sequences comprised the complete PR and the first 1005 nucleotides (335 amino acids) of the RT (1302 nt in total), and were obtained through viral RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR and direct sequencing using amplification and procedures described previously [

 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] under the GTR + Γ (4 CAT) model, which included 169 reference sequences downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV Database (LANL;

Only those sequences classified as subtype B were considered in subsequent analyses. Nucleotide alignments were obtained with MAFFT version 7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This analysis was part of the surveillance program of communicable diseases by the General Directorate of Public Health of the Comunidad Valenciana and, as such, falls outside the mandate of the corresponding Ethics Committee for Biomedical Research. All personal information was anonymized and no data allowing individual identification was retained.
