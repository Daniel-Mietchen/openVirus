<p>An initial HIV-1 B phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with FastTree2.1, using the GTR + Γ (4 CAT) model. In addition to the 1514 HIV-1 subtype B sequences from the CV, 133 non-B reference sequences and 1787 HIV-1 subtype B sequences were downloaded from LANL and were included in this analysis. In this tree, a large and highly supported cluster of 143 sequences from the CV was found and further analyzed, given its potential interest within the local epidemic occurring in the CV. A BLAST search for the 100 sequences deposited in GenBank with the highest similarity to each of the sequences in the cluster was performed in October, 2015. This resulted in a non-redundant dataset of 587 BLAST-derived sequences which, along with those from the proposed transmission cluster, 6 subtype B references and 40 additional Spanish sequences (kindly provided by Dr. JC Galán and Dr. M Thomson), were used to reconstruct a maximum-likelihood (ML) tree with PhyML [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The resulting tree was used to confirm that these sequences conformed a true transmission cluster (defined as a group of epidemiologically related sequences which share a common, recent ancestor; [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], excluding those sequences that were more closely related to those from the BLAST search or additional controls but falling outside the CV clade. Consequently, the criterion used to confirm and delimitate the potential transmission cluster was finding a clade in which more than 90% of its sequences were from the CV and grouped with aLRT support ≥ 0.99.
