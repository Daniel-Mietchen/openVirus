<p>The most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the transmission cluster was dated by means of Bayesian coalescent analysis as implemented in BEAST 1.8.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All the 143 sequences from the CV were included in the analysis. For the coalescence analysis, a GTR
 <sub>112</sub> + CP
 <sub>112</sub> + Γ
 <sub>112</sub> (4 CAT) evolutionary model was used and combined with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model and three different demographic models (Bayesian Skyline Plot, and exponential or logistic demographic change). The best demographic model was chosen using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICM, [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). For each demographic model, two independent runs of Bayesian MCMC, with chain lengths of at least 30 million states were performed, and sampled regularly every 3000 generations. These runs were then combined after discarding 10% as burn-in. The evolutionary parameters were estimated from an effective sampling size &gt;200. Trees generated were then summarized using TreeAnnotator (
