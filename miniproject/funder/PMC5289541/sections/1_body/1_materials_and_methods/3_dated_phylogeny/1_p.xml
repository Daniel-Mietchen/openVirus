We used as input the subtree that included the 143 sequences potentially belonging to the CV transmission cluster, as extracted from the HIV-1 subtype B tree obtained with FastTree. All the 143 sequences from the CV that grouped initially were included in the analysis. The multiple alignment, including time of sampling information, is available in the
