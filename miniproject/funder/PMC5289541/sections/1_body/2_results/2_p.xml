<p>The ML tree is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171062.g003">Fig 3</xref> and it revealed that 111 of the 143 sequences from the CV initially detected as a potential transmission cluster retained monophyly with very high statistical support (approximate Likelihood-Ratio Test, aLRT = 0.99). This reduced cluster, including those 111 sequences, will be referred to as “CV-cluster”. More specifically, the CV-cluster included 105 sequences from patients living in the city of Valencia and its metropolitan area and 6 from patients living in other localities from the CV. Only 2 sequences sampled in other Spanish cities outside the CV were included in this cluster, thus giving a total size for the CV-cluster of 113 patients.
