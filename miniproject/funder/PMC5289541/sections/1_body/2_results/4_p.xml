<p>The 111 Valencian sequences from the CV-cluster were sampled between 2006 and 2014, and 105 of them were sampled from 2010 onwards. Considering only those HIV-1 subtype B sequences from the city of Valencia (n = 1134), the transmission cluster accounted for 1.46% of all HIV-1 subtype B sequences sampled in this city between 2004 and 2009 (n = 5/343) but they represented 12.64% of the samples obtained between 2010 and 2014 (n = 100/791) (
