<p>The clock-like signal present in the analyzed dataset (n = 143) was evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficient (R) between the root-to-tip divergence and sampling date, obtaining an R value equal to 0.61, which was considered high enough as to proceed to estimating the Bayesian dated phylogenies with BEAST [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The exponential demographic model, combined with a lognormal relaxed molecular clock yielded the lowest AICM value. The Bayesian coalescent analysis performed under such model estimated the tMRCA of the CV-cluster to have occurred in 2001 (95% HPD = 1998–2004) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171062.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The median of the internal branch lengths in the Bayesian tree for the CV-cluster was 0.68 years (95% CI = 0.14–3.08). The demographic reconstruction of the CV-cluster shows no indication of deceleration in its growth rate until 2014, the last year of sampling (
