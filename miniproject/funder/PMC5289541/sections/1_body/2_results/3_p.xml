<p>Compared to the full dataset of HIV-1B sequences, the transmission cluster included a disproportionally large number of men [Fisher’s exact test, FET: odds-ratio (OR) = 7.41 (95% CI: 1.94–62.95), P &lt; 0.001], and MSM compared to HTs [FET: OR = 5.63 (1.80–28.40), P &lt; 0.001]. Geographically, the transmission cluster included a very large number of sequences of persons living in the city of Valencia and surroundings compared to other localities [OR = 4.74 (2.29–11.38), P&lt;0.001,
