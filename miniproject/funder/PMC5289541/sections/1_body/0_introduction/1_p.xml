<p>Contrarily to intravenous drug users (IDUs) and heterosexual people (HT), the number of new HIV diagnosis among MSM in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) has increased in the last years [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This trend is evident in the particular case of Spain, were IDU was consider the main transmission risk during the late 90s. However, in 2013, 51.2% of the 3278 new HIV diagnoses reported in this country occurred among MSMs [

 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One of the factors contributing to this resurgence of HIV infections is the continued increase in unprotected anal sex among MSM that occurs since the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in 1996 [

 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Molecular epidemiology analyses have revealed the vulnerability of MSM to HIV infection in different ways, such as the frequent detection of transmission clusters affecting this risk group [

 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and the estimation of shorter times between infections compared to those of HTs and IDUs [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Spain, MSMs have been associated with significantly higher levels of local clustering than other risk groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Also, Delgado et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0171062.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] recently detected a large HIV-1 subtype F cluster affecting tens of MSM from different Spanish regions, indicating a fast and uncontrolled transmission among recently infected MSM who were unaware of their HIV status.
