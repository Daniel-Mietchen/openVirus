 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figure 3</xref> shows the distribution of epidemic regions caused by FMD serotypes A (
 <italic>n</italic> = 25) and O (
 <italic>n</italic> = 40), and the standard deviational ellipses. The attributed values for the standard deviational ellipse are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3">Table 3</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>, the distribution of FMD serotypes A and O presented a directional trend and the angular rotations were 101.96° (northwest-southeast) and 100.33° (northwest-southeast). The geographic scope of FMD serotype O was larger than FMD serotype A.
