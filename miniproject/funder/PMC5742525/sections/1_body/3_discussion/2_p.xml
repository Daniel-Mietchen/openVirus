<p>At present, the prevention and control policy that is being implemented in China involves a combination of immunization and culling, and to a large extent the immunity generated by vaccination has effectively prevented and controlled the disease. The FMD vaccines currently used in China mainly include inactivated vaccines and synthetic peptide vaccines. Vaccines developed in China include the swine FMD serotype O Myanmar 98 vaccine (strain Mya 98), the swine FMD serotype O inactivated vaccines (strain OGX09-7 + strain OXJ10-11), and the FMD serotypes A ,O and Asia 1 trivalent inactivated vaccine (strain O/MYA98/BY/2010 + strain Asia 1/JSL/ZK/06 + strain ReA/WH/09). These vaccines are industrially produced and applied in the field (

After years of efforts, the prevention and control of FMD in China has largely succeeded. However, due to the existence of FMDV of mixed genetic lineages and different serotypes, the severe and complicated FMD epidemics of neighboring countries, and the increased risk of cross-border importation of epidemic strains, the goal of complete FMD prevention and control in China can currently not be guaranteed.
