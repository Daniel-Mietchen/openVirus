<p>Directional distribution analysis is commonly used to explore whether epidemic transmission of a disease shows a directional trend (

According to our study, FMD serotypes A and O cases in China showed an obvious distributional trend from 2010 to 2016, and the direction was northwest-southeast. The observed directional distribution of FMD may be related to the transportation of animals from breeding areas. According to the reference laboratory analysis, the FMD serotypes A and O cases that occurred in the Tibet area in 2013 were all distributed along the main traffic highway (

It is also a reminder that the restriction of animal transportation from FMD affected and high risk areas must be strengthened. It is well known that biological, ecological, and meteorological factors can affect the emergence of infectious diseases (

Thus, meteorological conditions may also influence the transmission of FMDV. The specific factors that explain this pattern of directional transmission need to be further investigated.
