<p>Spatial autocorrelation has been widely used in epidemic studies (

 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Moore &amp; Carpenter, 1999</xref>). During the time period studied in this report (years 2010–2016), the distribution of FMD serotypes A and O cases showed a random pattern when the study area was considered as a whole. And, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3</xref>, the diffusion of these cases was saltatory. It is likely that this distribution pattern was caused by the inter-provincial transport of animals. Although the global spatial autocorrelation of FMD cases from 2010 to 2016 did not show clustering, the local spatial autocorrelation analysis did show significant clustering in several years. Clusters of cases that occur randomly also affect the spread of an infectious disease (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Jeefoo, Tripathi &amp; Souris, 2011</xref>). FMD serotype A cases significantly clustered in Tibet and Xinjiang provinces in 2013 and 2014 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and no local spatial autocorrelation was detected in 2015. FMD serotype O cases significantly clustered in the Xinjiang province in 2010, in Tibet and Xinjiang provinces in 2011, and in Tibet, Xinjiang and Qinghai provinces in 2013 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and no local spatial autocorrelation was detected in 2015. The FMD hotspots concentrated in three provinces (Tibet, Xinjiang and Qinghai) in western China. It is strongly recommended that the government strengthens the prevention and control measures in these hotspots regions, and the export of animals and livestock products should be strictly limited.
