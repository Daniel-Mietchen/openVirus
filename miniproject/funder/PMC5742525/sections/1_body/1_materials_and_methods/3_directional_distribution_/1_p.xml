<p>Directional distribution analysis is most often used to determine whether the distribution of a disease shows a directional trend and to visualize the major areas infected. To analyze directional distribution, standard deviational ellipse was used. This method has been widely applied to study epidemics of infectious diseases (

 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al., 2008</xref>). This method generates elliptical polygons by calculating the standard distance of a group of points in both the 
 <italic>X</italic> and 
 <italic>Y</italic> directions. The attributed values for the ellipse polygons include the 
 <italic>X</italic> and 
 <italic>Y</italic> coordinates of the mean center, long and short axes, and ellipse orientation. When the distribution of the disease presents a directional trend, it will be reflected in the analysis of these features. Thus, the ellipse helps us to investigate whether the distribution of points shows a particular direction. The standard deviation to represent the dispersion was 68%. The coordinates of 65 FMD epidemic regions in China infected with 2 viral serotypes from 2010 to 2016 (25 with FMD serotype A and 40 with FMD serotype O) were collected, and the data were analyzed.
