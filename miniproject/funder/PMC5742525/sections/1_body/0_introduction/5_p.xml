<p>In this study, we collected data on FMD from 2010 to 2016 in China, including information on 65 FMD outbreaks (25 caused by serotype A and 40 by serotype O viruses) and 5,937 diseased animals (1,691 serotype A and 4,284 serotype O cases). 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref> showed the incidence rate of FMD by year. To investigate the distribution characteristics of FMD, spatial autocorrelation and directional distribution analysis were performed. This study may provide useful information to FMD hotspot areas and alert at-risk communities about the importance of preventing and controlling FMD outbreaks.
