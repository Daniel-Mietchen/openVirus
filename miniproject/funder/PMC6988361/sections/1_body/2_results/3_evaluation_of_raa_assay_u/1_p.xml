<p id="Par24">A total of 311 clinical samples were used for evaluation of the RAA assay, and the results were compared with those obtained with real-time PCR as the reference method. Real-time PCR tested 101/311 samples as positive, and the RAA assay correctly identified and differentiated all 101 of these positive samples with 100% accordance, sensitivity, and specificity (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). No significant differences between the detection results of RAA and real-time PCR were observed. The kappa value of the RAA assay was 1.0 (
