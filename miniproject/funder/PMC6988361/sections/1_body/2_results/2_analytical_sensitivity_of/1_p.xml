<p id="Par23">The sensitivity of the RAA assay for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> detection was determined using a panel of serially diluted recombinant plasmids containing a fragment of the P1 gene and compared with the real-time PCR. All replicate dilutions of the recombinant plasmid from 10
 <sup>4</sup> to 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies per reaction produced a positive signal in the RAA assay, while 11/12 replicates containing 10
 <sup>0</sup> copies per reaction tested positive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The detection limit of the RAA assay at 95% probability was 2.23 copies (19.4 fg) per reaction while the real-time PCR was 22.3 copies (194 fg) (probit analysis, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006).
