The primers and probe were designed within the conserved regions according to the principles of RAA primer and probe design (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Primer-BLAST of NCBI was used to confirm the specificity of the primers and probe. The online OligoEvaluator software (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oligoevaluator.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.oligoevaluator.com</ext-link>) was used to analyze the potential for primer dimers and hairpins. The primers and probe were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
