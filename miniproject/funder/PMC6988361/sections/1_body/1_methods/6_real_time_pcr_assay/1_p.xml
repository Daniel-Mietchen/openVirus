<p id="Par18">A commercial detection kit for 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> DNA (based on PCR and fluorescence detection) was purchased from Mole Bioscience (Jiangsu, China). The detection kit contained specific primers and probes (P1 gene as the target), Tris-HCl buffer, Hot Start Taq enzyme, and dNTPs. The reaction mixtures contained 5 μL of extracted DNA template, 6 μL of reaction buffer, 11.5 μL of DNase-free water, 2.0 μL primer and probe, and 0.5 μL of Hot Start Taq enzyme. The cycling profile was as follows: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 91 °C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 64 °C for 1 min.
