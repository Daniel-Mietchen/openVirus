<p id="Par17">The RAA assays were performed in 50-μL reaction volumes using a commercial RAA kit (Qitian, Jiangsu, China). The reaction mixtures contained 2 μL of extracted DNA template, 25 μL of reaction buffer, 15.7 μL of DNase-free water, 2.1 μL of primer F (10 μM), 2.1 μL of primer R (10 μM), 0.6 μL of the probe (10 μM), and 2.5 μL of 280 mM magnesium acetate. The reaction mixture was added to a tube containing the RAA enzyme mix (SSB, 800 ng/μL; UvsX, 120 ng/μL; DNA polymerase, 30 ng/μL) in a lyophilized form. The tube lids were carefully closed and the contents were mixed well before being transferred to the detection equipment, as the efficiency of the mixing process has an impact on the results. The tubes were then transferred to a QT-F7200–0001 fluorescence detector (Jiangsu, Qitian) at 39.0 °C for 20 min. A positive control (
