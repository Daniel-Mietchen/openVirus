<p id="Par16">Recombinant plasmids containing a 450-bp fragment of the P1 gene (nt 180,858–185,741, GenBank accession no. U00089.2) were prepared. The primers used to construct the plasmid are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The resulting PCR products from the P1 gene were cloned into a T-vector using the pGM-Simple-T-Kit (TIANGEN Biotech (Beijing) Co., China) to construct the recombinant plasmids. The plasmid DNA was quantified with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany). The DNA copy number was calculated using the following formula: DNA copy number (copy number/μL) = [6.02 × 10
 <sup>23</sup> × plasmid concentration (ng/μL) × 10
 <sup>− 9</sup>]/[DNA length (nt) × 660] [
