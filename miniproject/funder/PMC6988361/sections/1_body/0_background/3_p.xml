<p id="Par11">The recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay is a new isothermal amplification technology with the advantages of rapidity, simplicity, and low cost, and it is, therefore, potentially very suitable for clinical application. In this method, the recombinase UvsX (from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), and a DNA polymerase are combined in an RAA reaction system. The UvsX recombinase and primers form a protein-DNA complex that can bind to homologous sequences in the double-stranded DNA target. Once the homologous sequence is located by the primer, a chain exchange reaction will occur to form and initiate DNA synthesis, and the target region on the template will be exponentially amplified. The amplification process is completed within 15–30 min at 39 °C [
