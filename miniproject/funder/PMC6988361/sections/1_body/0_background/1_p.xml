 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> is a major cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and children, with an epidemic occurring every 3–7 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This organism can cause up to 20–40% of CAP in the general population during epidemics, and this can rise to as much as 70% in closed populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Its clinical manifestations range from mild bronchitis to severe pneumoniae. Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as extra-pulmonary pathologies of the joints, kidney, pancreas, liver, skin, cardiovascular system, and central nervous system, are often implicated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In recent years, there have been increasing reports of severe cases of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>-related pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is, therefore, important to develop an efficient diagnostic method to guide timely clinical treatment.
