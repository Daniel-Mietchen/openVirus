<p id="Par10">Traditional detection methods for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> rely on culture, PCR or serology testing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Cultures provide irrefutable evidence of infection, but as a fastidious bacteria, it requires several days to grow; thus, culturing is seldom used in clinical practice except when obtaining isolates to determine antimicrobial susceptibility or to perform other scientific research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Serology testing is currently the most commonly used method in many primary hospitals for its convenience, but this method produces inconsistent results when using serum samples obtained at different times during the onset of illness and when different commercial testing kits are used. For some individuals, antibodies toward 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> persist for a long time, making it difficult to confirm whether a current 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection is actually present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. PCR is a well-developed method with several advantages over serology, and it has dramatically improved diagnostic testing due to its superior analytical and clinical sensitivity; however, PCR requires expensive instruments and skilled operators, which limit its use in small clinical laboratories [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Now many new technical are used in 
 <italic>M.pneumoniae</italic> detection, like loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), Dual-priming isothermal amplification (DAMP) and recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].
