 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> is an important pathogen that causes respiratory disease in adults and children. A rapid and convenient diagnostic tool is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment and to prevent further spread of disease. Currently, the two most commonly used methods in clinical practice for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> detection are serology and real-time PCR [

Before PCR became widely used in clinical practice, serology was the primary means for laboratory diagnosis, even with its significant limitations such as high false-negative and false-positive rates, because there was no other rapid test available. Real-time PCR has since emerged as an ideal detection method but it remains difficult to implement in poorly funded laboratories with limited equipment and skilled personnel [
