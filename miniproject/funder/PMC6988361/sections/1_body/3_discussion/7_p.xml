<p id="Par31">However, the RAA assay still has some limitations. Firstly, multiplex amplification of different targets in RAA is currently difficult because the primers for RAA each require more than 30 bp of complementary sequence and the probe requires around 50 bp, the more and longer primers in one tube will cause non-specific amplification which limits the development of a multiplex RAA assay. Secondly, RAA does not differentiate between colonization and real infection, nor a coinfection with other pathogens. This latter could be identified with the commercial multiplex PCR respiratory panel which includes
