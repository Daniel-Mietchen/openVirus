<p id="Par26">The RAA assay developed in the present study can be completed at a constant temperature of 39 °C in 15–30 min, which provides a significant saving in turnaround time compared with the other methods. Furthermore, the RAA detection system does not require a sophisticated laboratory setting, skilled personnel or expensive equipment, and it can be performed with a portable device. The running costs for RAA are also relatively lower than for real-time PCR. Therefore, it is a rapid and easy method for clinical use especially in primary laboratories if accompanied with a simple DNA extraction method.</p>
