<p id="Par28">In this study, the analytical sensitivity of the assay for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> was 2.23 copies (19.4 fg) per reaction, while the sensitivity of the commercial real-time PCR assay used here for comparison is only 500 copies per reaction according to the manufacturer, suggesting that the RAA assay is more sensitive. Our RAA assay also achieved the same level of sensitivity reported for real-time PCR methods, which ranges from 0.83 fg–100 fg per reaction [
