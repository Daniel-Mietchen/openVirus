<p id="Par30">A similarly rapid detection method for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been shown to have comparable sensitivity to RAA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the current LAMP methods, especially LAMP with two loop primers, suffer from undesired nonspecific amplification with strong background signals due to the increasing target sites. This nonspecific amplification substantially reduced the reliability of LAMP and limited its applications in clinical diagnostics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Dual-Priming Isothermal Amplification (DAMP) is another promising and simple method for rapid detection of pathogens. It was proved to have better effect to detect to detect HIV-1 DNA/RNA and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA, showing equal or better sensitivity with shorter detection time compared to conventional LAMP and PCR methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which could be also used for 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> detection in the further study.
