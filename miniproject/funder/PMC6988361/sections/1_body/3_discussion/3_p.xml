<p id="Par27">The genome of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> is relatively conservative but genetic diversity among strains has been demonstrated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sequence variation within the target region can affect the detection results of molecular diagnostic methods. Previously reported targets for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> include 16S rRNA, P1, RepMP1, and the CARDS toxin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Among these, the P1 gene has offered high specificity and diagnostic efficiency. In the present study, the RAA primers and probe were, therefore, designed based on the P1 gene, and we observed no cross-reactions with other respiratory pathogens.
