<p>What will happen in Italy? Will it see the scrapping of Presidential Decree 320/1954 [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-10-00900" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]? From the methodological process currently shared, it can be seen that the AHL leaves less room for discretion and interpretation of the law because each category provides clear and defined measures. The current Presidential Decree 320/1954 declares that all the provisions of the veterinary policies can be totally or partially implemented once an outbreak of transmissible disease is suspected. This margin of discretion has often caused doubts about how to adapt or apply sanitary actions. Unfortunately, it has actually encouraged the failure of health professionals to report disease for fear that restrictions or rules will be too severe. Thus, this causes economic hardship to the farmers, which is sometimes greater than that caused by the disease. This lack of discretion will enable operators/veterinarians to have a clearer and more defined normative reference.
