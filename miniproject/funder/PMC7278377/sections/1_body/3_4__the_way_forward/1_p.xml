<p>The choice of category for a disease does not necessarily relate to the costs of control but depends on the pathogen involved, e.g., the dissemination of low pathogenic avian Influenza could affect 500 million birds and will be classified in categories D–E in future Annex IV. Avian influenza is a disease subject to surveillance and movement control but will be in the same group of diseases as, e.g., ovine epididymitis. The latter only requires limited resources for interventions and will only concern the centres of breeding. Alternatively, measures could be applied to simply control the circulation of seminal material, embryos, etc. There are two cases that provide the same measures (category D–E) but involve a very different economic commitment in terms of intensity, extension, and costs of the actions. The measures will, therefore, always be economically proportionate to the impact of the pathogen in the territory: control of a category A or B disease (in an almost free country) could also be less expensive than a disease included in C, D, or E.</p>
