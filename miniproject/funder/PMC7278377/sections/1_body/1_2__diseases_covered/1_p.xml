<p>Coming from the general list of animal diseases updated by the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-10-00900" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], a total of 58 candidate diseases were included by the MS in the Annex II [
 <xref rid="B3-animals-10-00900" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Annex IV [
 <xref rid="B4-animals-10-00900" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Of these diseases, 29 had already been selected for their importance during ad hoc assessment by a panel of animal health and welfare experts under the auspices of the European Food Safety Association (EFSA) [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-10-00900" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Five diseases were automatically included because they are described directly in Article 5 of the AHL Regulation because of primary importance (the great viral epizooties: foot and mouth disease (FMD), classical swine fever, African swine fever, African horse sickness, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)). Another 24 were derived from internal evaluations by the Commission and from other EFSA opinions and/or included the following notifications by the European Reference Centres (including 18 diseases of aquatic species, bees, and amphibians).
