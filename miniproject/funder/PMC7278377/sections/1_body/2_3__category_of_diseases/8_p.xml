<p>To fall into the first three categories of A, B and C, a disease must, in addition to having to automatically satisfy the measures provided by category D (regulation of animal movements) and E (surveillance), be bound by all the epidemiological criteria identified during the EFSA assessment [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-10-00900" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These comprise presence, transmissibility, transmission, susceptible species, and morbidity/mortality. The disease must also have a significant impact on at least one of the additional parameters included during the EFSA assessment, which are zoonotic risk, the economic impact, and any effects on the labour market, animal welfare, environment, and/or biodiversity.
