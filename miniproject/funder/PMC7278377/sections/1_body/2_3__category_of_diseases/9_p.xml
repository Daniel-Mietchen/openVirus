<p>For all the diseases categorized in Aâ€“E, surveillance activities (category E) are, therefore, always applicable with the next degree, category D. Movement control measures will be added, if necessary. The monitoring and control of movements (i.e., D and E) can be added as additional measures depending on whether the disease falls into the different categories of A, B, or C. These last three categories are mutually exclusive because each provides different criteria: a disease that falls in category A cannot be in B or C. However, the criteria of D and E always apply as transversal measures.</p>
