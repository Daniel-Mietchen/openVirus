  <p>Best‐fit models for influenza epidemics in Entebbe during 2007‐2015. The variables tested are shown on the 
   <italic>y</italic>‐axis. Coefficient estimates are shown for variables included in the best‐fit models (ie, the ones with the lowest 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">BIC</styled-content>); the vertical segments show the 95% confidence intervals; “x”s denote the mean and “*”s indicate predictors significant at the 5% level. For instance, for A/H1N1 (1st column), no vertical segments appear, indicating the best‐fit model for A/H1N1 includes none of the tested variables; for A/H3N2 (2nd column), only 1 vertical segment, corresponding to concurrent B activity (labeled on the 
   <italic>y</italic>‐axis), appears, indicating among the tested variables concurrent B activity is the only variable included in the best‐fit model
