<p>Using laboratory‐confirmed influenza surveillance data for 2 major Ugandan cities, we have examined the key weather variables and viral interactions shaping the epidemic dynamics of influenza in these tropical populations. For Entebbe over 2007‐2015, among all variables, intertype viral interactions were the most consistent and strongest predictors for influenza A/H3N2 and B epidemics: A/H3N2 activity was negatively associated with concurrent B activity and

After adjusting for co‐circulating influenza viruses, our models showed that epidemics of influenza A/H1N1 were significantly associated with lower precipitation and marginally associated with lower temperature, whereas A/H3N2 and B epidemics were not associated with either temperature or any of the 3 humidity variables (ie, precipitation, RH, or AH). The mutually negative association between A/H3N2 and B was also consistently identified for both Kampala and Entebbe over a shorter study period (July 2008‐December 2014).
