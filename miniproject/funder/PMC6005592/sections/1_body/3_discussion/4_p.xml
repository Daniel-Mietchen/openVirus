<p>Influenza viruses mutate continuously to escape prior immunity and thus are able to cause recurrent epidemics. Nevertheless, prior infection may confer partial, or cross, immunity to future infection and lead to competing interactions among influenza viruses. Animal experiments and serological surveys have shown that cross‐immunity exists, not only in influenza strains of the same subtype but also across subtypes

In particular, a strong mutual negative association between A/H3N2 and B activity was consistently identified across years and the 2 Ugandan cities. This finding provides support for the impact of cross‐immunity at the population level. Further, as influenza vaccination coverage in the 2 studied Ugandan cities was near zero,
