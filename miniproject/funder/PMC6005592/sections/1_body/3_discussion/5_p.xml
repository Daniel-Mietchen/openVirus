<p>Due to sparse observations of influenza infection and a lack of long‐term disease surveillance, we used monthly data for the analyses. This coarse time resolution likely limited our ability to identify the impact of weather variables, which tend to act acutely (eg, lower AH ~2 weeks prior to the epidemic onset

In addition, due to a lack of publically available weather data, we were only able to conduct a partial comparison between the 2 Ugandan cities. Findings from this partial comparison were not entirely consistent between the 2 cities (except for the negative association between A/H3N2 and B). This inconsistency could stem from a lack of statistical power due to low signal/noise ratios, or location‐specific factors (eg, population immunity) that were not accounted for in the models. Further investigations into these issues are warranted.
