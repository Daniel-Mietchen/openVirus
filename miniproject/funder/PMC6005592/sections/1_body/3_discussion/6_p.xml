<p>Despite the limited disease data, we have shown differing correlations with weather variables for different influenza (sub)types as well as key viral interactions among co‚Äêcirculating (sub)types at the population level in 2 tropical cities. Future work using data with better temporal resolutions and from more tropical locations hopefully will reveal a more comprehensive picture of the dynamics of influenza epidemics in tropical climates.</p>
