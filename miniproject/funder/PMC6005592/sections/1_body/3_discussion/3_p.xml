<p>Previous studies have reported inconsistent findings regarding meteorological effects on influenza transmission in the tropics, in particular, for humidity.

 <xref rid="irv12556-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> These studies typically made inference based on epidemic time series for all influenza viruses combined, without distinguishing influenza (sub)type. Here, we found that the impact of weather conditions could vary by influenza (sub)type. While precipitation was identified as a significant correlate of A/H1N1 epidemics in Entebbe during 2007‐2015, the associations with activity of A/H3N2, B, or all influenza viruses combined were neutral. In addition, we showed in the leave‐one‐out cross‐validation that the correlations of influenza activity and weather variables also varied by study period. Given that circulating influenza viruses vary by location and year, the differing effects of weather conditions by influenza (sub)type and inter‐(sub)type interactions may in part explain the inconsistencies in the literature. Indeed, we showed that, with the adjustment for inter‐(sub)type interactions in the models, weak associations with weather variables (eg, temperature and A/H3N2 or, temperature and B in Entebbe) were modified toward the null while robust associations (eg, temperature and A/H1N1 in Entebbe) stayed unchanged. Future studies therefore should account for such interactions when assessing the impact of weather variables, in particular, for regions with concurrent circulation of multiple influenza (sub)types.
