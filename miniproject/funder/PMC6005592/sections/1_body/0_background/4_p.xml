<p>We used regression models to test the impact of temperature, humidity, and precipitation on influenza transmission. The two studied cities are in close vicinity with similar weather conditions. Comparing findings for these 2 cities thus allowed identification of inconsistencies and spurious associations. In addition, as the influenza samples were fully subtyped, we were able to address 3 questions that have been rarely, if ever, investigated: (i) How do effects of weather conditions vary by influenza (sub)type? (ii) How do interactions among influenza (sub)types manifest at the population level? And (iii) how do these viral interactions along with weather conditions shape the epidemic dynamics of each influenza virus?</p>
