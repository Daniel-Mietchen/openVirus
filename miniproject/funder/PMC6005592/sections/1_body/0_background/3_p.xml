<p>Uganda is located between latitudes 4°N and 2°S on the East African Plateau, with a tropical climate. To enhance influenza surveillance in the country, the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) initiated a sentinel surveillance network in 2007 to monitor influenza‐like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) nationwide. At the sentinel sites, respiratory specimens were collected from all ILI/SARI cases and tested for influenza viruses by (sub)type‐specific RT‐PCR. In this study, we utilized these surveillance data to study the transmission dynamics of influenza in 2 major Ugandan cities, Kampala and Entebbe, during 2007‐2015.</p>
