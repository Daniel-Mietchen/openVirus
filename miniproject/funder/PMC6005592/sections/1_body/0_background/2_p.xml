<p>Influenza epidemics cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Weather conditions, such as humidity and temperature, have been identified as key factors shaping the dynamics of influenza transmission. In temperate regions, lower humidity and lower temperature have repeatedly been shown to be associated with the wintertime epidemics.
