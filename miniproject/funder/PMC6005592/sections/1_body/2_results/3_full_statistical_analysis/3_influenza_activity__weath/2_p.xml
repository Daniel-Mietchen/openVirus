<p>In our second analysis, we further examined potential interactions among co‐circulating influenza (sub)types and the resulting impact on the relationship of epidemic activity with weather variables. Consistent with our first analysis, in models including 2 co‐circulating (sub)types along with both weather predictors (Equation 
 <xref rid="irv12556-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref>), A/H1N1 activity correlated negatively with both precipitation and temperature with nearly identical estimated effects (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, D, and Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). In addition, the estimated effects for all 4 weather variables, by both the models over the entire study period and leave‐one‐out cross‐validation, were nearly the same as estimated by the corresponding models without adjusting for co‐circulating (sub)types (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> A‐F). The correlation between A/H1N1 activity and concurrent A/H3N2 activity varied slightly by included data (as seen in the cross‐validation), but overall, was neutral and not significant. Similarly, the models showed that A/H1N1 activity was not correlated with concurrent B activity.
