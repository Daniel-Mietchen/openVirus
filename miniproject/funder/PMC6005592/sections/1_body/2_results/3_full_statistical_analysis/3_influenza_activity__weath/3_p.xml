<p>The estimated effects of weather variables for A/H3N2 and influenza B, however, shifted toward the null, when adjusting for co‐circulating (sub)types (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> G‐L for A/H3N2 and M‐R for influenza B). In particular, for both viruses, the association with temperature, originally marginally negative for A/H3N2 and positive for B, was much closer to the null. The mean OR, averaged over 30 models, was 0.95 (vs 0.82 without the adjustment) for A/H3N2 and 1.08 (vs 1.19 without the adjustment) for influenza B.
