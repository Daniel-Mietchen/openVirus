<p>We then tested all possible combinations of weather variables and co‐circulating (sub)types as model predictors and pooled all models to identify the best‐fit model for each (sub)type during 2007‐2015, based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Model fits are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, none of the 4 weather variables were included in the best‐fit models. However, a negative association between influenza A/H3N2 and B activity was identified in the best‐fit models for both viruses (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, C). The estimated associations between the 2 viruses in the best‐fit models, where the opponent virus was the only additional predictor along with the lag‐1 and seasonality terms, were similar to the models with both co‐circulating (sub)types and weather variables (OR = 0.44 [0.32, 0.59], 
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.4e‐7 for A/H3N2 v. B; and OR = 0.75 [0.58, 0.96], 
 <italic>P</italic> = .022 for B v. A/H3N2).
