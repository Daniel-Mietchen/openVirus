<p>Interestingly, the models consistently identified a strong negative association between A/H3N2 and concurrent B activity (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>L, R). Each standard deviation (SD) increase in concurrent B activity was associated with a decreased OR of 0.44 [0.32, 0.60] (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 for all 3 models) for B activity during the same study period. In addition, this mutually negative association between A/H3N2 and B was evident in all cross‐validation tests (Figure
