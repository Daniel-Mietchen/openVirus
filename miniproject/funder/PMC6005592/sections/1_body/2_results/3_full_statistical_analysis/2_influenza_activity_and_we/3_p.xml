<p>Unlike A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B activities were not significantly associated with any of the 4 weather variables during 2007‐2015. For A/H3N2, several exceptions were seen in the cross‐validation fits, including a positive correlation with precipitation when data for Year 2008 were excluded (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E), a negative correlation with RH and AH when data for Year 2013 were excluded (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F, G), and a number of negative correlations with temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H). Overall, although not statistically significant, A/H3N2 activity appeared to be negatively correlated with temperature, with a mean OR, averaged over 30 models, of 0.82 (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>H). Conversely, a positive correlation with temperature, although not statistically significant, was consistently estimated for influenza B; the mean OR was 1.19 across 30 models (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>L).
