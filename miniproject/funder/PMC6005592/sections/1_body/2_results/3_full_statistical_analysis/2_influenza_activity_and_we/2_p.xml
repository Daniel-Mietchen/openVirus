<p>We first modeled the relationship between influenza activity and all 4 weather variables (ie, temperature, precipitation, relative, and absolute humidity) without adjusting for co‐circulating (sub)types, as commonly done in the previous studies. Over the entire study period (ie, 2007‐2015 excluding July‐December 2009 due to the pandemic), A/H1N1 activity correlated negatively with both precipitation and temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, D). Lower precipitation was significantly associated with higher A/H1N1 activity, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.74 [0.55, 0.99] (mean and 95% confidence interval; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .039); in the same model, lower temperature was also marginally significantly associated with higher A/H1N1 activity (OR: 0.71 [0.51, 1.00]; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .053). In addition, estimated effects for these 2 weather variables during cross‐validation, where each test excluded 1 year of data, were in general in agreement (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, D). Neither relative nor absolute humidity was identified as a significant correlate for A/H1N1 activity (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B for RH and 2C for AH).
