<p>Kampala and Entebbe are only 37 km apart, and hence, weather conditions are similar in the 2 cities (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). In both cities, temperature is high year‐round; mean temperature during the study period was above 20°C in both cities (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12556-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Typically, each year has 2 rainy seasons (March‐May and September‐November; Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), with much higher levels of precipitation during rainy seasons (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12556-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). In Entebbe, where humidity data were available, ambient humidity is high year‐round; monthly averages were always above 60% for RH and above 11 g/kg for AH during the study period and were slightly higher during rainy seasons (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12556-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref> and Figure
