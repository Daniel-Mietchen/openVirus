<p>The surveillance network detected 514 influenza cases among 4477 ILI/SARI visits (11.48%) in Entebbe during January 2007‐December 2015 and 390 influenza cases among 2566 ILI/SARI visits (15.20%) in Kampala during July 2008‐December 2014 (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12556-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). Among the confirmed influenza cases, the majority were infected by A/H3N2 (47.67% in Entebbe and 43.33% in Kampala). The 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic strain (A/pdmH1) was first detected in late June or early July 2009 in the 2 cities and quickly replaced the seasonal A/H1N1 strain. As such, A/pdmH1 accounted for the majority of A/H1N1 cases during the study period in both cities (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12556-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). While the viral positive rate varied substantially by month, influenza epidemics recurred in all study years (Figure
