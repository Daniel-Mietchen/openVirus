<p>To verify the relationships between influenza activity with weather conditions and co‐circulating (sub)types identified for Entebbe, we performed a similar statistical analysis for Kampala. However, due to a lack of data for humidity in Kampala, in this comparison, for both cities the models only included temperature and precipitation. Model fits for both cities are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the model coefficients estimated by the basic models with all variables included (A‐C) and the best‐fit models (D‐F). With a shorter model period (July 2008‐December 2014 excluding the 2009 pandemic) and only a subset of weather variables, the negative correlation between A/H3N2 and B activity, identified in the above full analysis (3.2.2), remained the most significant relationship in the models for both cities. This negative association was identified in both the basic models (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B, C) and the best‐fit models (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E, F). In addition, a mutually positive correlation between A/H1N1 and B activity was identified; however, this relationship was only significant for Kampala (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, C, D, and F). For A/H3N2, concurrent A/H1N1 activity was identified as a positive correlate (
 <italic>P</italic> = .00012 for Entebbe and 0.085 for Kampala; Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B); however, this positive correlation was not mutually identified in the A/H1N1 models (
 <italic>P</italic> = .15 for Entebbe and 0.29 for Kampala; Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). For the 2 weather variables examined, lower temperature was associated with higher A/H3N2 for both cities (
 <italic>P</italic> = .054 for Entebbe and 
 <italic>P</italic> = .00042 for Kampala; Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). These estimated associations were in general in agreement across years as shown in the leave‐one‐out cross‐validation (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>).
