<p>Data for Kampala were compiled from 6 sentinel sites located in the city (ie, IHK/Surgery, Kibuli, Kisenyi, Kiswa, Kitebi, and Nsambya), and those for Entebbe were compiled from 1 sentinel site. The sentinel site in Entebbe reported regularly from 2007 to 2015. For Kampala, while at least 1 site was reporting at any time during 2008‚Äê2015, the number of reporting sites fluctuated over time. To control for this fluctuation in reporting rate, we used the proportions of specimens testing positive for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, or B, respectively, among all ILI/SARI specimens as proxies for activity of the 3 influenza viruses. Due to the low numbers recorded, we aggregated the data to monthly intervals.</p>
