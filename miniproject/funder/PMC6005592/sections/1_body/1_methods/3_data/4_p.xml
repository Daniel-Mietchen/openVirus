<p>For Entebbe, monthly precipitation, mean temperature, and relative humidity data from January 2007 to December 2015 were compiled from 2 sources. Specifically, monthly precipitation values were compiled from Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBoS)'s annual statistical abstract.
 <xref rid="irv12556-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Daily mean temperature and relative humidity (RH) recorded at Entebbe International Airport were obtained from Weather Underground.
 <xref rid="irv12556-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Specific humidity, a form of absolute humidity (AH), was calculated from RH and temperature using the Clausius‐Clapeyron equation.
 <xref rid="irv12556-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> Monthly averages of temperature, RH, and AH were then computed from these daily records. We used this combined dataset for Entebbe for the full statistical analysis (
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0009" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>). For Kampala, however, similar ground station data were only partially available for precipitation (2008‐2015), maximum and minimum temperature (2008‐2014), and RH (2008 and 2009), all at monthly intervals, from UBoS annual statistical abstracts.
 <xref rid="irv12556-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> These weather variables were also available for Entebbe, from the same UBoS reports. We therefore used the average of the maximum and minimum temperature for each month to represent the monthly mean temperature and used these values along with monthly precipitation in the partial statistical analysis for a comparison of the 2 cities (
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0014" ref-type="sec">2.4</xref>).
