 <xref rid="irv12556-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Per standard World Health Organization guidelines, patients met the case definition for ILI if they were ≥2 months of age, presenting with a fever (&gt;38°C) and either cough or sore throat. SARI was defined as: (i) a child aged 2 months to &lt;5 years requiring hospitalization, with recent onset of cough or difficulty breathing within 10 days of symptom onset and an additional indicator of respiratory distress; or (ii) a patient aged ≥5 years requiring hospitalization, with a history of fever presenting with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing within 10 days of symptom onset.
