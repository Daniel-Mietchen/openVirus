<p>Statistical correlations consistently identified in multiple locations would strengthen these inferred associations. Due to a lack of humidity data for Kampala, we were unable to perform a full analysis as performed for Entebbe (
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0009" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>) and compare results between the 2 locations. Nevertheless, as a partial validation, we fitted the 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0010" ref-type="sec">2.3.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0011" ref-type="sec">2.3.2</xref> models for both Kampala and Entebbe using a subset of weather variables (ie, temperature and precipitation), for which data were available for both cities for at least 3 years. That is, only precipitation was used as an

 <xref rid="irv12556-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="irv12556-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref>. For this comparison, we restricted the study period to July 2008‐December 2014 when data for influenza activity, temperature, and precipitation were available for both cities. In addition, to control for effects due to the 2009 pandemic, we excluded the 2009 pandemic (July‐December 2009) as in the full analysis. As in 2.3, we pooled all models [ie, with or without adjustment for co‐circulating influenza (sub)types] and selected the one with the lowest BIC as the best‐fit model for each influenza time series. In addition, cross‐validation was performed for both cities as described in 
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0013" ref-type="sec">2.3.4</xref>.
