<p>To thoroughly search for the best‐fit model for each influenza time series, we tested all possible combinations of 
 <italic>co‐Flu1</italic>,
 <italic> co‐Flu2</italic>, temperature, and a humidity‐related variable. Note this test also included models without any co‐Flu variable or weather variable. We then pooled all models and selected the one with the lowest Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
 <xref rid="irv12556-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> as the best‐fit model for each influenza time series.
