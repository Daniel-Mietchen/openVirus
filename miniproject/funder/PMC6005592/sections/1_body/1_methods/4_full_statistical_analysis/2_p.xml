<p>As complete data for temperature, precipitation, relative and absolute humidity are available for Entebbe, we performed a statistical analysis of the relationship between influenza activity and these 4 weather variables for the city during January 2007‐December 2015. We refer to this analysis as the full statistical analysis hereafter. We first examined the relationship for each influenza (sub)type and all strains combined without adjustment for co‐circulating influenza (sub)types (
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0010" ref-type="sec">2.3.1</xref>), as has been done in previous studies. In the second part of this analysis, we reexamined the relationship with adjustment for co‐circulating influenza (sub)types (
 <xref rid="irv12556-sec-0011" ref-type="sec">2.3.2</xref>). For simplicity, we combined all A/H1N1 cases, including those caused by the pre‐2009 seasonal strain and those by the 2009 pandemic strain. To control for factors related to the 2009 pandemic (eg, higher population susceptibility), we excluded the period of July‐December 2009 in all analyses [ie, for A/H1N1 as well as other (sub)types and all strains combined]. In addition, to reduce biases due to small sample size, months with &lt;5 ILI/SARI specimens (15 out of 102 months) were excluded in the models. For all models, all predictor variables were normalized to have zero mean and unit variance.
