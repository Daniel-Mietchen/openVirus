<p>We performed cross‐validation of the 2 basic models (Equations 
 <xref rid="irv12556-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="irv12556-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref>), by running the models excluding data from one of the study years (ie, 2007‐2015). For instance, in a leave‐one‐out cross‐validation for Year 2008, data for 2008 were excluded and the remainder used to fit the models. Model estimates for each covariate across years were then compared.
