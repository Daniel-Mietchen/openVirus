 <p>Although we are now almost 40 years into the AIDS epidemics, no approved vaccine for HIV exists. This is due to the high mutability of HIV, which allows it to escape the immune system control. Nevertheless, a few long-infected patients have been able to develop antibodies, called broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), that have a high neutralization breadth and are effective against a variety of viral strains. The knowledge that bnAbs can develop over time suggests that a HIV vaccine can be found that short-circuits the production of bnAbs. In this study we present a computational approach to estimate the breadth of HIV antibodies. Experimentally, the breadth is the fraction of viruses in a panel that are neutralized by the antibody, where the ability to neutralize is quantified as the half maximal inhibitory concentration of the antibody (IC
  <sub>50</sub>). A method to estimate the IC
  <sub>50</sub> by computer modeling and machine learning is described and used for estimating the antibody breadth. This approach is likely to prove useful in the design of new antibodies effective against HIV and for testing the efficiency of theoretically-designed vaccination protocols.
