<p>Given the limited accuracy for the prediction of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g002">Fig 2</xref>), this result is particularly encouraging. It indicates a low sensitivity of the breadth to the actual IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. This is rooted in the definition of the breadth, which does not require the exact value of the IC
 <sub>50</sub>, but only whether the antibody does or does not bind to a given virus.
