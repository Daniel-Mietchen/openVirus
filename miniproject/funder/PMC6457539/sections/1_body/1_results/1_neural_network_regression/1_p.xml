<p>The first step toward the estimation of the breadth of a given antibody is to evaluate the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for the binding of the antibody with all the antigens in the Seaman virus panel [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Here, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are estimated using a Neural Network regression model (an MLP regressor), trained over experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Experimental values are obtained from the CATNAP database, which contains a total of about 40000 IC
 <sub>50</sub> values [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The values in the database were filtered to make sure that the amino acid sequences of both the antibody and antigen are available, that at least one crystallographic structure of the antibody bound to a related HIV antigen is known, and that the antibody binds to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs). Upon filtering the database for these attributes, a total of 6179 IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained. Of these, 3864 are reported as exact values, while the remaining 2315 are reported as “greater than” a given cutoff (e.g. “&gt;50 μg/ml”); see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We refer to these as “approximated” values. To train the MLP regression model, only the 3864 exact values are used; the approximate ones were discarded.
