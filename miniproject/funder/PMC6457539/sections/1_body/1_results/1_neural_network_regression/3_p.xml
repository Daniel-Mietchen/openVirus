<p>For training the MLP regressor the available experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are randomly divided in half to obtain a training set and a test set. The training is then performed, and the obtained neural network used to predict the IC
 <sub>50</sub>. The training is repeated 30 times using each time a randomly generated training and validation set, and the results are averaged over the 30 neural network results to estimate the error in the predictions.
