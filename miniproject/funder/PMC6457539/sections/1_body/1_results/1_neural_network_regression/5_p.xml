<p>With these IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, the breadth of known antibodies can be computed and compared with the experimental values. In the CATNAP database, 24 antibodies have a known sequence and bind to the CD4bs with a known crystallographic structure; see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The breadth is calculated for all of these using the computed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the viruses in the Seaman panel. Specifically, for each virus in the Seaman panel, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is estimated using the MLP regressor, and the fraction of viruses for which the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is less than 1 μg/ml is counted. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g004">Fig 4</xref> (left) compares the experimental and computed breadths and their estimated errors (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). For most antibodies the predicted breadth is in reasonable agreement with the experiments, although there is a tendency to overestimate it. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.800 (Spearman is 0.766) indicating a meaningful correlation. The breadth of the antibody CAP257-RH1 is significantly overestimated (experimental is 0.013, computed is 0.61±0.30), but this antibody is the one for which only a single exact IC
 <sub>50</sub> value is available, and the computed uncertainty is highest.
