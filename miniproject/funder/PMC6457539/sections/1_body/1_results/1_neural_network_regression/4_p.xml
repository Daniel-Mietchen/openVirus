<p>The correlation between the experimental and computed IC
 <sub>50</sub> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g002">Fig 2</xref> for both the training and the test sets. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the training set is 0.686 (Spearman coefficient is 0.682). For the test set, the correlation coefficients decrease to 0.410 (Pearson) and 0.408 (Spearman). This is a significant improvement over the use of individual descriptors, which maximally reach a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.28; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g003">Fig 3</xref> (last column).
