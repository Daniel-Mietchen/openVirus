<p>As a further test, all 6179 experimental values are used in the regression model including the “greater than” approximate values. For these, the maximum experimental value is used; e.g. if the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is expressed as &gt;10 μg/ml and &gt;50 μg/ml in two different studies, the value 50 μg/ml is used. The obtained regression model shows an increase in accuracy, in particular an increase ability in ranking different antibodies (Spearman correlation coefficient increases from 0.766 to 0.960), but it has a loss in sensitivity for all low-breadth antibodies predicting zero breadth for most antibodies with experimental breadth less than 0.4; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g004">Fig 4</xref> (center.) As a result, although the accuracy of the slope is improved, the regression line is shifted to the right, yielding worse values.
