<p>As inputs for the MLP regressor, we use the values of descriptors of the antibody/antigen bound system obtained from an atomistic model of the complex. A total of 24 descriptors were tested; they fall into four classes: atomic descriptors, protein/protein scoring functions, protein stability scoring functions, and entropy models (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). The procedure for building the model for one antibody/antigen complex and evaluating all the descriptors requires about 13 minutes (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>); for evaluating the values of the subset of 19 chosen descriptors only about 20 seconds are required, once the model has been constructed (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>).
