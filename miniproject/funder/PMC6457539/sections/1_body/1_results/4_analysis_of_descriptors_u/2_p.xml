<p>Selecting too few descriptors would risk making the model less general. Consequently, we kept a large number of descriptors, using as discriminant the computational cost needed to evaluate them. From the full set of 24 descriptors, 5 are initially removed due to their computational cost. The remaining 19 descriptors are all very quick to evaluate, about 20 seconds in total for one model, obtaining a 12.8x speedup in the calculation of the descriptors with respect to whole set of 24 descriptors. No decrease in accuracy is observed.</p>
