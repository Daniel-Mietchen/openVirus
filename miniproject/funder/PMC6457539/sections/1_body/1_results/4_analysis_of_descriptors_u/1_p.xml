<p>An important aspect in the present application of machine learning for the prediction of antibody breadth is the choice of descriptors. The 24 descriptors considered can be broadly divided into four categories: atomic descriptors such as buried surface area or number of hydrogen bonds (15 descriptors in total), protein/protein binding affinity measures (4 descriptors: Prodigy, ZRANK, ZRANK2 and DFIRE), protein folding scoring functions (FoldX and two pairwise statistical potentials: RFHA and RFCB), and entropy models (normal mode entropy from two different elastic network models: ENM_EXP and ENM_R6); see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref> for more details. Their relative correlation coefficients and their correlation with the experimental values are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g003">Fig 3</xref>. As expected, some descriptors are highly correlated with each other, such as the number of hydrogen bonds evaluated using different definitions, or the van der Waals energy with the buried solvent accessible surface area.
