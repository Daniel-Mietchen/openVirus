<p>We also studied the effects of the number of descriptors used in the MLP classifier on the accuracy of the model as measured by the confusion matrix; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Each sample in these two plots is a different MLP classifier model fitted over a different set of descriptors. The first graph shows the accuracy of the given model, as measured by the confusion matrix as sum of the percentages of true positive and true negative, while the second one shows the Pearson correlation coefficients obtained when comparing the calculated and experimental breadths. The blue points correspond to models with randomly-chosen descriptors, while the red points represent models obtained by successively removing the descriptor that is most correlated with all other descriptors and less correlated with the experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>). The accuracy starts to decrease significantly when the number of descriptors is less than about 10. The Pearson coefficient is more robust and starts decreasing at around 7 descriptors. At this point, the maximum cross-correlation (Pearson coefficient) between the descriptors is about 0.4. These data suggest that a simpler model of about 7â€“10 descriptors could be used, which would have (approximately) the same accuracy of the 19-descriptors model; see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. As expected from the earlier analysis, the breadth results converge more rapidly than the accuracy.
