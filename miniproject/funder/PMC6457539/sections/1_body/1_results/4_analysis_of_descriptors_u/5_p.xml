<p>This raises the question of which descriptors are most important in the prediction of the neutralization ability of an antibody. There are a variety of methods to extract descriptor importance from an artificial neural network, but there is no apparent consensus on which is better, in particular if the descriptors show a relative high level of cross correlation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it is possible to extract some information from the correlation of the descriptors with the experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values and with the deletion order reported in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The protein/protein scoring functions are on average more important than molecular descriptors, in particular the protein folding propensity descriptors (FoldX) and the two statistical pairwise potentials for estimating protein stability (RFHA and RFCB). Also, the entropy from elastic network models (ENM_EXP and ENM_R6) plays an important role, with ENM_EXP the last deleted descriptors with a relatively high correlation with the experiments (0.292 correlation coefficient). These highlight the importance of entropy in the binding, and the usefulness of complex protein potentials, with respect to simple molecular descriptors.
