<p>If too many descriptors are used, there is risk of overfitting. This is avoided here by the very large number of available experimental values. For the MLP classifier 6179 experimental values are available, half of which are used in the fitting. The MLP classifier with 19 descriptors and 10 hidden nodes contains 200 fitting parameters (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>), versus the 3089 (6179/2) experimental values used in the fitting. A ratio between the number of experimental values in the training and number of parameters in the model of ten or greater is suggested [
