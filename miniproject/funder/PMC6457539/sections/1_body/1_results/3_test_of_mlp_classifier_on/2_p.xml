<p>The computed breadth values are reported in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. For the mature antibodies the computed values are in good agreement with the experimental data. This is particularly interesting for the 3BNC60 antibody, for which no published structure of any antibody/antigen complex is currently available. For this reason, 3BNC60 was excluded from the training of the MLP regressor and classifier. However, a bound crystallographic structure is available for its putative germline precursor [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Assuming no significant change in the binding pose upon affinity maturation, the germline crystallographic structure was used for both the mature and germline antibody. This is likely to be a valid assumption, as indicated by the VRC01 and NIH45-46 antibodies for which crystallographic structures are available for both mature and germline forms bound to an antigen (see PDB 4JPK and 3NGB for VRC01 and 5IGX and 3U7Y for NIH45-46). The breadth of antibody 3BNC60 is slightly underestimated (0.53Â±0.21 vs 0.78), but it also has a higher than usual uncertainty.
