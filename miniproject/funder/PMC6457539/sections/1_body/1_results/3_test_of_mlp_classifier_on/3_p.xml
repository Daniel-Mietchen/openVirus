<p>For the putative germlines, the calculated breadths range between 0.27 and 0.45. Importantly, in all cases the breadth of the germline is significantly lower than the breadth of the mature antibody. This finding is encouraging, because only mature antibodies were used in the training of the MLP classifier, as no quantitative information for germline binding to HIV viruses is available in the CATNAP database. The MLP classifier is thus biased towards mature antibodies.</p>
