<p>Finally, we consider the DRVIA7 antibody, which is an immature form of a VRC01-class antibody [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Few experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are available for this antibody; they show a breadth of about 0.23. The estimated value by modeling is 0.45±0.17, which is again higher than expected, but lower than the VRC01 mature value (0.79±0.08) and similar to the germline (0.45±0.23).
