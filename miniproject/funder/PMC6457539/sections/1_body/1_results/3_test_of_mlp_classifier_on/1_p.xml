<p>Although our primary purpose for developing the MLP classifier is to evaluate antibodies designed to have increasing breadth (see Concluding Discussion), we decided to determine whether it could be used to compute the breadth of putative germlines, as compared to the breadth of the mature antibodies. We consider bnAbs VRC01, NIH45-46 and 3BNC60, for which the experimental breadths of the mature antibodies are available, see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. For the putative germlines no experimental breadths are available, but the expected breadth should be low, as they appears to have no affinity for native HIV antigens [
