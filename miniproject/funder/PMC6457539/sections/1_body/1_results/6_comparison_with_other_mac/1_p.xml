<p>It is of interest to compare the results from MLP classifier used here with other machine learning techniques. We compared the Neural Network with one hidden layer used in this paper with a Neural Network with two hidden layers, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], random forests (RF) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and Support Vector Machine (SVM) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Methods</xref>. All methods produce very similar results, in both the correlation with the experimental breadths and the estimated error in the single breadth values; see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. This is supporting evidence of the robustness of the results obtained with the MLP. Moreover, it suggests that to improve the results new information about the system needs to be introduced, e.g. in the form of different descriptors.
