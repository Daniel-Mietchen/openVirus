<p>The correlation between the experimental and the computed breadth using the IC
 <sub>50</sub> classifier is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g004">Fig 4</xref> (right). As expected, the results are significantly better than for the MLP regressor, with the correlation with the experimental breadth increasing from 0.800 for the regressor to 0.973 for the classifier. Moreover, no outliers are present and the estimated breadths of all 24 antibodies lie on the diagonal with near unit slope.
