<p>The breadth can be estimated more directly with an MLP classifier, which is trained to predict whether the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is less or greater than the 1 μg/ml cutoff. A higher accuracy in the correlation between experiments and predictions is expected, because a classification is a simpler problem than a regression. The methodology used for the MLP classifier is the same as that employed for the MLP regressor, except that the whole set of 6179 experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values is used; i.e., the 2351 “approximate” values are included. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists the antibodies and the number of “exact” and “approximate” IC
 <sub>50</sub> values available for each.
