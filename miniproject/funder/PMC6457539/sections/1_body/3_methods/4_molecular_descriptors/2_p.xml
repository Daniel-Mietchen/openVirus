<p>As “atomic descriptors” we consider descriptors that are simple function of the atomic coordinates. The two most obvious are the electrostatic (Coulomb) interaction between the antibody and the antigen (E_elec) and the dispersive (Lennard-Jones) interaction (E_vdw). These are modeled according to the CHARMM36 force field [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To approximate the solvation of the protein, the GBn2 [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] generalized Born implicit model was used as third descriptor (E_gbsa). No cutoff in either electrostatic or dispersion force was used. Other used descriptors are the buried surface area [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (MD_sasa) upon binding, the number of hydrogen bonds according to Baker &amp; Hubbard [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (MD_h1) and according to Wernet, Nilsson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] (MD_h2) definitions, and hydrogen bond energy according to Kabsch &amp; Sander [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] (MD_h3). These four descriptors were computed using the MDTraj [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] python module. To these, the number of interchain contacts classified according to polarity and charge are added (a total of six descriptors: IC_AA, IC_PP, IC_CC, IC_AP, IC_CP, IC_AC), as well as the apolar and charged non-interacting surface area (NIS_A and NIS_C). These last eight descriptors were computed using Prodigy [
