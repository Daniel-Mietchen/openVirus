<p>The third class of descriptors consists of scoring functions optimized to reproduce the folding propensity of a protein or its stability. With these scoring functions, the binding affinity can be estimated as the difference between the “stability” of the complex and that of the separated antibody and antigen. The methods tested are: FoldX [
