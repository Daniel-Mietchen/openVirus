<p>More complex descriptors are scoring functions developed for estimating the binding affinity of two proteins. These methods have been developed to score binding modes in protein/protein docking software. Here, they are not used as independent scoring functions (as originally intended), but as descriptors. The used methods are: Prodigy [
