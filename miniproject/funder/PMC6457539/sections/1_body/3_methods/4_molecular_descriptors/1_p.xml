<p>The optimized structure obtained by molecular modeling (see previous paragraph) was used for the computation of all descriptors to train the neural networks. 24 molecular descriptors were computed. These are divided in four main classes: atomic descriptors, protein/protein binding scoring functions, protein stability scoring, and entropy models.</p>
