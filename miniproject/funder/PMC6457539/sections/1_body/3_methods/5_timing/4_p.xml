<p>These timings are for one single model. For each antibody/antigen complex six models are used, and the descriptors are averaged. This means that to create the six models 10.6 minutes are required, and to get all the descriptors, an additional 30.8 minutes are needed, for a total of 41 minutes. Without FoldX and OpenMM, the timing for the descriptors decreases to 2.4 minutes, reducing the total time to about 13 minutes.</p>
