<p>The time required for each descriptor varies significantly. Most descriptors are computed almost instantaneously, requiring one second or less. There are three exceptions: evaluating the OpenMM-based descriptors (electrostatic, dispersive and generalized born energies) takes about 51 second per model, the ENM entropy takes 15 seconds, and FoldX is the slowest descriptor used, requiring 233 seconds on average. Computing all descriptors requires about 5 minutes. Skipping FoldX and OpenMM (the two most expensive steps) decreases the time from 5 minutes to 20 seconds.</p>
