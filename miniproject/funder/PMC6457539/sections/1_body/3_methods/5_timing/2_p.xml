<p>As described above, preparation of the atomistic model consists of three steps. Modeller takes on average 69 seconds to generate one model. CHARMM, used to fix the structure and run a quick minimization takes an insignificant amount of time. A deeper energy minimization with OpenMM takes on average 37 seconds. A total of about 100 seconds are thus needed to generate one model.</p>
