<p>To calculate the breadth of an antibody, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the antigens in the virus panel are required. In this work the experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> are used to both calculate the experimental breadth and to train a neural network (see below) to predict the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values and breadth of new antibodies.
