<p>Experimental values of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for different antibody/antigen complexes were obtained from the CATNAP database [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (accessed on March 5, 2018). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are presented in the database in two forms. If available, the exact value is reported; if the complex has a low binding affinity, the exact value is not available, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is reported to be greater than a given cutoff, e.g. “IC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;50μg/ml”. The full database contains information for 1024 HIV viruses and 334 antibodies, for a total of 23851 exact and 16467 approximate IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (most antibodies are tested on different viruses). Of interest in this work are antibodies binding on the CD4bs. Because our method requires atomistic models of the antibody/antigen complex, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are selected such that the binding is at the CD4bs (based on known crystallographic structures of the bound antibody/antigen complex), the amino acid sequences of both the antibody and the antigen are known, and at least one crystallographic structure of the complex is experimentally available. After applying these filters, 24 antibodies (over the 334 available) are selected, for which a total of 3864 exact and 2315 approximate IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are available; see
