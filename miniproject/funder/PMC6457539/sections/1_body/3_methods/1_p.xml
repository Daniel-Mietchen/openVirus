<p>First, the source of experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values used in the training of the neural network is described. Then, the procedure to create an atomistic model of antibody/antigen complexes is presented, followed by the computation of all molecular descriptors derived from the atomistic models. The computational cost of creating the models and evaluating the descriptors is then reported. The final section is dedicated to the details of the neural network models.
