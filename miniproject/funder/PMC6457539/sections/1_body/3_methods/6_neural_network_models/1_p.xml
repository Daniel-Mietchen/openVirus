<p>To predict the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values a Multi-Layer Perceptron regressor (MLP regressor) is used. This type of artificial neural network takes as input a number of descriptors, parse them in a hidden layer composed, in this case, of ten nodes, and outputs the predicted IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. For the training, the 3864 exact IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are split randomly in half into a training set and a validation set. The total number of parameters N
 <sub>p</sub> to fit in the MLP is given by N
 <sub>p</sub> = N
 <sub>i</sub>N
 <sub>h</sub>+N
 <sub>h</sub>N
 <sub>o</sub> where N
 <sub>i</sub>, N
 <sub>h</sub>, and N
 <sub>o</sub> are the number of input descriptors, hidden nodes, and outputs. Using 19 descriptors, and requiring one output (the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value), the total number of parameters to fit is 200. As an empirical rule, the ratio between the available experimental values used in the training and the number of parameters to fit has to be much greater than one. In our case, the number of experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values used for the training is 3864/2, which is 9 times higher than the number of parameters to fit. A logistic activation function is used in the hidden nodes, and the lbfgs solver is used for optimization.

 <sub>50</sub> values.
