<p>To select which descriptors to use in the neural network, the first criterium was to keep the scoring function as fast as possible, avoiding the more computationally expensive OpenMM energy-based terms and FoldX. Removing these four descriptors does not cause a decrease in accuracy, while reducing the required time by a factor of 12.8. Prodigy was also removed, as it is a linear combination of other descriptors (no effect is observed in the accuracy after removal). This way, the number of descriptors used decreases from 24 to 19 without loss in accuracy. To study the performance of simplified models including fewer descriptors, the models are sequentially simplified by removing the highest correlated descriptor. To do this, the cross-correlation matrix with all descriptors is analyzed to find the pair of descriptors with the highest correlation among themselves; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The descriptor with the lowest correlation with the experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values is removed. The process is repeated until only one descriptor is present. The list of descriptors which are deleted at each step (and their correlation coefficients) are reported in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. All descriptors are normalized to zero mean and unit variance (standard scaler).
