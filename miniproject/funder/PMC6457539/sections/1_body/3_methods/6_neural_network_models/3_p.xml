<p>It was observed that the outputs of both the MLP regressor and MLP classifier would change, in some cases significantly, upon repeated training using different random splitting of the experimental values into training and validation sets, and upon fitting the neural networks using different random seeds. For this reason, we average over 30 independently generated neural networks using each time a new splitting of the training and validation set and a new random seed in the training. The standard deviation between the 30 replicas is used as an estimate of the statistical error.</p>
