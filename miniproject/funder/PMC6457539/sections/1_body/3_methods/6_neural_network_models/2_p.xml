<p>A similar artificial neural network is used to predict whether the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is less or greater than the experimentally-derived 1 Î¼g/ml cutoff, which is used to calculate the antibody breadth. In this case, a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier (MLP classifier) is trained instead of a regressor on the same set of descriptors. The same settings as for the MLP regressor were used, with the only difference that the output is filtered with a logistic function to be between 0 and 1. Here the total number of experimental values is 6179. Of these, 3089 are randomly selected and used to train the model. The ratio between the number of experimental values in the training (3089) and the number of parameters (200) is more than 15, decreasing the chance of overfitting. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> compares the composition of the full dataset and a randomly generated set containing 50% of the values. All antibodies are represented in the training set, with the same percentages of binders and not-binders as in the whole set.
