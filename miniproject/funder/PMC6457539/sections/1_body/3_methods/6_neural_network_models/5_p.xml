<p>To verify the robustness of the neural network, the same analyses were repeated using other machine learning methods: k-nearest neighbors (kNN) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], random forests (RF) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and support vector machine (SVM) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. First, the MLP were compared with a second MLP containing two hidden layers instead of one. Having observed the same results, it was compared with a kNN (with distance weighting), a RF (composed of 31 trees) and a SVM (with radial basis function kernel) and no significant improvement was observed with any of them.
