<p>The protocol described in this work requires building of atomistic models for arbitrary antibody/antigen complexes and computing molecular descriptors to train the neural network models. The first task is to build a full 3D atomistic model of the antibody/antigen complex given only the sequences of the two proteins. A requirement is to have a template of the complex, which is used for homology modeling. We select one template for each antibody, neglecting differences in the antigens. The underlying assumption is that the binding mode of a given antibody to any antigen is very similar and can be approximated to be constant. Moreover, the structure of the antigen is assumed to be conserved over the sequence space. This is not generally true for antigens with significant insertion or deletions in their (hyper)variable loops. Because we focus on the CD4bs, the assumption is reasonable. Crystallographic structures of antibody/antigen complexes were used as templates for the 24 antibodies. In most cases, the antibody was not bound to naturally-occurring antigens, but to engineered monomeric (gp120) domains. In these cases, the engineered protein was substituted with the BG505 SOSIP structure (PDB 5FYJ) using best-fit RMSD alignment for the superimposition. The PDB codes used for each antibody are reported in
