<p>Given the sequences of the antigen and the antibody and a template crystallographic structure for the complex, Modeller [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was used to create a model of the complex. The structure was then refined by CHARMM [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], including adding missing hydrogen atoms, creating disulfide bonds, and minimizing the all-atom structure by 100 steps steepest descent. The system was then further minimized using OpenMM [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] until the potential energy was changing by less than 1 KJ/mol. The CHARMM36 force field [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was used for the all-atoms energy minimizations. In the modeling, only one monomer of the Env gp160 trimer was built, the gp41 deleted, and only the variable part of the antibody was kept. Glycosylation was not included.
