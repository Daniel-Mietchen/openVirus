<p>An important concern in any HIV model is the glycosylation of the virus since the HIV Envelope protein is heavily glycosylated. In the CD4bs, the focus of this work, there are at least five glycans (N197, N234, N276, N363, and N462) that can interact, and interfere, with the antibody binding. One glycan, N276, is particularly problematic in a comparison between germline and mature antibodies, as it has been observed that mature antibodies, like VRC01, introduce deletions or mutations to glycine in CDRL1 to avoid clashes and to accommodate the glycan [
