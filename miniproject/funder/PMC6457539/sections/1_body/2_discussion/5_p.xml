<p>The present technique for estimating antibody breadth based on IC
 <sub>50</sub> values could prove useful in the computational design of vaccination protocols to elicit HIV bnAbs. Promising computational/theoretical approaches for the design of vaccination strategies include a description of the affinity maturation (AM) process [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is achieved by simulating how antibodies mutate during the AM from the germline precursors to the mature antibodies. One essential step in these simulations is evaluating the breadth of the produced antibodies. Since the method described here requires as inputs only the sequence of the antibody and a template for the bound structure, it is likely to be a useful part of the design process. Moreover, the techniques developed here can, in principle, be applied to other highly variables viruses for which a definition of antibody breadth is important, such as influenza or hepatitis C viruses, if sufficient experimental neutralization data are available for training the models. From preliminary examination of the literature, this appears to be true at least for influenza.
