<p>For the development of such a model, many experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values to train the neural networks have to be available. Here we used experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from the CATNAP database [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After cleaning and filtering the data, 6179 IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained for the training of the classifier and 3864 for the regressor. These significantly outnumber the number of parameters in the neural network (200), reducing the possibility of overfitting. For best results, a small number of experimental values specific for the antibody under study, or a related antibody, need to be present in the training set. For the application of the same techniques to different HIV binding sites or different viruses, such as influenza, sufficient high-quality experimental data would have to be collected and validated.
