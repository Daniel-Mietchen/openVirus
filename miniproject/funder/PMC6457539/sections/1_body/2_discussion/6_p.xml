<p>An alternative perspective is to consider the evaluation of the breadth from the antibody/antigen binding affinity, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006954.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>. This requires an accurate, relatively rapid, method for the calculation of the binding affinity. Research on developing such a methodology is in progress [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The use of the “free energy of binding breadth”, rather than the “IC
 <sub>50</sub> neutralizing breadth”, would, in principle, bypass the need for machine learning techniques.
