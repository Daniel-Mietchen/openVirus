<p>To the best of our knowledge, we report in this paper the first attempt to estimate the breadth of HIV antibodies by the use atomistic modeling and machine learning techniques. We developed a method based on a Multi-Layer Perceptron (an artificial neural network), which is able to accurately reproduce and predict the breadth of CD4bs targeting HIV antibodies.</p>
