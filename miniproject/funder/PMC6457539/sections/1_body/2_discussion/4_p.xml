<p>The tools presented here are important for the computational design and screening of potential HIV antibodies. The usual focus in antibody design is in the optimization of the potency and specificity for a particular antigen [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As pointed out in the Introduction, this is only one part of the problem for highly mutable virus like HIV, for which the exposed antigens have a high variability, so that bnAbs are required. Thus, it is important to couple the calculation of the potency with an estimation of the breadth.
