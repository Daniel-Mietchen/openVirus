<p>However, a major obstacle to a successful computational design of bnAbs is a lack of accurate methods for computing the antibody breadth. Here, we use machine learning [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] coupled with descriptors obtained from all-atoms models of the antibody/antigen complex to predict the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the viruses in the Seaman panel from which the antibody breadth can be estimated. To predict the IC
 <sub>50</sub> we use a supervised artificial neural network [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], a multilayer perceptron (MLP); see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006954.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The neural network is trained by backpropagation, where the errors in the outputs are propagated backwards into the artificial network structure to optimize the internal parameters of the model. An essential element for the successful application of artificial neural networks is the availability of a large data set for training the networks [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For HIV, experimental IC
 <sub>50</sub> values have been collected in the CATNAP database of neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which contains more than 40000 IC
 <sub>50</sub> values; of these, 6179 satisfy the criteria required for our machine learning approach.
