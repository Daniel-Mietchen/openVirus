<p>For HIV, which is the focus of this paper, no approved vaccine exists, although we are now almost forty years into the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As is the case for influenza virus, HIV evolves rapidly so that there exist many different viral strains. Some of them can evade the immune response to a vaccination directed against only a small number of strains. Thanks to the development of antiretroviral therapies [

Several years after infection, a small fraction of the HIV infected individuals develop antibodies that are referred to as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), i.e. antibodies that are effective against many strains of the virus [

 <italic>et al</italic>. [
