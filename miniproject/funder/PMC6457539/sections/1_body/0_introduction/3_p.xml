<p>The “neutralization breadth” of an antibody is a measure of its ability to recognize and neutralize different variants of the virus. An antibody with a high breadth can recognize effectively many different variants, while a low breadth antibody is more specific. Experimentally, the neutralization breadth of an antibody is evaluated by testing its ability to inhibit a panel of antigens from different clades of the target virus [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006954.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To evaluate the breadth of an antibody, the half maximal inhibitory concentration of the antibody (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) is measured for each virus in the panel. The breadth is defined as the fraction of viruses for which the IC
 <sub>50</sub> is less than a given cutoff, usually set to 1 μg/ml.
