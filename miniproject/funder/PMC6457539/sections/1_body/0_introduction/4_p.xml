<p>The present paper describes a computational method to estimate the breadth of new HIV antibodies using only the sequence of their heavy and light chains, and the assumption that they form antibody/antigen complexes that are similar to a known crystal structure of an antibody/antigen complex that may not have high sequence homology. Of the known HIV antibodies, we select those that target the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of the HIV Envelope glycoprotein, a binding site used by diverse bnAbs [

Because the CD4bs is highly conserved, an HIV vaccine designed to elicit bnAbs that bind to this site would have a high therapeutic potential: bnAbs would likely recognize the conserved core, as well as the variable regions in the neighborhood that are required for the broad-based character to develop [
