<p>In the body of the paper, we describe training of the MLP to predict either the actual value of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> (by regression), or whether or not the antibody recognizes the virus (by classification). The outputs of the two artificial neural networks are then used to estimate the breadth of known antibodies. In a Concluding Discussion, we consider the limitation and extension of the methodology described here, as well as its utility for vaccine design.
