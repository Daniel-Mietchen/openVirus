<p>Vaccination is a medical procedure which has played an essential role in protecting mankind against viral and bacterial infections since the time of Edward Jenner, who developed a vaccine for smallpox over 200 years ago. Although for some diseases caused by viruses, such as measles, a small number of vaccinations provide almost permanent immunity, for other such as influenza, an annual revaccination, which provides only limited protection, is required. Since the measles virus, like the flu virus, undergoes error-prone replication that introduces mutations, it is not clear why the measles vaccination works as well as it does. Recent research [
