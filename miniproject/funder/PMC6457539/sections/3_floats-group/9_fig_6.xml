  <title>Computed breadth for the 24 antibodies studied in this work as a function of the number of experimental IC
   <sub>50</sub> values for that particular antibody used in the training of the MLP classifier.

  <p>The blue line is the computed breadth using all available experimental data in the training set, the red line is the experimental breadth. The graphs are shown up to 50 included experimental data, the total number of available experimental data is reported in
