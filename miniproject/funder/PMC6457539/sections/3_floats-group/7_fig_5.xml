  <p>Accuracy (left) and correlation with the experimental breadth (right) obtained for MLP classifier trained with different sets of descriptors. On the abscissa is the number of descriptors used in each model. Blue points represent randomly generated models (selecting randomly between 1 and 24 descriptors among the 24 available), red points represent models obtained by systematic reduction of the full 19-descriptors model by successive removal of the most correlated descriptor (the 5 most computationally expensive descriptors are removed first to bring from 24 to 19 descriptors, and then the most correlated are removed).</p>
