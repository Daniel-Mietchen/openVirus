<p>Regarding strategies for community-wide distribution of devices, participants in Iquitos suggested distributing them in areas with recent transmission: 
 <italic>“[It should be done] like how fumigation is done in the sector where dengue cases appear</italic>, 
 <italic>then it would be good to distribute this so that the people can use the RDTs”</italic> (FGD with community members outside of study zone in Iquitos). The discussion regarding the preferred device distribution method in Cambodia focused on whether the test kits were to be sold or provided for free. Community members and health professionals reported that the pharmacy was the most acceptable site for selling the RDT kits: 
 <italic>“[The test kits should be sold] at the pharmacy because if we need medicine we could also buy the test kits”</italic> (FGD, Deum Chan village). In both sites, health professionals recommended promoting new RDTs through a national program to enhance people’s confidence and trust in the new product.
