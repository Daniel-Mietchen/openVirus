<p>In Peru, although FGD community participants had not seen any commercially available at-home diagnostic devices, enthusiasm for such a hypothetical febrile diagnostic product to use at home was nearly unanimous. The perceived reason was to avoid long waits at health facilities and to reduce waiting time for a diagnosis: “
 <italic>It would be good [to use the RDT] to avoid going to the health post</italic>. 
 <italic>With this [test] you can see a doctor more quickly without having to stand in line</italic>” (FGD, Iquitos, inside study zone). Although no system is currently in place, participants liked the idea that having a diagnosis in their hand could facilitate or speed up their care once they presented at a health facility. Participants also felt that doctors and providers would take the patient more seriously because a positive test would mean that they had “something” for the health facility to follow up immediately and that this would facilitate their clinical evaluations: “
 <italic>I like the test because… I would be able to obtain something</italic>” (FGD, Iquitos, inside study zone).
