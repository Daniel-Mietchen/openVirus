<p>In Cambodia, the ability to detect dengue fever also made the test attractive to community participants, particularly since they had been exposed to annual dengue outbreaks. A quick result was appreciated by both community members and health workers. It was proposed that the test could be used as a first screening tool when a child has a fever, especially in remote and rural areas where access to health facilities is limited: 
 <italic>“If there is a test at home</italic>, 
 <italic>we could test</italic>. 
 <italic>If it is found that the child has dengue fever</italic>, 
 <italic>then we can bring him to hospital</italic>. 
 <italic>It saves a lot of time”</italic> (FGD, Kandal village). It was noted, however, that it might not be of much benefit in urban areas where there is access to standard blood tests with modern laboratory instruments and equipment.
