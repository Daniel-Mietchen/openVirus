<p>In Peru, we principally recruited women (mean age 35 years, range 18â€“60 years) because they are generally responsible for health care for family members (females: 93%, 70 of 75 FGD participants) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007773.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; data only available for Peru). Participants had an average two children, of which the average age of the youngest child (in some cases this was a niece, nephew, or grandchild) living in the home of 4.5 years. The five FGDs (n = 41) with health professionals included: (1) two groups of nurses/nurse technicians and one group of physicians working in the febrile triage section of Ministry of Health facilities; (2) nurse technicians on cohort study research staff; and (3) a group of medical residents on rotation in local hospitals.
