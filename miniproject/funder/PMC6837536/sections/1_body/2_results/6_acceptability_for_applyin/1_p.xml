<p>After applying or observing application of the RDTs, all Iquitos participants expressed confidence performing the test on themselves: 
 <italic>“I would do it on myself if they gave me the instructions”</italic> (FGD Iquitos, inside study zone). They were also confident about letting a family or a friend conduct the test on their child. When asked directly about whether or not they would be 
 <italic>willing</italic> to use the test on a child, we observed that those from Iquitos research study zones reported being more willing to use the test, compared to those outside study zones. Regarding pharmacy-based testing, there was hesitation because of a potential cost for testing or that the pharmacy staff would not be trained properly. Although the research team was exploring the possibility and strategies for free distribution of RDTs, when asked about what they would be willing to pay for such RDT, the majority said 5 soles (or USD 1.75) would be right, and even 10 soles would be too high. In Iquitos neighborhoods with ongoing dengue research, some responded that they would 
 <italic>“wait for [study staff] from NAMRU”</italic>, the local surveillance program supported by NAMRU-6, rather than go to a pharmacy.
