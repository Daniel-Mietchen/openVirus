<p>After reviewing the test kit instructions and watching the research team apply it to themselves, Cambodian participants felt that they could master the use of the test kits even though they had never used something similar before, and reported feeling confident that others in their community could use it: 
 <italic>“[All participants]</italic>, 
 <italic>there is no problem</italic>, 
 <italic>[using the test] is easy</italic>, 
 <italic>so [other people in community] could also use it like us”</italic> (FGD, Deum Chan village). They felt the procedures were simple, requiring only a few drops of blood: 
 <italic>“[The lancet] is easy to use</italic>. 
 <italic>We only press little bit</italic>, 
 <italic>the blood comes out”</italic> (FGD, Kandal village). The finger prick method was also preferable to drawing blood from vein using needle and syringes, especially for children.
