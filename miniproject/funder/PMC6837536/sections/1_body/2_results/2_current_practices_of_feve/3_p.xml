<p>In Cambodia, nearly all people reported bringing their febrile children to be checked by the Village Malaria Workers (1–2 per village) or to the nearest health center. As part of the Cambodian National Malaria Program, village malaria workers (who are usually the heads of the villages) record and report children with fever (&gt;37.5 C) to health surveillance teams (called Fever Investigator Team) who then take blood samples for rapid testing and refer children to health facilities if necessary. Some parents reported taking their febrile children directly to health facilities because they worried about giving medicine to their children without a doctor’s consent: 
 <italic>“We could not give any [not prescribed] medicine to them since they are children</italic>. 
 <italic>We could not give medicine prescribed by [seller] at pharmacy</italic>. 
 <italic>We need to go first to see doctor</italic>, 
 <italic>then [he/she] prescribes the drug”</italic> (FGD Deum Chan). Some health workers reported that people self-medicated with medicine purchased at pharmacies or visited private clinics, where they felt services were friendlier and faster.
