<p>The participants who viewed an instructional video in Peru were observed to be more confident and proficient in applying the device compared to those only using written information: 
 <italic>“With the instructions I can do it</italic>, 
 <italic>but with the video it is better”</italic> (FGD with community members inside study zone in Iquitos). We observed that those who saw the video prior to device use only referred to written instructions as a 
 <italic>reminder</italic> of the steps versus others who depended exclusively on the written instructions for each step. Participants mentioned that illiterate users would need very clear picture instructions.
