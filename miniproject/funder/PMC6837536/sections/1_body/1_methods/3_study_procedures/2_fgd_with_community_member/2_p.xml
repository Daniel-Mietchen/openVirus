<p>In the Peru FGDs, we then asked for volunteers to try and use the device, by breaking the participants into two groups: in each group, one FGD participant applied the RDT and another participant guided the person applying the RDT, while facilitators (ACM, JC, ER, AV, LQ) acted as patients. During the first two FGD, only paper instructions (step by step photos and text for each image) were provided (see Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007773.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007773.g002">2</xref>); in subsequent groups, an instructional video was developed by the research team so that participants could observe the procedure being conducted step by step. After each FGD, modifications were made to the video based on observations of this activity; this process allowed the research team to evaluate different ways to convey instructions and assess what worked best. Participantsâ€™ ability to use the device correctly, preferences for documenting observed results (
