  <title>Ex vivo cellular reactivity to EBOV LFn fusion proteins, Lagos, Nigeria.</title>
  <p>PBMC samples from the EVD survivors and documented EVD contacts were treated with the LFn-EBOV fusion proteins and the IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ cellular responses were detected by LFn ELISPOT ex vivo experiments. Average magnitude of convalescent IFN-γ (A) and TNF-α (B) responses are shown. Dotted lines represent the cut-off value. Control HCWs, control healthcare workers. *, p &lt; 0.05.</p>
