  <title>Ex vivo CD8+ and CD4+ cellular reactivity to EBOV LFn fusion proteins, Lagos, Nigeria.</title>
  <p>CD8+ and CD4+ cells from the EVD survivors and documented EVD contacts were treated with the LFn-EBOV fusion proteins and the IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ responses were detected by LFn ELISPOT ex vivo experiments. Individual and mean CD8+ IFN-γ+ (A) and TNF-α+ (B) and CD4+ IFN-γ+ (C) and TNF-α+ (D) responses are shown. Dotted lines represent the cut-off value.
