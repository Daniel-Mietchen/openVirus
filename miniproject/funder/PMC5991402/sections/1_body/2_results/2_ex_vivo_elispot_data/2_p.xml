<p>In most cases, the EVD survivors and the seropositive contacts mounted the strongest IFN-γ and TNF-α cellular against LFn-EBOV-NP, p&lt;0.05. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006530.g004">Fig 4</xref>). IFN-γ and TNF-α cellular responses against LFn-EBOV-GP1 were stronger compared to responses against LFn-EBOV-VP40, p&lt;0.05. Additionally, the seropositive EVD contacts mounted IFN-γ and TNF-α cellular responses against LFn-EBOV-NP, -VP40, and -GP1 that were stronger in magnitude compared to survivors; similarly, IFN-γ responses against LFn-EBOV-NP and -GP1 and for TNF-α responses against LFn-EBOV-NP and -VP40 were stronger in contacts compared to survivors, p&lt;0.05.
