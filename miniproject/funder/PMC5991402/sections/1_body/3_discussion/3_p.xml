<p>Moreover, minimally symptomatic and asymptomatic EBOV infections are not new phenomena. Using an immunofluorescence assay, World Health Organization researchers identified EBOV-infected individuals who had symptoms that ranged in severity, from mild to rapidly fatal, during the first outbreaks of EBOV in Zaire and Sudan in 1976 and 1979, respectively [

In one study of Gabonese individuals with asymptomatic EVD infection, high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected in plasma samples; yet, no T cell-derived cytokines were observed [
