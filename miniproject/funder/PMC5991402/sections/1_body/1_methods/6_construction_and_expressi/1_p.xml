<p>Commercially synthesized amino acid fragments corresponding to the EBOV (Makona variant) NP, VP40, GP1, and sGP were cloned into the LFn expression plasmid (pET15bLFn), which contains a T7 promoter, histidine tag, and the terminal domain of the anthrax lethal factor. The EBOV NP, VP40, GP1, and sGP sequences were derived consensus sequences generated from the initial 99 genomes initially published during the 2013â€“2016 outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006530.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The pET15bLFn containing the coding sequences of EBOV NP, VP40, and GP1 were transformed into E. coli BLR (DE3) (Millipore, Medford, MA, USA) for expression. Clones containing the correct reading frame as verified by sequencing were used for protein expression, as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006530.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The pET15bLFn was expressed and purified as described above for use as a negative control.
