<p id="Par10">Vero E6 cells were used for viral multiplication. Cytopathic effects (CPE) appeared 48 h after inoculating virus, and more than 70% CPE with cell clustering, detachment, and syncytium formation were observed at 72 h. These results indicated that the isolated PEDV could cause pathological changes in Vero E6 cells (Fig.
