<p id="Par12">The sequence identity between PEDV strains in this studies and typical strains in terms of their according genes or regions were calculated. The highest percentage of nucleotide identities of 5′-UTR, ORF1a/1b, S, M, N, E, ORF3, and 3′-UTR of PEDV compared with other PEDV strains were show in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. For ORF1a/1b gene, these strains are most similar to these strains, LZW, SHQPYM2013, AJ1102, CH/YNKM-8/2013, CH/JX-1/2013, USAKansas1252014, and CHZMDZY11, respectively. For S gene, these strains are most similar to these strains LZW, KoreaK14JB01, USAIllinois972013, USAKansas1252014, and CH/GDZQ/2014, respectively. The percentage of nucleotide identities of S of PEDV strains in this study compared with recombined strains SeCoV is 90.4–90.7%. For M gene, these strains are most similar to these strains USAIllinois972013 and USAKansas1252014. For N gene, these strains are most similar to these strains LZW and CHYJ130330. For E gene, these strains are most similar to these strains LZW, CH/JX-1/2013, and CH/YNKM-8/2013. For ORF3 gene, these strains are most similar to these strains LZW, CH/JX-1/2013, USAIllinois972013, USAKansas1252014, and CH/GDZQ/2014, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
