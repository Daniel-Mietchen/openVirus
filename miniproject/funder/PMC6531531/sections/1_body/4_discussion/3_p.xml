<p id="Par16">The 1–1180 bp section in the S1 region of PEDV genes is prone to mutate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Sequence analysis revealed that isolated PEDV strains and these variant PEDV strains were reported had insertion in 167–178 sites (GTGAAAACCAGG) and 421–423 sites (TGA), also deletion in 218 (A), 471–474 (ATAT) and 481–482 (TG) comparing with CV777. These insertion, deletion, or introducing stop codon (TGA) of sequence resulted in frameshift mutation and abnormally transcripts of S1 gene. It is a reason for failed vaccination with CV777 vaccine. However, different from other recent isolates, these strains in the Beijing area had shared sites with CV777 in the S1 region, such as A5G (this specific nucleotide change led to the amino acid change K–R), C70T, and T1043C (which led to the amino acid change F–S). This determined the genetic correlation between these strains in the Beijing area and the CV777 strain. It was remarkable that E sequences of isolates in the Beijing area had distinct differences from other isolates. There were unique variations in the E gene in these strains, such as T27G. This showed that these isolates from the Beijing area had unique mutations. This might provide a gene reference for other mutations of PEDV in the future.
