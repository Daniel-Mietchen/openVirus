<p id="Par14">Since 2011, a large number of piglets died as a result of PEDV outbreaks, causing much economic loss in China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The phylogenetic trees showed that, these PEDV isolates from the Beijing area belonged to group II, while the traditional vaccine strain, CV777, belonged to group I based on the comparison of several important genes in PEDV, such as ORF1a/1b, S, M, N, E, and ORF3. However, N, as a conserved gene, was inconsistent with the above results, which also suggested that the N sequence or protein is suitable for universal detection. The ORF1a/1b gene were two long ORFs which encoding the non-structural replicase polyproteins of PEDV. The strain from 2015 in the Beijing area shared the greatest homology in ORF1a/1b with LZW, which was also isolated in Beijing; it showed the continuity of heredity.
