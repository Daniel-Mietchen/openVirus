<p id="Par17">Viral gene recombination and mutation results in evolution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Gene recombination and mutation often occurs in coronavirus, such as PEDV, SARSCoV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There is evidence that the S gene of epidemic PEDV strains and genome of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TEGV) strains have recombined when both were present in the same host to form a new recombinant porcine coronavirus, SeCoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This S sequence of SeCoV strain share above 90% homology with S sequence of PEDV strains in this study. However, analysis of the recombination of PEDV strains showed that, no recombination event was occurred between SeCoV strain and PEDV strains in this study. These PEDV strains isolated in Beijing area shows recombination events with PEDV isolated in USA, PEDV isolated in Korea, and PEDV isolated in China in sequence. It suggests the accelerated spread of PEDV virus.
