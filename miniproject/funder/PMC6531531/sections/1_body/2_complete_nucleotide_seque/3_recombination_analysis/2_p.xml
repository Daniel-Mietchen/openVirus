<p id="Par9">The putative recombinant sequence of these strains in this study and its parental strains were conducted using recombination detection program (RDP) version 4.97 with seven recombination detection methods (RDP, GENECONV, Chimaera, MaxChi, BootScan, SiScan, and 3Seq). In order to improve the reliability of detection, the recombination breakpoints through at least 5 of these methods was taken as confirmatory for any putative recombination event (
 <italic>p</italic> value is 0.01). The phylogenetic tree of recombination and non-recombination were constructed to verify the reliability of these results.
