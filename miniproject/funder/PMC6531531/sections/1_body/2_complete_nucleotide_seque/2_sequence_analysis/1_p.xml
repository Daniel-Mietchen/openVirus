<p id="Par7">Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of PEDV were aligned by the ClustalW method. Sequence alignments of the whole genome and construction of trees were also performed by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA7 software. Information of the other strains that were chosen in this study, including years and locations of isolation and GenBank accession numbers proposed, are shown in TableÂ
