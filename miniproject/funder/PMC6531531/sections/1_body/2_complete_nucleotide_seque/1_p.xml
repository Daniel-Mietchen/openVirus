<p id="Par6">Total RNA was obtained from intestine samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA), per the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, USA), and was used for cDNA synthesis. PCR was performed to amplify the target gene using specific primers (reference sequence number: NC003436.1), as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. PCR reaction contained primers, cDNA, dNTP mix and Hifi polymerase (Transgen, China) in 1× Hifi buffer. PCR products were sequenced from both ends by Sangon Biotech co. ltd. The coding sequences for PEDV were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers MG546687-MG546690.
