<p id="Par2">Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly infectious disease of swine. It causes severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and death in suckling and nursing piglets that are typically 1–2 weeks of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The virus strain was first isolated in Belgium in 1973 and designated coronavirus CV777 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There were only a few reports in the following decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, a new PEDV strain has emerged in Asia since 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In China, the positive rate of PEDV in some provinces was over 50% in 2010–2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In USA, classical PEDV first identified in the state of Ohio in 2013, and a variant PEDV was reported in 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Japan, more than 490,000 pigs died of PED from 2013 to 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In Korea, PED outbreaks reoccurred in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In Europe, isolates were reported from the Ukraine, Belgium, Holland, France, Germany, Portugal and Italy from 2013 to 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These isolates were closely related to those strains reported from North America [
