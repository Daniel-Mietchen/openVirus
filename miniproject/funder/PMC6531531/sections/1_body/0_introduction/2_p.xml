<p id="Par3">Diarrhea disease broke out in some large-scale pig farms in the Beijing area of China from 2015 to 2016. The newborn piglets had high mortality rates, resulting in heavy loss to pig farms. The CV777 vaccines used failed. PEDV strains were isolated and identified from the small intestine of diarrhea samples obtained at these pig farms. Whole genome sequencing and recombinant analysis was performed, with the aim of examining the genomes for viral mutations and recombination. The molecular epidemiological information of PEDV can help develop efficient diagnostic reagent and vaccine.</p>
