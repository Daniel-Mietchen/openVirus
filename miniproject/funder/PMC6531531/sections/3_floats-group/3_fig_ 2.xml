  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of the PEDV nucleotide sequences of 22 PEDV isolates, including the reference strains. The trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA7 software. Bootstrap values were indicated for each node from 1000 replicates. The names of the strains, years and places of isolation, as well as GenBank accession numbers proposed, are shown in Table 
   <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The strains in this study are indicated by underline
