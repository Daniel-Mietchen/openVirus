<p>The influenza epidemic situation varies greatly among different regions. China has a vast territory that spans tropical, subtropical and temperate regions, and it is a large challenge to establish an influenza prediction mechanism in the whole country. Liaoning province is located in both a coastal and bordered region in the northeastern part of China, where the feasibility of influenza prediction models based on internet search query data is still unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether an early warning model utilizing both online influenza query data and traditional surveillance data could improve influenza prediction.</p>
