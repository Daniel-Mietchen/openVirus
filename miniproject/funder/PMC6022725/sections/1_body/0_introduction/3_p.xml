<p>Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms, the application of SVM to classification and regression has been a hot topic recently. For solving the regression problem, SVMs have been applied to many fields: air quality forecasting (

 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Lampos et al. (2015)</xref> indicated that a nonlinear query modeling approach presented the lowest cumulative nowcasting error. 
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al. (2016)</xref> found that the SVM regression model based on weekly influenza incidence data and query data from the Korean website Daum performed well. 
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al. (2017b)</xref> comprehensively assessed six machine learning algorithms based on Baidu search engine data and Dengue case data in Guangdong proposed that SVM regression model had a better performance than other forecasting techniques. Thus, this article attempted to build a SVM regression model to predict the flu activity.
