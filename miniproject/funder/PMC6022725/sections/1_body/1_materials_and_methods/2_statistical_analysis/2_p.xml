<p>The influenza case surveillance data was divided into two parts, the fitting dataset and the validation dataset in SVM regression model. Forty-five months’ data from January 2011 to September 2014 was used for model training, and the rest 15 months’ data from October 2014 to December 2015 was used as the test set for model prediction. The choice of three parameters (
 <italic>C</italic>, γ, ε) in the SVM regression model was determined by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) during the model construction process. Three metrics were adopted to measure the performance of the SVM regression model, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These three metrics are measures of prediction accuracy of a forecasting method in statistics. RMSE is very sensitive to the extreme errors or very small errors in a set of measurements, therefore RMSE can well reflect the precision of the forecasting. RMSPE is a percent difference between predicted and true values. MAPE is the most common measure of forecast error and it functions best when there are no extremes to the data (including zeros). The definitions of these three metrics are provided below. The notation in the study is as follows:
