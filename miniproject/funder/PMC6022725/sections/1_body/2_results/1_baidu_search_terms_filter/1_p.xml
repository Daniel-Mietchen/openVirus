<p>According to the filtering criteria, there were 46 search terms left due to the available sequential data within one calendar year during the study period (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Table S1</xref>). The Pearson correlation analysis was made between search terms and influenza cases across different lag periods (in the same month, at a lag of one month, at a lag of two months and three months). The correlation value of search terms with the influenza cases in the non-flu season is provided as a basal level of their relationship (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Twenty-nine of the remaining 46 terms were excluded, because their Pearson correlation coefficients between the search terms and influenza cases were less than 0.4 across every lag period. A total of 17 search terms which were strongly correlated with influenza cases across different lag periods were retained for the construction of SVM regression model, including nine queries in the same month, three queries at a lag of one month, one query at a lag of two months and four queries at a lag of three months (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Meanwhile, the amount of influenza cases might have an impact on the amount of incident cases of the following months. The Pearson correlation analysis was performed to compare the relationship between the reported number of influenza cases of the month and historically reported number of influenza cases. The correlation coefficients were 0.672, 0.498 and 0.151 at the lag time of one month, two months and three months, respectively. The reported number of influenza cases at the lag time of one month has shown the strongest correlation, thus it was submitted to SVM regression model.
