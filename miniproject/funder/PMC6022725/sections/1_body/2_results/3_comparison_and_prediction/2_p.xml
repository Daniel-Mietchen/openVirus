<p>The predicted values of the above three models and the actual number of influenza cases from October 2014 to December 2015 have been presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>. It was easily to find that the SVM model predictionâ€™s curve was almost identical when comparing the model based on internet search query data with the model based on ensemble data, and trend of the curve were consistent with the overall development trend of the actual influenza cases curve. The SVM regression model based on ensemble data was capable of predicting the timing and magnitude of most periods, whereas it failed to predict the influenza outbreak peak in March 2015. The predictions of the model based on flu data at the lag time of one month were significantly lower than the actual value in the previous six-month forecasting, but the overall trend was consistent in the following nine months. The residual of each predictor is displayed in
