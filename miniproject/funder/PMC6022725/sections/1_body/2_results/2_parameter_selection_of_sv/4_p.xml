<p>During the process of leave-one-out cross-validation, we started from the default value (γ = 0.0556, ε = 0.1), then we adjusted the 
 <italic>C</italic> value to observe the model fitting results (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The same method was applied to the selection of the other two parameters, γ and ε (
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="table-5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The values of these three parameters were evaluated according to the lowest test error, then the optimal parameters of the model were determined (
 <italic>C</italic> = 2, γ = 0.005, ε = 0.0001).
