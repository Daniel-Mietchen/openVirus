<p>The present study showed that the forecasting model based on internet search query was better than the model based on traditional data in terms of accuracy and stability. The results were consistent with the results of other studies (

 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Olson et al. (2013)</xref> investigated the reliability of Google Flu Trends (GFT) of 2003 to 2013 and compared the flu timing and intensity between forecasting data and actual influenza incidence at the national, regional and local levels. They concluded that GFT data could not serve as the reliable surveillance for seasonal or pandemic influenza and traditional surveillance are still irreplaceable. The main reason was that GFT was based on internet data without considering the epidemiological factors such as the age distribution of patients, geographical location, illness complaints or clinical manifestations. Our study proved the advantages of ensemble source data integrating traditional influenza incidence data and search engine data in the field of forecasting. Meanwhile, there may be some space to improve the SVM model presented in the present study. Although most of the forecasting values were fitted well with actual influenza cases in the SVM regression model, they failed to identify the influenzaâ€™s peak in March 2015. The climatic factors have great impact on Influenza incidence (
