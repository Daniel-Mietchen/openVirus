<p>Strong correlation between influenza cases and search terms of Baidu was found in the present study. Influenza is characterized by a short incubation period and a sudden onset of symptoms such as fever, cough (usually dry), etc., and it is reasonable that most of search terms about flu virus, symptoms and therapy closely correlated with influenza cases at the same month. The most effectively vaccine injection timing is about one to two months prior to the flu season. Winter and spring are the peak flu seasons in Liaoning, China, thus September and October are the best months for flu vaccination in the study area. The search behavior about flu vaccine is often earlier than the vaccination timing, so we found that the search terms of Baidu at a lag of three months had a strong correlation with the occurrence of influenza cases.</p>
