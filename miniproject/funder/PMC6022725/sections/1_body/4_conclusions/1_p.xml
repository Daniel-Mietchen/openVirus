<p>The present study built a forecasting model based on ensemble data integrating Baidu search query data and traditional flu data in Liaoning province. The model based on ensemble data showed the best accuracy and best robustness in SVM regression model, rather than the models based on other single data sources. It could be a complement of the traditional surveillance for influenza dynamics in Liaoning.</p>
