<p>A nomogram was formulated based on the results of the multivariable Cox regression analyses. The regression coefficient of different variables in the Cox regression equation and the extreme difference of the variables were used to calculate the product of the regression coefficient and the range of the different variables. Assuming that the largest product variable is 10 points, and assuming that the variable is a reference variable, the score corresponding to each unit of the variable could be calculated according to the range. The other variables were multiplied by the score corresponding to each unit of the reference variable according to the ratio of the regression coefficient to the regression coefficient of the reference variable, and the score corresponding to each unit of the variable was calculated. After calculating the score for each variable, the nomogram was formulated using the nomogram function of the RMS packages [
