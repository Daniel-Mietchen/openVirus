<p>All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation or medians with interquartile ranges, while categorical variables are presented as frequencies or percentages of events. The two-sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the relationship between the survival and mortality for continuous data. The Pearson chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare differences in proportion between groups, as appropriate. Independent risk factors were identified by univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses for predicting mortality.</p>
