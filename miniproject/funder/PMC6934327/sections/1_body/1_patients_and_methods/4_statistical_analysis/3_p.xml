<p>The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index). The maximum C-index value is 1.0, which indicates a perfect prediction model, whereas 0.5 indicates a random chance to correctly predict outcome by the model. The model was validated using bootstrapped resampling to quantify any overfitting. The calibration curve for the nomogram used 1000 repeated samples to obtain the corresponding actual incidence rate and 95% confidence interval (CI) at different probability levels to evaluate the consistency of model prediction. Bootstrap sampling was performed using the RMS packages in R version 3.0.2 (The R Project for Statistical Computing,

Calibration curves of the nomogram for 7-, 14-, and 28-days were applied to assess the agreement between predicted and observed survival. Clinical survival outcomes were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier analysis and prognostic groups were compared by the log-rank test. The X-tile software package [
