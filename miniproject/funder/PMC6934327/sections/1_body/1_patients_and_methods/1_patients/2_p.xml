<p>Patients diagnosed with SFTS were included in the study. The diagnosis of SFTS was confirmed by: 1) acute fever (temperature &gt;37.5 °C for over 24 h) with thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100×10
 <sup>9</sup> /L); and 2) laboratory-confirmed SFTSV infection by detection of viral RNA (fluorescent probe PCR, BGI-GBI, Beijing, China), and/or virus-specific IgM antibody in the peripheral blood (ELISA, Zhongshan Bio-Tech CO., LTD, Guangdong, China) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Those two tests are routinely used for the diagnosis of SFTS in China. Routine validation is carried out using samples sent by the China Information System for Diseases Control and Prevention. The exclusion criteria were: 1) laboratory-confirmed other pathogen infection including Platts and Mori rickettsia, Orientia tsutsugamushi, Hantavirus, etc.; or 2) history of acute or chronic blood system diseases.
