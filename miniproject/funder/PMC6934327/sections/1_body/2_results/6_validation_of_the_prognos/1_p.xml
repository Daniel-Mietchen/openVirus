<p>The C-index for the established nomogram to predict the death risk was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.93). ROC curves and calibration plots were performed to validate the predictive accuracy of the nomogram. The 7-, 14-, and 28-days survival ROC results had AUCs of 0.944 (95% CI: 0.920–0.968), 0.924 (95% CI: 0.896–0.953), and 0.924 (95% CI: 0.895–0.952), respectively (Figs
