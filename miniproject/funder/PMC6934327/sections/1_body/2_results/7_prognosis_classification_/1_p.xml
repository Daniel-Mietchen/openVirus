<p>According to the nomogram we established, patients were divided into three levels of death risk: low, moderate, and high. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, among the patients with &lt;18 points, only six patients died (2.2%). There were 25 patients with 18–26 points who died (24.0%, HR = 11.957). If patients scored points ≥27, the mortality rate was 69.1% (HR = 57.768). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed cumulative mortality in patients with different risk levels in primary cohort. The cumulative mortality was significantly different among the three groups (
