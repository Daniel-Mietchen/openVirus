<p>All patients exhibited early leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and impairment of myocardial functions. Patients with fatal outcomes had a higher percentage of neutrophils, and lower percentages and absolute counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the levels of creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isozyme (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were significantly increased and APTT was markedly longer in the mortality group compared with the survival group. Interestingly, unlike patients with HFRS, only a small number of patients with SFTS, especially in fatal cases, showed mild renal impairment. Levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (sCr) in fatal patients were significantly higher than in non-fatal cases (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Though the fatal group had a relatively higher concentration of serum potassium and bilirubin (TBil), and lower percentage of prothrombin activity, the levels were still within the normal range.
