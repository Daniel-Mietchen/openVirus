<p>The coefficients obtained from the Cox regression model were used to establish the nomograms for death (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007829.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Each parameter within the variables was assigned a score. By adding up the total score from all the variables and locating it to the total point scale, we could determine the probabilities of death by drawing a vertical line to the total score. The nomograms included all the five risk factors screened by the multivariable Cox analysis: older age, low lymphocyte percentage, early-stage encephalopathy, and elevated serum LDH and BUN levels. Details concerning the point assignment for the nomogram and the prognostic score are shown in
