<p>Univariable Cox regression analyses revealed that older age, presence of encephalopathy, decreased percentage of lymphocytes, low PTA, elevated percentage of neutrophil, and elevated levels of CK, CK-MB, LDH (ULN), ALT, AST, BUN, sCr, and APTT were risk factors for fatal outcomes. The above variables were used for multivariable Cox regression analyses. The results indicated that low lymphocyte percentage, early-stage encephalopathy, and elevated concentration of serum LDH and BUN were independent risk factors for fatal outcomes. The detailed results of the multivariable analyses are shown in
