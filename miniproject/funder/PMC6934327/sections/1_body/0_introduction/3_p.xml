<p>The management of SFTS still faces issues such as unclear pathogenesis, lack of specific treatment, and no approved vaccines. The clinical symptoms of SFTS are non-specific and often need to be differentiated from human anaplasmosis and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantavirus, since those two diseases are also found in the same geographical areas [

In addition, there is still no consensus on the staging and classification of SFTS and, so far, there is no specific antiviral therapy. Therefore, identifying risk factors for death of SFTS can be helpful for further understanding of the viral pathogenesis and revealing the cause of death. Early identification of critically ill patients is very important to carry out symptomatic treatments to reduce the mortality rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need for establishing a death risk predictive scoring system, assessing the severity of illness, and predicting the risk of death in order to take effective public health measures to control the epidemic and to recognize which patients require early interventions. Public health measures could eventually include better education for better recognition of the disease by front-line physicians.
