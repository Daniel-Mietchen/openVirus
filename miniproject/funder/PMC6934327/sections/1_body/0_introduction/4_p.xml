<p>In the present prospective cohort study, we analyzed the clinical information of patients with SFTS at the early stage of the disease. We compared the data between the survival and mortality groups using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses in order to screen for significant critical early-stage factors related to death. Based on this analysis, we established a SFTS nomogram scoring system, which is intuitional, fast, practical, and operable [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and is the first nomogram for this disease. Using this scoring system, we divided the patients into three levels of mortality risk: low, moderate, and high. This nomogram can identify critically ill patients at the early stage and could allow mortality reduction.
