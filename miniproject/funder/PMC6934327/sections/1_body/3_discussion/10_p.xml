<p>Our study has some limitations. First, some patients have given up on further medical treatment because of financial conditions when the disease progressed, and some severely ill patients were lost to follow-up. Second, due to the limited laboratory resources in some primary hospitals, viral load detection of SFTSV could not be conducted at all centers. Third, post-mortem examination was not performed in all cases. Finally, the nomogram we established needs to be improved by external prospective cohorts. For this reason, we are undertaking a prospective study on a larger cohort of SFTS patients hospitalized since September 2018 to validate the predictive value of this model.</p>
