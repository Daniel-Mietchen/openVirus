<p>In the present study, laboratory parameters showed that the levels of platelets and leukocytes were reduced in patients who died, while neutral granulocytopenia was predominant and hemoglobin was normal. On the other hand, the nadir of white blood cells and thrombocytopenia were not significantly related to fatal outcomes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While the level of leukocytes and lymphocytes are both decreased in both groups, their percentages in fatal patients are significantly lower than survivors. These results suggest that the damage or consumption of lymphocytes is more serious in non-surviving patients, indicating more severe acquired immune injury in non-surviving patients. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that decreased percentage and number of CD4 T cells, including Th1, Th2, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), were associated with an increased severity of SFTS. In addition, increased percentages of Th2, Th17 and Tregs in residual CD4 T cells, as well as skewing of Th17/Treg and Th2/Th1 ratios, may cause poor outcomes in SFTS patients. Hu et al. found that inflammatory mediators remained at high levels when death occurred, while they recovered within 3 weeks in surviving patients, indicating that the occurrence of immunologic injury and inflammatory storm in SFTS patients were associated with the severity of SFTS [
