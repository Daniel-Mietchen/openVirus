<p>In conclusion, SFTS is broadly distributed in central and northeastern China. The mortality rate is high. The main clinical manifestations are acute fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, often accompanied multiple organ damage, such as CNS, myocardial, liver, and coagulation function. The severe injuries of the myocardium and central nervous system caused by SFTSV infection are major causes of increased risk of death. Older age, early-stage encephalopathy, decreased lymphocyte percentage, and elevated serum levels of BUN and LDH are independent predictors of death. We established a simple and practical clinical scoring system, through which the patients can be classified as low-, moderate-, and high-risk of mortality. We can identify critically ill patients and provide intensive medical intervention for patients as soon as possible, which may contribute to reducing the mortality of SFTS.</p>
