<p>In addition to the hematologic system, SFTS can also cause multiple organ damage such as to the myocardium, coagulation function, liver, and kidney. Consistent with previous research [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we also observed that parameters of myocardial injury such as LDH, CK, CK-MB, and AST levels were elevated in most patients with SFTS who do not survive. The higher the LDH levels, the higher the mortality of SFTS. This result is in accordance with the conclusion of reports by Gai et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Cui et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the present study, some patients with fatal outcomes exhibited arrhythmia, pulmonary edema, and circulatory failure, which might be the actual cause of death. While the specificity of LDH is limited, its sensitivity is high; therefore, when it increases shortly after infection, along with elevated CK, CK-MB, and AST levels, and especially when cardiac dysrhythmia or dysfunction occurs, it could be a sensitive predictor of fatal outcomes for patients with SFTS.
