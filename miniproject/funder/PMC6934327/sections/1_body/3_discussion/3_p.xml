<p>In addition to systemic symptoms, patients who eventually die show higher frequencies of vomiting, diarrhea, petechia or ecchymosis, and lymphadenopathy [

On the other hand, we observed that the frequency of encephalopathy in the mortality group was higher than in the survival group, while the frequency of headache was higher in the survival group. The patients in the mortality group might report headache less frequently due to disturbance of consciousness at admission and inability to accurately describe their complaints. Several previous studies reported that manifestations of the central nervous symptom (CNS) such as apathy, hypersomnia, coma, muscle twitching, and hyperspasmia were high-risk factors of death in patients with SFTS [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Park et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported that the CNS manifestations of SFTS, including acute encephalopathy/encephalitis, are common complications of SFTS. Although meningeal inflammation is infrequent in patients with SFTS-associated encephalopathy/encephalitis (SFTSAE), SFTSV is frequently detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), along with elevated monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and IL-8. These findings indicate that direct CNS invasion by the SFTSV with elevated cytokine levels in the CSF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SFTSAE [

In addition, Masahiko et al. performed an autopsy of a Japanese patient who died of SFTS and found that the rapidly progressive CNS involvement in patient with SFTS might be a result of direct damage caused by infiltration of SFTSV-positive cells into the brain tissues [
