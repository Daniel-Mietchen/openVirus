<p>sCr and BUN levels were mildly elevated in the mortality group. The multivariable analysis showed that BUN was an independent risk factor for fatal outcome, as supported by previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The main causes of increased BUN could be high protein diet, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and blood volume (hypovolemia), congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, and increased catabolism. Elevated BUN plays a role in predicting fatal outcome, indicating that BUN reflects the general disease conditions after the onset of SFTS, which include fever, poor nutritional status, increased catabolism, impaired early renal function, and/or insufficient circulating blood volume.
