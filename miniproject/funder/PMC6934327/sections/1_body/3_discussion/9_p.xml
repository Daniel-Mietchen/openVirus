<p>At present, the pathogenesis of SFTS and the exact cause of death are still unclear and there is no specific antiviral treatment available, which is the reason why the mortality rate is still so high. By identifying risk factors for death of SFTS, our work provides useful information for the study of the pathogenesis of this viral infection. We found that age, percentage of lymphocytes, and BUN were host factors. Elevated LDH level and early-stage encephalopathy indicate that the severe injuries to the myocardium and central nervous system by the viral infection are major causes of increased risk of death. In addition,

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We are conducting a clinical trial of favipiravir treatment of SFTS. Classification of the patients according to the severity of the disease at the early stage using the scoring system we established in this study will benefit further research on drug efficacy and side effects.
