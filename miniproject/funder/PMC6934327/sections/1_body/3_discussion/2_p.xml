<p>In the present study, 69 patients died (16.1%). Sex was not associated with mortality, but the mean age was significantly higher among those who died, as supported by previous studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Older patients usually have a higher incidence and duration of comorbidities and poor compensatory organ function, which might explain, at least in part, the higher mortality than that observed in younger patients. The mortality rate of SFTS is high, but the CDC reports contrary results [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The possible reasons for this discrepancy may include: 1) frontline physicians may have insufficient understanding of this disease and fail to diagnose it; and 2) many hospitals are unable to detect SFTSV and cannot make the accurate diagnosis in the first place. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance the diagnosis and management of this disease through a comprehensive reporting system, education about SFTS, exploration of the risk factors for death, early identification of critically ill patients, and early intensive medical intervention.
