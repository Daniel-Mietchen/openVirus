<p>Based on the univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, we established for the first time a mortality risk predictive nomogram for SFTS. Five independent risk factors (older age, early-stage encephalopathy, decreased lymphocyte percentage, and elevated serum concentration of BUN and LDH) were found to be associated with 7-, 14-, and 28 days mortality. The C-index of the prognostic nomogram is 0.91, which shows high value for predicting fatal outcome. The nomogram was applied to the original cohort and the calibration plots showed fair concordance between the nomogram predictions and actual observations for 7-, 14-, and 28-days overall survival. These results strongly support the usefulness of the nomogram in patients with SFTS. Moreover, according to the scoring system, the patients can be divided as low-, moderate-, and high-risk mortality. previous studies attempted scores for predicting the outcomes of SFTF. Wang et al.

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] established a scoring system using 174 patients and in which the AUC was 0.894. In the system by Xiong et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the viral load is included, but not all hospitals in China are able to determine the exact viral load and this scoring system is impractical. In addition, their score relies on a complicated formula. Jia et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] developed a simple scoring system based on three variables, but it also has a complicated formula. The prominent advantages of our nomogram include that all factors can be obtained through routine examinations, in a timely manner soon after admission, and the score sheet is concise. The nomogram provides fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. It is practical and intuitional for primary care physicians in the countryside, who are likely to be the first-line doctors to identify this infectious disease. In addition, similar nomograms are available for other infectious diseases such as acute-on-chronic liver failure, bacteremia-urinary tract infections (b-UTI), maternal cytomegalovirus serostatus, and risk of HIV acquisition [
