<p>SFTS is widely distributed in China, being endemic in more than 20 provinces [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The mortality of SFTS ranges from 11.2% to 30%. In addition to China, SFTS has been reported in Korea, Japan, and the United States [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The incidence, clinical manifestations, and mortality of SFTS are similar to those in China, especially in South Korea. There are outbreaks by nosocomial infection, and the mortality is much higher than the rate reported in China [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007829.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This study aimed to analyze the clinical information of patients with early-stage SFTS and to establish a nomogram for the mortality risk. The resulting nomogram is a simple and practical clinical scoring system, through which we can identify critically ill patients and provide intensive medical intervention for patients as soon as possible to reduce mortality.
