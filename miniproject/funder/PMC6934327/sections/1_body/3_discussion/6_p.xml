<p>Liver damage is a significant manifestation of SFTS [

We also found that APTT prolongation is common in SFTS patients, especially in the mortality group, with a significantly longer APTT than in survivors. On the other hand, there was no significant jaundice. Furthermore, the ratio of AST/ALT was much higher, suggesting that the AST levels not only indicate acute liver damage, but also reflect the presence of myocardial injury. These results indicate that although patients with SFTS have severe liver inflammation and coagulation abnormalities in the early stage of the disease, liver failure do not occur in all patients who die. While SFTS infection affects the liver function, it is probably not the main cause of death.
