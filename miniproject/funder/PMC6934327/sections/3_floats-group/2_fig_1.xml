  <title>SFTS survival rate nomogram.</title>
  <p>To use the nomogram, the value of an individual patient is located on each variable axis, and a line is drawn upward to determine the number of points received for the value of each variable. The sum of these numbers is located on the total point axis, and a line is drawn downward to the survival axes to determine the probability of 7-, 14-, and 28-days survivals. LYM (%) lymphocyte percentage; LDH lactate dehydrogenase; BUN Blood urea nitrogen. *LDH (ULN) Multiple of the normal upper limit of lactate dehydrogenase.</p>
