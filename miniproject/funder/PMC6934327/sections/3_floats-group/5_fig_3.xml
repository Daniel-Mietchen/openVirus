  <title>Calibration curves of overall survival at 7, 14, and 28 days for the primary cohort.</title>
  <p>Nomogram-predicted probability of survival is plotted on the x-axis, and the actual survival is plotted on the y-axis. Dashed lines along the 45Â° line through the point of origin represent the perfect calibration models where the predicted probabilities are identical to the actual probabilities. A. Overall survival at 7 days. B. Overall survival at 14 days. C. Overall survival at 28 days.</p>
