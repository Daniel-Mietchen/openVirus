  <bold>Objectives:</bold> Viral phylogenetics revealed two patterns of HIV-1 spread among MSM in Quebec. While most HIV-1 strains (
  <italic>n </italic>=
  <italic> </italic>2011) were associated with singleton/small clusters (cluster size 1–4), 30 viral lineages formed large networks (cluster size 20–140), contributing to 42% of diagnoses between 2011 and 2015. Herein, tissue culture selections ascertained if large cluster lineages possessed higher replicative fitness than singleton/small cluster isolates, allowing for viral escape from integrase inhibitors.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods:</bold> Primary HIV-1 isolates from large 20+ cluster (
  <italic>n </italic>=
  <italic> </italic>11) or singleton/small cluster (
  <italic>n </italic>=
  <italic> </italic>6) networks were passaged
  <italic>in vitro</italic> in escalating concentrations of dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine for 24–36 weeks. Sanger and deep sequencing assessed genotypic changes under selective drug pressure.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> Large cluster HIV-1 isolates selected for resistance to dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine faster than HIV-1 strains forming small clusters. With dolutegravir, large cluster HIV-1 variants acquired solitary R263K (
  <italic>n </italic>=
  <italic> </italic>7), S153Y (
  <italic>n </italic>=
  <italic> </italic>1) or H51Y (
  <italic>n </italic>=
  <italic> </italic>1) mutations as the dominant quasi-species within 8–12 weeks as compared with small cluster lineages where R263K (
  <italic>n </italic>=
  <italic> </italic>1/6), S153Y (1/6) or WT species (4/6) were observed after 24 weeks. Interestingly, dolutegravir-associated mutations compromised viral replicative fitness, precluding escalations in concentrations beyond 5–10 nM. With elvitegravir, large cluster variants more rapidly acquired first mutations (T66I, A92G, N155H or S147G) by week 8 followed by sequential accumulation of multiple mutations leading to viral escape (&gt;10 μM) by week 24.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Further studies are needed to understand virological features of large cluster viruses that may favour their transmissibility, replicative competence and potential to escape selective antiretroviral drug pressure.
