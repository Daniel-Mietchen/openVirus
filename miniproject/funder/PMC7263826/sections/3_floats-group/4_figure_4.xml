  <p>Drug resistance selections with lamivudine, elvitegravir, dolutegravir and dolutegravir + lamivudine. Stepwise increases in drug concentrations under selective drug pressure were based on levels of RT enzymatic activity at each weekly passage relative to a no-drug control. The mean weekly drug concentrations were averaged for the four large cluster viral lineages (black lines) belonging to clusters 27 (14997), 53 (14969) and 185 (14947 and 14637) as compared with four singleton/small cluster variants (isolates 143809, 14515, 15336 and 5833, grey lines) grown under selective pressure with lamivudine, elvitegravir, dolutegravir or dolutegravir + lamivudine over 36 weeks. The arrows represent viral breakthrough based on the first acquisition of new resistance mutations presented in Figures
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4–6</xref>. Regarding lamivudine, one large cluster virus passaged with lamivudine acquired M184V leading to earlier viral escape by week 16; the remaining three large clusters developed M184I. DTG, dolutegravir; EVG, elvitegravir; 3TC, lamivudine.
