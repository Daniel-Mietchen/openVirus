  <p>Viral outgrowth of HIV-1 singleton/small cluster strains cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of dolutegravir. HIV-1 isolates from six singleton/small clusters (cluster size in parentheses) were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of dolutegravir. Cell-free supernatant was collected at selected time periods and viral RNA purified and genotyped across the integrase domain. The frequency (%) of individual amino acid substitutions acquired in the virus population at the designated weekly passage was determined based on deep sequencing. DTG, dolutegravir.</p>
