  <p>Viral outgrowth of HIV-1 large cluster strains cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of dolutegravir. HIV-1 isolates from eight large clusters (cluster size in parentheses) were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of dolutegravir. Cell-free supernatant was collected at selected time periods and viral RNA purified and genotyped across the integrase or RT domain. The frequency (%) of individual amino acid substitutions acquired in the virus population at the designated weekly passage was determined based on deep sequencing. Cluster 14947 (a and i) was selected with both dolutegravir and dolutegravir + lamivudine to ascertain the sequential appearance of R263K and M184V. DTG, dolutegravir; 3TC, lamivudine. An asterisk indicates Sanger sequencing only.</p>
