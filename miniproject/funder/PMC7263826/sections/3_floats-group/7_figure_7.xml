  <p>Genotyping analysis based on Sanger and deep sequencing of HIV-1 small cluster strains cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of elvitegravir. HIV-1 isolates from four large clusters and two singleton/small clusters were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of elvitegravir. Cell-free supernatant was collected at selected time periods and viral RNA purified and the RT- and/or integrase-coding region sequenced using Sanger or deep sequencing as previously described. The frequency (%) of individual amino acid substitutions acquired in the virus population at the designated weekly passage was determined based on deep sequencing. EVG, elvitegravir.</p>
