<p>Genotypic analyses at selected passages evaluated the development of amino acid substitutions under selective drug pressure, conferring reduced susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs (i.e. drug resistance mutations). Sanger (population) sequencing of viral RNA or complementary DNA extracted from culture supernatants was performed as previously described.

 </xref> Deep sequencing was performed using a CLIA/CAP-validated HIV-1 genotyping assay (DEEPGENâ„¢HIV) with a &gt;1% cut-off for the detection of minority HIV-1 variants based on the intrinsic error rate of the entire system (0.3%).

 </xref> Ultradeep sequencing confirmed the homogeneity of founder variants, as well as the earliest time to emergence of resistance to integrase inhibitors.
