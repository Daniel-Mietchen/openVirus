<p>HIV-1 transmission constraints lead to a single monophyletic HIV-1 variant, termed the transmitted/founder virus, establishing most new infections. There is continued debate as to whether transmission bottlenecks are stochastic, randomly restricting all viruses, or selective, favouring specific transmission/founder viruses

 </xref> Observational data from the Montreal PHI cohort showed that cluster size and the skewed role of 30 founder viruses (1.7% of viral lineages) in 1200 forward transmissions were not directly related to patient epidemiological factors, including numbers of reported sexual partnerships and viral load.

 </xref> We postulated that HIV-1 strains associated with large clusters have unique phenotypic features in reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase replicative processes that may have contributed to heightened infectiousness and cluster burst size.
