<p>To test this hypothesis, tissue culture selections with dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine were used to compare the barriers to resistance for viruses derived from 11 patients belonging to 10 large clusters (cluster size 20–140) and 6 persons associated with singleton/small clusters (cluster size 1–4). Sanger (population) and next-generation (deep) sequencing was performed to monitor genotypic changes under selective drug pressure over 36 weeks. HIV-1 isolates from large cluster lineages demonstrated a lower genetic barrier to resistance to dolutegravir, elvitegravir and lamivudine as compared with viruses from singleton/small cluster networks. However, the rapid acquisition of R263K or S153Y mutations with dolutegravir compromised viral replicative competence and hindered viral breakthrough. Taken together, our findings show a selection bias for large cluster viral variants showing higher replicative fitness under selective drug pressure.</p>
