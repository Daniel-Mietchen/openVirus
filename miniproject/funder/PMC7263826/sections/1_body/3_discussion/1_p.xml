<p>Genetic diversity is the hallmark feature of HIV-1 contributing to the divergent spread of distinct HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant forms in different regional settings. In Quebec, the subtype B HIV-1 epidemic among MSM has not declined in the era of potent and simplified ART and improved treatment-as-prevention strategies. Viral phylogenetic cluster analysis has shown that half of the subtype B HIV-1 epidemic among MSM can be ascribed to the episodic genesis and expansion of 30 viral lineages, contributing to 13%, 25% and 42% of new diagnoses over the periods 2004–07, 2008–11 and 2012–15, respectively.

 </xref> Here we proposed that the disproportionate contribution of these 30 strains over more than a decade may be related to distinct virological features beyond the effects of risk behaviour and the high infectiousness of acute/recent stage infection. Novel findings observed in this study using
 <italic>in vitro</italic> selections revealed that HIV-1 large cluster lineages show a lower barrier to resistance when compared with viruses from singleton/small cluster networks.
