 </xref> Notably, cluster 50 (cluster size 140) and cluster 99-K103N (cluster size 34) remain persistent sub-epidemics harbouring G190A and K103N, respectively. Genetic differences between viral strains may contribute to their relative transmissibility, replicative competence and propensity towards the development of resistance. Our findings show that R263K and S153Y, once acquired, may not revert. The negative viral fitness costs of these mutations may, however, limit their development and potential transmissibility. In this regard the prevalence of resistance in patients failing integrase-based regimens was 8% in Quebec (January 2014â€“April 2016), largely associated with raltegravir- and elvitegravir-associated resistance mutations (I. Hardy and B. G. Brenner, unpublished results). Resistance to dolutegravir has, however, been limited to the G118R case and a novel resistance pathway from a raltegravir-experienced patient harbouring the N155H mutation.
