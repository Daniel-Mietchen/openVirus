<p>Given the high potency of dolutegravir in the clinic, it has proven difficult to document and characterize dolutegravir resistance profiles. Cell culture selections performed using replicatively resilient large cluster variants highlighted novel aspects regarding emergent resistance to dolutegravir that could not be otherwise ascertained.

 </xref> We observed that the rate of appearance of R263K with dolutegravir was as rapid as that observed for the appearance of M184V with lamivudine. The emergence of select mutations under dolutegravir pressure, including R263K (AGA→AAA or AGG→AAG), G163R (GGA→AGA or GGG→AGG) and E138K (GAA→AAA, GAG→AAG), may be related to APOBEC-mediated G→A hypermutation.

 </xref> Our previous studies also showed the development of G118R (GGA→AGA) in two patients failing dolutegravir monotherapy.

 </xref> These patients harboured a rare GGA natural polymorphism (1.5% prevalence) compared with the majority of clinical viral isolates harbouring GGC (79%) or GGT (18%) glycine motifs where G118R acquisition would require two point mutations (

 <underline>A</underline> or 
 <underline>G</underline>G

 <underline>C</underline>GT), respectively.

 </xref> The generation of M184I (ATG→ATA) can also arise from G to A hypermutation although M184V leads to higher fold drug resistance. Although APOBEC3G-mediated G to A hypermutation may contribute to the development of drug resistance, it can also inhibit viral replication by driving viruses into error catastrophe mode.
