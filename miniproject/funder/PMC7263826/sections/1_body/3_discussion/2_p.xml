<p>The rapid acquisition of R263K, S153Y or H51Y with dolutegravir was unexpected given the isolated number of reported cases of resistance in the clinic. Indeed, the appearance of these dolutegravir-related mutations within 6–12 weeks using HIV-1 strains from large clusters was far more rapid than previous studies by our group using laboratory strains where resistance arises after 20 weeks of culture with dolutegravir.

 </xref> Furthermore, viruses obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the laboratory strain pNL4.3 with R263K or H51Y are severely compromised in their ability to acquire or coexist with other mutations, such as M184V and T66I.

 </xref> Findings reported herein revealed the emergence of viral variants coexpressing R263K/M184V and R263K/T66I as dominant (&gt;98%) quasi-species under selective pressure with dolutegravir + lamivudine and elvitegravir, respectively. The acquisition of E157Q (94% and 99%) by two viruses (and) coexpressing T66I/R263K (&gt;98%, isolate 14947) or a mixed T66I (85.9%) and H51Y (15.9%) quasi-species (isolate 14997) under elvitegravir pressure suggests that E157Q may serve as an accessory mutation that restores viral replicative fitness and increases resistance.
