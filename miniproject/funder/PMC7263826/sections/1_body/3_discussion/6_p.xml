<p>Bottlenecks constrain HIV-1 transmission, such that a single monophyletic founder variant is responsible for establishing individual infections. Studies have compared the ‘signature’ genetic motifs and phenotypic properties of newly transmitted viruses to those of chronic-stage viruses.

 </xref> Transmitted viruses are most often CCR5-tropic, possess signature leader sequences (codon 11), show less envelope glycosylation and have shorter variable envelope loops than chronic stage viruses.

 </xref> Here, we also show an accelerated development of resistance to integrase and RT inhibitors on the part of viruses belonging to 10 different large 20+ clusters, perhaps suggesting a potential replicative and/or enzymatic fitness advantage in the subset of large cluster viruses. Studies are ongoing to ascertain RT and integrase activity for WT and resistant (R263K or S153Y) cluster 185 isolates, compared with pNL4.3. Direct study of the infection and replication properties of clinically relevant large cluster viruses in cell culture may help define distinct features of transmitted viruses and early events following infection.
