<p>As illustrated in Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>(a), drug dose escalations and viral breakthrough, under lamivudine selective pressure, progressed at faster rates in the case of large cluster lineages as compared with singleton/small cluster strains. Drug dose escalations with lamivudine in large cluster variants were associated with the appearance at week 8 of M184V (isolate 14947) or M184I (isolates 14637, 14997 and 14637). The latter isolates shifted from M184I to M184V by weeks 15â€“23, leading to higher fold resistance (&gt;100-fold) and viral escape. Small cluster isolates developed resistance more slowly, acquiring M184I infections by week 23 (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F3">3</xref>a). The rapid selection of M184V by isolate 14947 parallels that observed for CXCR4-tropic pNL4.3 reference strain grown in MT-2 cells or CBMCs. The M184I substitution conferred lower fold resistance, decreased processivity and replicative fitness than the M184V mutation.

 </xref> Large cluster variants showed a more rapid shift from M184I to M184V when compared with small cluster lineages where selection of M184I was attenuated.
