<p>Large cluster strains also showed a lower barrier to resistance to dolutegravir with R263K (

 <italic> </italic>1) mutations appearing by week 8 in large cluster lineages; these mutations were absent in the four small cluster viruses at week 36 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>c). It was, however, noteworthy that the acquisition of R263K and S153Y had a negative impact on RT enzymatic activity, hindering escalations in dolutegravir concentrations beyond 5–10 nM (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>c). Dual selections with dolutegravir and lamivudine showed the appearance of resistance in only one large cluster isolate (14947) with the first appearance of R263K at week 8 preceding the acquisition of M184I/V and M184V at weeks 15 and 23, respectively (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>d). Drug concentrations of both drugs could not be increased following the acquisition of R263K.
