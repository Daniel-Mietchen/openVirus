<p>Cell culture selections using large cluster and singleton/small cluster HIV-1 strains were conducted in parallel under the same conditions. Stepwise drug dose escalations were based on weekly RT assays, performed for each isolate in the presence and absence of drug. As illustrated in Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F3">3</xref>, viruses in both cluster groups replicated equally well in the absence of drug pressure. The progress of viral outgrowth in the presence of stepwise increasing concentrations of inhibitors over the course of 36â€‰weeks, comparing viruses belonging to cluster 185 (14947 and 14637), cluster 27 (14997) and cluster 53 (14969) and four singleton small cluster lineages (HIV-1 isolates 143809, 14515, 15336 and 5833), is depicted in Figure
