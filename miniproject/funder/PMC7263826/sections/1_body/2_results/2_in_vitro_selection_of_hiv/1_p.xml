<p>Clinical isolates from newly infected persons typically use the CCR5 receptor, show T-cell tropism and do not grow in MT-2 cells. Tissue culture selections were performed using CBMCs to characterize possible differences in the development of drug resistance to lamivudine and integrase inhibitors.

 </xref> CBMCs infected with relevant HIV-1 strains (from large or singleton/small clusters) were serially passaged over the course of 24–36 weeks in the presence of increasing concentrations of dolutegravir, elvitegravir, lamivudine or dolutegravir + lamivudine dual pressure. These drugs are recommended components of choice in first-line regimens.
