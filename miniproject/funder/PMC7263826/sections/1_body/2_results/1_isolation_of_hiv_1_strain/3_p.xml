<p>Viruses associated with the selected 10 20+ large clusters were resequenced across the integrase-coding regions. Phylogenetic trees showed similar co-clustering patterns across the integrase region as previously observed across the protease/RT domains. It was, however, noteworthy that clusters 45, 118 and 185 (cluster size = 38, 43 and 45, respectively) had a shared common branch in the integrase tree although the protease/RT regions within these three clusters were distinct (Figure
