<p>Eleven subtype B viruses belonging to 10 large 20+ clusters and 6 singleton/small clusters were derived from PHI cohort participants with estimated dates of infection of 3.7 ± 0.6 months based on Detuned/BED biological assays (Table

 </xref> The 11 large cluster strains were collectively associated with 600 transmissions in Quebec. The six singleton/small cluster variants included two reference clinical isolates (5326 and 5833) used in cell culture selections by our laboratory for over a decade. Table 
 <xref rid="dkx118-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows clinical and genotypic features of the selected viruses, illustrating that cluster size was not related to the number of reported sexual partnerships by cohort participants 3 months prior to their infection, as previously reported for the entire MSM cohort.
