<p>Interestingly, culturing HIV-1 isolate 14947 (cluster 185) with dolutegravir led to the rapid selection of variants carrying the R263K mutation, as rapidly as M184V selection with lamivudine (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>a and d). Again, the acquisition of M184V/I was faster for large cluster as compared with small cluster lineages. It is also significant that R263K arose more rapidly than M184V in dolutegravir + lamivudine dual selections performed with isolate 14947 and that both mutations can coexist (Figures
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>d and
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>i).
