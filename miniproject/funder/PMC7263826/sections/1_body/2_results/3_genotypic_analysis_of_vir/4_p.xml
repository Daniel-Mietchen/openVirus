<p>Incremental increases in dolutegravir concentrations (beyond 10 nM) following acquisition of R263K, S153Y and H51Y mutations could not be attempted because the pressure on viral survival was too great based on weekly RT assays (Figures
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>c and
 <xref rid="dkx118-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This decline in viral replicative fitness under drug pressure is consistent with cell culture selection studies and integrase enzymatic assays previously performed by our group using site-directed mutagenesis to insert resistance substitutions into the laboratory HIV-1 pNL4.3 strain.
