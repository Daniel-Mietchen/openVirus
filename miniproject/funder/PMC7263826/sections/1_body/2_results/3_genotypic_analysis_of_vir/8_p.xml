<p>It was rather surprising that R263K and H51Y did not adversely impact on viral replicative competence with elvitegravir as observed for dolutegravir (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F6">6</xref>a). Deep sequencing-based genotyping showed T66I selection occurred prior to R263K followed by E157Q, which may have compensated for the fitness compromise of R263K (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F6">6</xref>a). The presence of secondary (accessory) mutations, including T66I, E157Q, G163R and S230R, can increase levels of resistance and/or viral fitness (Figures
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>b and
 <xref rid="dkx118-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).
