<p>Cluster 185 isolates 14947 and 14637 harbouring R263K and S153Y at weeks 30 and 34, respectively, were grown in the absence of dolutegravir pressure for a subsequent 19 and 17â€‰weeks, respectively (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F4">4</xref>a and b). The release of drug pressure failed to lead to a reversion of R263K or S153Y, substantiating their presence as dominant quasi-species.
