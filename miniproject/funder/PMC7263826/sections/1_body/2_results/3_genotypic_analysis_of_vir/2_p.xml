<p>As depicted in Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>, dolutegravir selections, performed on large cluster viruses, led to rapid appearance of R263K (
 <italic>n </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>6/8) or S153Y (
 <italic>n </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>1/8) as dominant members of quasi-species within 6–8 weeks, while H51Y (
 <italic>n </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>1/8) appeared by week 12 (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>). In general, viral outgrowth under dolutegravir pressure resulted in R263K, S153Y or H51Y as singlet mutations, representing the dominant quasi-species (&gt;96%) at weeks 24–36 based on ultradeep sequencing. The infrequent appearance of S230R, E157Q, G163R or G59E minority species (&lt;10%) occurred in some large cluster selections at selected weeks of passage but failed to accumulate over time. Although isolate 14637, belonging to cluster 185, selected for S153Y (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>b), three subsequent dolutegravir selections using this isolate resulted in R263K as the sole mutation (B. G. Brenner and M. Oliveira, unpublished results). Isolate 10387 showed the dual appearance of R263K and S153F as 52% and 10.9% of the quasi-species at week 8, although R263K (99%) became and remained the dominant quasi-species at week 26 (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>d).
