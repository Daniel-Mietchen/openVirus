<p>There was a delay in the selection of dolutegravir resistance in small cluster as compared with large cluster lineages (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>). Four of six small cluster lineages (cluster sizes 1, 1, 1 and 2) failed to select any resistance to dolutegravir over 36â€‰weeks. INSTI-associated mutations were present at really low frequency as determined by deep sequencing (R263K at 1.1% and Y143H at 1.6% in 14514 and 14380, respectively) (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>c and d). The remaining two small clusters (cluster sizes 2 and 4) selected R263K or S153Y as singleton mutations (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F5">5</xref>a and b).
