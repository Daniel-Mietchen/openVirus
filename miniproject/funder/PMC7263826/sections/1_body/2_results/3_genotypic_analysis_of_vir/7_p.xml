<p>The development of resistance under elvitegravir pressure proceeded rapidly for large cluster lineages with a sequential accumulation of multiple mutations along different resistance pathways (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F7">7</xref>a–d). Isolate 14947 acquired T66I and R263K within 8 weeks, representing 98.7% and 44.9% of the quasi-species, respectively (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F6">6</xref>a). By week 24, the dominant virus coexpressed T66I (99.5%), R263K (98.7%) and E157Q (94.1%) (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F6">6</xref>a). The second isolate, belonging to cluster 185 (14637), developed resistance with viruses coexpressing N155H (99.5%), Q95K (97.5%) and S230R (99.6%) as the dominant quasi-species (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F6">6</xref>b). Isolate 14997 acquired a mixture of different viruses with T66I, E92G, E157Q, H51Y and/or S147G representing 85.9%, 19.8%, 99.7%, 15.0% and 9.9% of variants at week 36 (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F6">6</xref>c). Isolate 14969 acquired S147G (92.1%) at week 8 followed by Q148R (99.7%), known to confer high levels of cross-resistance to elvitegravir and raltegravir (Figure

 </xref> The accumulation of mutations along different pathways contributed to viral breakthrough and &gt;100-fold resistance. Similarly, the acquisition of T66I followed by secondary mutations, including L74M, Q146K, and G163R, by small cluster viruses contributed to viral escape by week 24 (Figure
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkx118-F7">7</xref>e and f).
