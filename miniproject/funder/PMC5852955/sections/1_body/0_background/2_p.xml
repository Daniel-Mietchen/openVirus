<p id="Par14">Belonging to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family in the 
 <italic>Nidovirale</italic> order, PEDV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in size that encodes four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) and nonstructural proteins (1a, 1ab, and ORF3) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among the viral proteins, the S glycoprotein is the most diverse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and plays a critical role in the process of inducing neutralizing antibodies and binding specific receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At least two B cell epitopes (SS2 and SS6) and two regions containing neutralizing epitopes (COE and 2C10) have been identified on this protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The S gene is also associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of virulence in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and was used as an important component in studies for understanding genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates, the epidemiological status, and vaccine development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The M protein is the most abundant component of viral protein in the envelope, and is responsible for morphogenesis, assembly, and budding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The N protein of coronavirus interacts with viral genomic RNA, serving as the critical basis for the helical nucleocapsid during the viral assembly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Two antigenic epitopes (NEP-D4 and NEP-D6) have been identified in the N protein of PEDV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].
