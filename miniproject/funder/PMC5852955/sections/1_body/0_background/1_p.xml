<p id="Par13">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologic agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute enteritis disease that is characterized by vomiting and watery diarrhea and usually leads to high morbidity and mortality, especially in piglets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The disease was first recognized in England in 1971 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the prototype virus, which was designated as PEDV CV777, was identified in Belgium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Subsequently, PEDV has been reported in several other European countries, causing only sporadic outbreaks. Since the 1980s, it has been widespread in Asia and has become an economic concern for the swine industry in many Asian countries such as Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In April 2013, a PEDV outbreak was confirmed in the US for the first time. It swept across more than 30 states in the country, causing deaths of more than 8 million newborn piglets during the one-year-epidemic period, and subsequently spread throughout North America, including Canada and Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Afterward, US-like PED epidemics have been reported in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, France, and Belgium [
