<p id="Par40">In conclusion, our study revealed that Japanese field PEDVs causing PED outbreaks during 2013â€“2016 could be classified into three types, and these PEDVs might have been introduced from overseas at the same time or during similar periods. The disease has developed to an endemic stage in which the PEDV can persist for a long time in these herds or these local regions causing subsequent epidemics. The distant genetic relationships and various aa substitutions between the Japanese field PEDVs and vaccine strains may be responsible for the unsuccessful PED control in Japan. Our findings will be useful in understanding the origin and molecular epidemiology of the PEDV, and helping to develop measures for the control of the disease.</p>
