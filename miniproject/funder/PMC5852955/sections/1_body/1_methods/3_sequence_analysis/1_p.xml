<p id="Par18">Nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were edited, assembled, and aligned using Geneious v9.1.6 software (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.geneious.com</ext-link>), and percentage sequence divergences at the nt and aa levels were further calculated by using the same software. The obtained nt sequences were deposited in GenBank under the following accession numbers: KY619734–KY619839 as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) software, version 6.06 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], with the maximum likelihood method and bootstrap tests of 1000 replicates. The best-fit nt substitution models for analysis were assessed. Phylogenetic trees based on the nt sequences of the full-length S and N genes were generated using the Tamura-Nei substitution model with a discrete gamma distribution (TN93 + G). A phylogenetic tree based on the nt sequences of the M gene was created using the Kimura 2-parameter substitution method with a discrete gamma distribution (K2 + G). N-glycosylation sites were predicted using a service available on
