<p id="Par17">After producing cDNA, as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the full-length S gene of PEDV was amplified using the primer pair FS-F/FS-R (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and KOD FX Kit (Toyobo Co., Japan). The PCR products were used as templates for nested PCR reactions that amplified five DNA fragments spanning the entire S gene using 5 primer sets (CS1-CS5), as previously reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The M and N genes of the PEDV were also amplified from the cDNA using two newly designed primer sets, fMF/fMR and fNF/fNR (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). EmeraldAmp MAX PCR Master Mix kit (Takara Bio, Japan) was used for PCR amplifications of the CS1-CS5 fragments, as well as the M and N genes. The amplified PCR products were purified using a FastGene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (NIPPON Genetics Co., Ltd., Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All sequencing reactions were carried out in duplicate, and sequences were determined in both directions using BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Products were analyzed using ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzers (Applied Biosystems).
