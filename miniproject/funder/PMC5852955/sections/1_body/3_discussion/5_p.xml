<p id="Par36">In our previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], by sequencing a partial S gene containing a neutralizing epitope region (COE domain), we suggested that 14JM-140 may belong to the S INDEL type that has been circulating in Japan together with the highly virulent US-like strains. In this study, by sequencing the full-length S gene, we confirmed 14JM-140 to be an S INDEL strain. We also identified another strain that belonged to the S INDEL type, 14JM-144, although it was not predicted to be an S INDEL PEDV in the previous study. This discrepancy arose due to the region of the partial S gene utilized in the previous report that lack the typical insertions and deletions of the S INDEL type. Our data revealed the circulation of S INDEL strains in PED outbreaks occurring in Japan, but these strains compose only a minor population of the reemerging Japanese PEDVs. These results are consistent with two recent reports of Japanese PEDV [
