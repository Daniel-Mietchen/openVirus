<p id="Par39">On farms 2 and 3, PED first occurred in May 2014, despite all the sows receiving antepartum PEDV vaccinations in 2013. Afterward, the disease disappeared until early 2016 when the subsequent outbreaks recurred. There was no detection of the PEDV during the interval between these two outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S and N genes revealed that the strains collected from the first outbreaks on farms 2 and 3 formed a monophyletic branch. Moreover, these two farms were located close to each other with a distance of 0.5Â km (separated by a small mountain), and the outbreaks occurred at the same time. This suggests that the PEDV strains introduced onto these farms that induced the first outbreaks were derived from a common source of PEDV. Likewise, in the secondary outbreaks, the strains collected from these two farms also have the highest genetic identity to each other and formed minor monophyletic branches, as shown in the phylogenetic trees for the S and N genes. All the strains collected from the primary and recurrent outbreaks on these farms were closely clustered into the subclade PED-J2, together with other strains collected from other farms located in Miyazaki prefecture (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This data suggested that the PEDV strains causing the subsequent outbreaks on farms 2 and 3 evolved from PEDVs that had been circulating in the Miyazaki region since 2014. There are two possibilities for the origin of the strains that caused the subsequent outbreaks on farms 2 and 3. First, PEDVs may have persisted silently on these farms since 2014, evolving, and then causing the subsequent outbreaks when suitable conditions arrived in early 2016. Another possibility is that PEDVs may have persisted on other pig farms, circulating in the Miyazaki region since the 2014 PED occurrence, after which the PEDVs were introduced again onto farms 2 and 3, causing the secondary epidemics. More data is needed to elucidate exactly the origin of these PEDVs strains. The occurrence of PED in these herds has partially indicated the failure of using the current PEDV vaccines, which are based on old seed stock of classical Japanese strains. Besides, the repeated outbreaks in these herds indicate that the disease has developed to an endemic stage. These results could be used to elucidate the prevalence of PEDVs and to contribute to the prevention of PED in the region.
