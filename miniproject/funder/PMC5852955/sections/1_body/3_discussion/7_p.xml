<p id="Par38">The first PED epidemic on farm 1 was a severe occurrence in May 2014 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Afterward, obvious clinical symptoms and death caused by PED were not observed in pigs of the herd until February 2016 when the subsequent outbreak recurred with less severity than the first. Although the pigs did not show any obvious symptoms of PED, the presence of PEDV on this farm was detected in piglets several times by RT-PCR during the period from June 2014 to January 2016, according to the information supplied by veterinarians responsible for this farm. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the S and N genes showed that PEDV strains from the primary and secondary outbreaks formed monophyletic branches. They also shared with each other the highest sequence identity of the S, M, and N genes compared to other strains used in this study. Additionally, PED outbreaks were not observed on other farms within a 5Â km radius of farm 1, and many strict measures for establishing a high level of security were implemented on this farm. Taken together, we speculated that PEDV strains causing the primary outbreak induced partial protective immunity but persisted in the herd for nearly two years. Subsequently, the persisted PEDVs caused the secondary epidemic. This is the first report of a two-year-long persistence of PEDV in a pig herd. It has been proposed that the popular circulation of PEDV variants with large deletions in the S gene is associated with the persistence of the PEDV on the infected farms in Japan [

Other factors, including the genetic variation of causative PEDV strains, may play a more important role in the disease recurrence.
