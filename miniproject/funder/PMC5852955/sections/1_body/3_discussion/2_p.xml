<p id="Par33">The result of this study revealed that all the field PEDV strains (except 13JM-291) were closely related to emerging strains identified in the US, South Korea, Taiwan, and in European countries. Of note, the Japanese PEDVs were genetically most closely related to the US strains; some even had identical S gene. Since the recent PED pandemics in Japan started to reemerge six months after those in the US, the close genetic relationship indicated that the current Japanese PEDV might have been introduced directly from the US, or both the US and Japanese PEDVs were derived from one source of origin.</p>
