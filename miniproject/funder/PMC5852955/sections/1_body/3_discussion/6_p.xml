<p id="Par37">Phosphorylation of viral proteins is a reversible post-translational modification that can have major impacts on viral infection, replication, and cytotoxicity in a host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For infectious bronchitis virus, belonging to the coronaviruses, the phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein has a dramatic influence on RNA binding capability and the recognition of viral RNA from non-viral RNA in the process of viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Along with phosphorylation, glycosylation is another post-translational modification that often strongly affects the protein functions of viruses. N-glycosylation sites in the spike gene of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus were demonstrated to be crucial for viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, mutations observed in the neutralizing regions have been proposed as presenting a viral evolution, allowing escape from antibodies developed against vaccine or classical PEDV strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In this study, we characterized differences in epitope regions, high-specificity N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, between the vaccine and recent field strains. Various substitutions observed in the S (521, 553, 568, and 570), M (5), and N (123, 252, and 255) proteins may have affected the antigenicity, conferring the capacity for immune evasion in the PEDV field strains, and consequently, influencing the efficacy of the vaccines. In fact, despite vaccination, PEDV infections still spread rapidly and are commonly observed on PED-vaccinated farms in Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Vaccination showed very low efficacy and could not mitigate the severe losses caused by PED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Based on the antigenicity analysis of the vaccine and field strains, as well as the recent performance of the PED vaccines on the Japanese pig farms, we suggest that the development of novel vaccines based on reemerging PEDVs is necessary to control current PED outbreaks.
