<p id="Par32">Since late 2013, massive PED outbreaks have recurred in Japan causing tremendous financial losses in the swine industry. Despite the nationwide use of available attenuated vaccines developed decades ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], PEDV has rapidly swept across the county. Our sequencing data revealed that the prevailing Japanese PEDVs are genetically heterogeneous and can be classified into 3 genotypes: NA, S INDEL, and Asian non-S INDEL. Both the NA and S INDEL types, which have been identified in recent studies in Japan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were also responsible for recent outbreaks in the US and South Korea. In our study, besides the two previously reported PEDV types, we identified another type of Japanese PEDV (designated as Asian non-S INDEL) that is closely related to the Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese strains. The Asian non-S INDEL type was collected from an early PED epidemic that occurred in southern Japan where the recent PED pandemic began spreading. Moreover, the Asian non-S INDEL type appeared at a similar time to the appearance of the NA and S INDEL types in Japan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we speculated a possibility that the three types of Japanese PEDV originated from one source and emerged at the same or similar time in the southern region of Japan before spreading across the country
