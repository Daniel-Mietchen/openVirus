<p id="Par35">Sixteen PEDV strains from four different prefectures including Miyazaki, Kagoshima, Aomori, and Aichi formed a well-supported subclade (PED-J1). Fourteen PEDV strains from various farms in Miyazaki prefecture were also grouped into a distinct subclade (PED-J2). These results suggested that strains of those Japanese sublineages (PED-J1 and PED-J2) may derive from two common ancestral PEDVs whose progeny have spread in the regions. Two genetic sublineages of US strains, namely IA1-Co/13 and MN-IA2 [

Notably, the Japanese PEDV of the Japanese sublineage PED-J1 in this study showed a close relationship with the US sublineage IA1-Co/13, and PEDVs of the Japanese sublineage PED-J2 showed close relatedness with the US sublineage MN-IA2. This data revealed the common pattern of genetic diversity as well as the close relationship between the Japanese strains and the US strains, suggesting a common ancestor for these strains.
