<p id="Par34">Since April 2013, the NA type of PEDV has emerged in the US. The NA strains were identified subsequently in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan from late 2013. Another PEDV type possessing typical insertions and deletions in the N-terminus of the S gene when compared to the prototype NA type was first discovered in Ohio in the US [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This PEDV type, therefore, was designated as S INDEL. The S INDEL PEDVs were also identified later in recent outbreaks in Japan, South Korea, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Netherlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both highly virulent and S INDEL PEDVs prevailing in the US are supposed to be derived from Chinese PEDVs as a result of recombinant events [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In accordance with these findings, our sequence analysis showed that the S INDEL strains, such as CH/HBQX/10 and JS120103, had already appeared in Chinese PED outbreaks during 2010–2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. With the prevalence of both NA and S INDEL strains in the US, South Korea, and Japan since 2013, we suggested that there are two major possibilities of origin for the reemerging Japanese PEDV strains. First, US-like strains have been directly transmitted to Japan from the US or South Korea. Second, the same source of the US strains could have introduced the PEDV into Japan, from China, shortly after the US outbreaks. However, our study revealed the prevalence of the Asian none-S IDEL PEDV strain in Japan, which has not been reported in the US or South Korea. Thus, we incline toward the possibility that multiple parent PEDV strains have been introduced into Japan, from China or China’s neighboring countries (such as the Southeast Asian region), causing the recent PED pandemic. Further investigation and surveillance are required to specifically identify the source of origin for the reemerging Japanese PEDVs.
