<p id="Par19">Identical nt sequences of the S gene were distinguished and excluded, resulting in the identification of 34 individual sequences from the 45 total collected field strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene sequences from the Japanese strains and reference strains identified from various countries revealed two major clusters: genogroup G1 divided into subgroups G1a and G1b, and genogroup G2 divided into subgroups G2a and G2b (Fig.Â
