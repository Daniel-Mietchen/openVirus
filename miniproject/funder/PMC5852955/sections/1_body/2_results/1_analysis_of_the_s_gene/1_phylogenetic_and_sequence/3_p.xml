<p id="Par21">Pairwise alignment of the 45 field PEDVs in this study revealed that their S genes were heterogeneous. The S gene nt (aa) sequences had 94.36%–100% (94.45%–100%) identity with each other, but only 93.24%–95.91% (92.01%–96.17%) identity with the two Japanese vaccines. Most of the Japanese PEDVs belonging to G2b had 99.16%–100% nt among themselves, and shared a high (98.27%–100%) nt identity with other highly virulent PEDVs. Interestingly, 13JM-127 from the first PED outbreak in Miyazaki prefecture (South Japan, December 2013) shared the same sequence with 14JM-311 (Aichi prefecture, north-central Japan, April 2014) and US strains, such as USA/Indiana/17846/2013 (from the first reported PED case in the US) [

Additionally, 14JM-01 has 100% nt sequence identity with two other US strains (NPL-Pedy/2013 US and USA/Minnesota127/2014) and a Canadian strain (ON-007).
