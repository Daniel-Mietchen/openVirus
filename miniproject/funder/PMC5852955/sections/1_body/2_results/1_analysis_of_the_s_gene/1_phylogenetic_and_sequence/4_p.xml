<p id="Par22">Of the 45 field PEDVs, 14JM-01 from Miyazaki and 16 other strains from Aomori, Aichi, Kagoshima, and Miyazaki were grouped into a monophyletic branch designated as PED-J1, and they shared high nt and aa sequence identities (99.69%–100% and 99.35%–100%, respectively) with each other. Another subclade, designated as PED-J2, including 14 Japanese strains collected in Miyazaki were also clustered into a segregated branch as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The strains 14JM-140 and 14JM-144 showed 98.99%–99.92% nt sequence identity with other S INDEL strains within G1b. The S gene of 14JM-144 had the highest (99.93%) nt sequence identity with OH851 which was the first reported S INDEL strain in the US. The S gene from 13JM291 shared 97.64%–99.35% nt sequence identity to those of other G2a strains, with the highest nt identity (99.3%) to those of VN/VAP1113_1/2013/VungTua/Vietnam and VN/KCHY_310113/2013/KhoaiChau/HungYen from Vietnam, BCR2 from Thailand, and CH/GXNN/2012 from China.
