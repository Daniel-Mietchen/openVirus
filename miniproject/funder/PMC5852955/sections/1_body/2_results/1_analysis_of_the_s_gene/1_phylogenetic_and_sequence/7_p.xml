<p id="Par25">Regarding the prediction of high-specificity N-glycosylation sites in the S protein, most Japanese strains belonging to G2b exhibited eight N-glycosylation sites over the entire S protein (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). 14JM-268 had one additional N-glycosylation site at residue 557, and 14JM-242 possessed an additionally unique N-glycosylation site at position 382 of the aa chain. Two Japanese S INDEL strains (14JM-140 and 14JM-144) had seven N-glycosylation sites, while 13JM-291 had eight N-glycosylation sites. Compared with the vaccine strain, 96-P4C6, most of the Japanese non-S INDEL strains in G2b lost three N-glycosylation sites (at 132, 557, and 1233) and gained another N-glycosylation site (at 60). Compared with P-5Â V, these G2b Japanese strains lost three N-glycosylation sites (at 117, 132, and 515) and gained four other N-glycosylation sites (at 60, 119, 325, and 1262).
