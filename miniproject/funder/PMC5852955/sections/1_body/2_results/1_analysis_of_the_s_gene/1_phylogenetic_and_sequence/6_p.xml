<p id="Par24">Compared to the two vaccine strains, all Japanese field PEDVs were highly conserved in epitopes 2C10 and SS2, except for strain 13JM-293 that had an aa substitution (L1375I) within 2C10 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Additionally, compared to the vaccine strains, all the Japanese field PEDVs had two aa changes (L768S and D770S) in the epitope SS2, and three serine substitutions (A521S, T553S, and G598S) in the neutralizing domain COE (excluding 13JM291 and 14JM-268). Notably, the aa substitutions at positions 521 and 553 resulted in predictable phosphorylation sites in the S protein of the Japanese field strains. Furthermore, different amino acids were found at the 12 sites within the COE domain (Fig.
