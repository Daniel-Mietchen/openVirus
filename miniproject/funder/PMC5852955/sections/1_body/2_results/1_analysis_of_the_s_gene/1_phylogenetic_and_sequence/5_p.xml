<p id="Par23">The sequence data revealed that S genes from the Japanese field PEDVs are of 4152–4161 nt long, and encode proteins with 1381–1386 aa residues. This consequence was due to the presence of several deletions or insertions that accumulated primarily in the N-terminus of the S protein. Multiple alignments of the S gene demonstrated that 14JM-140 and 14JM-144 exhibited insertions and deletions (1-nt, 11-nt, and 3-nt deletions at positions 167, 176, and 416, respectively, and a 6-nt insertion between positions 474 and 475), which are typical for S INDEL strains [
