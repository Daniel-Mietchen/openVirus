<p id="Par20">All 45 Japanese field PEDVs in the present study fell into 3 subgroups G2a, G2b, and G1b. The most dominant strains belonged to G2b, which comprised 42 of 45 current Japanese strains, along with the highly virulent (North American type) PEDVs isolated in the US, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Taiwan. Two PEDV strains (14JM-140 and 14JM-144) were clustered into G1b, which included the new S INDEL strains that have been detected since 2013 in the US, Germany, France, Belgium, South Korea, Japan, and China. Isolate 13JM-291 fell into G2a, which included PEDV strains identified from PEDV outbreaks that occurred after 2010 in Vietnam, Thailand, and China. The two vaccine strains (P5-V and 96-P4C6) clustered into the G1a subgroup, which primarily consisted of classical strains, such as CV777, KH, NK, LZC, SM98, and DR13 parent.</p>
