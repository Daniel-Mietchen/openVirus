<p id="Par29">There were three swine farms where PED outbreaks first occurred in 2014, and then recurred in 2016, as shown in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Farm 1 is located in Aomori prefecture, while farms 2 and 3 are located in the same town in Miyazaki prefecture. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene sequences revealed that three PEDV strains (14JM-168, 16JM-334, and 16JM-339) collected from two different outbreaks on farm 1 were closest to each other and segregated into a distinct minor branch. PEDVs from the primary PED outbreaks on farm 2 (14JM-179, 14JM-181) and farm 3 (14JM199 and 14JM-200) grouped closest together, along with two other strains (14JM-146 and 14JM-147) from different pig farms in Miyazaki prefecture in 2014. Likewise, strains from recurrent outbreaks on farm 2 (16JM-325 and 16JM-326) and farm 3 (16JM-319, 16JM-323) were also grouped into a monophyletic branch. All the PEDV strains collected from the primary and recurrent outbreaks on farms 2 and 3 were clustered into the minor group PED-J2, along with several strains collected from PED outbreaks that occurred on other pig farms in Miyazaki in 2014. Similar phylogenetic relatedness among PEDVs obtained from primary and recurrent outbreaks was observed, based on the phylogenetic tree of the N gene.
