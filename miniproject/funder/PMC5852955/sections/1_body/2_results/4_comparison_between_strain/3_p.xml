<p id="Par31">Compared with the strain collected from the primary outbreak on farm 1, two strains from the recurrent outbreak had 11 aa substitutions in their S proteins (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S2). Notably, the substitution S722 N lead to the loss of a predicted serine phosphorylation site. These recurrent strains also had two aa substitutions (R166S and T413 N) in the N protein; the R166S substitution formed a predicted serine phosphorylation site. Comparison to PEDVs from the primary outbreak on farms 2 and 3, PEDVs from the recurrent outbreaks had 13 aa substitutions in the S proteins, in addition to a single aa change (A42V) in the M protein and two aa changes (L18I and S31F) in the N protein. Notably, the substitutions L18I and S31F occurred in the reported epitope NEP-D4 (18–133) of the N protein.
