<p id="Par30">On farm 1, the S, M, and N genes of PEDVs identified from the recurrent outbreak (16JM-334 and 16JM-339) shared the highest (99.66%, 100%, and 99.55% respectively) nt sequence identities to a strain (14JM-168) collected from the primary outbreak. The S genes of PEDVs from the primary outbreak on farms 2 and 3 had high (99.92%â€“99.98%) nt identity to each other. These strains also had identical sequences for the M and N genes. In the secondary outbreaks, PEDVs from farms 2 and 3 also shared highly homologous genes. The S and M genes of two strains (16JM-319 and 16JM-323) from farm 3 shared 100% nt sequence identities with those of a strain (16JM-325) from farm 2.</p>
