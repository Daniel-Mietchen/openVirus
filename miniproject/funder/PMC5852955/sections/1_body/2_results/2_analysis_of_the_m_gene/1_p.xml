<p id="Par26">The M gene sequences from all the Japanese field PEDVs and the two vaccine strains consisted of 681 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 226 aa. Identical nt sequences were distinguished and excluded, resulting in the identification of seven unique sequences from the 45 total collected PEDVs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A phylogenetic tree based on the M gene of the Japanese strains and reference strains revealed that all the sequences were divided into 2 groups (G1 and G2); G2 was further divided into two subgroups G2a and G2b (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). All the current Japanese PEDVs fell into G2, and showed the closest relatedness to the NA strains and emerging strains identified in Europe, South Korea, and China. These field PEDVs were phylogenetically distant from the vaccine strains and a classical Japanese strain (JMe2) of G1. The M genes of field PEDVs had 99.56%–100% nt identity to each other and 97.5%–98.24% nt identity with the vaccine strains.
