<p id="Par27">The B cell epitope, WAFYVR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], located at position 195–200 of the M protein, was conserved in all field and vaccine strains. Compared with the vaccine strains, all Japanese field strains had an aa substitution (A214S) belonging to an antigenic region (aa 205–223), as predicted by the EMBOSS protein analysis tool (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1A). Strain 14JM-236 had a different aa (S213 N) leading to the loss of a predicted serine phosphorylation site. In another predicted epitope region (aa 5–15), the field PEDVs had one different aa (V12I) compared to P-5 V, and two aa substitutions (F5S and Q13E) compared to 96-P4C6. These substitutions (F5S) resulted in gaining a predicted high-specificity N-glycosylation site.
