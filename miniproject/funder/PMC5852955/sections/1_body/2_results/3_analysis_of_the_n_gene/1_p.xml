<p id="Par28">The N gene of all the field PEDVs and vaccine strains was 1326 nt in length encoding a protein of 441 aa. Identical nt sequences of the N gene were distinguished and excluded, resulting in the identification of 19 unique sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the N genes from the Japanese strains and reference strains revealed the classification of PEDV strains into three groups: G1, G2, and G3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). All Japanese field strains were closely clustered together into subgroup G3 with other US and US-like strains. The Japanese field PEDVs shared 98.72%–100% N gene nt sequence identity to each other and 95.70%–96.76% to the vaccine strains. Strain 13-JM127 from the first outbreak in Miyazaki had 100% nt identity to eight other field strains collected in Miyazaki, Aichi, and Kagoshima, and this is likely to be the most dominant sequence of N gene among the field strains. Compared to the vaccine strains, all the field strains in the present study had 9 aa substitutions (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1B); the substitution K123 N resulted in forming a predicted N-glycosylation site on the N protein from the field strains, while the aa substitutions A142T and N255S observed in field strains formed two predicted phosphorylation sites. Of note, the substitutions K123 N and N255S belong to the reported antigenic epitopes NEP-D4 (aa 18–133) and NEP-D6 (aa 252–262), respectively [
