  <p>Phylogenetic trees of PEDVs based on nucleotide sequences of entire M and N genes. Phylogenetic trees based on the M gene (
   <bold>a</bold>) and the N gene (
   <bold>b</bold>) were constructed using the maximum likelihood method in the MEGA program. Numbers at nodes represent the percentage of 1000 bootstrap replicates. The scale bars indicate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Names of strains, countries and years of isolation, and GenBank accession numbers are shown. The Japanese field PEDV strains identified in this study are marked by solid diamond symbols and the vaccine strains used in Japan are marked by solid square symbols
