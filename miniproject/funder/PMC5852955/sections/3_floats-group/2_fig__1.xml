  <p>Phylogenetic tree of PEDVs based on the nucleotide sequences of the entire S gene. The tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood method using the Tamura-Nei substitution model with a discrete gamma distribution in the MEGA v.6.05 program. Numbers at nodes represent the percentage of 1000 bootstrap replicates (values &lt;â€‰50 are not shown). Names of strains, countries and years of isolation, and GenBank accession numbers are shown. The Japanese field PEDV strains identified in this study are marked by solid diamond symbols and accompanied by the corresponding prefectures where they were collected. The classical Japanese strains identified prior to 2013 are marked by solid round symbols and the vaccine strains being used in Japan are marked by hollow triangle symbols. PEDV strains collected from farm 1 (14JM-168, 16JM334, and 16JM-339) were marked in a blue box; strains collected from farms 2 and 3 (14JM-179, 14JM-181, 14JM-199, 14JM-200, 16JM-319, 16JM-323, 16JM-325, 16JM-326 are marked in a red box</p>
