    <bold>Figure S1.</bold> Amino acid substitutions in the M and N proteins between the field and vaccine strains. 
    <bold>A</bold>: Amino acid substitutions in the M protein. The field strain 14JM-236 has an aa substitution, S213 N, resulting in the loss of a predicted phosphorylation site. The substitution at aa 5 in the M protein of the field strains may result in gaining a high-specificity N-glycosylation site (NGSI) compared with the vaccine strain 96-P4C6. 
    <bold>B</bold>: Amino acid substitutions in the N protein. Two antigenic epitopes (NEP-D4 and NEP-D6) are marked by red bars. Compared with the vaccine strains, the Japanese field strains had 9 aa changes, including K123 N, A142T, T145A, M216 V, R241K, H242L, K 252 R, N255S, Q397L. A high-specificity N-glycosylation site (NFSQ) was predicted to occur at position 123 and a phosphorylation site was predicted to occur at positions 142, 166, and 255. (JPEG 10446 kb)
