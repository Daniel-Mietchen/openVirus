Although PEDV vaccines have been used widely, the disease has swept rapidly across the county, and is commonly observed in PED-vaccinated farms, and has recurred in domestic herds. To better understand PEDVs responsible for the reemerging outbreaks in Japan, full-length spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of 45 PEDVs collected in Japan during 2013&#x02013;2016, were sequenced and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Phylogenetic analysis based on S gene sequences revealed that all the recent field PEDVs were genetically distinct from the classical Japanese strains, and were classified into three genotypes: North American (NA), S INDEL, and Asian non-S INDEL. Our data suggested a possibility that multiple parental PEDV strains were introduced into Japan from abroad at the same time or similar times. The newly identified Japanese strains showed the closest relationship to the US strains. Two sublineages of Japanese strains circulating in Japan were similar to two sublineages identified in the US, suggesting common ancestors for these strains. In comparison with two vaccine strains used in Japan, the field strains had various changes in epitope regions, glycosylation sites, and phosphorylation sites. These substitutions, particularly observed in epitope regions of the S (521, 553, 568, and 570), M (5), and N (123, 252, and 255) proteins, may have affected antigenicity and vaccine efficacy, resulting in an unsuccessful PEDV control. Sequence comparisons between PEDVs collected from primary and secondary outbreaks in three herds revealed that the disease has developed to an endemic stage in which PEDV could persist for nearly two years in the herds or local regions, causing subsequent epidemics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">These results elucidate the genetic characteristics, origin, and molecular epidemiology of PEDVs circulating in Japan, as well as the PEDV strains causing recurrent outbreaks. This study provides a better insight into the PEDVs responsible for recent outbreaks in Japan, and could potentially help to develop measures for controlling and preventing the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12917-018-1409-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus</kwd><kwd>PEDV</kwd><kwd>Spike gene</kwd><kwd>M gene</kwd><kwd>N gene</kwd><kwd>Genetic heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006452</institution-id><institution>University of Miyazaki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant number 2014-70</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 17H04639</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologic agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute enteritis disease that is characterized by vomiting and watery diarrhea and usually leads to high morbidity and mortality, especially in piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The disease was first recognized in England in 1971 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the prototype virus, which was designated as PEDV CV777, was identified in Belgium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Subsequently, PEDV has been reported in several other European countries, causing only sporadic outbreaks. Since the 1980s, it has been widespread in Asia and has become an economic concern for the swine industry in many Asian countries such as Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In late 2010, new Chinese strains of PEDV were detected. These new strains were clinically more severe than the classical strains, resulting in 80%&#x02013;100% illness among infected swine herds and a 50%&#x02013;100% mortality rate among infected suckling piglets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In April 2013, a PEDV outbreak was confirmed in the US for the first time. It swept across more than 30 states in the country, causing deaths of more than 8 million newborn piglets during the one-year-epidemic period, and subsequently spread throughout North America, including Canada and Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Afterward, US-like PED epidemics have been reported in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, France, and Belgium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Belonging to the <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family in the <italic>Nidovirale</italic> order, PEDV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28&#x02009;kb in size that encodes four structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) and nonstructural proteins (1a, 1ab, and ORF3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among the viral proteins, the S glycoprotein is the most diverse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and plays a critical role in the process of inducing neutralizing antibodies and binding specific receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. At least two B cell epitopes (SS2 and SS6) and two regions containing neutralizing epitopes (COE and 2C10) have been identified on this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The S gene is also associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of virulence in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and was used as an important component in studies for understanding genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates, the epidemiological status, and vaccine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The M protein is the most abundant component of viral protein in the envelope, and is responsible for morphogenesis, assembly, and budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The N protein of coronavirus interacts with viral genomic RNA, serving as the critical basis for the helical nucleocapsid during the viral assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Two antigenic epitopes (NEP-D4 and NEP-D6) have been identified in the N protein of PEDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">In Japan, the PED-like disease was observed from late 1982 to early 1983, but was not reported again until the outbreaks that occurred between September 1993 and June 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In an epidemic of diarrhea caused by a PEDV infection in 1996, more than 39,000 suckling pigs died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Afterward, there were no PED cases reported from 2006 until the first half of 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. PED outbreaks first reemerged in October 2013 from a southern location (Okinawa Island) and spread rapidly throughout the country. Until May 2016, PEDV infections were reported from more than 1000 farms in 39 of 47 prefectures; the infections affected over 1.5 million pigs and led to the death of half a million pigs, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maff.go.jp">http://www.maff.go.jp</ext-link>). Currently, PEDV infections and piglet mortality has decreased significantly. However, PED still occurred and frequently recurred in pig farms in Japan. Therefore, better insight into the causes for the reemergence of PED outbreaks is required for more efficient control and prevention of the disease. Toward this goal, we sequenced and analyzed the full-length S, M, and N genes of the Japanese field PEDVs in comparison with those of vaccine strains used in Japan, classical Japanese PEDV strains, and isolates from other countries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample collection, RNA extraction, and PEDV detection</title><p id="Par16">Small intestine or stool specimens were obtained from suckling piglets, post-weaning piglets, and sows presenting acute watery diarrhea at pig farms in Japan, between December 2013 and February 2016. Intestinal samples were collected from dead piglets, and fecal samples were non-invasively collected immediately after excretion. Thus, no aggressive actions toward the pigs were carried out for sampling purpose. Samples of two major vaccine strains that have been employed in Japan, P5-V (Nisseiken Co., Ltd) and 96-P4C6 (Kaketsuken Co., Ltd., Japan), were collected from commercial vaccine bottles used in the swine farms. Sample preparation, RNA extraction, and PEDV detection were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Japanese field samples may contain both PEDV variants with large deletions in the 5&#x02032;-terminus of the S gene and PEDV strains with an intact S gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Due to the complexity in discriminating, isolating, and individually sequencing PEDV strains, only specimens containing PEDVs with an intact S gene were used in our study. Finally, 45 PEDV-positive field samples were collected from 37 farms, located in five different prefectures in Japan. These samples, along with the two vaccine samples described above, were sequenced to determine the full-length sequence of the S, M, and N genes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All these field PEDVs were confirmed to possess an intact 5&#x02032;-terminus of the S gene, showing only the expected prominent single DNA band from PCR products on a 1.2% agarose gel [<xref

Both highly virulent and S INDEL PEDVs prevailing in the US are supposed to be derived from Chinese PEDVs as a result of recombinant events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In accordance with these findings, our sequence analysis showed that the S INDEL strains, such as CH/HBQX/10 and JS120103, had already appeared in Chinese PED outbreaks during 2010&#x02013;2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. With the prevalence of both NA and S INDEL strains in the US, South Korea, and Japan since 2013, we suggested that there are two major possibilities of origin for the reemerging Japanese PEDV strains. First, US-like strains have been directly transmitted to Japan from the US or South Korea. Second, the same source of the US strains could have introduced the PEDV into Japan, from China, shortly after the US outbreaks. However, our study revealed the prevalence of the Asian none-S IDEL PEDV strain in Japan, which has not been reported in the US or South Korea. Thus, we incline toward the possibility that multiple parent PEDV strains have been introduced into Japan, from China or China&#x02019;s neighboring countries (such as the Southeast Asian region), causing the recent PED pandemic. Further investigation and surveillance are required to specifically identify the source of origin for the reemerging Japanese PEDVs.</p><p id="Par35">Sixteen PEDV strains from four different prefectures including Miyazaki, Kagoshima, Aomori, and Aichi formed a well-supported subclade (PED-J1). Fourteen PEDV strains from various farms in Miyazaki prefecture were also grouped into a distinct subclade (PED-J2). These results suggested that strains of those Japanese sublineages (PED-J1 and PED-J2) may derive from two common ancestral PEDVs whose progeny have spread in the regions. Two genetic sublineages of US strains, namely IA1-Co/13 and MN-IA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], were identified from the US outbreaks in 2013. Notably, the Japanese PEDV of the Japanese sublineage PED-J1 in this study showed a close relationship with the US sublineage IA1-Co/13, and PEDVs of the Japanese sublineage PED-J2 showed close relatedness with the US sublineage MN-IA2. This data revealed the common pattern of genetic diversity as well as the close relationship between the Japanese strains and the US strains, suggesting a common ancestor for these strains.</p><p id="Par36">In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], by sequencing a partial S gene containing a neutralizing epitope region (COE domain), we suggested that 14JM-140 may belong to the S INDEL type that has been circulating in Japan together with the highly virulent US-like strains. In this study, by sequencing the full-length S gene, we confirmed 14JM-140 to be an S INDEL strain. We also identified another strain that belonged to the S INDEL type, 14JM-144, although it was not predicted to be an S INDEL PEDV in the previous study. This discrepancy arose due to the region of the partial S gene utilized in the previous report that lack the typical insertions and deletions of the S INDEL type. Our data revealed the circulation of S INDEL strains in PED outbreaks occurring in Japan, but these strains compose only a minor population of the reemerging Japanese PEDVs. These results are consistent with two recent reports of Japanese PEDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Phosphorylation of viral proteins is a reversible post-translational modification that can have major impacts on viral infection, replication, and cytotoxicity in a host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For infectious bronchitis virus, belonging to the coronaviruses, the phosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein has a dramatic influence on RNA binding capability and the recognition of viral RNA from non-viral RNA in the process of viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Along with phosphorylation, glycosylation is another post-translational modification that often strongly affects the protein functions of viruses. N-glycosylation sites in the spike gene of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus were demonstrated to be crucial for viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, mutations observed in the neutralizing regions have been proposed as presenting a viral evolution, allowing escape from antibodies developed against vaccine or classical PEDV strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In this study, we characterized differences in epitope regions, high-specificity N-glycosylation and phosphorylation sites, between the vaccine and recent field strains. Various substitutions observed in the S (521, 553, 568, and 570), M (5), and N (123, 252, and 255) proteins may have affected the antigenicity, conferring the capacity for immune evasion in the PEDV field strains, and consequently, influencing the efficacy of the vaccines. In fact, despite vaccination, PEDV infections still spread rapidly and are commonly observed on PED-vaccinated farms in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Vaccination showed very low efficacy and could not mitigate the severe losses caused by PED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Based on the antigenicity analysis of the vaccine and field strains, as well as the recent performance of the PED vaccines on the Japanese pig farms, we suggest that the development of novel vaccines based on reemerging PEDVs is necessary to control current PED outbreaks.</p><p id="Par38">The first PED epidemic on farm 1 was a severe occurrence in May 2014 (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Afterward, obvious clinical symptoms and death caused by PED were not observed in pigs of the herd until February 2016 when the subsequent outbreak recurred with less severity than the first. Although the pigs did not show any obvious symptoms of PED, the presence of PEDV on this farm was detected in piglets several times by RT-PCR during the period from June 2014 to January 2016, according to the information supplied by veterinarians responsible for this farm. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the S and N genes showed that PEDV strains from the primary and secondary outbreaks formed monophyletic branches. They also shared with each other the highest sequence identity of the S, M, and N genes compared to other strains used in this study. Additionally, PED outbreaks were not observed on other farms within a 5&#x000a0;km radius of farm 1, and many strict measures for establishing a high level of security were implemented on this farm. Taken together, we speculated that PEDV strains causing the primary outbreak induced partial protective immunity but persisted in the herd for nearly two years. Subsequently, the persisted PEDVs caused the secondary epidemic. This is the first report of a two-year-long persistence of PEDV in a pig herd. It has been proposed that the popular circulation of PEDV variants with large deletions in the S gene is associated with the persistence of the PEDV on the infected farms in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, we did not detect the presence of the large S deletion variants in the fecal and intestinal samples collected from this farm. Other factors, including the genetic variation of causative PEDV strains, may play a more important role in the disease recurrence.</p><p id="Par39">On farms 2 and 3, PED first occurred in May 2014, despite all the sows receiving antepartum PEDV vaccinations in 2013. Afterward, the disease disappeared until early 2016 when the subsequent outbreaks recurred. There was no detection of the PEDV during the interval between these two outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S and N genes revealed that the strains collected from the first outbreaks on farms 2 and 3 formed a monophyletic branch. Moreover, these two farms were located close to each other with a distance of 0.5&#x000a0;km (separated by a small mountain), and the outbreaks occurred at the same time. This suggests that the PEDV strains introduced onto these farms that induced the first outbreaks were derived from a common source of PEDV. Likewise, in the secondary outbreaks, the strains collected from these two farms also have the highest genetic identity to each other and formed minor monophyletic branches, as shown in the phylogenetic trees for the S and N genes. All the strains collected from the primary and recurrent outbreaks on these farms were closely clustered into the subclade PED-J2, together with other strains collected from other farms located in Miyazaki prefecture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This data suggested that the PEDV strains causing the subsequent outbreaks on farms 2 and 3 evolved from PEDVs that had been circulating in the Miyazaki region since 2014. There are two possibilities for the origin of the strains that caused the subsequent outbreaks on farms 2 and 3. First, PEDVs may have persisted silently on these farms since 2014, evolving, and then causing the subsequent outbreaks when suitable conditions arrived in early 2016. Another possibility is that PEDVs may have persisted on other pig farms, circulating in the Miyazaki region since the 2014 PED occurrence, after which the PEDVs were introduced again onto farms 2 and 3, causing the secondary epidemics. More data is needed to elucidate exactly the origin of these PEDVs strains. The occurrence of PED in these herds has partially indicated the failure of using the current PEDV vaccines, which are based on old seed stock of classical Japanese strains. Besides, the repeated outbreaks in these herds indicate that the disease has developed to an endemic stage. These results could be used to elucidate the prevalence of PEDVs and to contribute to the prevention of PED in the region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">In conclusion, our study revealed that Japanese field PEDVs causing PED outbreaks during 2013&#x02013;2016 could be classified into three types, and these PEDVs might have been introduced from overseas at the same time or during similar periods. The disease has developed to an endemic stage in which the PEDV can persist for a long time in these herds or these local regions causing subsequent epidemics. The distant genetic relationships and various aa substitutions between the Japanese field PEDVs and vaccine strains may be responsible for the unsuccessful PED control in Japan. Our findings will be useful in understanding the origin and molecular epidemiology of the PEDV, and helping to develop measures for the control of the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
