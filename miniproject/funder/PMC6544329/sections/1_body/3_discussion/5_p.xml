<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of ENSO on CHIKV importation to non-endemic areas. The wavelet analysis revealed significant positive relationships between the monthly imported CHIKV cases and the 6-month lagged moving average SOI during December 2009 to October 2010 and from November 2015 to June 2016. Historically, there were EI Ni√±o events from 2009 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2016 [
