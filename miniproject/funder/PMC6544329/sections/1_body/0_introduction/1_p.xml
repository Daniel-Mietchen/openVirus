<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are no licenced vaccines or specific antiviral drug treatments for the disease [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007376.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CHIKV has circulated almost continuously in Asia since 1950’s, with over 1.9 million cases reported since 2005 from India, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and Thailand combined [
