<p>Respondents reported performing a variety of routine mosquito bite prevention activities. A large proportion of study participants used environmental measures to reduce mosquito numbers around their homes, most frequently larval source management such as the emptying of water containers, which has shown to be effective when used as part of a broader integrated

 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The use of insecticide-containing (commonly pyrethroid) plug-in evaporators and sprays, was also frequently reported. Although such products may be useful for reducing mosquito numbers inside a home, their effects on arboviral disease transmission are unclear due to a lack of published efficacy data with epidemiological outcomes. The use of personal protective measures was less common. While the use of topical mosquito repellents was occasionally described, this frequently referred to repellents such as citronella oil-based products or home-remedies such as Vicks VapoRub and moisturizing creams and lotions. These products have not undergone the extensive testing required to meet efficacy standards recognised by WHO and CDC criteria, and are, therefore, not recommended for use in arbovirus prevention. By using these products, rather than active ingredients that have been proven to provide protective efficacy, people are likely to be at a greater risk. The use of citronella oil and home-remedy repellents were often described by participants as preferable to synthetic chemical-based repellents due to a perceived lower chemical toxicity. Indeed, a sentiment throughout many of the discussions, particularly among pregnant women, was that products derived from plants were inherently safer than those based on synthetic chemicals. An elevated caution of pregnant women for repellents has been noted previously. A knowledge, attitudes and practices survey of pregnant women in Greece revealed a high proportion of participants reporting not using mosquito repellents because of fears they may be dangerous for the foetus [

This strongly suggests that educational messaging does not sufficiently emphasize the low toxicity and high efficacy of many of the recommended chemically synthesized repellents, and it may be possible to improve uptake rates by increasing the distribution of safety information on these compounds. DEET, for example, is approved for use by pregnant women by the U.S. EPA, and its use has been recommended by the U.S. CDC as a tool for reducing Zika transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, safety and toxicology reviews of DEET have concluded that it possesses low acute toxicity and is safe for pregnant women [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Alternatively, there is one highly effective plant-based repellent recognised by the CDC [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], that may be more appealing to some pregnant users. PMD (p-menthane 3,8-diol) is a repellent purified from oil of lemon eucalyptus, and has been shown to have repellent properties similar to that of DEET [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007970.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Public awareness campaigns and health provider advice need to stress the importance of using repellents that contain active ingredients that have been evaluated for efficacy and approved by appropriate authorities, and emphasize the safety profiles of repellents recommended for use during pregnancy.
