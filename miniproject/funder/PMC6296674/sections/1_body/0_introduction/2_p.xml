<p>CHIKV (genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>; family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) is an enveloped virus that possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. This genome is approximately 11.8 kb in length, although this size has been found to vary slightly among isolates [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Like other alphaviruses, CHIKV has two open reading frames (ORFs). The 5' ORF encodes four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP2-nsP3-nsP4) that provide important enzymatic activities during viral replication [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The 3' ORF, which is expressed from a subgenomic RNA, encodes structural polyproteins, comprising the capsid (C) and envelope (E3-E2-6K-E1) proteins [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During viral assembly, the 30-kDa C protein is needed for the packaging of newly synthesized genomic RNAs. The envelope proteins E2 and E1, which are incorporated as trimeric spikes on the mature virion, are responsible for receptor binding and fusion with host membrane protein(s) [

 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The smaller envelope proteins, E3 (64 amino acid (aa) residues) and 6K (66 aa residues), are not primary components of the mature virion; instead, these proteins act together as a signal sequence facilitating translocation of the precursor envelope protein to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [
