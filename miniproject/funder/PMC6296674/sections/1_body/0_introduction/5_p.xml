<p>More than 75% of CHIKV-infected individuals develop a classical acute clinical presentation [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that is similar to that observed in patients infected by other mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue and Zika virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These symptoms present diagnostic challenges to clinicians working in geographic areas where these viruses cocirculate [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although debilitating joint pain is a distinctive feature of CHIKV infection, many of the other clinical symptoms and pathology of CHIKV infection are not specific to CHIKV and may occasionally become severe. Accurate diagnosis of CHIKV is thus clinically relevant for supportive management of the infected patient, and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures.
