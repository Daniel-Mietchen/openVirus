<p>To diagnose CHIKV infection in the acute (viremic) phase, several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based methods and a point-of-care immunochromatographic (IC) device that detects CHIKV E1 protein have been described [
 <xref rid="pone.0208851.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Given that the IC test is user-friendly, cost-effective, and facilitates early diagnosis, this device was expected to increase accessibility of laboratory diagnosis of CHIKV infection. Indeed, this IC device has been reported to exhibit high sensitivity (89.4%) and specificity (94.4%) against clinical samples known to contain ECSA-genotype CHIKV [

In further investigation, we showed that one of the mAbs used in this test has a limited ability to recognize the Asian-genotype 6K-E1 protein, which differs from the ECSA-genotype 6K-E1 protein as the result of a glutamic acid (E) to aspartic acid (D) substitution at aa 350 [
