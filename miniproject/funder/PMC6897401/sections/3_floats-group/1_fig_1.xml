  <title>Origins and early spread of HIV-1 virus subtypes in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</title>
  <p>Maximum clade credibility tree based on 346 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequences sampled in the DRC in 2008. Branch colours depict the most probable inferred ancestral location as inferred using discrete phylogeographic analysis [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Grey boxes indicate the positions of isolates identified as belonging to subtype A1, C and D both by REGAv3.0 [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and COMET [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] subtyping tools. Mean posterior support for the modal location estimates (upper italic number) and phylogenetic support values (lower number) are shown for specific viral lineages and for the root location. Since the DRC 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequence alignment did not contain temporal information (all sequences were sampled in 2008), subtype node heights were calibrated using information from a previously published molecular clock analysis of 
   <italic>env</italic> sequences [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The lower panel shows the node age density distributions stratified by location state for each subtype represented in this data set.
