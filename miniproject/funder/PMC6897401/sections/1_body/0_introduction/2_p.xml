<p>HIV-1 cases in eastern and southern Africa comprise half of the HIV-1 infection burden worldwide [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] are thought to have contributed to the spread and establishment of HIV-1. Subtype C is the most dominant in the region, followed by subtypes A1 and D [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It has been proposed that the dominance of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa is the result of its increased transmission efficiency compared to other HIV-1 subtypes [
