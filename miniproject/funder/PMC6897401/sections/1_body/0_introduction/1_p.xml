<p>AIDS is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in human history and its main causative agent, HIV-1 group M, is responsible for over 38 million infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several lines of evidence indicate that group M originated in Kinshasa, the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), during the early twentieth century [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. From there, founder events introduced virus lineages to other geographic regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], resulting in today’s heterogeneous global distribution of the genetic forms of HIV-1 group M, characterised by 9 subtypes and many recombinant forms [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some of these lineages, such as subtypes H and J, are rare and remain largely confined to Central Africa [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Others are circulating in relatively more restricted regions, like subtype D in Central Africa [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In sharp contrast, subtype C expanded rapidly across sub-Saharan Africa, especially eastern and southern Africa, and is responsible for over 75% of HIV-1 cases in the region [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Overall, subtype C is currently the dominant HIV lineage worldwide and is responsible for nearly half of the world’s HIV infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
