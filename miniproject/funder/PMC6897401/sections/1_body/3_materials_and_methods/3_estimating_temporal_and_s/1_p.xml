<p>Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v7 [

To assess whether virus populations were structured per country compartmentalization analyses were performed using tree-based methods such as the association index estimated using a posterior distribution of phylogenies in BaTS [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and estimated using maximum likelihood Simmond’s Association Index (AI) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. When sequences are labelled according to location of sampling, the two statistics strongly reject the null hypothesis of panmixis (
