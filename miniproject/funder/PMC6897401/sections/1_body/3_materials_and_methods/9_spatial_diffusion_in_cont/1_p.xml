<p>While ancestral locations inferred with the discrete approach will be necessarily drawn from the set of sampled locations and countries, we also use a relaxed random walk (RRW) model, in which diffusion rates were allowed to vary among branches according to a Cauchy distribution, to fully explore viral diffusion in the two-dimensional space (latitude and longitude) for the CEA data sets [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To sidestep a computationally demanding joint inference, we performed each continuous phylogeographic reconstruction on a single tree: the maximum clade credibility tree obtained using phylogenetic inference without ancestral state reconstruction, acknowledging that the inferred continuous diffusions do not accommodate phylogenetic uncertainty. For the sake of comparison, each continuous phylogeographic inference was performed with and without an informative prior on the root location, i.e. corresponding to the geographic coordinates associated with the inferred discrete location state for Kinshasa (subtypes A1 and D) Mbuji-Mayi (subtype C).
