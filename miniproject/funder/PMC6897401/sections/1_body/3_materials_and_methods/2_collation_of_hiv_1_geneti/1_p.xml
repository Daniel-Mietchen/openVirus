<p>Sequences were subtyped using REGAv3.0 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A further 96 sequences sampled in 2007 from military personnel serving in Kinshasa were included for analysis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Data with concordant subtype assignments and pertaining to the three most commonly detected lineages in the DRC, i.e. sub-subtype A1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 84), subtype C (
 <italic>n</italic> = 92) and subtype D (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15) were retained for subsequent analysis. We then compiled 2,960 sequences collected from 1996 to 2011 across 16 locations (cities or villages) spanning 5 East African countries with generalized epidemics, namely Burundi [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s019">S7 Fig</xref>). DRC and East African sub-subtype A1, subtype C and subtype D data sets were then merged to form Central East African (CEA) data sets (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,916; mean, minimum and maximum of 99, 44 and 170 sequences per location, respectively). Major resistance-conferring sites at the amino acid positions described by the International AIDS Society–USA were excluded for phylogenetic analysis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In order to mitigate potential sampling bias in these data sets, we randomly sub-sampled sequences so that the number of taxa from each location across subtypes was roughly proportional to the estimated HIV-1 prevalence in each corresponding country (multiple

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s003">S3 Table</xref> shows the number of sequences per location between and after subsampling. To contextualise these data, sub-Saharan African overlapping sequences deposited on the LANL-HIVdb [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] belonging to subtype A1 (
 <italic>n =</italic> 2,187), subtype C (

 <italic>n =</italic> 1,210) (accessed May 2015, LANL) were appended to the CEA data sets.
