<p>To check for inter- and intra-subtype recombination, we applied the Φ-test [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] implemented in the program SplitsTree 4 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The Φ-test is based on a pairwise homoplasy index (PHI), which is a measure of the similarity between closely linked sites. In the test, the level of significance of this statistic is tested by permuting the sites. The rationale behind this permutation procedure is that under the null hypothesis of no recombination, the genealogical correlation between sites is not altered by such permutations because all sites are linked and share the same evolutionary history [
