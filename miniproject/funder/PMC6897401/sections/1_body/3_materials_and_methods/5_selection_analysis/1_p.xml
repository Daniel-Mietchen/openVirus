<p>The posterior trees for the different subtypes from the above analysis were used as empirical tree distributions for estimating evolutionary rates (nonsynonymous and synonymous) and dN/dS ratios using the renaissance counting method [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] implemented in BEAST 1.8.4. Two independent MCMC runs of 10 million steps were computed for this analysis using BEAST. We also estimated dN/dS ratios for the three main subtypes in HyPhy [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] with two maximum-likelihood based methods; MEME [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] and aBSREL [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], which provide site-specific dN/dS ratios using a mixed effects site model and an adaptive branch-site random effects model, respectively. Both MEME and aBSREL relax the assumption that selective pressure at a site and/or branch is constant across the phylogeny [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>].
