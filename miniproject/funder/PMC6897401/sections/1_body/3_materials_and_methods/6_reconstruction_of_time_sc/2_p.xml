<p>To identify the best-fitting coalescent model to describe changes in effective population size over time, model selection was performed using path-sampling and stepping-stone log-marginal likelihood estimators [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Using the same amount of computational work (50 million path steps), distinct demographic models were tested: constant, exponential, exponential-logistic and the Bayesian skygrid with 60 grid-points [

After removal of 10â€“30% burn-in, subtype-specific empirical tree distributions (consisting of 1,000 time-calibrated trees) evenly sampled from the posterior distribution from the best-fitting model runs were generated for subsequent analyses.
