<p>The basic reproductive number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, is defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case in a completely susceptible population. We opted for the birth-death model [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] available in BEAST v.2 software package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] to quantify R
 <sub>0</sub> based on time-stamped sequence data. Here we used a beta prior on the sampling probability parameter that takes into account the number of isolates per subtype in relation to the number of infected people in each country under analysis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s012">S12 Table</xref>). The birth-death model was here preferred over an alternative structured coalescent model because it has been demonstrated that the coalescent does not well approximate stochastic exponential population growth [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which is typically modelled by a birth-death process. Finally, we used a constant-logistic growth model to estimate epidemic growth rates (
