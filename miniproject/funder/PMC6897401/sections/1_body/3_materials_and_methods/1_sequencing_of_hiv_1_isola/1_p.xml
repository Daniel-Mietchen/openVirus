<p>Protease and reverse transcriptase were obtained for 346 patients attending antiretroviral therapy clinics and public hospitals in 2008 in four cities across the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasa, Matadi, Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi, during previously reported surveillance studies on drug resistance in the DRC [

RNA was transcribed into cDNA with the reverse primer IN3, cDNA was amplified by a nested polymerase chain reaction using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche, Meylan, France) with outer primers G25REVand IN3 and inner primers AV150 and polM4. The amplified fragments covering the protease (amino acids 1–99) and reverse transcriptase (amino acids 1–310) were purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kits (Qiagen) and directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Sequences were assembled with the SeqMan II software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI).
