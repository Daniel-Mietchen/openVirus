<p>The data presented in this study indicate an increase in subtype C prevalence in Kinshasa from 2.1% in 1997 to 9.7% in 2002 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and 15% in 2007â€“2008 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007976.s013">S1 Fig</xref>). We detect higher synonymous substitution rates for subtype C that could in part be explained by a higher replicative capacity of subtype C compared to other lineages [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Higher overall subtype C substitution rates obtained by similar analysis of the gp41 region of 
 <italic>env</italic> has recently described in a cohort of untreated Uganda patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The authors found that the nonsynonymous substitution rate in the gp41 region of 
 <italic>env</italic> is twice as fast for subtype C compared to other subtypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].
