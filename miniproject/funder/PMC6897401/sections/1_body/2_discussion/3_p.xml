<p>Our study represents the largest survey of group M’s 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene sequence diversity in the DRC and our results provide further support for an origin of group M in Kinshasa [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While previous analyses of partial 
 <italic>env</italic> gene sequences have also placed the origin of group M in Kinshasa [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the recombinant nature of HIV implies that different genomic regions may have different evolutionary histories [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. More generally, our 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the DRC add detail to the origins of group M subtypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and use a genomic region that is more commonly sequenced due to increased antiretroviral coverage. Therefore, the 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences will be useful for future genetic analysis at the country and continental-level.
