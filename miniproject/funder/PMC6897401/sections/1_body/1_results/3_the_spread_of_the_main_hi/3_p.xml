<p>Our phylogeographic analyses of the main HIV-1 subtypes in Central and East Africa reveal distinct patterns of virus spread across the region. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g002">Fig 2</xref> summarises the dispersal of HIV-1 subtypes across six Central and East African countries using circular plots [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These plots depict the estimated virus lineage movement among different countries in Central and East Africa for subtypes C, A and D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007976.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). The absolute difference between the outer (migrations from-) and the inner (migrations into-) links reflect net migration for each country and subtype. Moreover, these results suggest that Rwanda, DRC and Tanzania have been the main net exporters of subtype C in the CEA region, while Uganda appears to act as the main source of subtypes A1 and D (
