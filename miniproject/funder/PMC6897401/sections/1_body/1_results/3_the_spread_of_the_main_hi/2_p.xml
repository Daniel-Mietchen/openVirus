<p>We initially reconstructed the epidemic histories of group M subtypes using a relaxed molecular clock model and a best-fitting non-parametric coalescent tree prior (path sampling and stepping stone model selection approaches consistently favour the skygrid model over several parametric coalescent models, for all subtypes;

Specifically, we used a hierarchical discrete phylogeographic model that shares a migration graph across subtypes while allowing some variability in the migration patterns at the subtype level [

Although inference of location of the root of subtype C in Mbuji-Mayi was robust to the inclusion of East African data, the same was not true for the subtype A1 and D phylogenies, because of a much larger sample of East African sequences compared to the number of DRC sequences available for analysis. To correct for this bias, the root location of subtype A1 and D phylogenies was constrained to Kinshasa, as supported by our DRC-only analysis (
