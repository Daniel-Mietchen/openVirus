<p>To quantify the contribution of virus movement across locations we used a hierarchical phylogeographic approach that estimates which migration rates between locations are likely to be relevant [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We find that on average 60% of the total number of estimated virus lineage movement events (38 of 64 links supported by Bayes factor, BF &gt; 10) occurred within national borders (
