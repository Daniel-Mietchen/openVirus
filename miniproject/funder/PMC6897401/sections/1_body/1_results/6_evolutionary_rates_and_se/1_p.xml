<p>It has been hypothesised that subtype C may have a selective advantage in comparison with other co-circulating strains [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As part of our Bayesian framework, we estimate selective pressure as the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions over synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for each subtype while integrating over the posterior distribution of phylogenies, in order to quantify uncertainty in nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution estimates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007976.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While synonymous rates are expected to reflect mutation rates and generation times, non-synonymous rates will also be affected by (immune) selective pressure.
