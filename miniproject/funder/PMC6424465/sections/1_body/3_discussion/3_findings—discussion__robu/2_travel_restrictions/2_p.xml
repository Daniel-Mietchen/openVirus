<p>When commuting was modelled by a radiation law, there was little effect of travel restrictions on reducing final size, and no effect for the lowest clustering levels. This is likely due to the construction of the radiation law, which does not directly depend on distance, but rather on the population density between the locations, suppressing some of the clustering effects that are found with the gravity law. Less area is protected for the radiation law, especially for the lowest clustering levels, indicating that the countries are more well-connected through the commuting network, decreasing the effect of travel restrictions.</p>
