<p>Our results are in agreement with [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], where travel restrictions were found to delay the epidemic. In [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it was found that a 50% travel restriction delayed the epidemic by 1.5 weeks, and we find a delay of 3-10 days, depending on the clustering level. With 90% travel restrictions, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found a delay in the epidemic by a few days and [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] found a one week delay in the spread. In our simulations, we found a delay of 4-27 days with 90% travel restrictions, depending on the clustering level. Our results are thus similar to the results in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for the higher clustering levels (more specifically, 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 3.0, 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 2.0 and 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 1.5), while we find larger delay effects for the lower clustering levels.
