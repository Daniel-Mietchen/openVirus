<p>The peak occurred earlier for higher clustering levels for all the settings, except when the distance parameter was doubled. Travel restrictions were found to delay the peak for most settings. However, for the UK based country, with doubled destination population parameter and the radiation law settings, this was only the case for the lower clustering levels, while there was no delay effect for the higher clustering levels. Overall, the delay effects were smaller for the UK based country, the radiation law setting and when doubling the destination population parameter. Travel restrictions were more effective in delaying the peak for the lower clustering levels. This was true for all the settings considered, but the effect sizes depended on the various parameter choices and settings.</p>
