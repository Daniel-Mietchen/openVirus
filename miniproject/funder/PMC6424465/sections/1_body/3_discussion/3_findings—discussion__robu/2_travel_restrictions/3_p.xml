<p>We investigated further how the reduction of final size varied by the type of location, that is, how rural or urban the location is. For all but the most urban locations, the final size clearly increased more with increased amount of travel for the higher clustering levels. The effect of travel restrictions on epidemic final size was thus larger for the higher clustering levels, but the effect was most prominent in the less urban areas. This was also the case when varying the length of stay for the long distance travellers, for the different set of disease parameters and for the country based on UK commuting and population size distributions. This is in accordance with [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], where they find no effect of travel restrictions in urban areas. The fact that the effect of travel restrictions was most prominent in the rural areas, might make them less attractive to implement. On the other hand, health care services are more scarce in rural areas than in urban areas, so it might also be attractive that the travel restrictions are most effective in the rural areas. This should be taken into account by policy planners and decision makers.
