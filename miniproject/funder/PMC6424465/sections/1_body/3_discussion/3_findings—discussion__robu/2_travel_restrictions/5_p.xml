  <bold>Peak prevalence and timing</bold>
 </italic>. Internal travel restrictions delayed and reduced the peak. The reduction in peak prevalence was robust to all the settings considered. Under travel restrictions, we found that the higher the clustering, the higher the peak. This finding held for a range of parameter choices and assumptions, but the peak prevalence did not increase with clustering when commuting was modelled by a radiation law. For the exponential distance function in the gravity law, this was only the case for the full travel ban setting.
