 </italic>. In contrast with the baseline scenario, population clustering had an effect on the outcome measures under travel restrictions. Most importantly, the final size decreased with increased clustering. The effect of travel restrictions on decreasing the final size was stronger for higher clustering levels. This finding was quite robust to the various parameters and choices, but we note some discrepancies. When halving the distance parameter of the gravity law, travel restrictions effectively reduced the final size for both high and low clustering levels, and hence clustering mattered less in this setting. The decrease in final size under travel restrictions was larger in this setting than for the main analysis. When the distance parameter is decreased, the destination and origin population increase in importance relative to the distance, and hence the commuting patterns become more similar for the different clustering levels. In the limit of lim

 </sup>, the commuting networks are equal, and so we expect clustering to be less important for a lower distance parameter. For the UK based country, the reduction in final size with travel restrictions was larger than for the main analysis for higher clustering levels, and smaller for the lower clustering levels. The effect of travel restrictions on reducing final size was smaller for an exponential distance function in the gravity law, and there was no effect for the lowest clustering levels. Doubling the distance parameter in the gravity law, there was also no effect of travel restrictions on reducing final size for the lowest clustering levels. In these two commuting models, the distance is punished more, hence, there is more commuting to proximate locations compared to the gravity law used in the main analysis. Therefore, the country is more well-connected through the commuting network, especially for the lower clustering levels, and travel restrictions on non-commuting travel are most likely therefore less effective.
