<p>In a baseline scenario (no travel restrictions, no prior immunity and no vaccination), we found that the population clustering did not play an important role in outcome measures. This finding was robust across a range of different parameter values and choicesâ€”for a different set of disease parameters, for a fictional country based on a UK gravity law and population distribution, when varying the length of stay for the long distance travellers, when varying the shape and parameters of the gravity law and when modelling the commuting with a radiation law.</p>
