 </italic>. There are of course ethical issues with spatially targeted vaccination strategies. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) ethical guidelines state that allocation of limited resources should be guided by equity [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], focus is given to the trade off between equity, simplicity and robustness for efficient spatial allocation policies. Hence, the policy makers have to balance the effectiveness of the vaccine strategy and equity. In our setting, the urban vaccination strategy performed only slightly better than the uniform (fair) vaccination strategy, and hence the uniform vaccination strategy would be recommendable, taking equity into account.
