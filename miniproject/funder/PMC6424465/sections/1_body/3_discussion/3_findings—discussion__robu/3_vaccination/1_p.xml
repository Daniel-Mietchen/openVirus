<p>Preferentially vaccinating urban locations was the single most effective strategy in reducing final size, though only slightly better than vaccinating uniformly. This is in accordance with the result in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], indicating little difference in the final size with a pro rata (uniform) vaccination strategy, and a sequential vaccination by population size-strategy. Preferentially vaccinating the more rural locations was clearly the most inferior strategy. The vaccination was slightly more effective for the lower clustering levels, but the epidemic progression was robust to the population clustering under all three vaccination strategies (in line with the baseline scenario), as opposed to under the travel restriction settings. This may be due to the travel restrictions breaking down specific infection routes, as opposed to the vaccination.
