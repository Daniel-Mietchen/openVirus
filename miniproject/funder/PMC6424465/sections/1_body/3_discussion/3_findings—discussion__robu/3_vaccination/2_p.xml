 </italic>. We implemented a combination strategy, combining 99% travel restrictions with the three different vaccination strategies. We found that the most effective strategy for reducing the final size of the epidemic was a combination of travel restrictions with urban vaccination, for all the clustering levels. The difference between the final size for the urban vaccination strategy and the uniform vaccination strategy was (slightly) larger for the higher clustering levels. This is likely because when extensive travel restrictions were imposed, the most rural areas were protected, as we have seen in the analyses. The combination strategy was very efficient in reducing the final size. Travel restrictions further reduced the final size with almost 20 percentage points for the lowest clustering level and 15 percentage points for the highest clustering level. For lower
