<p>We have proposed a method for generating spatial fields with controllable levels of clustering of the population. The clustering is controlled by a design parameter 
 <italic>Îº</italic>. Combined with an SEIR model for infectious diseases, we have used this tool to investigate the interplay between infectious disease spread, the effectiveness of interventions and population clustering. This framework is more general and could also easily be applied to the problem of simultaneously investigating the tendency for people to move to cities and the population growth. We have studied the urbanisation phenomenon from a theoretical viewpoint, and hope that this will inspire other, more data-driven and applied studies on urbanisation in specific settings for specific populations.
