<p>Our study is subject to limitations. The scaling from Norwegian municipalities to block units should be handled with care. The data that we used to fit the population size distribution and gravity law were on a different scale than the block units used in the fictional country, and we can not assess how well these models generalise to the finer block unit scale. In addition, different ways of dividing the population into administrative units could yield different population distributions, which could affect the results. We believe that it is of key importance to model the commuting and the population sizes for the same scale and population, and since commuting data are not available on a finer scale (due to for instance privacy regulations), we have chosen to use the finest scale available for the commuting data. The block units can then be interpreted as a discretisation of administrative units. Census data are often collected for administrative units, but mobile phone data could be used as an information source for commuting on a square gridded fine scale resolution, and would have been an interesting alternative. The fine scale resolution of the fictional country is necessary for the clustering algorithm to provide smooth transitions between the different clustering levels. The fact that we consider the country in isolation and ignore bordering countries can result in edge effects, since the locations on the border might in reality have a connection to the neighbouring countries.</p>
