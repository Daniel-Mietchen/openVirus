<p>We address some of these limitations in our sensitivity analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>. To handle the fact that different ways of defining administrative regions could affect the population distribution and in turn the results, we also perform the analysis on a country based on population data from the United Kingdom. The population size distribution for Norway was quite heterogeneous compared to other European countries examined, while United Kingdom had a more homogeneous population size distribution. Here, a gravity law fitted to commuting data for the United Kingdom is also used. We also perform sensitivity analysis on the parameters and shape of the gravity law. Though the qualitative patterns were not so sensitive to the choice of commuting model, the effect sizes were not robust to the shape of the commuting law.
