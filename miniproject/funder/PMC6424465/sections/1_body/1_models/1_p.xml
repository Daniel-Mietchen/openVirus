<p>In order to investigate how population clustering affects infectious disease dynamics, we build a series of countries with varying population clustering, where everything else is fixed. Imagine something like taking one country and reshuffling its population, so to increase monotonically its level of urbanisation. We construct a fictional country, where the spatial clustering of population sizes is controlled by a design parameter. However, we try to conserve some realism in the different ingredients of the framework. The realism is obtained by using a population size distribution and commuting law fitted to data from Norwegian municipalities.</p>
