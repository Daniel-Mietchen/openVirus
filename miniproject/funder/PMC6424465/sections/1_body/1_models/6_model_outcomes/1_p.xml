<p>The epidemics are compared by examination of final size, peak date, peak prevalence and the proportion of area that is not infected during the epidemic. The final size is defined as the total number who were infected during the epidemic. The peak date is the date with the highest number infected, and the peak prevalence is the proportion infected on the peak date. The area not infected is the proportion of block units where the prevalence was never larger than a threshold for seven consecutive days. The threshold is 1.0%, except from in the locations where the population size is less than 100, then the threshold is one case.</p>
