<p>We assume that we have enough vaccines to vaccinate 40% of the population, similar to the vaccine coverage in Norway during the 2009 pandemic [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We let the individuals eligible for the vaccine be the susceptible individuals. We assume that the vaccine efficacy is 70%, so that 70% of the vaccinated individuals become immune to the virus, while the remaining 30% remain susceptible, in line with estimates of the efficacy of the 2009 pandemic vaccine [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Susceptible individuals who are vaccinated but still susceptible, are likely to experience fewer symptoms and be more resistant to the virus if they become infected, so we assume that they are 20% less infectious (in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>, we also analyse the more optimistic setting where they are 80% less infectious). We assume that the vaccine is introduced 75 days after the first influenza case introduction, and that the vaccines are distributed uniformly (in time) each day for six weeks.
