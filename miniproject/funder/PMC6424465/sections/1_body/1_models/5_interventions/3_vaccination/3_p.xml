<p>In the setting with uniform vaccination, we vaccinate (approximately) 40% of the population in each location. The approximation is due to the integer approximations, so we vaccinate to the nearest integer. Since we do not vaccinate immediately, there might be locations where the number of susceptibles is too small to vaccinate 40%. The remaining vaccination doses are then uniformly distributed in the other locations. In the urban vaccination strategy, we vaccinate preferentially in urban locations, by only vaccinating the 50% largest locations, using the same total number of vaccines as in the uniform vaccination setting. In the rural vaccination strategy, we vaccinate preferentially in rural locations, by leaving out the 2% locations with highest population size, using the same total number of vaccines as in the uniform vaccination setting.</p>
