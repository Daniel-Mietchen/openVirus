<p>Travel restrictions are varied through the amount of non-commuting travel in the simulations, for the various levels of population clustering. The scenarios we consider are 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0 (only commuting), 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/1000, 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/100 and 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/10 (baseline scenario).
