<p>The disease dynamics model is a metapopulation model which can be described as a network where every node represents a location, and every edge between locations represents people who travel between the locations and thus can spread the disease further. In every location there is a separate set of stochastic difference equations governing the local disease dynamics, but the processes are coupled through travellers. Similar disease dynamics models are used for instance in [
