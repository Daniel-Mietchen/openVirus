<p>The travel probability is set to control the ratio of non-commuting to commuting. We denote this ratio by 
 <italic>τ</italic>. A ratio of non-commuting travel to commuting of 1/10 is likely to be the most plausible travel ratio, in the baseline scenario with no travel restrictions. Hence, 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/10 is the baseline scenario. By using the number of yearly domestic flights in Norway as a proxy for non-commuting travel, we find a ratio of non-commuting travel to commuting of approximately 1/12. This is in agreement with [
