<p>The process is stochastic, and we perform 100 disease simulations for each clustering level and report the average. The epidemic is dynamically seeded by placing one infectious individual in ten different locations with large population size (above the 80% quantile), and two infectious individuals in the location with largest population size, every day. This corresponds to 12 seeding events daily, which is 0.04% of the number of arriving international air travel passengers in Norway in 2016, as in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The seeding locations have the same population sizes for all the different clustering levels. The disease parameters are set to mimic an influenza with high transmissibility, since implementations of interventions are more relevant for influenza strains with large transmission potential. The average latent period is set to 1.9 days, the average infectious period is set to 3.0 days (as in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) and the transmission parameter is set to 0.60, corresponding to a basic reproductive number of 1.50.
