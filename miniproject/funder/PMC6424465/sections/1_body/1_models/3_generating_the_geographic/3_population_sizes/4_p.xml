<p>In some of the results, the locations are grouped according to population size. We let Q1 denote areas which have population size smaller than the 25% quantile, Q2 denote areas with population size between the 25% quantile and the median, Q3 denote areas with population size between the median and 75% quantile, and Q4 denote areas with population size larger than the 75% quantile. So Q1 are the most rural areas, while Q4 are the most urban areas in our simulations.</p>
