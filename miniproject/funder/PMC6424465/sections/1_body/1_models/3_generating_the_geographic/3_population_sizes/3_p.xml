<p>We fit distributions to normalised population data from various other countries, to assess similarity across countries. The fitted population distributions are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g001">Fig 1</xref>. For France, we use the 334 arrondissements [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], for Italy the 107 provinces [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], for Netherlands the 388 municipalities [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], for Denmark the 98 municipalities [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], for Iceland the 129 post codes (data for 2017 from Statistics Iceland) and for UK the population sizes in the 424 local authorities (Office for National Statistics GB, estimates for 2016). The population sizes in the Norwegian municipalities seem to be more heterogeneous than for the other countries, with a higher occurrence of smaller population sizes. The UK distribution seems most homogeneous. Noticeably, all the population distributions are skewed. Note that these administrative levels are not standardised across the different countries. Therefore comparison between countries must be treated with caution.
