<p>The block units are assigned populations which are drawn from a gamma distribution. We use 6561 block units with unit area 81 km
 <sup>2</sup>, corresponding to a total area of approximately 530 000 km
 <sup>2</sup>. We rescale our resulting population sizes to sum up to 6 000 000 (slightly larger than Norway). The data are from Statistics Norway for 2016, and we use the 428 municipalities, excluding Svalbard. We use the municipality scale, because this is the finest spatial scale for which we have both population size data and commuting data. The block units can be interpreted as a discretisation of administrative units, so that multiple block units can make up one administrative unit. We do not use the population sizes in the administrative units directly, because a finer scale is necessary for the clustering algorithm to generate smooth distributions. The number of block units is chosen as a trade off between a high resolution, and computational feasibility.
