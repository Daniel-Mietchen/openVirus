<p>The construction process consists of two steps. First, we generate the population sizes in the block units of the country by drawing a random sample from a reasonable population distribution. In the second step, we apply a clustering algorithm, generating different versions of the country with various levels of clustering. The clustering is done by rearranging the block units according to a mapping rule.</p>
