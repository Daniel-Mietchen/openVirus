<p>In order to assess what a reasonable range for 
 <italic>κ</italic> is, we perform a visual comparison to some real countries (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Iceland seems to have the highest population clustering level (similar to 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 3.0). Norway and France also seem to have a high population clustering, similar to 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 1.5 or 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 2.0. The United Kingdom seems to be somewhere between 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 1.5 and 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 1.0. Germany seems to be somewhere between 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.5 and 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.8, while the Netherlands seem similar to something between 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.8 and 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 1.0. Similarities are found by visual inspection. A more formal estimation or assessment of 
 <italic>κ</italic> is beyond the scope of this paper. The transformation that we use from the random spatial field to the resulting versions of the countries with different clustering levels is not linear, and it is thus not possible to formally estimate 
 <italic>κ</italic>. However, we are not aiming at providing quantitative results for specific countries, nor is our framework the best choice for that purpose. We are interested in general trends when 
 <italic>κ</italic> is varied, both qualitative and quantitative, in order to be able to make comparisons between different cases. However, the absolute measures (the peak dates, final sizes etc.) are not translatable to specific real settings. When a quantity like the non-infected area during an epidemic changes monotonically when the (synthetic) level of urbanisation increases, then we will hypothesise that urbanisation affects the quantity. When we do not discover a monotone effect, we will conclude that a dependency is less likely.
