<p>In this section, the different parts of the simulation framework will be described. We first describe how to generate the geographical areas, with a plausible population distribution. We then introduce the clustering algorithm that is used to generate different versions of the geographical area, with different levels of clustering. Then we describe the models for the two (coupled) dynamical processes for the geographical areas—the infectious disease process and the mobility process. Finally, we describe the interventions—the internal travel restrictions and the vaccination strategies.</p>
