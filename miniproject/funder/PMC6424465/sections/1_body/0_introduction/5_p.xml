<p>To our knowledge, this is the first modelling and simulation study which systematically investigates the effect of population clustering on the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, it is the first study to consider the effect of internal travel restrictions and vaccination in relation to urbanisation. This is a study of the urbanisation phenomenon represented in a very simplified and theoretical way, yet with important elements of realism. We focus on these two control strategies, because they are clearly affected by urbanisation. We do not consider international air travel restrictions, school closure or other sanitary measures, which were used for instance during the 2009 pandemic [

There has been some work on infectious disease spread and urbanisation focussing on the improved health conditions in urban areas compared to rural areas. For the developed countries, health has overall improved with increased urbanisation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In low-income settings, health conditions are on average better in urban areas than in rural areas, but there are also significant challenges relating to inequities and heterogeneity in health among the urban population (favelas, slums, etc.). High population density increases exposure to infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Africa, the urban population has better nutritional status, fewer morbid events, increased vaccine coverage and better access to healthcare services compared to the rural population, and have reduced levels of malaria transmission and other severe diseases [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There is also one study, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which develops a model for the effect of urbanisation on the transmission of infectious diseases, focussing on population growth and land use development. However, the infectious disease spread model is very simple. In addition, they do not consider the effect of interventions.
