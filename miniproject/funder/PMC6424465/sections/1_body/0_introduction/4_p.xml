<p>The plausibility of the synthetic country is obtained by conserving the population size distribution of Norway and a gravity law fitted to data on commuting between Norwegian municipalities. We use Norwegian data to ensure reasonable population sizes, and plausible commuting for those population sizes, and because we have commuting data available on a relatively fine spatial scale. We are studying the urbanisation phenomenon generically, and we do not claim, nor is it our aim, that these results are directly applicable to Norway. This framework is a simulator, and it is not our purpose to model and provide results for a specific country. Our results allow a theoretical description of how urbanisation affects interventions to control epidemics.</p>
