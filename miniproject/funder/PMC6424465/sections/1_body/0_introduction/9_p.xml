<p>We first describe the simulation set-up with details on the properties of the fictional country, the clustering algorithm, the disease dynamics model, the travel restrictions and vaccination strategies. We then use this tool to simulate the infectious disease spread for the various levels of clustering, investigate the effect of various amounts of internal travel restrictions, simulate and investigate the effect of the three vaccination strategies and finally a combination of travel restrictions and vaccination. We end with discussion and concluding remarks.</p>
