<p>We aim at studying the urbanisation phenomenon and its effect on infectious disease spread in a general setting. Our purpose is not to describe single outbreaks in specific populations, or finding the “best model” or strategy for a specific country, but rather study the phenomenon from a more generic and principled point of view.</p>
