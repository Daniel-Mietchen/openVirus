<p>We investigate how domestic travel restrictions and vaccination affects the epidemic timing, spread and final size for the various levels of population clustering. For policy planners, the timing of peak dates and initial dates are important because they indicate how much time there is to implement interventions and preventive measures. If peak dates for spatially proximate regions are close in time, the efficiency of the health care organisation is challenged. This is extra problematic if there is in addition clustering of high peak incidences, since that would imply that spatially proximate locations have high disease activity at the same time. We further disentangle the effect of travel restrictions on final size of the epidemic by examining how the effect depends on how urban or rural the location is.</p>
