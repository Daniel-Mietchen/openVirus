<p>In this paper, we explore the effect of internal travel restrictions and vaccination on infectious disease spread, when the clustering of population is continuously varied. By internal travel restrictions, we will refer to restrictions on non-commuting travel within the country. If the disease dynamics is different for different levels of population clustering, this can have important implications for the effectiveness and design of interventions. In order to study this, we need a continuous series of countries where everything is fixed, apart from the urbanisation, which changes between the countries in a controllable and continuous manner. This is difficult in practice, and we therefore construct a fictional country for this purpose, however trying to maintain some realism. Our aim is not to develop a precise model for urbanisation in a country. We aim for a simple model, where urbanisation is controlled by one single tuning parameter, which captures key features of urbanisation. We use this model to generate a fictional country with a plausible population distributed in urban and rural areas. More specifically, we use a plausible population size distribution, plausible commuting patterns modelled by a gravity law and a plausible infectious disease model. We use a metapopulation infectious disease model, where an SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) process [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] governs the disease dynamics in each location, and the different locations are coupled through individuals travelling between them. This framework allows us to investigate in silico how urbanisation affects various aspects of infectious disease spread. As a motivating example, we will study an influenza-like illness spreading in a single country, where we assume that the pathogen has already been imported to the country. We investigate how the infectious disease dynamics depends on the underlying population clustering in the country and focus on the effect of internal travel restrictions and three different vaccination strategies.
