<p>We are living in a world which is continuously urbanising. From a United Nations report [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we know that in 2014, 54% of the population was living in urban areas. By 2050, they estimate that 66% of the population will be living in urban areas. The number of “megacities” is also increasing [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Urbanisation involves clustering of people within a geographical area [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Migration from rural to urban areas is one of the key drivers of urbanisation, and results in spatial expansion of urban centers [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Though there are also other characteristics of urbanisation, like urban sprawl [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and population growth, we here focus on this population clustering. By population clustering, we mean that large cities are often surrounded by other cities or suburbs with large population sizes. Rural areas also tend to appear in clusters (i.e. positioned closely together). This has for instance been found to be the case for the Turku region in Finland, where regions of both high and low population densities are clustered [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Another example is Australia, where the majority of the population is clustered around the coastal belt [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. From here on, the term urbanisation will be used to refer to the population clustering.
