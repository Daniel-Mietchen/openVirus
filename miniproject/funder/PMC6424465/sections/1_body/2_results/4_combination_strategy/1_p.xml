<p>The impact of the vaccination strategies were quite robust to the underlying population clustering. Since the travel restriction intervention resulted in more protected rural area the higher the clustering, we investigated whether the performance of the vaccination strategies in combination with travel restriction differed from the performance without any travel restrictions. The peak dates, peak prevalences, areas not infected and final sizes for the different strategies and clustering levels are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g014">Fig 14</xref>. The urban and the uniform vaccination strategies were very similar, also when travel restrictions were included. The peak dates were slightly delayed (only with a couple of days) with increased clustering for the urban and the uniform vaccination strategies. Under the rural vaccination strategy, the peak dates occurred earlier for the higher clustering levels than for the lower clustering levels. For the area not infected, the different vaccination strategies were much more similar when travel restrictions were included, and the protected area increased compared to vaccination only or travel restrictions only. The combination strategy further reduced the final size and the peak prevalence for all vaccination strategies, but the qualitative relationship with population clustering was similar to the vaccination only setting. The urban vaccination strategy combined with travel restrictions reduced the final size with 87% for the lowest clustering level, and with 78% for the highest clustering level. For the uniform vaccination strategy, the corresponding reductions were 85% and 76%. Though they were very similar, the difference between the final size for the urban vaccination strategy and the uniform vaccination strategy was larger for the higher clustering levels. Hence for all clustering levels, there was a (small and non-significant) benefit in using the urban vaccination strategy instead of the uniform vaccination strategy, but the benefit was (slightly) larger for higher clustering levels.
