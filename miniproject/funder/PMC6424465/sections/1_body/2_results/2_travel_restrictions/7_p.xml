<p>The peak dates for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/1000 and 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/100 are given in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g007">7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g008">8</xref>, respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows that for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/1000, there were some clusters of protected locations which did not experience the infection in any of the simulations. Comparing with the situation with 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g006">Fig 6</xref>, we found that when adding the non-commuting travel, the infection was no longer trapped in the larger hubs for the higher levels of clustering, but was able to infect a larger area of the country. There were also some protected clusters of locations with 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/100 (as opposed to the baseline scenario).
