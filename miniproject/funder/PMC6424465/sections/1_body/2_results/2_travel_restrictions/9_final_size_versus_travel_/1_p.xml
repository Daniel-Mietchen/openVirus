<p>To further investigate the relationship between final size and travel ratio for the various clustering levels, we also considered 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/400, 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/200, 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/80, 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/40 and 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/20, in addition to 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0 (only commuting), 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/1000, 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/100 and 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/10. The final size of the epidemic versus travel ratio for the different levels of clustering are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g010">Fig 10a</xref>. For all the clustering levels, the final size increased with increased travel ratio, as expected, and the confidence bands are insignificant compared to the variation over the 
 <italic>τ</italic> range. We found a much larger increase in final size when increasing the amount of non-commuting travel for the higher levels of clustering, than for the lower clustering levels. Hence there was a rapid increase in final size for the highest clustering levels with increased amounts of non-commuting travel. Further inspecting the final size in the various locations, we found that the decrease in final size with travel restrictions was mainly due to fewer locations being infected, but there was also some decrease in final size beyond this effect. In particular, comparing the final size in the locations which are hit in every 
 <italic>τ</italic>-scenario, the difference in final size is largest for 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 2.0, where the average final size decreases from 0.584 (
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/10) to 0.575 (
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0). The smallest difference is for 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0, where the average final size is slightly larger for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0 than for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/10 (0.583 versus 0.582). For other 
 <italic>κ</italic> values, there was a decrease, however, the decrease was much smaller than the total decrease in final size, due to fewer locations being hit.
