<p>From the plots of the peak dates for the various travel ratios, there seemed to be some protected clusters in the settings with a low 
 <italic>τ</italic>, where the epidemic seemed to be restricted to the hubs. We therefore expect the epidemic risk to be different for locations with different population sizes. We plotted the mean final size versus travel ratio, for various levels of 
 <italic>κ</italic>, in areas of different population size. The final sizes for the Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 areas are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g010">Fig 10b–10e</xref>. For the Q1, Q2 and Q3 areas, we found that the higher levels of clustering were more affected by the travel restrictions. The final size in these areas increased more with increasing 
 <italic>τ</italic> for large 
 <italic>κ</italic>. This coincides with high population clustering having protected clusters for lower values of 
 <italic>τ</italic>. For the Q4 areas, we also found a more rapid increase in final size for the higher clustering levels, but the curve quickly levels off to a point where a further increase in 
 <italic>τ</italic> does not affect the final size much. In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>, we fit functions for final size versus 
 <italic>τ</italic> for all the clustering levels, and find a monotone and positive relationship between growth rate and 
 <italic>κ</italic> for the Q1, Q2 and Q3 locations.
