<p>For 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/1000, fewer locations were infected and the final size decreased with increased clustering, just as in the setting with 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0 (cf. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The same was found for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/100 in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, but the differences were smaller. The effect of travel restrictions on reducing the final size was larger with higher clustering. The 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0, 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 3.0 scenario had 21% reduced final size, while the 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0, no clustering-scenario had a 9% reduction. For the 99% travel restrictions, the reductions were 19% for 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 3.0 and 8% for the scenario without clustering. For the 90% travel restrictions, the corresponding reductions were 12% and 6%.
