<p>We performed sensitivity analysis with respect to delay in implementation of travel restrictions, the length of stay for the non-commuter travellers, the disease parameters and the country the population data is based on (population size distribution and gravity law). We performed sensitivity analysis with respect to the parameters in the gravity law and the shape of the gravity law. We performed the analysis using the radiation law [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] to model commuting, instead of the gravity law, and an analysis with an increased range parameter of the Mat√©rn covariance function. In addition, we performed simulations in the setting where only the symptomatic infectious individuals were restricted from travelling. In general, the qualitative results for the various sensitivity analyses were similar to the results in the main analysis, and the details are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The effect sizes differ between the various settings. We will also comment on the robustness of the different qualitative results to these settings in the Discussion section.
