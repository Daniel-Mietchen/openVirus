<p>We have plotted the peak date for the mean global prevalence curve, peak prevalence, mean area not infected and mean final size for the various levels of clustering, for the baseline scenario and the travel restriction scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The peak dates occurred earlier for increased levels of clustering, for all the travel ratios. In addition, the curves were very similar for the three travel restriction scenarios, while the peak dates occurred earlier for the baseline scenario. Hence, implementing travel restrictions delayed the epidemic peak. For the peak prevalence, we note that the higher levels of travel restrictions, the lower the peak. The decrease in peak prevalence was larger for the lower clustering levels. The decrease in peak prevalence for 99% travel restrictions compared to the baseline scenario was 38% for the highest clustering level and 48% for the lowest clustering level. There was almost no difference between the 99% travel ban scenario and the 100% travel ban scenario. The peak prevalence increased with increased clustering. The difference in peak prevalence with clustering was more prominent the more extensive the travel restrictions. The peak prevalence for 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 3.0 was 20% higher than the peak prevalence for the “no clustering”-level for the complete travel ban scenario. For the mean area not infected, there was little difference between the 99% travel restrictions and the full travel ban setting. The more travel restrictions, the more area was protected. In addition, the amount of area which was protected increased with increased clustering, and the effect of clustering was stronger the more travel restrictions. For the final sizes, we found that the more travel restrictions, the lower the final size. In addition, as we have seen, for the travel restriction scenarios, the final size was lower for higher clustering levels. The more extensive the travel restrictions, the larger the difference between the various clustering levels.
