<p>Overall, the epidemic peaked earlier with higher levels of clustering. We plotted the peak date versus travel ratio, for the different

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g011">Fig 11</xref>. The difference in peak date between the clustering levels decreased with increased non-commuting travel, as expected, and there was a rapid decrease for the low clustering levels. Travel restrictions delayed the epidemic with up to one week for the highest clustering levels and up to five weeks for the lowest clustering levels.
