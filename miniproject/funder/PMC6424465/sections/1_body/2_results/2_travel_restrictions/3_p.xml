<p>The global prevalence curves for the different clustering levels for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0 are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g005">Fig 5a</xref>. The higher clustering levels experienced an earlier peak and a higher peak prevalence. Considering the confidence bands, these curves are significantly different—not between every clustering level, but the prevalence curves for the higher clustering levels are significantly different from the prevalence curves for the lower clustering levels. Interestingly, the higher peak prevalence did not imply a larger final size, as could be expected. Instead, the higher clustering levels had both higher peak prevalences and lower final sizes.
