<p>The mean global prevalence curves for the settings with 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/1000 and 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/100 are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g005">Fig 5b and 5c</xref>, respectively. In the prevalence curves for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/1000, we got similar results as for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 0, with an earlier and sharper peak for the higher clustering levels. The same was found for 
 <italic>τ</italic> = 1/100, but the differences between the curves were smaller, as expected.
