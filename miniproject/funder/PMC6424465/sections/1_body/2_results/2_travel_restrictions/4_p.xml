 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s006">S5</xref> Figs. There was spatial clustering in both the initial dates, peak dates, peak incidences and probabilities of experiencing the epidemic, and the spatial clustering increased with increased (population) clustering levels. The more clustered the country, the fewer locations were infected on average (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the peak dates plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g006">Fig 6</xref>, we see that we had some locations which were not infected in any of the 100 simulations (coloured white). For the higher 
 <italic>κ</italic>, these non-infected locations were clustered, and the cluster sizes increased with 
 <italic>κ</italic>. The epidemic did not spread throughout the whole country for the highest clustering levels, but seemed to be restricted to the highly populated area.
