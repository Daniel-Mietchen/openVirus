<p>The global prevalence curves for the rural vaccination strategy are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g012">Fig 12c</xref>. Again, the peak timing seemed to be quite similar for all the clustering levels, with a higher peak for the higher clustering levels. The mean area not infected and mean final size are given in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. With the rural vaccination strategy, less area was infected, but the final size was a lot larger than for the urban and uniform vaccination strategies, due to both a higher peak prevalence and a longer epidemic. There was only a 42% reduction in final size for the 
 <italic>Îº</italic> = 3.0 version, and 44% for the least clustered version. Comparing the final sizes for the rural vaccination strategy and the urban vaccination strategy yields that the difference was larger for the lowest clustering levels.
