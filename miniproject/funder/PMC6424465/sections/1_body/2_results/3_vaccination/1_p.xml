<p>In the setting with only regular commuting, there were some clusters of protected locations for the highest clustering levels, and the epidemic seemed to be restricted to the hubs. It might therefore be a more effective use of vaccines to allocate all the resources to the most urban locations, since the more rural locations are more protected from the epidemic. However, a different strategy would be to preferentially allocate resources to exactly these rural locations, since the vaccination is more likely to successfully eliminate the risk in these locations.</p>
