<p>The global prevalence curves for the urban vaccination strategy are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g012">Fig 12b</xref>. The prevalence curves were very similar to the uniform vaccination setting. The mean area not infected and mean final size are given in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. More area was infected in this setting compared to the uniform vaccination setting. The final sizes were slightly smaller in the urban vaccination setting compared to the uniform vaccination setting, for all clustering levels except 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 3.0. The effectiveness of this vaccination strategy compared to the uniform vaccination strategy did not seem to depend on the underlying population clustering of the country. The reduction in final size for the country without clustering was 67% while the reduction under the 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 3.0 scenario was 63%.
