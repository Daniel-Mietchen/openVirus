<p>We have plotted the peak date for the mean global prevalence curve, peak prevalence, mean area not infected and mean final size for the various levels of clustering, for the baseline scenario and the different vaccination strategies. The plot is given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g013">Fig 13</xref>. The peak dates were slightly later for the lower clustering levels than for the higher clustering levels, for the baseline and the rural vaccination strategy. The peak date was similar for the urban and uniform vaccination strategy, while it occurred later for the rural vaccination strategy. All vaccination strategies reduced the peak. The reduction was larger for the uniform and urban vaccination strategies (which were very similar), than for the rural vaccination strategy. The peak prevalence increased slightly with increased clustering under all vaccination schemes. The area infected seemed robust to the population clustering. For the final sizes, we clearly see a reduction with all the vaccination strategies, and the uniform and urban vaccination strategies were the most effective (and very similar), while the rural was a lot less effective. In addition, the final size was quite robust to the underlying clustering, but there was a slightly larger final size for the higher clustering levels.
