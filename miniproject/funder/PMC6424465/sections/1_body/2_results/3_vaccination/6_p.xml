<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006879.s001">S1 Text</xref>, we repeated the vaccination simulations, where we assumed that the vaccinated non-immune individuals were 80% less infectious (and not 20% as in the results presented here). The qualitative results were the same, and the final sizes were only slightly smaller for this more optimistic scenario. The urban vaccination strategy was the most effective in reducing final size for all clustering levels, and the uniform vaccination strategy performed similarly.
