<p>The global prevalence curves in the uniform (pro rata) vaccination setting are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g012">Fig 12a</xref>. The peak timing of the epidemic was similar for the different clustering levels, but there was a higher peak for the higher clustering levels (however note that the confidence bands are overlapping). The mean area not infected and final sizes are given in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Uniform vaccination reduced the final size substantially for all the clustering levels, compared to the baseline scenario and the travel restriction settings (cf. Tables 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The reduction was slightly larger for the lower levels of clustering (i.e. a 65-66% reduction in final size for the no clustering, 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.1 and 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 0.2 versions, compared to a 63-64% reduction for the 
 <italic>κ</italic> ≥ 1 versions).
