<p>In order to compare the dynamics for the different levels of population clustering, the disease spread was simulated for the various clustering levels. It is intuitive that with a large enough amount of non-commuting travel, there will be sufficient mixing between all the block units in the country for the population structure not to play a role in the disease dynamics. The mean global prevalence curves for the different clustering levels are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g003">Fig 3</xref> for the baseline scenario with no vaccination and no travel restrictions. The curves were visually very similar, but the higher clustering levels tended to have a higher and earlier peak. Note that the confidence bands were overlapping for most clustering levels. This indicates that with the baseline amount of non-commuting, the mixing was so high that the underlying population clustering seemed to have little effect on the disease dynamics. Slightly less area was infected for the higher clustering levels, and the final sizes were slightly smaller the more clustering (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006879.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The peak dates (the day with the largest number of infected symptomatic individuals) in the different block units are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006879.g004">Fig 4</xref>. The epidemic was able to spread throughout the whole country. We found spatial clustering in peak dates (by visual inspection), and the spatial clustering was larger the more clustered the country in terms of population size.
