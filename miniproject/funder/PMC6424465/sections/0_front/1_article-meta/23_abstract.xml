 <p>We study the interplay between urbanisation and infectious disease spread. As part of the worldwide urbanisation process, people are continuously moving to urban areas, and the cities are growing in size. This causes clusters of areas with high population density and clusters of areas with low population density, which is what we call population clustering. By simulating infectious disease spread in a synthetic country where we vary this population clustering, we explore the consequences of urbanisation on infectious disease spread. Our qualitative results have direct implications for infectious disease control guidelines and policies. We find that implementing internal travel restrictions have greater impact on the final number ill in the most urbanised countries than in the less urbanised countries. The effect is largest in the more rural parts of the country. According to our model, travel restrictions are more effective in delaying the epidemic in the less urbanised countries than in the more urbanised countries. We investigate vaccination strategies, where locations are targeted depending on how urban or rural they are. We find that it is important to vaccinate the urban locationsâ€”if the most urban locations are not covered by the vaccine, the final number ill will be a lot larger.</p>
