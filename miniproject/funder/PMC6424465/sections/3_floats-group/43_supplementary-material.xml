  <title>Peak dates, peak prevalence, area not infected and final size, exponential distance function.</title>
  <p>Peak dates for the global mean prevalence curve, peak prevalence, mean area not infected and mean final size as a function of clustering, with 95% confidence bands, with an exponential function of distance in the gravity law. The lines correspond to the baseline scenario, 90% travel restrictions, 99% travel restrictions and 100% travel restrictions. Top left: peak date. Top right: peak prevalence. Bottom left: area not infected. Bottom right: final size.</p>
