  <title>Peak dates, peak prevalence, area not infected and final size, 20% reduced infectiousness.</title>
  <p>Peak dates for the global mean prevalence curve, peak prevalence, mean area not infected and mean final size as a function of clustering, with 95% confidence bands, when the assumed infectiousness of non-immune vaccinated is reduced by 20%. The lines correspond to the baseline scenario, uniform vaccination, urban vaccination and rural vaccination. Top left: peak date. Top right: peak prevalence. Bottom left: area not infected. Bottom right: final size.</p>
