<p>We present an analytical framework to understand the evolutionary histories of organisms that are characterized by periods of isolation. Our theoretical investigations identify specific genomic signatures of past population isolation. We show, for example, that the number, size, and dynamics of modes in the distributions of the pairwise nucleotide differences in populations are informative on the existence of past isolation. Our results extend previous work on the distribution of pairwise coalescence times and pairwise nucleotide differences under a model of population split with or without migration (IM model). We show, for example, that under the reconnection model, the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences has a temporal evolution which is distinct from the one expected under an IM model (

 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg and Feldman 2002</xref>): the distribution is first bimodal and then tends to become unimodal with time. We also found that in the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), the presence, the position and the value variants in excess are informative as to the numbers of previously isolated populations, and the joint SFS characterizes the amount of genetic overlap between populations. Signatures identified here are robust to the presence of recombination, extinction-colonization processes, population bottlenecks, and expansion as well as skewed offspring distributions. Our developments add to the current literature in the field as we demonstrate that population reconnection after isolation is not fully captured by commonly used test statistics based on SFS classes of variants at high and/or low frequencies such as
