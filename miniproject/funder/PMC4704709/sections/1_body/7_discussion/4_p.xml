<p>Our methods also appear robust to high mutation rates and the presence of selection. Indeed, we detect past HIV-1 history despite its extraordinary defining features: HIV has a small genome (about 9.8 kb in length), a short generation time (24 hr;

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Keele 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>)]. Nevertheless, the signature observed here in the distributions of pairwise nucleotide difference and on SFS only slightly deviates from theoretical expectations. The robustness of these results may have a simple explanation: a separation of time-scales of the processes involved. Selection and population demographic changes drive divergence of populations during isolation. Migration and recombination during population reconnection allows a rapid – relative to divergence – genome admixture. Both impact genome polymorphism, but the latter does so more drastically and at much shorter time-scales.
