<p>It is important to keep in mind that viral population isolation and reconnection events can occur at a much smaller time scale within hosts. There is increasing evidence suggesting that genetic compartmentalization of viral populations occurs in different organs, tissues, or cells, and might play a critical role for virus evolution and more importantly for its control. This has been demonstrated for HIV (
