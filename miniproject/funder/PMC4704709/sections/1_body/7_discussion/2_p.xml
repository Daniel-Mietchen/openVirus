<p>We apply our theory in order to analyze the genome signature of successive colonization of HIV-1 subtypes in Asia and South America. In both regions, we reconstruct the successive colonization of HIV-1 subtypes, and find that they are followed by strong HIV-1 subtype admixture. We find, in these regions, that HIV diversification is followed by a temporal homogenization of HIV-1 genome composition. Our analysis highlights a large degree of admixture between circulating HIV-1 subtype genomes in China and South America, and most probably worldwide. These results suggest that genomic exchanges may indeed be relatively strong, and that HIV-1 is currently in a process of homogenization subsequent to isolation and diversification. HIV genome homogenization may seem to contradict the idea that HIV is undergoing a diversification process (

 </xref>). Indeed, when isolated and diverged populations reconnect, a transient excess of genetic diversity is predicted in the resulting population (

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Alcala and Vuilleumier 2014</xref>) as all the genetic material that accumulated during the isolation phase is shared among populations. However, this excess of genetic diversity is transient and with time, the diversity decreases (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>). In HIV-1, such processes occur through multiple recombination events among subtypes through coinfection or superinfection and are the source of novel recombinant forms. In the long term, successive recombination events will ultimately lead to the homogenization of the genomic composition of HIV-1. Homogenization might be further enhanced by selective forces imposed by the immune response or treatment acting on the HIV genome (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>). As many world regions are currently being newly colonized by different HIV-1 subtypes, it is expected that new recombinants may still emerge and HIV diversity will further increase. However, as demonstrated here, this is expected to be a transient state toward global homogenization.
