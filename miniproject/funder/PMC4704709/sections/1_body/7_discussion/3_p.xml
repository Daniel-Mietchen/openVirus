<p>We find signatures of reconnection events among populations of HIV-1 subtypes that were previously isolated both in China and South America. The signatures on HIV-1 DNA polymorphism suggest reconnection events of three previously isolated HIV-1 populations in both regions. These results align with the known epidemiologic history of HIV-1 in the two regions (

As expected, they reflect first the HIV outbreak in China in 1989: colonization of B and C subtypes (variance of the first peak in the SFS is generated by B and C subtypes). The subsequent colonization of CRF01_AE at the origin of the HIV outbreak in the late 1990s is also signaled in the SFS (a high proportion of CRF01_AE in the highest mode). We obtained similar concordance for the origin of the sequences forming the peaks and the successive subtypesâ€™ colonization events in South America.
