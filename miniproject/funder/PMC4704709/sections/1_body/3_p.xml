<p>As in influenza, events of HIV isolation and reconnection are common and can be observed at different spatial and temporal scales. Indeed, tracing the origin of HIV has confirmed that cross-species transmission of SIVs from other primates to humans, acting as sources of HIV, occurred several times over the past 100 years (

 </xref>). The virus remained isolated for a very long period and adapted rapidly in humans, which ultimately rose to epidemic levels (

 <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Vuilleumier and Bonhoeffer 2015</xref>). Those reconnection events are the source of emergence of many new recombinant forms which constitute a major challenge for vaccine development and are at the origin of new epidemics (

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Feng 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>). The multiple colonization events of HIV-1 that occurred in Asia and in South America are representative of this trend (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Hamelaar 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). Indeed, with an estimated 4.8 million people living with HIV as of 2011, Asia is the second most HIV-affected region worldwide (
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Zhang 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>). Historical epidemics in Asia are associated with transmission events to various risk groups; HIV-1 subtypes B and C were first detected in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, respectively, in the Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) risk group (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Lu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2008
 </xref>), and then spread to other populations. Subtype CRF01_AE was first detected in the Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) risk group in the 1990s, then spread to other groups and became the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype in many parts of China. Similarly, the epidemic clade circulating in South America is derived from subtype B viruses that migrated out of Haiti around 1969 (1966–1972) and spread through the world (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Bello 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). Later, a single-founder subtype F1 strain, introduced in Brazil, spread and recombined with local subtype B viruses to form the HIV-1 BF1 and F1 epidemics (
