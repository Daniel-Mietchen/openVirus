<p>Thus, we show that distinctive signatures of past isolation and reconnection events can be identified in the SFS as well as in the joint SFS. Namely, the SFS has an excess of variants, the size and position of which are indicative of the number of previously isolated populations and of the timing since the reconnection event. The temporal dynamic of the joint SFS is informative as to the level of gene flow between populations.</p>
