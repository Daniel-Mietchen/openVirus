<p>The temporal patterns in the joint SFS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) are also strongly informative as to the occurrence of reconnection events and as to the amount of gene flow among populations since the reconnection event. When populations are isolated, each has its own segregating variants. This translates, in the joint SFS, into variants being restricted to the axes of the joint SFS [classes (20,
 <italic>i</italic>), (
 <italic>i</italic>,20), with 
 <italic>i</italic> ranging from 1 to 20 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>]. Then, following the reconnection event, gene flow distributes the variants among populations to the point that they occur at similar frequencies in each population and the genetic compositions of populations are fully homogenized. Consequently, in the joint SFS, several variants move progressively away from the axes toward the diagonal of the joint SFS, as expected in a structured population at equilibrium (last column 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).
