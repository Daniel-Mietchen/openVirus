<p>When a population is at mutation-drift equilibrium, the distribution of its alleles, or SFS, has a characteristic shape (dotted line 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When populations experience demographic changes, departures from this characteristic shape are expected and the size and the position of those changes are informative as to the demographic change. Consistent with the expectation, we found a large excess of variants at intermediate frequencies on the SFS following reconnection events between previously isolated populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This excess was due to exchanges of variants among populations that were once fixed in one or several populations during isolation. The size and the position of this excess is indicative of the number of populations that have reconnected and of the timing of the reconnection event (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and can be identified by the visual test of equilibrium neutrality proposed by 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Nawa and Tajima (2008</xref>). We predict that in the total SFS (SFS obtained with merged samples from all populations), shortly after a reconnection event one would expect narrow, high peaks of specific variants. These peaks are found at frequencies
