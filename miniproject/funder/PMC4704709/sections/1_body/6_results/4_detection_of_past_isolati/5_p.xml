<p>To provide insights on the generality and global importance of these results, we performed a PCA analysis of worldwide genomes from HIV-1 subtypes B, C, F1, and CRF01_AE (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with the observations for Chinese and South American samples, we observed that HIV-1 genomes are positioned on the straight edges of the triangle formed by original subtypes, positioned at the corners, forming a continuum along the axes rather than discrete clusters within. Very few genomes are localized outside the edges of the triangle defined by the 3 original subtypes. This pattern not only signals that most of the circulating HIV-1 genomes experience constant gene flow from other subtypes but also represents the current spatial distribution of HIV-1 populations. It reflects, for example, the extensive admixture between subtypes B and CRF01_AE in Brazil and China, between B and CRF01_AE in Thailand, and B and F1 in Brazil, Argentina, and Spain.
