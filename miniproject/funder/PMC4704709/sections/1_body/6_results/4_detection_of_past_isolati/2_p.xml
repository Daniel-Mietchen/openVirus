<p>Past isolation between HIV-1 subtypes in China and South America is signaled by the excess of variants, with peaks at intermediate frequencies in the total SFS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, A and B and G and H</xref>). These peaks reflect the presence of variants from the sampled population that diverged during isolation and were present at high frequencies in each previously isolated subtype population identified with cluster analysis (see 
 <italic>Results</italic>).
