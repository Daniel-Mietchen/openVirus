<p>Genome admixture in China and in South America is also visible when the sampled genomes are projected together in a PCA space defined by original subtypes 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, which originate from the beginning of the HIV epidemic in Africa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, E and F and K and L</xref>). Several HIV-1 genomes are present on the straight edges of the triangles defined by the ones at the origin. Temporal PCA patterns also suggest homogenization between subtypes B and C in China and between B and F1 in South America, as they move away from the pure subtypes in PCA space.
