<p>The reconnection of HIV-1 subtype populations in China and South America is indicated by the bimodality in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences between-populations (considering sequences of small length 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We found that a large proportion of the genome of HIV-1 displays bimodality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In China, this proportion was initially low but rapidly increased through time. Between 2006 and 2007, the proportion of bimodality increased fourfold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and increased a further 40% between 2008 and 2009. This suggests that the time series analyzed here captures a burst of HIV-1 subtype admixture. The dynamics of genomic admixture between HIV-1 subtypes in China is also highlighted by the temporal changes in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences and the SFS. The peaks formed by the excess variants (resulting from population admixture in the total SFS) decreased in size, and the values of optimal test statistics

We find a significant increase in the variance of the first mode in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences between 2005 and 2009 (

The joint SFSs for the two time points also indicate that the reconnection event and genome admixture is either recent or that genome admixture is limited but ongoing. Indeed, we can observe the excess of variants along the axes of the joint SFS shifting to the diagonal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, C and D</xref>). In South America, the proportion of bimodality in HIV-1 samples from 1999 is large (60%) and remains approximately constant from 1999 to 2004, signaling a prior reconnection event. Patterns observed in the joint SFS suggest that HIV-1 subtype genomes are well homogenized overall; further, this process of homogenization seems to have either slowed or ceased. Indeed, no increase of variance in the modes of the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences was detected (two-sided Bartlett test), and the total SFS shows only small changes between 2001 and 2005, with nonsignificant changes in values of optimal test statistics
