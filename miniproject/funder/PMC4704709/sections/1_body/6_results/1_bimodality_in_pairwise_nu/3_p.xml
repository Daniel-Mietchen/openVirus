<p>Thus, we show that distinctive signatures of past isolation and reconnection events can be identified on the distribution of the number of nucleotide differences between pairs of genomes sampled (within, between, or in the total population). We also determine the parameter ranges for which this signature can be detected (sample size, migration rate, and time since reconnection).</p>
