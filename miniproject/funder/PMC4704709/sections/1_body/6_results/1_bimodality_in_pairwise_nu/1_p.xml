<p>Two distinct signatures of population reconnection after isolation were found in the temporal distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences: bimodality and increased variance of the first mode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Bimodality was observed in these distributions (both within and between populations,

 </inline-formula>) only when a population reconnection occurred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This bimodality reflects the different possible origins of the two sequences sampled: the two sequences either have a recent common ancestor (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, after the reconnection event; first mode in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or an ancient common ancestor (before the isolation event; second mode in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bimodality was also observed in the distributions of total pairwise nucleotide difference (considering all populations, π) after a reconnection event but, in this case, bimodality was also observed when populations were completely isolated (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although testing for increase in variance requires data from different time-points, it has the advantage of not requiring

 <italic>i.e.</italic>, being within or between populations).
