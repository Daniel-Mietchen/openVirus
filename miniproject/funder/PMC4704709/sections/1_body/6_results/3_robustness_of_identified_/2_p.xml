<p>The observed signatures are robust even when a massive population expansion occurs concomitantly with the reconnection event (Figure G in

Such events modify the expected signature only by presenting an excess of low frequency variants compared to what is expected with populations of constant size (as expected from the results of Tajima (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Tajima 1989</xref>) in a single panmictic population). Replacing the classic Kingman coalescent model (Wright-Fisher model) with a beta-coalescent model does not alter our results for values of the model parameter α (Figure H in

Beta-coalescent models account for large variance in the number of offspring per individual, as expected under repeated bottlenecks, fast extinction-recolonization dynamics, or recurrent beneficial fixations (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Neher and Hallatschek 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Tellier and Lemaire 2014</xref>). Such variance leads to an excess of low frequency variants and smaller peaks in the total SFS compared to Kingman’s coalescent model; this effect is larger for small α values (light-gray lines Figure H in

However, having an excess of variants at low frequency does not alter the identified signature of reconnection on the total SFS (dynamics of the peaks). Also the temporal dynamics of the signature distinguish this pattern from that of an IM model. Indeed under the IM model, the size of the peaks in the SFS increases with time (Figure I.B in
