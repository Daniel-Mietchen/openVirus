<p>For the Chinese and South American data, we identified HIV-1 populations (subtype clusters) by Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) (

 </xref>). Our investigations considered dominant subtypes B, C, CRF01_AE and F1 and their associated recombinants. Each cluster encompassed a dominant subtype and some recombinant forms between subtypes. We found strong support for four groups using the Bayesian Information Criterion (ranging from 2 to 100 PCA axes) that are independent of sampling year (See Figure J in

We then computed the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences and the total and joint SFS for the major circulating HIV-1 subtypes in China and South America.
