<p>Using coalescent theory, we first present methods for detecting the signature of population reconnection after isolation on the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences. Then, in the second section, we use coalescent simulations to derive the signature of population reconnection after isolation on the SFS. The third section highlights the robustness of these signatures to alternative demographic scenarios. Finally, the fourth section presents a data application for these methods: inference of recent HIV-1 evolution in China and in South America.</p>
