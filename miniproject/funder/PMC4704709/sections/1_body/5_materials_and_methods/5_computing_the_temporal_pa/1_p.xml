<p>We computed the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences, and the total and joint SFS for the major circulating HIV-1 subtypes in China and South America. The distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences within (within-population pairwise differences) and between clusters (between-population pairwise differences) were generated for each nonrecombinant block between subtypes that we identified with

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>). In total, 19 and 24 blocks were identified in sequences sampled in China and South America, respectively; the 5%, median and 95% quantiles of block length were 111bp, 220bp and 1333bp, respectively. Detection of bimodality in the distribution, the signature of a past isolation event, was performed by fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm from

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>). Gaussian distributions are used to estimate positions of the mode as distributions are symmetric (the 5% and 95% quantiles of the skewness of all components are -1.05 and 1.05, respectively). The algorithm also provides posterior probabilities of membership into modes, which is used to identify genomes that have bimodal distribution (
