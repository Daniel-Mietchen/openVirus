<p>The total and joint SFS were computed using subtype J as an outgroup. Results were robust to the chosen outgroup (Figure K in

Note that the distinction between recombining and nonrecombining sequences does not apply for the SFS, as the expectation (and the maximum likelihood estimate) of the SFS is not affected by recombination: only its variance is affected (
