<p>The present study identifies specific temporal signatures of reconnection of diverged populations in two broadly used summaries of DNA polymorphism: the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences (via coalescent theory), and the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS, via simulation). We also describe how past isolation can influence commonly used SFS-based test statistics (Tajima’s

Then, using theoretical results and full genome polymorphism data, we reconstruct the successive invasions of HIV-1 subtypes in China and in South America and analyze the subsequent dynamics of genome composition. We find extensive admixture between HIV-1 subtypes, potentially leading in the long term to homogenization of HIV-1 genomes in these regions.
