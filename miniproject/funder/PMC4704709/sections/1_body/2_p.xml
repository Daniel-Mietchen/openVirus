<p>Past population isolation and subsequent reconnection or secondary contact are common in natural populations and can have a drastic impact on speciesâ€™ evolutionary histories. Anatomically, modern humans are thought to have admixed with Neanderthal populations after a period of isolation between the African and European continents (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>), where dependency on the host cell and other features of the life cycle isolate viral populations within hosts, groups of hosts, or host species in-between infections. For example, reassortment between avian and human influenza viruses caused the pandemic outbreaks in 1957 and 1968, and a reassortment of swine, avian and human influenza viruses was responsible for the 2009 pandemic (
