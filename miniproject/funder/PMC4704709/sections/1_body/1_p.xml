<p>Consequently, DNA sequence polymorphisms are increasingly used to infer past demographic events and have successfully reconstructed past histories of many organisms, including humans (

 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Slatkin and Hudson 1991</xref>) or for specific demographic scenarios (

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Wakeley 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Hey 2010</xref>). Recently developed approaches allow for the inference of a wide range of demographic parameters (

 </xref>). However, inferring reconnection of diverged populations after isolation remains difficult, as models of past isolation with recent contact are challenging to distinguish from models of ancient population separation with a continuous exchange of migrants. Also, parameter inference requires 
 <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of a population split (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Hey 2010</xref>), and the time at which migration event(s) occurred has thus far been difficult to estimate (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Strasburg and Rieseberg 2011</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Wakeley (2001)</xref> first proposed a method to infer time of divergence (IM model), the migration rate between the two populations, as well as the relative sizes of the populations. This approach was extended to account for the divergence of multiple populations (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Hey 2010</xref>) and temporal reduction of gene flow following an initial population split (
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson-Herbots 2012</xref>). Though others have discussed the expected signature of a reconnection event following a past isolation period (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Becquet and Przeworski 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Sousa and Hey 2013</xref>), detailed theoretical formalization is still lacking. Besides this, the use of the aforementioned methods for general inference is also challenging as they are difficult to apply when the number of sampled populations is large (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Foll 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>). Further, they often rely on a specific evolutionary model, such as the Wright-Fisher model (
