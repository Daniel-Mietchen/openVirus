<p>Regression analysis of root-to-tip distances for the ninety-four ORF4 sequences from Madagascar (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) indicated that the sampling dates were a significant predictor (
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.02). In Bayesian dating analyses, there was no overlap between the 95 per cent HPD intervals of the substitution rate estimated from the real sampling dates and those estimated after tip permutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Using clustered permutations (thirty-eight clusters), however, reduced the 
 <italic>P</italic>-value of the linear regression to 0.05. Moreover, the mean substitution rate estimated from the real sampling dates in Bayesian dating analyses fell within the range of values obtained after cluster permutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Hence, the temporal signal in the Madagascar dataset (ninety-four sequences) may not be sufficient to reliably estimate the substitution rate of RYMV in Madagascar.
