<p>The analyses of the potential impact of environmental factors on viral lineage dispersal velocity did not reveal any notable footprint (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Only the elevation raster tested as a conductance factor with the least-cost path model led to both a positive distribution of 
 <italic>Q</italic> values and an associated BF support &gt;3 (BF = 3.8). This means that under the least-cost path model, phylogenetic branch durations tend to be more correlated with environmental distances computed on the elevation raster (treated as a conductance raster) than with environmental distances computed on the null raster. However, while the 
 <italic>Q</italic> distribution is supported, the mean 
 <italic>Q</italic> value remains rather low. A low 
 <italic>Q</italic> value indicates that the tested environmental layer (here the elevation layer) does not better explain the heterogeneity in lineages dispersal velocity than a uniform layer (null raster) that only accounts for the impact of geographic distance. Indeed, using the elevation raster to compute environmental distances with the least-cost path model only increases the correlation with branch durations by âˆ¼2 per cent, relative to the null raster. Therefore, if high altitude was directly or indirectly associated with higher lineage dispersal velocity, it contributed only marginally to the observed heterogeneity in RYMV dispersal velocity.
