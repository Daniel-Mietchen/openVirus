<p>The reconstructed epidemic history based on the virus genetic data places the time to the most recent common ancestor (

 <sub>MRCA</sub> estimate derived from the Madagascar dataset alone (1981, 95%CI: 1975–86). The southwards dispersal occurred along the west and east sides of the country, with few virus exchanges across the high-altitude plateau between the east and west regions. In the high-altitude plateau, where the disease is sporadic, closely related isolates were found nearby the capital Antananarivo at the early (1991) and late stages (2014) of RYMV epidemics. This suggests localized low-level virus persistence in the high plateau rather than recurrent and transient introductions from the Lake Alaotra basin, 200 km north, through rice corridors connecting the two regions. Whereas the phylogeographic reconstructions do not infer an origin of the epidemic in the very north of the country, they infer a re-invasion of the northeast around 1995 and of the northernmost part of the country around 2005. The full extent of spread throughout the country was achieved within three decades. The estimated mean wavefront rate was 33 km/year (95% HPD: 24.6–41.3) which is close to that of 37 km per year we deduced from the field surveys.
