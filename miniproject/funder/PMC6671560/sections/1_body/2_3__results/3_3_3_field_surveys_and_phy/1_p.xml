<p>In the early 1970s, in the very north of Madagascar (Antsiranana, Ambanja, Ambilobe, Antsonihy), vernacular names (such as Menamiretaka) were given by farmers to rice plants showing RYMV-like symptoms (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez023-F4">Fig. 4</xref>). In the first half of the 1980s, disease symptoms were observed in the large rice plains in the northwest of the country (Betsiboka valley, Marovoay, Ambato-Boeny, Mampikony). It was later confirmed by serological tests that the symptoms resulted from RYMV infection (see Section 2). In 1990, RYMV was detected by biological and serological tests in symptom-carrying plants from this region. In the second half of the 1980s, symptoms were observed in the northeast of Madagascar (Vohemar, Sambava, Andapa) and in the central west (Miandrivazo). In 1989, the virus was detected in the Lake Alaotra basin, in the central east, the largest rice producing region of Madagascar (100,000 ha). In the first half of the 1990s, symptoms were observed with subsequent virus detection in the central west (Morondava, Maintirano, Melaky district), in the high plateau (Antananarivo), and along the east coast (Vavatenina plains, Toamasina, Mananjary). In the second half of the 1990s, the disease was observed further southeast (Tsivory). Since 2000, the disease has been observed further south, in the southwest (Tandava) and in the southeast (Manakara). RYMV in Madagascar is now present in regions with different climates and where rice is cultivated under different modes (see Section 2), except in the very south of the country (Tsiombe, Beloha, Ampanihy, Ejeda) where it is absent although surrounded by locations where the disease has been present for years. In the high-altitude plateau, the disease remained sporadic, observed near Antananarivo in 2014 only since its first report in 1991. Furthermore, the disease was not found in locations neighboring Antananarivo during surveys conducted the same year (
