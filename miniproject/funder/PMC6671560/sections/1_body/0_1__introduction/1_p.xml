<p>Less than a decade ago, a methodology for reconstructing the phylogeographic history of viruses on a continuous landscape in a Bayesian statistical framework was introduced (
 <xref rid="vez023-B38" ref-type="bibr">Lemey et al. 2010</xref>). It has increasingly been applied to animal viruses (

 <xref rid="vez023-B68" ref-type="bibr">Tian et al. 2018</xref>), and in some cases to human viruses (

 <xref rid="vez023-B55" ref-type="bibr">Pybus et al. 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez023-B16" ref-type="bibr">Dellicour et al. 2018a</xref>). In contrast, it has been rarely been applied to plant viruses (

 <xref rid="vez023-B13" ref-type="bibr">De Bruyn et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trovão et al. 2015b</xref>) although plant immobility may result in a regular virus spread, in particular for plant viruses with short-range vectors. Recently however, the spatiotemporal dispersal of 
 <italic>Rice yellow mottle virus</italic> (RYMV) in mainland Africa was inferred using the continuous diffusion model framework (
 <xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trovão et al. 2015b</xref>). The choice of the spatially continuous model for RYMV spread was motivated by the predominance of short-range transmission (
 <xref rid="vez023-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bakker 1974</xref>) and by the high degree of genetic isolation by distance (
 <xref rid="vez023-B2" ref-type="bibr">Abubakar et al. 2003</xref>). The spatiotemporal estimates indicated the emergence of RYMV at the end of the nineteenth century in Africa followed by an overall regular dispersal over more than a century across West Africa and across East Africa. A natural extension of studies conducted at the continental scale is to apply the spatially continuous model at a country scale (
 <xref rid="vez023-B39" ref-type="bibr">Levin 1992</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez023-B8" ref-type="bibr">Baudelle and Regnauld 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez023-B10" ref-type="bibr">Chave 2013</xref>). An island sufficiently large for the epidemics to develop and isolated enough to prevent recurrent introductions from blurring the dispersal patterns could provide an interesting model system of study (
 <xref rid="vez023-B12" ref-type="bibr">Cliff and Hagget 1995</xref>). For this reason, we focus on RYMV in Madagascar, a 600,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> large country isolated from mainland Africa by the Mozambique canal that is at least 400 km wide. Rice is the staple crop in Madagascar (
 <xref rid="vez023-B73" ref-type="bibr">Van Chi-Bonnardel 1973</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez023-B37" ref-type="bibr">Le Bourdiec 1977</xref>) and RYMV is the main disease of rice (
 <xref rid="vez023-B60" ref-type="bibr">Reckhaus and Andriamasintseheno 1997</xref>). Scrutinizing the historical spread of RYMV in Madagascar will also help to understand the epidemiology and contribute to control the disease.
