<p>The ORF4 sequence dataset of isolates from mainland Africa was assembled by retrieving the publicly available sequences from NCBI GenBank (28 December 2018). The dataset consists of 450 geo-referenced sequences (720 nt) collected between 1966 and 2017 in twenty-two countries from West Africa (eleven countries), Central Africa (six countries), and East Africa (five countries), that is from almost all rice-growing countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The sequences of the isolates from countries at the west of Central Africa (Cameroun, Central African Republic, Chad) were analyzed together with those from West Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra-Leone, Togo) and constitute the West-African dataset. The sequences of the isolates from countries at the east of Central Africa (east of the Republic Democratic of the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda) were analyzed with those from East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda) and make up the East African dataset. The West African and the East African datasets were analyzed separately because of the independent epidemiological dynamics in the two regions (

 <xref rid="vez023-B71" ref-type="bibr">Trovão et al. (2015</xref>b), the updated dataset of 450 sequences included 30 additional isolates from West Africa (210 vs. 180), referred to as the WA210 dataset, and twice as many isolates from East Africa (240 vs. 120) referred to as the EA240 dataset. In West Africa, the newly sequenced isolates belong to recorded strains. In contrast, the extension of the surveys in East Africa revealed new strains at the north of Ethiopia (
