<p>The full-length sequence alignment was screened for recombination signals using the RDP version 4.95 software (
 <xref rid="vez023-B43" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2015</xref>). The default settings were used for each of the seven recombination detection algorithms that RDP incorporates, as was a Bonferroni corrected 
 <italic>P</italic>-value cut-off of 0.001. Only recombination events detected by more than three of the seven methods implemented in RDP were considered. In addition, the genetic distance across the genome between the S4-Mg strain, the other S4 strains, and the S5 sister-strain, all originating from East Africa, were visualized by SIMPLOT (
