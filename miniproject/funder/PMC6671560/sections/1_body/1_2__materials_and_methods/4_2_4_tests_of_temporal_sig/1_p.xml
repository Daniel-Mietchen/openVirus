<p>A suite of tests was applied to assess the significance of the temporal signal in the sequence datasets (

 <xref rid="vez023-B59" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al. 2016</xref>) to regress phylogenetic root-to-tip distances against sampling date using the root that minimized the residual mean squares. The significance of the regression was assessed by random permutation of the sampling dates over the sequences (tip permutations), using the correlation coefficient as the test statistic. A total of 1,000 replicates of the data with the sampling dates randomly permuted were generated to obtain the expectation of the test statistic in the absence of temporal signal. The 
 <italic>P</italic>-value is the proportion of replicates with a test statistic greater than or equal to the test statistic obtained using the observed sampling dates. The significance of the temporal signal was also evaluated while accounting for the nonindependence of the data. To this end, the mean rate and its 95 per cent highest density probability (HPD) estimated with the observed sampled dates using BEAST v1.8.4 were compared to a null distribution obtained by randomly permutating the tip dates ten times (

The temporal signal analyses were also conducted when randomizing the sampling dates over clusters of taxa (cluster permutations) and not over individual taxa (tip permutations), with clusters defined as monophyletic clades for which all taxa were sampled in the same year (
