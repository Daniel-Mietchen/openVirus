<p>The S4-Mg strain is a combination of genetic fragments of lineages ancestral to the S4-Ug strains (CP, protease, VPg, and polymerase genes) and an ancestral S4-Et strain (P1 gene), assembled through consecutive recombination events. The S4-Ug and the S4-Et strains are found, respectively, at the East of the Lake Victoria basin and in the northwest of Ethiopia. In contrast, the S4-Mg strain is genetically quite distant from the strains S4-Lm, S5, S6, and S7 found along the Tanzanian coasts, and RYMV has not yet been observed in Mozambique (Séré and Ndikumana, pers. comm.). Taken together, this indicates that RYMV in Madagascar was not introduced from the closest continental coasts 400–1,000 km away. Rather, the available data suggest that RYMV virus in Madagascar originates from the very East of Africa. The long distance separating Madagascar from mainland Africa and in particular from the northwest of Ethiopia (&gt;1,000 km) points to a mode of transmission not involving the usual short-range beetle-driven dissemination. This long-range, likely unique, introduction, suggests a human-mediated mode of transmission (
