<p>We also acknowledge that the temporal and/or the spatial scales of the factors we tested may not be epidemiologically relevant. Concerning the temporal scale, RYMV spread may be dependent on temperature variation over brief periods that cannot be captured by testing annual mean temperature. Concerning the spatial scale, a high degree of variation in rice cultivation over small areas in Madagascar that may be epidemiologically more relevant to assess host connectivity will be averaged out at a regional scale. Such small-scale variation is apparent in a suite of detailed geographical maps (

Areas of 10 × 10 km are often rice-free, even in regions with an overall high density of rice cultivation. These 10 × 10 km wide gaps are likely to be major obstacles for RYMV with vectors associated to restricted mobility and an average lineage dispersal rate of around 15 km/year. Moreover, the layout of the rice surfaces is critical. In particular, rice is often cultivated continuously along rivers and around lakes, facilitating rice connectivity for virus propagation, even across regions of overall low rice density. Altogether, this indicates that host density, even when considered at a scale of a few hundred meters, is not necessarily a good predictor of RYMV dispersal. These challenges may explain the difficulty to assess the drivers of the epidemics of RYMV in mainland Africa (
