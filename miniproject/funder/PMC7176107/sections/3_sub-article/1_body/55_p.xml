<p>1. While I recognize that this is a particularly difficult population to work with, I am not certain why recruitment could not have been more purposive in that only injection drug users were recruited. Instead, it is misleading to state that 30 participants were recruited, and then go on to describe only the experiences of the 17 among them who were actually injecting for some parts of the manuscript and more general experiences of the other users in other parts of the manuscript. Infact this demarcation is not at all clear. It is also unclear if saturation of themes were achieved with these 17 interviews (among injecting PWID), which the authors themselves admit is a limitation. This is a major methodological flaw in the study. Instead the authors should aspire to conduct a more robust qualitative study, recruiting enough injecting (male and female) PWID to explore these areas in detail until saturation of themes is achieved. Respondent driven sampling (which the authors used partially) can be a powerful way to recruit participants. The experiences of male and female PWID also need to be more clearly delineated since there is enough data to suggest that HIV disproportionately affects female PWID. Barriers to receive harm reduction services also differ significantly between male and female PWID. Instead what appears in this manuscript is the experiences of male and female PWID inter-mingled such that the sexual risk behaviors among female PWID (who are also sex workers) is explored in detail, and yet little is known about the sexual risk behaviors of male PWID. The other alternative is to focus exclusively on female PWID (as has been done in other studies in other settings) as a separate manuscript.</p>
