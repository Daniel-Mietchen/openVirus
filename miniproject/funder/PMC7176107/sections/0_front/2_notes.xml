 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>Data included in this paper include excerpts from in-depth interviews with 30 illicit drug users from Kampala, Uganda. The data cannot be shared even upon request because our consent forms stated that data would not be shared with anyone outside the research team. The Institutional Review Boards at Makerere University School of Public Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin has thus restricted access to the data set. Further questions can be directed to Kathryn Gaudreau at the Medical College of Wisconsin IRB,
