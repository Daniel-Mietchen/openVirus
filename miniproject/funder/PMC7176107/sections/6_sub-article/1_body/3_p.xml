<p>In this revision, the authors have been more transparent about their rationale to recruit both people who inject drugs and people who use drugs; the study also clearly includes both genders which is certainly valuable. In their response to my concern that the small number of participants may not have facilitated achievement of saturation of themes, the author state the following: “We believe that we received saturation of themes for injectors and non-injectors, women and men”. I want to point out that this directly contradicts what they write in the limitations section of this manuscript: “The present study has several limitations including the small sample size characteristic of qualitative studies. Given that not all participants injected drugs, we may not have reached saturation of themes regarding drug injection risks”. Also, I should note that nowhere in their methodology have they stated that they actually continued recruitment till saturation of themes was achieved.</p>
