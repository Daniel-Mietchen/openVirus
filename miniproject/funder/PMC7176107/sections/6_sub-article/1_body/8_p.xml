<p>While the results section has been reorganized, I think this section can further be improved. Again, explanations for certain observations is not needed in this section. Please see below for suggestions on how to improve this section.. Throughout the manuscript, the term “availability” of harm reduction services is used. I think what the authors are actually assessing is whether PWID accessed harm reduction services. As they state in the introduction, there are few if any harm reduction services that are available. What is also true is that few PWID are actually accessing even the available services.</p>
