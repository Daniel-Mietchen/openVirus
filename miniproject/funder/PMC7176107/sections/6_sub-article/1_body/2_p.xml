<p>Thank you for your careful review of the paper which was found to be improved but still in need of some clarification, particularly with regards to whether we achieved data saturation. We agree with Reviewer 1â€™s comments and do not claim to have reached data saturation and changed the title and limitations accordingly. We have also included access as well as availability of harm reduction materials where appropriate and corrected typos and grammatical errors.</p>
