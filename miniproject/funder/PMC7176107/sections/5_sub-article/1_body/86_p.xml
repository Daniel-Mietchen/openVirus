<p>This manuscript presents a significant contribution to the literature around injection-related risk behaviors for HIV and other blood borne pathogens among PWID and PWUD in Uganda. As a formative study, this qualitative work paints a broad picture of the context of drug use among some PWID and PWUD in Uganda, and clearly delineates avenues that should be pursued in further work. The authors addressed all of my comments. I recommend that the manuscript be accepted.</p>
