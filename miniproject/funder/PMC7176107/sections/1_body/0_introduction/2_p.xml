<p>Despite the effectiveness of existing HIV prevention efforts for people who inject drugs, such efforts are inadequate or non-existent in many SSA countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0231969.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Uganda has recently piloted a syringe exchange program [
 <xref rid="pone.0231969.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and has pledged to devote more resources to prevent HIV among PWID including providing medication assisted therapy (MAT) such as buprenorphine to help drug users abstain from more harmful opioids like street heroin, or injection risks; the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund key population investment fund have pledged money and resources to begin MAT by this year in three centers in Kampala. Tanzania and Kenya recently opened methadone clinics in 2016 and 2018, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0231969.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These efforts are likely insufficient to combat HIV in PWID in East Africa and have been hampered by addictophobia on the part of providers, stigma of people living with HIV (PLH) and PWID and a lack of political will [

Most researchers argue that a combination of approaches are needed including provision of clean syringes through syringe exchange programs (SEPs), frequent HIV testing and linkage to HIV care, antiretroviral therapy initiation after infection to reduce risk of onward transmission through viral suppression, medication assisted therapy, psychosocial support and pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis [

 <xref rid="pone.0231969.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, modelling projections suggest that very high coverage of ART, SEPs, and MAT in combination are necessary to reduce HIV incidence of PWID by more than 50%; very high intensity and coverage of single interventions is necessary to achieve similar effects, otherwise single interventions are unlikely to be effective [
 <xref rid="pone.0231969.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Very few countries provide all these harm reduction services and services are often fragmented and rarely offered in one place. For example, many studies have shown that the integration of substance abuse treatment in HIV care can improve adherence to ART, but such programs are still rare [

 <xref rid="pone.0231969.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. At present, only HIV testing and linkage to care is consistently provided to drug users and only in Kampala through the Uganda Harm Reduction Network (UHRN) outreach to drug hotspots and peer navigation to government HIV clinics in which ART is provided free of charge. However, efforts are underway to increase harm reduction centers to the rest of the country that include MAT, syringe exchange and PrEP.
