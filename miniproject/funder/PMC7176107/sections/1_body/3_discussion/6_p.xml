<p>Additional services are needed to develop a combination prevention intervention that can effectively halt the spread of HIV and reduce other risks among PWID. First, efforts to increase rates of HIV testing among PWID are needed to link those with HIV into care. Few PWID in this study reported getting an HIV test more than once every few years, and some avoided testing altogether. Given the high rates of risk, and the prevalence of HIV rates among PWID estimated, HIV testing is a necessary first step to get PWID into HIV treatment and virally suppressed to prevent transmission to others. Social network HIV testing, in which PWID or other key populations are given monetary incentives to receive an HIV test and incentives for referring other members of their networks for an HIV test, has been very effective in increasing HIV testing among people who use crack cocaine in El Salvador and could increase testing rates in Uganda (Authors pub). Testing for Hepatitis C is needed to assess its prevalence among PWID and advocate for medications to treat it.</p>
