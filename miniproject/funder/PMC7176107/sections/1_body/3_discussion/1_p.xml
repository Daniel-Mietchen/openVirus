<p>Results from our study demonstrate several risky injection practices in Uganda that could increase HIV incidence if actions are not taken. These are very similar to those found in other parts of the world, and include sharing syringes, sharing mixing containers, reusing syringes multiple times, using dirty water or blood to mix drugs and engaging in sex work [

While all participants reported knowing about the risks of contracting HIV by sharing syringes and other injection paraphernalia such as cookers and water, and syringes are available for sale without a prescription in pharmacies, the price of syringes and PWIDs’ poverty made using a new syringe for each injection economically infeasible. According to a study conducted by Alliance Uganda and the UHRN [

Similarly, many PWID often had to pool resources to buy drugs, increasing the risk of sharing mixing water. These risks are common to all PWID in places without significant harm reduction efforts, such as syringe exchange programs, in locations were PWID can access them [
