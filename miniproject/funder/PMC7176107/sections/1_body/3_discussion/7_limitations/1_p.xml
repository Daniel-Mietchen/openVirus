<p>The present study has several limitations including the small sample size. Given that not all participants injected drugs, we may not have reached saturation of themes regarding drug injection risks. This study should be considered exploratory and its value lies in revealing the HIV risks of people who use injection and non-injection drugs in a setting that has only recently seen illicit drug use. However, the similarity of risks reported by participants within the study and in comparison to research conducted with people who inject drugs in other settings adds confidence to our results. In addition, experiences of people who used a variety of non-injection drugs may not have been adequately captured. The study was conducted in a number or drug hotspots in Kampala Uganda and may not represent the experiences of drug users in other parts of the country. However, because more harm reduction services are available in Kampala than elsewhere in the country, we felt that it was important to document gaps in these efforts in Kampala as they are likely to be greater in other parts of the country.</p>
