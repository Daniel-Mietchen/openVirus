<p>However, results from this study also reveal risks that may be unique to low- and middle-income countries, or to Uganda. First, the use of tap water to dilute drugs may increase the risk of abscesses, endocarditis, Hepatitis A and B and other infections even more than in developing countries because of the high levels of pathogenic viruses and bacteria in drinking water [

Further, most PWID in Uganda live in informal settlements, or slum areas, many of which may have poorly designed pit latrines or lack sanitation facilities at all. Second, many participants reported buying premeasured drugs in syringes from drug dealers and then returning the used syringes to these dealers. It is not known whether these syringes are new or have been sterilized, but the willingness of PWIDs to buy drugs and inject with dealersâ€™ syringes is also a sign of the scarcity of clean needles in Kampala.
