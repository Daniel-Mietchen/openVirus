<p>All taped interviews were transcribed, and text data was coded and analyzed for key themes and patterns of response using MAXQDA software. All authors participated in developing the code book. Authors 3, a US-based MA qualitative researcher, 5, a graduate student in Public Health from Uganda and 6, a US medical student coded data while author 3 checked coding for consistency and accuracy. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. Data analysis was primarily descriptive and included drug and sexual risks participants described, contextual reasons for these risks, and the availability and accessibility of harm reduction services to reduce risks. New themes that were iteratively discovered during analysis were added to the final coding tree. The coding tree is shown in
