<p>Interviews took place in a private location in the community, for example a private room in a community center or the project car. We informed participants that all the information they gave us was confidential. Interviews took about 1Â½ hours to complete and were tape-recorded, except for interviews with three participants when a tape recorder was not available. Detailed notes were taken of these interviews. Interviews were conducted by an outreach worker with experience in qualitative and quantitative research at the UHRN, and a graduate student who is a native Ugandan. Interviews were conducted in Luganda. All interviews were transcribed and translated into English by a bilingual translator.</p>
