<p>Interviews contained both a structured quantitative survey as well as open-ended qualitative questions. The quantitative portion included demographics: age, employment, income level, sources of income, and education level. We also assessed the quantity and frequency of use of various drugs. This brief demographic interview was followed by an open-ended ethnographic interview in which the following topics were explored among others: 1) drug use history; 2) subsistence strategies to support drug use; 3) where and how injection equipment is obtained, and a description of injection practices including how drugs are prepared or shared; 4) sexual experiences and HIV risk behaviors while using drugs; 5) experiences trying to quit or cut down on drugs including knowledge of places that offer drug treatment or people who have successfully quit; and 6) any experiences with harm reduction services such as SEPs and HIV testing.</p>
