<p>Eligibility requirements included being 18 or older, having used an illicit drug in the last 30 days, and being able to provide informed consent in English or Luganda. Drug use was kept open in order to explore the types of drugs most commonly used. We include both people who inject drugs (PWID, n = 17) and people who use drugs (PWUD) but do not inject (n = 14), because while injection with contaminated syringes is one of the most efficient ways to become infected with HIV, PWID and PWUD can be at risk for becoming infected through high-risk sexual behaviors. In addition, PWID and PWUD often are parts of the same drug using networks. We purposively oversampled to include more women than in the general drug using population.</p>
