<p>We conducted 30 in-depth interviews with people who used illicit drugs from drug-use hotspots in Kampala, Uganda. Interviews assessed the physical and social context in which drugs were consumed that increased or decreased injection- and drug-related sexual risk. Interviews also explored participantsâ€™ access to syringes, experiences with HIV prevention programs, HIV testing services, HIV treatment, and any substance abuse prevention or treatment services. This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Makerere University School of Public Health, and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology.</p>
