<p>We used a combination of standard outreach techniques and participant referral to identify and recruit eligible participants for in-depth interviews. Members of the Uganda Harm Reduction Network who served as Research Assistants to the project recruited directly from selling “hotspots” in Uganda. Screening questions verified that the potential participant used cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or methaqualone in the past 30 days. We also asked participants about their alcohol use and sexual activity to disguise eligibility criteria to avoid false reporting of eligibility. Participants under 18 years old were excluded from in-depth interviews due to potential risks involved in obtaining parental informed consent for minors to participate in interviews focusing on illicit drug use. Eligible participants, or participants who were ineligible but indicated that they had previously used drugs, were asked to refer someone they know who uses drugs to the study. Again, we asked seed participants to bring or send potential participants to field staff for screening, and staff never directly approached an individual who was identified by a participant. Luganda informed consent forms were read aloud to participants by research interviewers. After reading the consent form, potential participants were asked if they had any questions and were asked questions by the interviewer to test their understanding of the project and their decision to participate or not. Participants who agreed to participate were asked to sign the form or to make their mark if illiterate to signify their consent. The research interviewer witnessed consent and signed the consent form.</p>
