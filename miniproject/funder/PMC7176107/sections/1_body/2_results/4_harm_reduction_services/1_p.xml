<p>As mentioned, the UHRN piloted a syringe exchange program in the year we conducted this study. Approximately three participants reported receiving syringes from an active drug user who gave syringes to people he knew. This included one woman and two men.

   <p>Interviewer: You told me about the injectables, heroin and cocaine; could you tell me where you obtain the syringes you use to inject drugs?</p>

   <p>Participant 1: Am going to say but don’t take him away. For syringes, we have [UHRN peer recruiter] and he is always supplying us syringes so we don’t get sick. These days he is not bringing the syringes and I don’t know why. That’s why these days I don’t inject and am missing. All I beg from the government is to help us because not all those who smoke, inject and sniff drugs are dangerous. We do it because of problems like having no money, standards of living, stress; joblessness leads us to that other than taking us to prisons. …… It’s bad to take drugs but we are addicted. The government should help the addicts such that the syringes are supplied. We need more syringes and we are dying seriously. (20-year-old woman)</p>
