<p>This participant obtained syringes from the UHRN to pass for free to his drug using peers. As mentioned, he took this role very seriously and avoided using drugs in front of his peers for fear they would not listen to his harm reduction advice, and because he was trying to cut down on his drug use. The fact that only three participants reported that they received syringes from an outreach worker suggests the need to expand the program. Unfortunately, the pilot lasted only a year and funding for it had just ended by the time the interviews for this project were conducted.</p>
