   <p>Participant 25: Yes, I always exchange sex for money and the drug. Sex work has been my source of earning for many years and I have always been paid depending on the time spend with the client and the nature of sex to play [i.e. protected or not protected using a condom]. Meanwhile, the addiction to drugs means you cannot do without a drug. There are sometimes when I do not have required money to possess a drug or when I am with my friends to give me a shot. In this condition, I have asked for a drug from known drug dealers and paid in kind. Most times in a bar, when a guy buys me alcohol they expect sex in return. (27-year-old female)</p>
