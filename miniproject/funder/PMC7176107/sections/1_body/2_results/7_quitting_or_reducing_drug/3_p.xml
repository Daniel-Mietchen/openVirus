<p>Some participants mentioned prison as being a place where some temporarily abstained from drugs but claimed that most started their substance use as soon as they were released. Others mentioned the Butabika psychiatric hospital as the only place they knew of that people who use drugs were taken to recover from substance use. Without exception, participants reported that people taken to Butabika were mistreated and left in worse condition than when they entered.

   <p>Participant 1: You know, I fear being taken to rehabilitation…. One day my dad took me to Butabika, but life was hard. They injected me, and I would sleep the whole day. It’s bad. When I came back, I said am not going back to my dad to take me to Butabika. In Butabika we eat posho [food made from sorghum or millet flour with the consistency of dough]. Some patients have saliva coming out of their mouths. You can get mad [crazy] from there. We need a better place (20-year-old woman)</p>
