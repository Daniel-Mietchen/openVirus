<p>In this situation of scarcity, even people who knew the risks of sharing and took precautions to protect themselves reported that they would share their used syringes with other users. This was sometimes done voluntarily to help others avoid withdrawal while at other times, people reported searching for discarded syringes when they did not have one.

   <p>Participant 1: Syringes sometimes get lost and some use them in a group. Some syringes are shared in a group of two to three people. But that is harmful, dangerous because of transmission of HIV/AIDS. That’s why when I don’t have my own, I don’t use. Others use and give others to use. You know am educated at least but others share the syringe. When I don’t have the syringe, I don’t use the injection. When I use a syringe and throw it away, they search for it and sometimes we fight for it.</p>

   <p>Participant 1: They ask me, and I give them, but I don’t use it again. So, we need more syringes to reduce on the rate of HIV infection. (20-year-old woman)</p>
