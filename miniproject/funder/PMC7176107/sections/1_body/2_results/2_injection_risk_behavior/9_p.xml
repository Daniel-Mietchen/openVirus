   <p>Participant 1: Where we get water from where we buy the drugs. They boil the water and put it in a tin. If you are nice to them they give you and we buy drip water (saline water) that is used for drips and not mixed with any other drugs. So, when we buy, and they measure and mix for us—we inject. That’s why these drugs are expensive. If you can’t afford the saline water, you use the local one. (20-year-old woman)</p>
