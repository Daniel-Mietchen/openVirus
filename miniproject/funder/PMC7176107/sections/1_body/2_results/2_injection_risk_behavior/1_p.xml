<p>Participants reported buying syringes from pharmacies, sharing them from friends or obtaining them from drug dealers. Only three reported obtaining syringes from a syringe exchange (see below). Nearly all participants who injected drugs reported sharing injection equipment. While syringes are legally available for sale in Uganda, most participants who injected reported that they were too expensive to buy for a single use, or even for a single person. As a result, people who injected drugs often shared with each other, like the man below who reported injecting cocaine daily.

   <p>Participant 4: You see, the way those syringes are expensive, you have to share even needles as well as alcohol. We have to share, today itâ€™s me and tomorrow it might be him without any money on him. (23-year-old man)</p>
