<p>Thank you for your careful review of our manuscript “Injection and sexual risk among people who use or inject drugs in Kampala, Uganda: A qualitative analysis.” The reviewers thought there was merit in the paper, but suggested a number of revisions which we outline below. Unfortunately, I did not read that we should submit a copy with track changes and one without, so I have highlighted the parts that were changed in the revised manuscript “with tracked changes.” We also address editor comments regarding format, data accessibility and making supplementary material such as interview guides available.</p>
