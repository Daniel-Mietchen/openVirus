<p>“The quotes in the results section are interspersed with paragraphs such as data on clean water in Uganda. Firstly, for each theme that is explored, representative quotes can either be provided in text, or additional quotes can be provided in table format (or in an appendix). Secondly, the addition of explanatory data is distracting, and should only be reserved for the discussion section if relevant. The results section should be solely limited to the exploration of themes and presentation of quotes.” This was also a comment made by Reviewer 2. We have taken out all references to previously published research and implications of results to the Discussion section.</p>
