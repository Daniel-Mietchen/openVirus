<p>“The qualitative methodology needs to be explained in greater detail. Representative questions are presented (and can perhaps be organized under broad headings in a table); however not all questions are sufficiently dealt with in the results. For example, the authors state that they explored transitions to drug use and why injecting did or did not occur but do not describe this in the results.” We have taken out descriptions of questions which were not analyzed or presented in this paper. The entire interview guide is included in supplementary materials.</p>
