<p>“At the very beginning, in the introduction, a pre-amble can be provided on the following: i) size estimates of PWID in Uganda (at least what is known), ii) existence of syringe exchange programs and opioid agonist therapy services, iii) targeted intervention programs for PWID, iv) voluntary testing and counseling centers, iii) government ART centers. While this data is offered in the manuscript, it is interspersed in the results and discussion. Whereas describing this information at the beginning provides clarity and helps the reader recognize what is available. Subsequent themes on barriers to receive services (including paucity of services) or other factors can then be appreciated in this context. The authors note that a "package of interventions" is recommended for PWID -- indeed, this is also the WHO's recommendation for key populations (given the challenges in reaching and linking such hard to reach populations). Presenting what is available in Uganda, and noting that as is the case in many countries, service delivery to key populations often tends to be fragmented (even if services are available) will offer context as well.” The first paragraph of the paper included the size of the PWID population in Uganda, existence of syringe exchange programs and MAT, and targeted intervention programs for PWID. We have included information on government ART centers and HIV testing through UHRN. We have also described the developmental phase of these programs, and the lack of coordinated services in most LMICs.</p>
