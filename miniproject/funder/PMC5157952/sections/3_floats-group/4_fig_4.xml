  <title>Relative performance of conventional and universal vaccines, under different levels of vaccination coverage.</title>
  <p>Shaded areas represent the range of outcomes arising from the parameter ranges shown in 
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>: lower and upper boundaries depict the 2.5
   <sup>th</sup> and 97.5
   <sup>th</sup> percentiles of simulated outcomes, respectively. In each panel. where ratios are greater than 1, conventional vaccines have greater efficiency than universal vaccines, and vice versa. (A) Relative performance in controlling seasonal epidemics, defined as the ratio of seasonal epidemic sizes under a given coverage of vaccination, comparing conventional and universal vaccines (i.e. upper and lower curves in
