  <title>Overview of the two major model components.</title>
  <p>(A) The epidemic component, a deterministic, compartmental model capturing a single influenza season. Boxes represent proportions of the population in different states, where ‘CP’ denotes cross-protective immunity. Here we assume conservatively that the role of cross-protective immunity is to reduce infectiousness without necessarily reducing susceptibility: as a result in the force-of-infection term 
   <italic>λ</italic>, there is a coefficient 
   <italic>c</italic> &lt; 1 to represent diminished infectiousness amongst 
   <italic>I</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>(CP)</italic>
   </sup>. (B) The ‘interepidemic’ component, which governs the generation and selection of new strains. Given a reference, immunizing strain at 
   <italic>d</italic> = 0, we assume that candidate viruses at increasing antigenic distance (horizontal 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis) show increasing immune escape (blue curve). However, these candidates are also assumed to be less frequent during the interepidemic period (red curve). The selected virus is assumed simply to be that which maximises the trade-off between these factors (yellow curve). In the full model, this is calculated with respect to the different strains that individuals in the population have last been infected with, as described in the main text and in the appendix.
