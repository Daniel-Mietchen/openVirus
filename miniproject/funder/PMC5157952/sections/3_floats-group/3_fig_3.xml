  <title>Comparative vaccine effects under illustrative parameters.</title>
  <p>The Figure compares universal vaccines (orange) against conventional (blue), under different levels of coverage in the population. (A) The proportion of the population being infected by seasonal influenza, each year (B) The ‘pace’ of antigenic change, measured by the mean antigenic distance between successive seasons. (C) The size of a pandemic following several years of seasonal vaccination. In all Figures, cross-protective immunity is assumed to have a half-life of 3 years, and both HA-specific and universal vaccination occur annually. See
