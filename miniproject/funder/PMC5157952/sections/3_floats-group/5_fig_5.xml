  <title>Sensitivity analysis of relative efficiency in controlling seasonal epidemics.</title>
  <p>Relates to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, and assuming 15% coverage. The quantity 
   <italic>r</italic> is the relative seasonal epidemic size under 15% coverage of a universal vaccine, relative to that under the same coverage of a conventional vaccine. Points with 
   <italic>r</italic> &gt; 1 (shown in red) universal vaccines are less efficient than conventional vaccines, and vice versa. Each panel shows results over 10,000 simulations spanning the parameter ranges in 
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (third column), as a scatter plot with respect to each of the parameters in the model. Note here that each point has the same height in each panel; they are simply arranged in different ways along the horizontal axis, depending on their relationship to the model parameter denoted on that axis. The median and 95% intervals for 
   <italic>r</italic> are 0.38 (0.03–0.92). Parameters are as follows: 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>0</italic>
   </sub>, basic reproduction number; 
   <italic>c</italic>, effect of cross-protective immunity in reducing transmission potential; 
   <italic>k</italic>, abundance of immune escape variants, relative to immune escape potential; 
   <italic>h</italic>, half-life of cross-protective immunity; 1/
   <italic>μ</italic>, mean host lifetime.
