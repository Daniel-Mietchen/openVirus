 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005204.e003">eq (2)</xref> is in the simple case of a population with exposure to only one virus, over several seasons there is a series of viruses that emerge and circulate. Moreover, conventional vaccination in any given season offers protection against the virus circulating in that season, but also—to an extent diminishing with antigenic distance—against related viruses. It is thus necessary to keep track of the exposures to these viruses in the population, and to evaluate the proportion susceptible over all of these histories. Nonetheless, as we assume a one-dimensional antigenic space, it is only necessary to record the most recent infection or vaccination that individuals have undergone. Details of the necessary record-keeping are provided in the appendix.
