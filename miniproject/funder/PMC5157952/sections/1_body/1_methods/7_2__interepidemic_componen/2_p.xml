<p>For antigenic drift we adopt a simple deterministic framework to capture the essential role of population immunity, in driving selection for new variants (see, for example, ref [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] for a review of evidence supporting this assumption). We assume a one-dimensional axis of HA antigenic variation, a simplified representation of the distinctive ladder-like phylogeny of influenza A hemagglutinin [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows the simple case of a single immunizing strain (a ‘reference’ strain). We denote 
 <italic>d</italic> as the antigenic ‘distance’ between this and a candidate virus, shown on the horizontal axis. The Figure captures two essential features of antigenic evolution: first, candidates with greater 
 <italic>d</italic> have a greater degree of immune escape and therefore a higher transmission potential [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (blue curve). However, they arise at a lower frequency (red curve). Combining these two opposing factors to yield the ‘frequency-weighted immune escape’ (orange curve), we assume that—on a population level—the selected virus for an upcoming season is one that maximizes this quantity. Specifically, the frequency-weighted immune escape for this candidate virus is defined as:

 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>k</italic> is a parameter governing the relative rarity of immune escape variants. For example, in the theoretical case 
 <italic>k</italic> = 0 there is unlimited viral diversity in the interepidemic period, thus allowing a pandemic-scale outbreak every year. At the other extreme as 
 <italic>k</italic> → ∞, there is no generation of escape variants even in the face of population immunity: a situation similar to measles. For influenza, the scenario is intermediate. We calibrate the value of 
 <italic>k</italic> in order to yield, at steady state, seasonal epidemics that infect roughly 10% of the population per season, consistent with the behaviour of seasonal influenza [
