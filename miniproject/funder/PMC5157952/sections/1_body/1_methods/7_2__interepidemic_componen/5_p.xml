 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the default parameter values used, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g002">Fig 2</xref> schematically summarises the procedure. Starting with a virus in a fully susceptible population, we simulate its spread using (1) (‘initiation’ in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We then simulate the selection for a new immune escape variant using (2). Having determined this variant, we find the associated initial conditions (population susceptibility) for the subsequent epidemic season, and repeat the iteration from (1) to (2) (‘Circulation’ in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Finally, to study how a pandemic would be affected by the conditions of immunity in this population, at year 25 we introduce a virus to which only pre-existing cross-protective immunity, and not HA-immunity, is effective (‘Pandemic’ in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g002">Fig 2</xref>).
