<p>For the waning of T-cell immunity, we assume simply that a proportion 
 <italic>σ</italic> of individuals lose this immunity in every interepidemic period. For illustration we choose 
 <italic>σ</italic> = 0.21, consistent with findings from early seminal work that suggested a T-cell half-life of 3 years [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, it is important to note that there is considerable uncertainty around this Figure, with more recent studies suggesting that CD8 T-cell immunity can last as long as a decade, both for influenza ([
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) and for other viruses ([
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). Accordingly, we explore this uncertainty in the work below.
