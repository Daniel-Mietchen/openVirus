<p>For comparability between the two types of vaccine being considered here, it is necessary to choose values for the quality of vaccine protection (vaccine ‘efficacy’) that are matched in terms of their population effect. We assume for simplicity that universal vaccination elicits the same cross-protective immunity as does natural infection, thus identifying 
 <italic>c</italic> with the efficacy of universal vaccination. Correspondingly for conventional vaccines, we assume that efficacy derives from a proportion 
 <italic>c</italic> of vaccinated individuals successfully acquiring strain-specific immunity (the rest remaining with their prior immune status). It is straightforward to show (see appendix) that both vaccines thus have the same effect on
