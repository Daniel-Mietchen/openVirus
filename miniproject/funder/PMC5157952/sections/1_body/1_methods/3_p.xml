<p>In this context, we concentrate on the potential, future impact of mass vaccination programmes. We distinguish two types of immunity in the model: ‘strain-specific’ immunity is long-lasting and blocks infection against a given (immunizing) HA strain, and offers some protection against related strains, diminishing with antigenic distance from the immunizing strain. ‘Cross-protective’ immunity—consistent with T-cells—wanes over time [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] but acts uniformly against all HA strains: conservatively, we assume that this type of immunity does not reduce susceptibility, but instead lowers infectiousness in the event of infection.
