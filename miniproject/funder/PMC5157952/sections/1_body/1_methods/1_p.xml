<p>To motivate the model, we first give a brief overview of influenza vaccines. At present one of the most widely used influenza vaccines is the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Consisting only of non-replicating viral material, this formulation raises antibodies against HA and NA, but no T-cell immunity. Another formulation is the live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), using cold-adapted influenza viruses to target specific strains of HA and NA [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Although such vaccines raise T-cell immunity through viral replication, a recent study suggests that they offer only modest efficacy against antigenically drifted strains [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and reduced heterosubtypic immunity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], comparable to that of TIV. Nonetheless, cross-protection could be enhanced through adjuvants or T-cell boosting [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
