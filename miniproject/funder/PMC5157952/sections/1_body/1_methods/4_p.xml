<p>We assume that natural infection raises both types of immunity: further, we assume that ‘conventional’ vaccines (TIV and LAIV) raise only effective strain-specific immunity, and that ‘universal’ vaccines (concentrating here on T-cell vaccine candidates) raise only effective T-cell immunity. In the current work, this dichotomous choice of vaccine effect helps to contrast the corresponding population-level effects that arise. In practice, however, a ‘cocktail’ vaccine formulation could combine both types of vaccine effect: although beyond the scope of this paper, we discuss potential implications of this type of vaccine below. For a summary of the immune transitions in the host population, see Fig A in
