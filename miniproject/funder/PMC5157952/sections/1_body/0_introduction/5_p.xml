<p>Previous work [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] focused on the emergence of a pandemic virus, finding that the ability of cross-protective vaccines to mitigate pandemic risk depended on the ability of any vaccine (whether current or future) to provide broader protection than that provided by natural infection. Another modeling study [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] showed how cross-protective vaccines could slow the rate of antigenic evolution for seasonal viruses, thus enhancing the control of seasonal epidemics with conventional (HA-specific) vaccines. However, neither model addressed the potential effect of conventional vaccines on seasonal viral evolution, and how this might compare with universal vaccines. The present model builds on this previous work, addressing the questions above with a simple, novel model of influenza transmission and evolution. The model evaluates the relative merits of ‘conventional’ versus ‘universal’ vaccination, while casting light on vaccine characteristics that would be helpful to quantify, in anticipation of novel vaccine candidates entering advanced clinical trials.
