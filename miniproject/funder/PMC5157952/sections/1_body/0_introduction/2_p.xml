<p>There is evidence to suggest that other viral components, including the matrix protein M1 and the nucleoprotein NP, may be more conserved than HA and NA [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Immunity to these proteins, mediated by T-cells rather than by antibodies, is associated with broad-spectrum protection[

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At the same time, it is also possible for antibodies to raise broad-spectrum protection: with most of HA variability concentrated in the ‘head’ region of the protein, antibodies against the more conserved (but less accessible) ‘stem’ region have also attracted considerable attention[
