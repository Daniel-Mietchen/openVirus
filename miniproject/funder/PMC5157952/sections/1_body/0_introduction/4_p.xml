<p>Together, such developments raise important questions about the potential future use and impact of influenza vaccines. For example, how might novel vaccines compare against current, strain-matched vaccines, in their ability to control transmission? What are the implications for seasonal HA evolution, of a mass immunisation programme targeting HA versus one targeting other more conserved viral components? As these vaccines are still in development, important vaccine parameters, including classical vaccine efficacy, and duration of protection in humans, remain to be determined [
