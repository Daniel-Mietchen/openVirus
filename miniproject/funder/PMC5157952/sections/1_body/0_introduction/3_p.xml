The resulting emergence of candidates for ‘universal’ vaccines raises the potential for more stable influenza vaccination programmes, that do not have to be updated so frequently. At the same time, even with current, strain-matched vaccines, population coverage is on an increasing trend: in some settings (notably in the UK) there is growing emphasis on widened vaccination coverage to reduce transmission as well as disease [
