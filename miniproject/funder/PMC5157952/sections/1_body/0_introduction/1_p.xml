<p>Seasonal and pandemic influenza pose major public health challenges [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Vaccines against seasonal influenza aim to raise antibodies against the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface proteins of circulating strains [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While these targets offer the best correlates for immune protection, they are also by far the most variable amongst influenza viral components [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], undergoing continual evolution for immune escape: current seasonal influenza vaccines therefore need to be updated regularly. Moreover, influenza pandemics are caused by the emergence of a virus with an altogether new HA (and other viral components), to which there is little or no immunity in the human population [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Current vaccines cannot be deployed in advance of an influenza pandemic, as it is not possible to predict what virus will cause the next pandemic [
