<p>In control of seasonal influenza, universal vaccines could also avert more transmission per dose administered than conventional vaccines, with the potential to interrupt transmission even at moderate levels of coverage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This amplified effect likely arises from the fact that universal vaccination reduces strain-matched immunity in the population while increasing cross-protective immunity and slowing antigenic drift, while conventional HA-specific vaccines do the converse. Overall, therefore, universal vaccination could complement population immunity in a way that is more efficient for controlling transmission, over several seasons, than strain-matched vaccines. Furthermore, while the effects of HA-specific vaccination are limited by antigenic evolution, the effects of universal vaccination are limited by the duration of cross-protective immunity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As long as this duration is long enough to persist across vaccination intervals, the effect of cross-protective vaccination can be maintained on a population level with each passing season.
