<p>Conventional vaccines provide HA-specific immunity against seasonally circulating strains at the expense of infection-acquired immunity that may otherwise protect against novel antigenic subtypes [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, increased HA-specific vaccination coverage could result in increased pandemic sizes. Indeed, these model findings are consistent with experimental findings in animal challenge studies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. By contrast, a universal vaccine, even if transmission-blocking rather than infection-blocking, could reduce pandemic sizes by promoting cross-protective immunity in the population. Similar phenomena have been suggested by Zhang et al via different mechanisms, by which cross-protective immunity limits the opportunities for reassortment, thus limiting the emergence of pandemic-capable viruses ([
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Taken together, these findings suggest that universal vaccines could be effective in both preventing and mitigating pandemic emergence.
