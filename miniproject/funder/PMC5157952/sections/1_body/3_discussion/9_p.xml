<p>Several important caveats about immunity also bear mention: first, in the absence of relevant data, we have assumed that vaccine-induced immunity has an efficacy equivalent to its counterpart in natural immunity. Further work could explore the implications of relaxing this assumption. It might be expected that model results would depend to a large extent on whether vaccine-induced immunity would be more or less effective (or long-lasting) than its counterpart in natural immunity. (It is notable, for example, that recombinant technology raises the prospect of focusing immunity on particular antigens to a greater extent than is possible through natural immunity [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]). Second, for simplicity we have neglected the potential for complex interactions such as between antibody-mediated and T-cell mediated immunity, and the potential effect of an individual’s infection history on their vaccine response [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These complexities are only starting to be explored for influenza, and in future a better understanding of these immunological interactions will allow refined models to explore their implications. Third, we have assumed that universal vaccination does not protect against infection (i.e. no reduction in susceptibility). This being a conservative assumption, we might expect our overall findings to be accentuated by allowing for such additional protection. Conversely, we have assumed that current, strain-matched vaccines elicit no cross-protective immunity. Although this is a helpful caricature for contrasting two different modes of vaccination, conventional vaccines may also elicit some heterosubtypic immunity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In practice, any such protection is unfortunately too weak for current vaccines to protect against novel pandemic strains [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], a major rationale for universal vaccines [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]–nonetheless, any broad protection from current vaccines would tend to narrow the gap between conventional and universal vaccines illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Such caveats notwithstanding, our overall findings are likely to hold true: a vaccine formulation enhancing cross-protective over strain-specific immunity would have qualitatively different population implications from one that does the converse. Overall, a key data need in future is a quantitative comparison of the duration and potency of cross-protection raised by current vaccines, against that offered by emerging vaccine candidates.
