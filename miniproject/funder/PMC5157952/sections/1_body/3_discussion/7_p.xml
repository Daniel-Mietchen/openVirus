<p>The present model has several limitations to note. First, it involves a stylized model of influenza evolution: in practice, the antigenic dynamics of influenza arise from a combination of complex processes, spanning the chance emergence of an immune escape variant in an infected host; the transmission of that mutant to other hosts; and its successful establishment in the global population, all in competition with other potential escape variants ([

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]). Each of these stages is stochastic, giving rise to notable irregularities in influenza evolution such as antigenic ‘jumps’ shown by influenza A, every 3–9 years, with important consequences for vaccine selection [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] Nonetheless, the aim of the present work is not to explain such spatiotemporal variation, but rather to capture the essential, long-term interplay between population immunity and viral evolution. Consequently our current findings for universal vaccines (particularly, that they could slow antigenic evolution) are consistent with previous work, which employed a more complex, stochastic framework [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]: we would expect our current findings for conventional vaccines to be similarly qualitatively robust to stochasticity in viral evolution.
