<p>A primary result from this work is the contrasting evolutionary effects associated with the two types of vaccines. In general, sustained control of transmission reduces the number of immune individuals in the population, and thus dampens selection pressure for new antigenic variants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3B</xref>): universal vaccines, because they are not HA-specific, are able to achieve this state without themselves contributing to HA selection pressure. Thus the pace of antigenic evolution decreases with higher universal vaccine coverage. However, conventional vaccines raise strain-matched immunity: they therefore have the opposite effect to universal vaccines, compounding HA selection pressure and thus tending to accelerate antigenic evolution.
