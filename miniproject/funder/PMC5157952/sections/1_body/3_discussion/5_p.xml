<p>While influenza is a readily evolving pathogen, it is evidently not so rapidly evolving as to cause pandemic-scale epidemics every season. Here, we capture this phenomenon by assuming that viral evolution is limited by the available HA diversity in the population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). As for the conserved antigens targeted by universal vaccines, we have ignored the potential for immune escape, assuming in this work that any antigenic change would be too functionally costly for the virus to continue replicating. Nonetheless, the potential for such immune escape cannot be discounted: should it occur it would have far reaching consequences, comparable to pandemic emergence. Additionally, even if conventional vaccines should have negative implications for pandemic control, for their sterilizing immunity they would remain essential in routine immunization to protect specific risk groups such as the immunocompromised and the elderly.
