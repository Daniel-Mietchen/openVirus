<p>Second, the model does not take into account heterogeneities such as age structure [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]), and the elderly being less important for transmission, the effect of a given population coverage of vaccination will depend critically on how it is distributed amongst age groups ([
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]). Neglecting such effects, our model may overestimate the impact of a given vaccination coverage, for example, suggesting such low seasonal epidemic sizes at current levels of coverage in the US (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). If this bias applies equally for universal as well as for conventional vaccines, it may not be expected to influence our overall results about their relative efficiencies. Moreover, an important area for future work would be the potential impact of age-targeted vaccination programmes for emerging, transmission-controlling vaccines.
