<p>Overall then, rather than replacing one vaccination programme with another, it is important to consider universal vaccines as being strategically complementary to conventional, strain-matched vaccines. With recent work highlighting the potential effects of influenza vaccination programs in controlling transmission [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], our work suggests that—depending on the characteristics of new vaccines including duration of protection and vaccination frequency—the ‘transmission dampening’ role could be one best filled by universal vaccines. An alternative could be a ‘cocktail’ formulation consisting of a combination of strain-specific and vectored, cross-protective immunogens. Such cocktails could continue to protect clinical risk groups such as the elderly, as well as maintaining cross-protective immunity in the population to mitigate pandemic risk. However, their effect on seasonal influenza evolution would depend on the relative strengths of strain-specific and cross-protective protection that they provide: future work could explore the extent to which the cross-protective component of a cocktail vaccine could mitigate the potential ‘evolution-speeding’ effects of its strain-specific component.
