 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3C</xref> additionally illustrates differences between the vaccines, for the size of a pandemic following several years of seasonal vaccination. The Figure illustrates that, while both types of vaccines can reduce seasonal epidemic sizes, high vaccination coverage with conventional vaccines tends to allow for increased pandemic sizes, whereas universal vaccines have the opposite effect. Moreover, pandemic sizes decline more rapidly with increasing universal vaccination coverage when there is no antigenic evolution (i.e. an increased gradient in pandemic sizes for vaccine coverage &gt; 25%). This effect arises because interrupting transmission renders vaccination the sole source of cross-protective immunity in the population. The incremental impact of increased vaccination coverage is thus greater than in regimes allowing transmission, where infection is an additional source of cross-protective immunity.
