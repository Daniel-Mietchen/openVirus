<p>First, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3A</xref> illustrates how conventional and universal vaccines could have differing effects on long-term patterns of influenza transmission. While both vaccines reduce seasonal epidemic sizes, at any given level of coverage, universal vaccines appear to have a stronger effect in suppressing seasonal epidemics. Moreover, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3B</xref> illustrates—consistently with previous work—that large-scale universal vaccination would slow antigenic evolution over several seasons. Notably, however, these results suggest that conventional vaccines would tend to do the opposite, potentially accelerating antigenic change. We discuss below how these effects might arise from the different types of vaccine action.
