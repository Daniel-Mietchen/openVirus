<p>To identify which parameters are driving this result, taking a vaccination coverage of 15%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows scatter plots of the relative efficiency r with respect to each of the parameters in the model. Points of interest (
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 1) are shown in red, and are roughly evenly distributed for each of the parameters, with the notable exception of 
 <italic>h</italic> (fourth panel), where values of 
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 1 clearly cluster around a low duration of protection. Motivated by this Figure, holding 
 <italic>h</italic> constant at its default value, and re-sampling other parameters, yields values of 
 <italic>r</italic> strictly less than 1 (see Fig C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005204.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Overall, therefore, in the range of parameter values explored here, universal vaccines appear robustly more efficient in controlling seasonal epidemics, as long as the duration of protection that they provide is sufficiently long.
