<p>Under universal vaccination, the pace of antigenic evolution is driven to zero at sufficiently high coverage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, orange curve): in this regime seasonal transmission is so heavily dampened that there is little strain-specific immunity to drive selection for new variants. However, we note that seasonal epidemics—even of very small sizes—could still occur at this coverage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, ‘elbow’ in orange curve). This is a regime where universal vaccines interrupt transmission in the short term: over several years, however, seasonal viruses can sporadically persist, purely because of the accumulation of naïve individuals, rather than because of antigenic evolution—a situation analogous to measles ([
