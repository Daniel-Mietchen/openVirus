<p>To additionally explore the validity of these findings under parameter uncertainty, we conduct a multivariate sensitivity analysis as described in the Methods. In particular, we explore the key outputs of this analysis: the relative performance of conventional and universal vaccines, with respect to control of seasonal influenza; impact on the pace of antigenic evolution; and implications for pandemic control. Taking the first of these as an example, if 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <italic>
  <sub>C</sub>
 </italic> is the average seasonal epidemic size under a given vaccination coverage, and 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>U</italic>
 </sub> is the corresponding quantity for a universal vaccine, we calculate the ratio 
 <italic>r</italic> = 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>U</italic>
 </sub> / 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>C</italic>.
 </sub> As long as this quantity is below 1, the qualitative finding in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3A</xref> holds true. Defining 
 <italic>r</italic> as the ‘relative efficiency’ in control of seasonal epidemics, we likewise consider relative efficiencies in controlling antigenic evolution, and in pandemic control (corresponding to each of the panels in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3</xref>).
