 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g003">Fig 3</xref> provides a side-by-side comparison of the effects of conventional and universal vaccines, presenting three different outcomes: control of seasonal epidemics (panel A); the effect of vaccines on the pace of antigenic evolution (panel B); and the implications of seasonal vaccination for pandemic sizes (panel C). As described above, the Figure assumes equivalent vaccine efficacy and, in both cases, an annual vaccination program. The Figure is illustrative, involving only the point estimates for each of the input parameters involved (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005204.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): below we examine the robustness of this qualitative behaviour under parameter variability.
