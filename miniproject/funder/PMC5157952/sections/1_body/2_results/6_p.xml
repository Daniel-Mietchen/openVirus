 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g004">Fig 4</xref> plots these relative efficiencies, together with their uncertainty, for different levels of vaccination coverage. In each panel, the region above the dashed line (i.e. a ratio &gt; 1) corresponds to conventional vaccines being more efficient than universal vaccines, and vice versa. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005204.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> suggest that universal vaccines are robustly more efficient in controlling antigenic evolution and in mitigating pandemic sizes. Notably, however, the uncertainty bounds in
