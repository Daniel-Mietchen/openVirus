 <p>Influenza vaccines used today offer good protection, but have limitations: they have to be updated regularly, to remain effective in the face of ongoing virus evolution, and they cannot be used in advance of an influenza pandemic. In this study we considered how such ‘conventional’ vaccines might compare on the population level against new ‘universal’ vaccines currently being developed, that may protect against a broad spectrum of influenza viruses. We developed a mathematical model to capture the interactions between vaccination, influenza transmission, and viral evolution. The model suggests that annual vaccination with universal vaccines could control annual influenza epidemics more efficiently than conventional vaccines. In doing so they could slow viral evolution, rather than promoting it, while maintaining the broadly protective immunity that could mitigate against the emergence of a pandemic. These effects depend sensitively on the duration of protection that universal vaccines can afford, an important quantity to monitor in their development. In future, it is likely that conventional and universal vaccines would be deployed in tandem: we suggest that they could fulfill distinct roles, with universal vaccines being prioritised for managing transmission and evolution, and conventional vaccines being focused on protecting specific risk groups.</p>
