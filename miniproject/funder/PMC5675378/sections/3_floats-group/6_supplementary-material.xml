  <title>Reassortment inference between unpassaged sequences.</title>
  <p>Histograms of reported HA-NA reassortment events between unpassaged sequences for different core distances 
   <italic>δ</italic> (red bars) are compared to expected number of false positives (blue bars), which decays exponentially with increasing 
   <italic>δ</italic>. This result is qualitatively comparable with the distance dependence of real events and false positives that we find including in the analyses also strains subjected to passaging.
