  <title>Reassortment of HA and NA in human influenza A/H3N2 from 2000 to 2015.</title>
  <p>The 95 inferred events are mapped on a joint HA-NA tree. The reassortant strain 
   <italic>r</italic> of each event is represented by a filled circle (color-coded by year of occurrence). The events are homogeneously distributed over the tree and the reassortant clades are predominantly at peripheral positions of the tree.
