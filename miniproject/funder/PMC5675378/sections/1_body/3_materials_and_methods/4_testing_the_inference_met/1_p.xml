<p>We simulate the genome evolution of a population of 
 <italic>N</italic> individuals starting at a stationary state, under the effect of mutation, genetic drift and selection, based on the model used in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Each strain is characterized by a sequence of epitope and non-epitope sites, flanked by neutral sites. Selection on epitope sites is time-dependent and its direction fluctuates randomly at a rate 
 <italic>γ</italic>, while non-epitope sites are modeled with time-independent direction. To these basic steps we add reassortment, which occurs at each generation with probability λ: we select randomly two individuals (the parents) and divide their genome into two parts of fixed length 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>L</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, then mimic the process of reassortment by creating a new individual (
 <italic>r</italic>) with a mixed genome. We focus on events between strains at genetic distance 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>1,2</sub> ≥ 5 in each segment, discarding reassortment at lower distances. The results of each simulation are a set of sampled sequences, some of them involved in a reassortment event, that we use to build up the genealogical trees, as we would do with real observed strains.
