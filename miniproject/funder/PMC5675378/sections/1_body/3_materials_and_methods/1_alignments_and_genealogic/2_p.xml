<p>Some of the isolates we use in this study were subject to passaging for amplification in cell culture. To test the possible role of passaging adaptations as a confounding factor [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we repeat our inference of reassortment on 20 trees built from a restricted alignment of 1053 unpassaged sequences. We observe the same patterns of mutations which characterize the reassortment events reported above, as well as a very similar distance dependence of the false positives counts (
