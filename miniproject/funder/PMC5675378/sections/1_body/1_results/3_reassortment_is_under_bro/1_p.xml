<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g004">Fig 4</xref>, the majority of observed reassortment events are on peripheral positions of the joint HA-NA tree. This observation is broadly consistent with a neutral or, on average, deleterious process. We now turn to measuring selection on reassortment in a more quantitative way.
