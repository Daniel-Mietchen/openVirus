 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the inferred reassortments since 2000 mapped on a joint HA-NA tree. These events cover the entire time interval of the tree with a slight increase in frequency in recent years, which is likely due to increased depth of the tree. In all cases, the parent strains were collected at close times, which is consistent with the fast evolutionary speed and the resulting short sojourn periods of specific genotypes in the population of circulating strains. By comparing the number of reassortment events with the number of synonymous nucleotide changes on the same tree, we estimate that reassortant variants get established at a rate of order 10
 <sup>−2</sup> in units of the neutral point mutation rate. This establishment rate refers to observed variants in a strain sample, which clearly depends on the sampling depth (our data set has a detection threshold frequency of order 10
 <sup>−3</sup>). Our finding of broad negative selection on reassortment, which is reported below, suggests that the reassortment rate of individual virions is higher, but many reassortant variants are rapidly lost in the population of circulating strains.
