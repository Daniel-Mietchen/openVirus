<p>We apply our reassortment inference method to a sequence dataset of human influenza A/H3N2 collected from 1968 to 2015. In each two-segment tree, we map HA-NA reassortments as detailed in Methods: we identify candidate events (

 </inline-formula>, and we eliminate double-counting of events. At the same time, the total number of detected events does not depend on the number of inferred trees, indicating that our mapping exhausts the events occurring in the original dataset. Furthermore, we have verified that passaging mutations do not confound our inference (
