<p>This procedure produces a list of 103 bona fide reliable and independent HA-NA reassortments in our data set. These events have a mean genetic distance 
 <italic>d</italic> ≥ 3 between reassortant and parent strains in both segments and an average 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>ave</sub> = 10, which sets them clearly apart from individual point mutations and provides the genetic basis for potentially strong and epistatic selection (see below). In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006685.s006">S2 Table</xref>, we report the genetic distance 
 <italic>d</italic>, as well as representative strains from the reassortant clade 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>r</italic>
 </sub> and the parent clades 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>′
 </sub>. From the year 2000 on, we find an average of 6 unique reassortment events per year, which is in overall agreement with other studies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, events detected by the majority of these studies are well represented in our list (starred events in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006685.s006">S2 Table</xref>); these include reassortments between New York strains isolated between 2000 and 2005 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006685.s007">S1 Text</xref> for more details). The clean statistical test used here, however, addresses the over-counting of events in a more objective way.
