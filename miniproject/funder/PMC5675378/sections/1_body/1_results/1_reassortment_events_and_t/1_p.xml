<p>A reassortant strain reassembles the genome segments of two parent strains that co-infect a host cell. In this study, we focus on reassortment between the HA and NA genes of influenza, because the evolution of both proteins has been linked to immune escape and functional epistasis between them affects vaccine efficacy [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Hence, we restrict the genomic analysis to the two segments carrying the HA and NA genes; each parent strain contributes exactly one of these segments to the reassortant strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Our inference of reassortment is based on genealogical trees constructed from linked sequence of these two segments (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>). A tree representation of a joint genealogy with a reassortment process is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g002">Fig 2a</xref>. The two parental strains 
 <italic>p</italic> and 
 <italic>p</italic>′ appear in different sublineages, and the reassortant strain 
 <italic>r</italic> is shown as a descendant of one of these parents (here 
 <italic>p</italic>′). These strains define three distinct clades of descendant strains, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>′
 </sub>, and 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>r</italic>
 </sub> (grey areas in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g002">Fig 2a</xref>); the numbers of strains in these clades are denoted by 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>p</italic>′
 </sub>, and 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>r</italic>
 </sub>, respectively. We note that the “direction” of the reassortment event (here from 
 <italic>p</italic> to 
 <italic>p</italic>′) is merely a property of the tree representation, and there is an equivalent tree with the roles of 
 <italic>p</italic> and 
 <italic>p</italic>′ exchanged. This reassortment pattern can be readily identified in two-segment trees. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g002">Fig 2b</xref> shows an example of a HA-NA reassortment event in the genealogy of influenza A/H3N2, another example using tree data from simulated evolution of a population in a regime of clonal interference is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g002">Fig 2c</xref>.
