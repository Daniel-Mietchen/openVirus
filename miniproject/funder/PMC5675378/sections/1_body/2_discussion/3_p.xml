<p>Reassortment can be seen as a natural “experiment” that continuously produces new combinations of viral proteins and probes their fitness in a fast-evolving population. Hence, the statistics of reassortment is informative of key selective forces governing the evolutionary dynamics. Specifically, our result of negative selection on reassortment signals ubiquitous fitness interactions (epistasis) between viral proteins; that is, the fitness of alleles of one protein depends on the genetic background of the other proteins in the same virion. The mutation-selection dynamics in non-reassortant sublineages produces favorable combinations of protein alleles, and reassortment introduces a fitness cost by randomizing these combinations. Importantly, this cost arises between genetic variants from co-circulating strains in a given viral lineage; these variants are individually viable, differ by just a few mutations (of order 20 nucleotide changes in both reassorted segments together), and have a recent common ancestor (typically dating just one or two years back). This implies that new favorable protein combinations are continuously produced and selected for, while many random combinations incur a fitness cost. In other words, cross-protein epistasis constrains the adaptive evolutionary path of a given influenza lineage. This result could be tested, for example, by combining reassortment experiments [
