<p>The main biological result of this paper is that reassortment within human influenza A/H3N2 is under broad, distance-dependent negative selection. Specifically, there are fewer large-
 <italic>d</italic> reassortments in our sample than expected from the distribution of co-circulating strains, and reassortant strains have fewer descendants than their parent strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These observations probe negative selection on reassortant genotypes at different scales of frequency and sojourn time in the population. The suppression of large-
 <italic>d</italic> reassortment signals purifying selection that prevents some reassortant variants from reaching sufficient frequencies to appear in our strain sample; the growth rate difference between reassortant and parent clades indicates moderate negative selection on the variants that do appear in the sample. Reassortment between very close sequences may well be approximately neutral, but sequence-based inference methods cannot distinguish such events reliably from point mutations. The inferred selective effects characterize the continuous evolution of a seasonal influenza lineage; they do not exclude rare large-effect reassortment events causing antigenic shifts and seeding new lineages. We stress that our results are based on statistical methods evaluating ensembles of inferred reassortments and background distributions. Any such method is subject to possible confounding factors and biases; for example, reassortment can be expected to occur preferentially in high-infection settings at the peak of seasonal epidemics. It is the consistent outcome of two distinct inference procedures that gives a credible signal of selection acting on reassortment.
