<p>We have developed a new method to map reassortment of genomic segments in an evolving viral population. We detect reassortment events based on their trace in the genealogy of the population. On a two-segment genealogical tree, a set of 
 <italic>core mutations</italic> in one of the reassorted proteins appears twice: on the branches linking the reassorting (parent) strains and, in reverse direction, on the branch to the reassortant clade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). We are interested predominantly in reassortment events above a certain minimum genetic distance 
 <italic>d</italic> from their parent strains (here at least 3 mutations), which are clearly set apart from the dynamics of point mutations. This is also the regime in which our method allows a reliable identification of events, which is not confounded by ambiguities in tree reconstruction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g003">Fig 3</xref>).
