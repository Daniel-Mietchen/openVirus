<p>The resulting negative selection on reassortment increases in strength with the genetic distance between reassortant and parent strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006685.g005">Fig 5b</xref>). The mixing of genetic material by reassortment is somewhat similar to recombination in diploid populations or transformation in bacteria. However, recombination and transformation require physical splicing of genome segments; the rates of these enzymatic processes get strongly suppressed with increasing genetic distance of the parent sequences [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. There are no corresponding physiological barriers against reassortment of viral segments. Instead, our results suggest that epistatic fitness barriers are already substantial between more distant co-circulating strains of the same lineage, which ties in with the observation of cross-lineage pairing constraints [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hence, on larger scales of genetic distance, such fitness barriers may be an important factor in delineating—and, thus, defining—viral species.
