<p>In parallel to point mutations within single proteins, the genome of the influenza virus changes by so-called reassortment processes. If the same host cell is co-infected by two or more viruses carrying distinct genomes, mixing of genomic segments within that cell may produce a hybrid genotype carrying segments from different parental strains. The evolutionary implications of these dynamics are quite complex. On the one hand, in rare cases, reassortment can lead to 
 <italic>antigenic shifts</italic>, which are new combinations of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase that strongly enhance fitness [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The acquisition of new HA and NA variants by human influenza A through reassortment with avian strains, for example, has been shown to cause global pandemics in 1957 and 1968, known as the “asian” and the “Hong Kong” flu, respectively [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many reassortments, however, have negligible antigenic effects but may have other fitness effects. Specifically, fitness interactions between segments across lineages are observed as biases in observed pairings [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By partly randomizing such pairings, reassortment generates a fitness cost and a resulting increase of subsequent compensatory mutations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Broad negative selection has been postulated for reassortment between well distinct influenza B lineages [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but the overall selective effects of intra-subtype ressortment have not been systematically analyzed so far.
