<p>Influenza virus is a negative-sense single strand RNA virus. Humans can be infected by three phylogenetically and antigenically distinct influenza lineages—A, B and C—that co-circulate globally. Among these lineages, influenza A shows the fastest rate of evolution [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The genome of the virus is segmented into 8 RNA filaments that encode 11 different proteins. Within each segment, genomic evolution is a purely asexual process carried by point mutations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which are subject to genetic drift and natural selection. In particular, positive selective pressure by host immunity plays an important role in the evolution of the surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA), which governs viral binding and entry into host cells, and neuraminidase (NA), which drives the release and escape of new virions from the cell [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006685.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The gradual accumulation of adaptive mutations in these two proteins maintains the ability of the virus to continually evade host immunity [
