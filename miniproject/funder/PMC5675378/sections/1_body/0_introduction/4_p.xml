<p>In the second part of the paper, we turn to our main biological objective of mapping selection on reassortment within an influenza lineage. We apply two independent and complementary selection inference methods to a set of intra-subtype reassortments in the A/H3N2 lineage inferred by our genealogy-based algorithm. First, we compare the distributions of the RNA distances between actual reassortant strains with a suitable background distribution of co-circulating strains, which quantifies the neutral opportunities for reassortment. Second, we compare the total population sizes between the reassortant clade and the non-reassortant clade defined by individual reassortment events; these sizes are estimated from the number of strains in the sequence sample. We find a consistent signal of broad negative selection on intra-lineage reassortment by both methods. We interpret this signal in terms of ubiquitous cross-protein epistasis and discuss evolutionary consequences.</p>
