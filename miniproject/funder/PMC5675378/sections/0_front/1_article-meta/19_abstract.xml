 <p>The genome of the human influenza virus consists of 8 disjoint RNA polymer segments. These segments can undergo reassortment: when two viruses co-infect a host cell, they can produce viral offspring with a new combination of segments. In this paper, we show that reassortment within a given influenza lineage induces a fitness cost that increases in strength with increasing genetic distance of the parent viruses. Our finding suggests that evolution continuously produces viral proteins whose fitness depends on each other; reassortment reduces fitness by breaking up successful combinations of proteins. Thus, selection across proteins constrains viral evolution within a given lineage, and it may be an important factor in defining a viral species.</p>
