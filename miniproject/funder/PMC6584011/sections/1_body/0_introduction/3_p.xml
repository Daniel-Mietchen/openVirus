<p>Although significant progress has been made towards the application of microbes such as 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> for mosquito-borne disease control, we still lack the basic understanding of the natural microbial communities associated with diverse mosquito species of medical and veterinary significance. For example, while a great wealth of knowledge is available on microbial communities of mosquito vectors of malaria, dengue, Zika, Yellow fever, and West Nile virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the microbiota of RVFV vectors remain poorly understood. The lack of this knowledge has limited our ability to understand the influence of mosquito microbiota on RVF transmission and their potential application in RVF disease prevention and control.
