<p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease caused by RVF virus (Bunyaviridae: 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>). Over the last several decades, the virus has caused periodic epizootics and epidemics in Africa, which have been associated with severe economic and nutritional impacts [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Efforts to prevent RVF are mainly devoted towards development of vaccines. Currently, there are no licensed RVF vaccines for use in humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and those that are commercially available for use in livestock face many challenges that affect their effective utilization. These challenges include safety concerns, induction of abortion, fetal malformation in pregnant ewes, stillbirths, need for annual revaccination or application of multiple doses and the inability to differentiate naturally infected animals from vaccinated animals [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the highly susceptible RVF hosts in greater need of vaccination such as sheep and goats have high population turn-over rates, limiting the maintenance of herd immunity especially in pastoralist areas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The lack of safe and effective vaccines for medical and veterinary use underscores the urgent need for alternative strategies for RVF control particularly those targeting the vectors.
