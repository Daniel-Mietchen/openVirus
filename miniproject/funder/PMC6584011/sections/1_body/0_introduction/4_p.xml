<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the microbial communities of 
 <italic>Aedes mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes ochraceus</italic>, the primary vectors of RVFV in Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> are flood water mosquito species belonging to the subgenus 
 <italic>Neomelaniconion</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedimorphus</italic>, respectively. Large populations of the two mosquito species occur in major hot spots for RVF in Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and RVFV has been isolated in pools of both mosquito species during outbreak periods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Inter-epidemic maintenance of RVFV through transovarial transmission has also been documented in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As primary vectors, these mosquito species have been reported to exhibit distinct genetic population structure and demographic patterns in relation to variable occurrence and outbreak patterns of RVF in different ecologies of Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To accomplish our objectives, mosquitoes were collected from four study sites and their microbial composition characterized through MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results reveal that the two mosquito species have distinct microbial communities and that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> has significantly higher microbial diversity and richness than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>. These results provide critical insights into the composition and structure of microbial communities of important disease vectors and may guide the identification of bacterial species that could be harnessed for symbiotic control of RVF virus.
