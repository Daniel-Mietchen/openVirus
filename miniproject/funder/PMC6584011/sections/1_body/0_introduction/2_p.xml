<p>Mosquitoes serve as hosts for diverse microscopic life-forms including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa that are collectively referred to as microbiota. Bacteria are the best-studied component of mosquito microbiota, with some members known to inhibit transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens and to contribute essential functions in mosquito survival, development, and reproduction [
