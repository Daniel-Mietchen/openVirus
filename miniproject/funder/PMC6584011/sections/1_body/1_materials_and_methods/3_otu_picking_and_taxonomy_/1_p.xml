<p>De-multiplexed FASTQ-formatted files obtained from the sequencing facility were processed using IM-TORNADO 2.0.3.2 platform which is specifically designed to process non-overlapping reads [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A detailed description of how raw reads were processed prior to OTUs assignment is provided in our previous report [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In brief, forward and reverse primers were removed prior to quality trimming, discarding reads with less than 150 base pairs. R1 and R2 reads were joined by the IM-TORNADO workflow. Sequences were clustered at 97% sequence similarity to generate operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and then representative sequences were classified taxonomically using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) version 10 as the reference set and mothur v 1.28 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with a threshold of 60% bootstrap confidence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
