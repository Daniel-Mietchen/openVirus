 <italic>ochraceus</italic> were sampled using CDC miniature light traps (John W. Hock Company, Model 512) baited with dry ice. Collections were made during the rainy season between November 2015 and June 2016 from four sites (Korisa, Masalani and Fafi in northeastern Kenya and Ahero in western Kenya) where the two mosquito species are known to occur [

Collections were conducted for two consecutive nights per site with traps operated between 1800 hours and 0600 hours. Trapped mosquitoes were anesthetized for 2 min using triethylamine before sorting and transporting in liquid nitrogen to the laboratory of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (
