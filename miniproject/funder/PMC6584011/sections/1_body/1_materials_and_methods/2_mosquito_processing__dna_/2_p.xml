<p>All DNA samples were shipped to the W.M Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois for sequencing using Illumina MiSeq Bulk V3 platform. The PCR amplification and sequencing procedures targeting the V3-V5 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene were performed as described in our previous reports [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In brief, all DNA samples were measured on a Qubit (Life Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA kit and diluted to 2 ng/μl. PCR master mix was prepared using the Roche High Fidelity Start Kit and 20x Access Array loading reagent and aliquoted into 48 well PCR plates along with 1 μl DNA sample and 1 μl Fluidigm Illumina linkers (V3-V5-F357: ACACTGACGACATGGTTCTACA and V3-V5-R926:TACGGTAGCAGAGACTTG-GTCT) with unique barcode. In a separate plate, 20x solutions of the following primer pairs: forward 5`-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3`and reverse 5`-CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT-3`were prepared by adding 2 μl of forward and reverse primer, 5 μl of 20x Access Array Loading Reagent and water to a final volume of 100 μl.
