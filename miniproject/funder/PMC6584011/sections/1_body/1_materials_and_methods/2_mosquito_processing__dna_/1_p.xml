<p>Adult females that were not visibly blood-engorged were processed for microbial analysis. Prior to genomic DNA extraction, adult female mosquitoes were surface sterilized by rinsing them in 2% bleach solution for 1 min, followed by 70% ethanol for 5 min and then three rinses in sterile phosphate-buffered saline solution each lasting 10 sec. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual mosquitoes using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, GmbH Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and stored at -20°C until further processing. In total, 153 mosquito samples from two mosquito species,
