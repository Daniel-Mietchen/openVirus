<p>A 4 μl aliquot of sample was loaded in the sample inlets and 4 μl of primer (20x) loaded in primer inlets of a previously primed Fluidigm 48.48 Access Array IFC, and samples on the array were then amplified on the Fluidigm Biomark HD PCR machine using the following Access Array cycling program without imaging: 50°C for 2 min (1 cycle), 70°C for 20 min (1 cycle), 95°C for 10 min (1 cycle), followed by 10 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min, 2 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 80°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 min, 8 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72° for 1 min, 2 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 80°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min, 8 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min, and 5 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec, 80°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min. The PCR product was transferred to a new 96 well plate, quantified on a Qubit fluorimeter (Thermo-Fisher) and stored at -20°C. All samples were run on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytics, Ames, IA) and amplicon regions and expected sizes confirmed. Samples were then pooled in equal amounts according to product concentration. The pooled products were size selected on a 2% agarose E-gel (Life Technologies) and extracted from the isolated gel slice with QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Cleaned size selected products were run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer to confirm appropriate profile and determination of average size. The final library pool was spiked with 10% non-indexed PhiX control library (Illumina) and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq V3 Bulk system. The libraries were sequenced from both ends of the molecules to a total read length of 300nt from each end. Cluster density was 964k/mm
 <sup>2</sup> with 85.9% of clusters passing filter.
