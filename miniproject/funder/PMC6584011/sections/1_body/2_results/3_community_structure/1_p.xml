<p>NMDS plots based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities revealed a clear grouping of the samples by mosquito species with some degree of overlap (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007361.g006">Fig 6a</xref>). These results were confirmed by ANOSIM test (R = 0.19, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). Additional analysis revealed a significant effect of study site on microbiota of the two mosquito species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007361.g006">Fig 6b, 6c and 6d</xref>). A follow up ANOSIM test showed that 20 out of the 28 pairwise comparisons were significantly different after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (R = 0.37, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001). One pairwise comparison (OC-MA vs MC-FA) had an R value &gt;0.75 indicating substantial differences in microbial community structure. Nineteen pairwise comparisons had R values ranging from 0.27–0.68 indicating varying degree of overlap but generally different community structure (
