<p>Shannon diversity index, observed OTU and Chao1 but not evenness were significantly influenced by host species and site of collection but not their interaction (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> had significantly higher microbial richness and diversity compared to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007361.g004">Fig 4</xref>). For the site effect, Shannon diversity index, observed OTUs, and Chao1 values were significantly lower in Ahero compared to the other sites. Chao1 values were also significantly lower in Fafi compared to Masalani.
