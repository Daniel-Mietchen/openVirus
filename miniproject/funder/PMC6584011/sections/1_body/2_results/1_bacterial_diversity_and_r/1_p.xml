<p>To survey the microbial communities of field-collected populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>, the V3-V5 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA was PCR amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. Rarefaction curves generated using all mosquito samples (n = 153) demonstrated that bacterial OTU richness for both mosquito species varied markedly across study sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007361.g002">Fig 2</xref>). OTU richness was highest in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> from Fafi and lowest in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> from Ahero. Rarefaction curves indicated that sequencing coverage of the bacterial communities was adequate for some but not all samples.
