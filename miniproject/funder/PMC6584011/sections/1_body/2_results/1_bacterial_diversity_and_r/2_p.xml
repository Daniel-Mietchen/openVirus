<p>Of the 358 OTUs that were detected in the two mosquito species, 85 and 78 OTUs were unique to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>, respectively and 195 were shared between the two mosquito species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007361.g003">Fig 3</xref>). For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>, 35, 15, 39, and 30 OTUs were unique to Ahero, Fafi, Korisa and Masalani, respectively, with only 37 (13%) common across the sites. For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>, 8, 59, 8, and 48 OTUs were unique to Ahero, Fafi, Korisa and Masalani, respectively. There was a significant difference in unique OTUs between 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> across the study sites (Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001). Significant differences were observed between Ahero and Korisa (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001), Ahero and Masalani (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001), Fafi and Korisa (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001) and Fafi and Masalani (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001). Only 10% of the OTUs (28 out of 273) were shared across the study sites in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>. Overall, the proportion of shared OTUs among sites for both species were comparable (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>: 13%, 37/280; 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>: 10%; 28/273; Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5082). The proportion of OTUs unique to specific study sites was also comparable between the two mosquito species (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic> vs 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>: 119/280 vs 123/273; Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5498). For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>, the number of OTUs exclusively shared between any pair of sites was lowest between Ahero and Fafi (4) and highest between Korisa and Masalani (28). For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>, the lowest number of OTUs that were shared between any pair of sites was lowest in Ahero and Korisa (0) and highest between Fafi and Masalani (37).
