<p>A total of 10 bacterial phyla were detected in the two mosquito species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007361.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). The five most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria (53.5%), Firmicutes (22.0%), Actinobacteria (10.0%), Bacteroidetes (5.9%), and unclassified bacteria (5.6%) which collectively accounted for 97% of the total microbiota. Other bacterial phyla included Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, Planctomycetes and Tenericutes. Among the proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria (37.1%) and Alphaproteobacteria (11.7%) were the most dominant groups followed by Betaproteobacteria (4.6%). Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes were abundant in both mosquito species and their relative abundance varied markedly by study site (
