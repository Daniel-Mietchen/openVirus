<p>We used amplicon-based MiSeq sequencing to characterize the bacterial communities of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>, the primary vectors of RVFV in Kenya. Our findings reveal that the two mosquito species harbor distinct microbial communities and that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> has a more diverse microbial community compared to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>. The microbial communities of the two mosquito species were also strongly influenced by the site of collection. Proteobacteria (53.5%), Firmicutes (22.0%) and Actinobacteria (10.0%) were the most abundant phyla which is consistent with previous findings on microbiota of field-collected mosquitoes [
