<p>Variation in microbial composition between the two mosquito species is intriguing given that they were collected from the same study sites and are known to utilize similar aquatic habitats commonly referred to as dambos for oviposition and larval development [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The findings may relate to differences in their biology and exploitation of resources as adults. Both species may have different physiologies that dictates which microbial species can colonize and thrive in their bodies. In addition, blood feeding and sugar feeding are common in these mosquito species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and both traits are known to influence the composition and diversity of microbial communities in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Delineating the microbiota contribution of different blood meal and nectar feeding sources, would require additional research.
