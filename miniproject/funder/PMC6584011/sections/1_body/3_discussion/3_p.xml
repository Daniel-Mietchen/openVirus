<p>For each species, OTU richness varied by the site of mosquito collection suggesting an effect of local environment on microbial richness. Our findings are consistent with previous findings that the local environment is a key determinant of microbial communities in wild-caught mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This effect may partly be mediated by microclimatic differences among the sites such as temperature and humidity. These variables have been found to influence the abundance of microbial communities such as

Contamination of aquatic habitats with pollutants such as pesticides may also alter the microbial communities in the aquatic habitats which in turn may influence the microbial communities that mosquitoes acquire from the larval environment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, we neither quantified the chemical contaminants that the mosquitoes were exposed to nor the plant communities that were present in our study sites. Future studies should include these aspects.
