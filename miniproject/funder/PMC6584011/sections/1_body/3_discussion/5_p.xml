<p>Some of the bacterial genera that were differentially abundant among study sites or between mosquito species included 
 <italic>Tatumella</italic>, 
 <italic>Gluconobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Anoxybacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Proprionibacteria</italic> among others. 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, an acetic acid bacterium largely associated with floral nectar is among the core microbiota of many mosquito species and is likely acquired through sugar-feeding or contact with flowering plants [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. 
 <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Roseomonas</italic> are also acetic acid bacteria that are adapted to various sugar-rich and ethanol-rich environments [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and are commonly found in insects that depend on sugar-based diets including mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. 
 <italic>Achromobacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Anoxybacillus</italic> are commonly found in soil and water and adult mosquitoes may acquire them through contact with soil and water or through transstadial transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. 
 <italic>Tatumella</italic> spp. has previously been described in other adult mosquito species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Members of this genus along with those of genus 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> are involved in fermentation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. 
 <italic>Propionibacterium</italic> include common bacteria of human skin and other animals and may be acquired when the mosquito lands on a blood-meal host.
