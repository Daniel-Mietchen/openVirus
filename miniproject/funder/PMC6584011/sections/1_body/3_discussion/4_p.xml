<p>There is evidence that the two mosquito species differ in vector competence for RVFV as well as in their contribution to RVFV transmission in nature based on infection rates during the RVF outbreak of 2006/07 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. OTUs belonging to the bacterial genera 
 <italic>Propionibacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Anoxybacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Chryseobacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Roseomonas</italic> were mostly associated with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>mcintoshi</italic>, while the genera 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> and unclassified bacteria were mostly associated with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic> (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Bacterial species in some of these genera have been known to influence vector susceptibility to pathogens. For instance, 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp. isolated from 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was shown to directly inhibit La Crosse virus in vitro assays [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. inhibited 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> infection in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Removal of midgut bacteria including 
 <italic>Chryseobacterium</italic> via antibiotic treatment increased the susceptibility of 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> to 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Conversely, 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection success in 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> was associated with higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While bacteria in the genera 
 <italic>Propionibacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Anoxybacillus and Roseomonas</italic> have been previously reported in other mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007361.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], little is known about their effects on pathogen transmission. Whether differences in the contribution of the two mosquito species to RVFV transmission in nature are related to their microbiota profiles remains unclear. Thus, assessing the impact of the identified bacteria on vector competence for RVFV should be the focus of future studies.
