<p>In summary, we provide the first comprehensive report of the microbial communities of field-caught populations of the primary vectors of RVFV in Kenya. We show that the two mosquito species have distinct microbial communities whose diversity and richness is heavily influenced by the site of collection. Because vector susceptibility to pathogens may be influenced by certain bacterial species, further studies are warranted to investigate the functional role of identified microbiota on the biology of the mosquito species including influence on susceptibility to RVFV. These studies may propel identification of bacterial taxa that may be harnessed for symbiotic control of RVF virus.</p>
