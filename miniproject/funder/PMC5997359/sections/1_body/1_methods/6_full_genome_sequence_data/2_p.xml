<p>Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were inferred by IQ-TREE using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model chosen according to Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Statistical robustness for internal branching order in each phylogeny was assessed by UFBootâ€”Ultrafast Bootstrap (BB) Approximation (2,000 replicates) implemented in IQ-TREE [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and strong statistical support along the branches was defined as BB&gt;90%. UFBoot was eployed as it accelerates computing and reduces overestimating branch support [
