<p>The temporal signal for each dataset was assessed using ML trees with TempEst v1.5 (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Bayesian inference of time-scaled phylogenies were carried out with BEAST v1.8.4 (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] by enforcing either a strict or relaxed molecular clock [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and the SDR06 substitution model with empirical base frequencies and gamma distribution of site-specific rate heterogeneity. Two demographic priors were also tested for each analysis: constant population size or non-parametric Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP). Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were run for 50–200 million generations (sampled at fixed intervals to obtain posterior distributions with 10,000 data points), depending on the data set, in order to assure proper mixing of the MCMC, which was assessed on the basis of the effective sampling size (ESS) of each parameter estimate, accepting only ESS values &gt;200. The best clock/demographic model for each virus-specific data set was chosen by comparing marginal likelihood estimates (MLE) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], obtained using path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) methods [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with Bayes Factor (BF) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006505.s006">S2 Table</xref>). In practice, the BF natural logarithm was used for comparison with 
 <italic>ln</italic>BF&lt;2 indicating no evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e. less parameter-rich model), 2–6—weak evidence, 6–10—strong evidence, and &gt;10 very strong evidence [
