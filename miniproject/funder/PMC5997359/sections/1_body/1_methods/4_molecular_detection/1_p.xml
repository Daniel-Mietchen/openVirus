<p>Total RNA was extracted from both plasma specimens and spent media, and tested by real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) following published protocols for CHIKV vRNA [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for confirmation of previous tests performed in Haiti. RNA extracted from plasma specimens were then screened for DENV serotypes 1–4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] vRNAS by rtRT-PCR. Cycle threshold (Ct)-values under 38 were considered positive. Viral genomic RNA that was extracted from CHIKV, DENV1-4, and ZIKV strains that were obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resource Repository (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA) were used as positive control materials for rtRT-PCR. Cell cultures were also tested for the presence of DENV and ZIKV vRNAs by rtRT-PCR, even if the corresponding plasma specimen tested negative. Additionally, spent media from cultures displaying non-CHIKV CPE, that were DENV and ZIKV negative by rtRT-PCR, were screened with a duplex RT-PCR for the vRNAs of other alphaviruses (
 <italic>Venezuelan equine encephalitis -</italic>, 
 <italic>Eastern equine encephalitis -</italic>, 
 <italic>Western equine encephalitis -</italic>, 
 <italic>Aura—</italic>and 
 <italic>Mayaro viruses</italic>) and flaviviruses (
 <italic>Yellow fever -</italic>, 
 <italic>Saint Louis encephalitis -</italic>, 
 <italic>Bussaquara -</italic>, 
 <italic>Ilheus -</italic>, 
 <italic>and Rocio viruses</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The DENV-1 strain from BEI and the 2015 MAYV sample from our laboratory [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were used as the flavivirus and alphavirus positive controls, respectively, in the duplex RT-PCR protocol.
