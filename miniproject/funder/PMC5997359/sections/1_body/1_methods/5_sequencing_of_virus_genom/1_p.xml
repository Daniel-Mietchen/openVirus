<p>Whole genome sequence data from 10 of the CHIKV samples (7 from children with co-infections, 3 from selected randomly mono-infections) were obtained by Sanger sequencing and a primer-walking approach, as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, we designed sequencing primers for MAYV and ZIKV that also amplify approximately 800bp overlapping segments, and used a primer walking method for whole genome sequencing of those viruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For the sequencing of DENV, primers described by Christenbury 
 <italic>et al</italic> were utilized [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Amplification of each segment was performed using an Accuscript high-fidelity first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) followed by PCR with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The 5’ and 3’ ends of the viral genomes were obtained using RNA-ligase mediated (RLM) systems for 5’ and 3’ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) per the manufacturer’s protocols (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Amplicons were purified, sequenced bi-directionally, then the sequences assembled with the use of Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software v2.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI), and subsequently analyzed in comparison to DENV, MAYV, and ZIKV sequences available in GenBank for nucleotide sequence comparisons. The vRNA sequences we obtained differed from those of the corresponding viruses in our repository, confirming the newly analyzed sequences did not arise from laboratory contamination.
