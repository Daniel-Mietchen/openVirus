<p>Blood specimens were collected from schoolchildren with acute febrile illness seen at the Christianville School clinic in Gressier, Haiti, beginning in May 2014. This clinic serves as the primary source of healthcare for approximately 1,250 children at four school campuses (the main LaSalle campus [campus A] and three small satellite elementary school campuses [campuses B, C, and D]) operated by the Christianville Foundation in the Gressier/Leogane region; schools are located within a radius of approximately 10 miles. The clinic has facilities for short-term stays of a few hours for sick children, with those requiring hospitalization referred to the local community hospital. As previously described, acute undifferentiated febrile illness was defined as occurrence of fever in a child with no obvious source of infection (i.e., no respiratory symptoms, symptoms of UTI, or evidence of malaria or typhoid) [

Clinical features of these cases are reported elsewhere [
