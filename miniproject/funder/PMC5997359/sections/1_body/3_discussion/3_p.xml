<p>What was unexpected in our data set was the relatively high frequency of ZIKV/CHIKV co-infections. This occurred in a setting in which we were only screening plasma samples. As we have previously reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], urine can be positive for ZIKV for a longer period of time than plasma; if we had also screened urine, there is the possibility that we would have identified additional ZIKV-positive patients. We, and others, have previously reported cases of ZIKV/CHIKV co-infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], so finding the two together is not surprising. The ZIKV case cluster in the current study would appear to have been relatively widespread within the community (i.e., not a point source at the school), as one of the six co-infections was from a child at a different school campus, ca. 5 miles from the main campus. Interestingly, our molecular clock analysis indicates that the strains of CHIKV and ZIKV found in our patients were both introduced in Haiti within the same short time frame, each one giving rise to a well-supported monophyletic clade, one including all CHIKVs from CHIKV/ZIKV co-infected subjects, the other one including all ZIKVs from the same co-infected subjects. The simultaneous emergence of these two clades in the Haitian population is compatible with a simultaneous co-infection scenario or indicate, at the very least, the sequential infection of a patient with two arboviruses within a relatively short period of time. In light of recent reports that mosquito co-infection with ZIKV and CHIKV allows simultaneous transmission without affecting vector competence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], it is plausible that the two viruses were co-transmitted by the same mosquito. Given that these are among the earliest, if not the earliest, documented ZIKV infections in the hemisphere, the observation that they appeared together with epidemic CHIKV raises interesting questions about the possible role of CHIKV in the initiation of the ZIKV epidemic in the Americas.
