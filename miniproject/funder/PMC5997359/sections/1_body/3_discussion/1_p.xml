<p>Despite increasing recognition of the frequency with which simultaneous co-infection with multiple arbovirus species occurs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], co-infection dynamics are not well understood, and the clinical, pathologic, and immunologic significance of such co-infections remains to be determined. As a starting point in unraveling these dynamics, we were interested in better quantifying the frequency of such infections, and exploring possible origins of co-infecting strains. To optimize our ability to identify co-infections (and following standard practices in our laboratory [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]), we continued diagnostic studies even after initial identification of CHIKV or another pathogen in a patient sample. Interestingly, while we identified multiple co-infecting viruses in cell culture, the original patient rtRT-PCR in this study was, in each instance, negative for the second pathogen, suggesting that viral loads for the co-infecting species were low. We also had instances where viral cultures were negative in the setting of a positive rtRT-PCR, possibly reflecting the presence of non-viable virus in the sample, and/or strains that have mutated or which do not grow well in Vero cells. If we are to better understand the role of co-infections in disease occurrence, the diagnostic significance of both rtRT-PCR negative/culture positive and rtRT-PCR positive/culture negative samples will require further study.
