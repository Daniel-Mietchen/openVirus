<p>Co-infections with CHIKV and DENV are well described, with reported rates of co-infection ranging from 1% to 34% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; the highest reported co-infection rates were from Madagascar (26%) and Nigeria (34%). Another study from the Colombian-Venezuelan border reports a CHIKV/DENV co-infection prevalence of 7.6% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our study, in contrast, the co-infection rate was only 1%, with only two additional dengue cases (both DENV-1) identified among CHIKV-negative patients; this may reflect a low level of circulating DENV in the community during the CHIKV epidemic, and/or a high existing level of population immunity to the virus. We also identified one CHIKV/MAYV co-infection. We have previously reported a mixed MAYV and DENV-1 infection that occurred outside of the time frame of the CHIKV epidemic (January, 2015) in the same school cohort [

The high genomic similarity of this Haitian MAYV isolate with a Brazilian strain isolated in 1960 corroborates our hypothesis that MAYV has been criptically circulating in the human population at a sub-epidemic level, most likely in Brazil, for years and that it was introduced just recently onto Hispaniola [
