<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006505.g003">Fig 3</xref>, two other 2014 CHIKV isolates, not collected as part of this study but previously reported by Lanciotti (KR559476 and KR559478) from mono-infected Haitian patients, clustered within a second distinct clade related to different Central and South American strains, but separate from our Gressier strains. One of the 10 sequenced CHIKV strains from our cohort, from a randomly selected mono-infection in a child from Campus B, was in yet a third clade, which clustered most closely with a strain from the Dominican Republic.
