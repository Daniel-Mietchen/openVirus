<p>The six ZIKV sequences obtained in June 2014 from the CHIKV co-infected patients were highly similar (99.9%) to each other and also cluster within a well-supported monophyletic clade, which, interestingly, includes a divergent strain isolated in 2016 from Guadaloupe (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006505.s004">S3B</xref>). The primary clade of co-infecting ZIKV strains is closely related to another ZIKV clade including isolates from the 2016 USA Florida outbreak [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) belonged to distinct phylogenetic lineages, consistent with multiple independent introductions of ZIKV to Haiti. The median origin of the Haitian ZIKV co-infection strains was estimated by molecular clock in April 2014 with a 95%HPD between January and May 2014 (
