<p>CHIKV, ZIKV, MAYV and DENV-2 alignments displayed strong phylogenetic signal (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006505.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), as well as temporal signal sufficient for the calibration of an accurate molecular clock (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006505.g003">Fig 3</xref>) using the best fitting molecular clock/demographic model (

Bayesian and ML reconstructions displayed very similar topologies and suggested three independent phylogenetic lineages of CHIKV in Haiti, possibly the result of three separate introductions (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006505.s004">S3A</xref>). The CHIKV strains from the current study were in a well-supported monophyletic clade which was most closely related to a strain from El Salvador (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006505.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Within this clade, six CHIKV strains were from patients co-infected with ZIKV and one with DENV-2. Molecular clock median estimate of the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for the clade was August 2013, with 95% highest posterior density (95%HPD) intervals between April 2013 and January 2014 (
