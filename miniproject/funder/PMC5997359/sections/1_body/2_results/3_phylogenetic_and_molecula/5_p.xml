<p>Finally, the MAYV strain from a CHIKV co-infected patient seen on June 4, 2014 is the earliest documented case of MAYV in Haiti to date. Its genome is highly similar (99.4%) to a strain from Brazil isolated in 1960, and phylogenetic analysis cluster both strains in a well-supported monophyletic clade (Figs

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], with a tMRCA dating back to 1958 (95%HPD interval of 1949â€“1960). It should be noted, however, that since we only have one MAYV strain clustering with the Brazilian 1960 strain, the tMRCA is unlikely to represent the date of introduction of MAYV in Haiti. Another, previously reported Haitian strain (KX496990) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], clusters in a different well-supported clade within genotype L, a scenario once again consistent with multiple independent introductions of the virus in the Caribbean.
