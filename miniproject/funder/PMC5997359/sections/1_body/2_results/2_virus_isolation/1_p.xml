<p>Of the 82 rtRT-PCR CHIKV-positive specimens, attempts were made to isolate virus from 62 specimens, with the remainder not inoculated onto cell cultures due to insufficient specimen volume. Typical CHIKV-induced CPE, consisting of cell membrane blebbing, cell lysis, and apoptosis, were observed in cultures from 43 of the 62 samples on average 5 days post inoculation (dpi), with some specimens displaying advanced CPE as early as 2 dpi and others not until 20 dpi (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006505.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All negative control cell cultures lacked CPE and tested negative by rtRT-PCR for the target vRNAs of this work. Eleven (15%) of the 62 samples cultured did not display any CPE during the period of culture and tested negative for target vRNAs in these studies, despite initial positive CHIKV results by rtRT-PCR. Eight cultures displayed CPE inconsistent with those expected for CHIKV (

The mixed CPE in these latter cultures was associated with co-infection with CHIKV together with another virus, as determined by molecular tests of the cultured specimens: co-infecting arboviruses included ZIKV (n = 6), DENV type 2 (n = 1), and MAYV virus (n = 1). Sex and age of patients were comparable for those with CHIKV mono-inections and the subset of CHIKV cases with co-infections. Seven of the 8 co-infections were from Campus A of the school; one co-infection (CHIKV and ZIKV) was in a student from Campus B.
