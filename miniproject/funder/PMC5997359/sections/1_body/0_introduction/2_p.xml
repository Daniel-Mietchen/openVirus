<p>The similarity of the clinical presentation of acute-phase arbovirus infections is further complicated by the potential for simultaneous infection with multiple arboviruses. In a recent literature review, co-infections with CHIKV and DENV ranged from 1% to 34% of patients [

Even where good laboratory diagnostic facilities are available, identification of co-infections often does not occur, as there is a tendency to cease investigation once an initial pathogen has been identified, and/or identification of a second pathogen may require facilities for virus isolation, which may not be available.
