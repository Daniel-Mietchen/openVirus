  <title>Maximum likelihood (ML) selected arbovirus phylogenies inferred from full genome sequence alignments obtained using the IQ-TREE software.</title>
  <p>Midpoint rooted ML phylogenies for (A) CHIKV, (B) ZIKV, (C) DENV-2 and (D) MAYV. Branch lengths are scaled in nucleotide substitutions per site according to the bar at the bottom of each tree. Tips are colored by sampling location as indicated in the legends to the left of each tree; diamonds at each node indicate strong statistical support along branches defined as ultrafast bootstrapping&gt;90% (out of 2,000 replicates).</p>
