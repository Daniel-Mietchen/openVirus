<p>Results of sensitivity analyses indicated that both magnitude and duration of epidemics were most sensitive to variation in the proportion of recovered individuals in the population at the initiation of the epidemic, regardless of the manner in which epidemics were initiated (via recrudescence or via immigration) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). These results again were consistent with the general consensus that availability of susceptible individuals is the primary infection-limiting factor

 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. As expected, magnitudes and durations of epidemics produced by both versions of the model also were sensitive to changes in disease transmission rate and the lengths of the latency and infectious periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0080430-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences between the two versions of the model with regard to their sensitivity to changes in any of the parameters tested (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080430-t003">3</xref>). Thus, relative sensitivity of simulated local (within a single population) epidemiological dynamics to changes in the values of important parameters was consistent with current knowledge, and these dynamics were robust to the manner in which epidemics were initiated (via recrudescence or immigration).
