Hendra virus is one of several zoonotic viral diseases that have recently emerged from <italic>Pteropus</italic> species fruit-bats (flying-foxes). Most hypotheses regarding persistence of Hendra virus within flying-fox populations emphasize horizontal transmission within local populations (colonies) via urine and other secretions, and transmission among colonies via migration. As an alternative hypothesis, we explore the role of recrudescence in persistence of Hendra virus in flying-fox populations via computer simulation using a model that integrates published information on the ecology of flying-foxes, and the ecology and epidemiology of Hendra virus. Simulated infection patterns agree with infection patterns observed in the field and suggest that Hendra virus could be maintained in an isolated flying-fox population indefinitely via periodic recrudescence in a manner indistinguishable from maintenance via periodic immigration of infected individuals. Further, post-recrudescence pulses of infectious flying-foxes provide a plausible basis for the observed seasonal clustering of equine cases. Correct understanding of the infection dynamics of Hendra virus in flying-foxes is fundamental to effectively managing risk of infection in horses and humans. Given the lack of clear empirical evidence on how the virus is maintained within populations, the role of recrudescence merits increased attention.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Sources of funding: Queensland Government.

A number of zoonotic viral agents, including Hendra virus, have emerged from <italic>Pteropus</italic> species fruit-bats (commonly known as flying-foxes) since the mid-1990s <xref rid="pone.0080430-Mackenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Mackenzie2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Chua1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

Hendra virus is a novel paramyxovirus, which with Nipah virus, constitutes the genus <italic>Henipavirus</italic>. Hendra virus has resulted in at least 75 equine deaths and four associated human deaths in eastern Australia since 1994 <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Playford1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. All human cases have resulted from horse to human transmission.</p><p>From a human perspective, a common characteristic of many disease-causing agents is their ability to appear and disappear quickly in nature, often in an inexplicable manner. The emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases is inextricably linked to the natural system, of which the causal agent is but one part, making it extremely difficult to identify the combinations of climatic conditions, landscape structures and host characteristics that provoke a disease outbreak.</p><p>In spite of major health implications for both horses and humans, knowledge of the manner in which Hendra virus is maintained in flying-fox populations, and particularly how the virus avoids extinction as their host species become immune, remains limited <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The sporadic nature of spillover events <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, coupled with the nomadic lifestyle and complex social structure of <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats <xref rid="pone.0080430-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, leaves several important questions regarding the ecology and epidemiology of Hendra virus unanswered, and in particular how it persists within host populations.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that Hendra virus is maintained through episodic infection of local populations within a metapopulation structure, but does not persist endemically within any single local population. Most hypotheses emphasize horizontal transmission within colonies via urine and other secretions, especially during pregnancy and mating <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and transmission among colonies via migration, with the magnitude of migration affected by the spatial connectivity among colonies, resulting in episodic infection <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. While these hypotheses explain much of the observed disease dynamics, the finding of some recent virus excretion prevalence studies <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field5" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> are not adequately explained.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis, which to our knowledge has not been tested within a quantitative framework, is that endemic infection occurs via viral latency and recrudescence. Two recent studies have indicated an endemic pattern of Hendra virus infection in flying-fox populations, suggesting that the infection dynamics of this novel paramyxovirus may differ from the acute, self-limiting, episodic pattern observed with other paramyxoviruses (e.g. measles virus, phocine distemper virus, rinderpest virus) <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field5" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern, Breed et al. <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> found that the seroprevalence of Hendra virus in a spectacled flying-fox (<italic>Pteropus conspicillatus</italic>) population in northern Australia gradually increased over a two-year period, suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period. The authors found that age, pregnancy, and lactation were significant risk factors for a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Further, two recent papers suggest recrudescence as the only plausible explanation of henipavirus infection in discrete flying-fox populations. Rahman et al. reported recrudescing infection and subsequent transmission in a captive colony of <italic>Pteropus vampyrus</italic> in Malaysia <xref rid="pone.0080430-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and Peel et al. reported henipavirus serologic findings in the fruit-bat <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> on an isolated island in the Gulf of Ghana that also support viral recrudescence <xref rid="pone.0080430-Peel1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, an increasing number of studies suggest another mode of henipavirus persistence may exist.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the possible role of recrudescence in the persistence of Hendra virus in flying-fox populations via computer simulation using a model that integrates published information on the ecology of flying-foxes, and the ecology and epidemiology of Hendra virus. We first describe an individual-based version of a simple SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model, modified to include the possibility that &#x0201c;recovered&#x0201d; individuals again become infectious via recrudescence during pregnancy and early lactation. We then evaluate the demographic and epidemiological dynamics generated by our new model in view of the available empirical evidence. Finally, we use our new model to explore the possible role of recrudescence in generating recurring epidemics of different magnitudes and durations in an isolated (no immigration) population under a variety of scenarios.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Model description</title><p>We formulated the model as an individual-based model representing the daily dynamics of a hypothetical black- (<italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>) or grey-headed (<italic>Pteropus poliocephalus</italic>) flying-fox population consisting of a single isolated colony.

We imposed the basic life cycle pattern via fixed rules coded into the model, and seasonal patterns in age structure shifts appeared as a direct result of individual life cycles. The ability of the model to generate appropriate demographic patterns was a prerequisite for the subsequent representation and explanation of disease dynamics. For this phase of model evaluation we ran three Monte Carlo simulations using baseline parameter values (see model description in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0080430.s001">Appendix S1</xref>).</p><p>We then confirmed the ability of the model to generate differences in the magnitudes and durations of epidemics as a function of the proportions of susceptible individuals in the population at the beginning of the epidemic. Once again, although we imposed these patterns via fixed rules coded into the model, the ability of the model to generate reasonable patterns of local epidemics, from initial infection to apparent viral extinction, was a prerequisite for the subsequent evaluation of the role of recrudescence in disease persistence. Thus, for simulations during this phase of model evaluation, we assumed no recrudescence and initiated epidemics by introducing one infectious individual into the population on day 1 of simulated time (1 January), while varying the initial proportions of susceptible individuals in the population from 0.95 to 0.05 in increments of 0.05. We ran three Monte Carlo simulations for each initial proportion of recovered individuals, with all other parameters set to their baseline values, and monitored the (1) magnitudes of epidemics (maximum proportion of infectious individuals in the population), (2) numbers of days post infection that these maximums occurred, and (3) durations of epidemics (number of days with the proportion of infectious individuals &#x0003e;0.10).</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the relative sensitivity of the epidemiological dynamics of our model to changes in the values of important parameters, and the robustness of these responses to the manner in which epidemics were initiated (via recrudescence or immigration). Sensitivity analysis <xref rid="pone.0080430-Saltelli1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> focused on determining the response of the magnitude and duration of epidemics to variation in (1) initial population size, (2) initial proportion of recovered individuals in the population, (3) duration of latency period, (4) duration of infectious period, (5) duration of maternal immunity period, (6) disease transmission rate, and (7) recrudescence rate. Except for disease transmission rate and recrudescence rate, we selected the range of values used for the various parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080430-t001">Table 1</xref>) to correspond to the ranges reported in <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0080430-t001">Table 1</xref>). We varied disease transmission rate between 2.0E-5 (the lower end of the range reported in <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>) and 0.001, and we varied recrudescence rate over this same range. Robustness analysis consisted of comparing the relative sensitivities of two versions of the model to changes in the values of these parameters. The first version assumed epidemics were initiated by recrudescence and the second assumed epidemics were initiated by introducing one infectious immigrant into the population on a randomly-chosen day of the year (assuming no recrudescence). For each sensitivity analysis, we once again ran three Monte Carlo simulations for each parameter combination.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0080430-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0080430.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design for the sensitivity analysis and robustness analysis.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0080430-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0080430.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameter</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mid-range</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maximum</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial population size</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5000</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10000</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial proportion of R individuals</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.05</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.95</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of latency period (days)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of infectious period (days)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of maternal immunity period (days)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">150</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">180</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">210</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disease transmission rate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0E-5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0E-4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recrudescence rate (sensitivity analysis)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.0E-5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.0E-4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recrudescence rate (robustness analysis)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>Three Monte Carlo simulations were run for each parameter combination.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Role of recrudescence in the persistence of Hendra virus</title><p>After confirming the ability of our model to produce and explain differences in the magnitudes and durations of Hendra epidemics based on the life cycle of flying-foxes and the epidemiology of Hendra virus in a manner consistent with current knowledge, we used the model to explore the possible role of recrudescence in generating recurring epidemics in an isolated population under a variety of scenarios.

Previously, metapopulation models of the presence of Hendra virus in flying fox populations had provided the most coherent explanation of the patterns of infections observed <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. We do not suggest that recrudescence is more important than transmission via immigration in initiating local epidemics or that the two mechanisms are mutually exclusive. We suggest that recrudescence provides a plausible mechanism of Hendra virus persistence in flying-fox populations, and in addition, a parsimonious model for maintenance of Hendra virus in populations that are ecologically isolated.</p><p>Hendra virus could be maintained in an isolated flying-fox population indefinitely via periodic recrudescence in a manner such as to be indistinguishable from maintenance via periodic immigration of infected individuals. The magnitude and duration of simulated epidemics initiated by either mechanism of infection depended on the proportion of susceptible individuals in the population at initiation of the epidemic. This is consistent with theory <xref rid="pone.0080430-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and has been reported in earlier field studies of flying-foxes <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field4" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and in pigs with another henipavirus, Nipah virus <xref rid="pone.0080430-Pulliam1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The magnitudes of our simulated epidemics appeared to increase almost linearly with the length of time between recrudescent events. The variability in magnitudes of epidemics after any given recovery period was accounted for primarily by annual variation in cohort sizes (numbers of pups born) and hence, annual variation (lagged one year) in recruitment of susceptible individuals into the population. However, after relatively long periods with no new infections in the population, the dwindling number of potentially recrudescent individuals became the factor limiting the initiation of an epidemic.</p><p>The usefulness of our model and its results firstly rests on the credibility of the model, and secondly on how well it explains observed events in nature. To evaluate model credibility, we followed the Pattern-Oriented Modelling protocol as outlined in <xref rid="pone.0080430-Grimm2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which focuses on comparing patterns in the structure and dynamics of the model with those patterns in the real system deemed most relevant to the questions of interest. The general idea is that the credibility/usefulness of a model is determined not only by its ability to generate a single pattern of interest, but also by its structural realism. This requires that the model produces multiple independent patterns that match observations from the real system and that collectively explain how the pattern of interest was generated <xref rid="pone.0080430-Grimm3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We assessed the model to be credible/useful based on its ability (1) to generate demographic patterns representing appropriate seasonality of births and fluctuations in population size, as well as appropriate lengths of developmental stages and stage-class composition of the population; (2) to generate epidemiological patterns representing magnitudes and durations of epidemics that demonstrated appropriate sensitivity to changes in the values of important parameters affecting disease transmission (such as transmission rate, lengths of periods of latency, infectiousness, and maternal immunity, and initial proportion of immune individuals in the population); and (3) to generate these epidemiological patterns robustly, that is, regardless of the mechanism, recrudescence or immigration, used to initiate epidemics.</p><p>The robustness of simulation results to changes in the process used to initiate epidemics, together with the empirical evidence for the recrudescence of Hendra virus infections in mammalian hosts provides evidence for the potential role of recrudescence in the persistence of Hendra virus in flying-fox populations. We suggest that recrudescence is a possible mechanism for initiating local epidemics; we do not suggest that recrudescence is more, or less, important than transmission by immigration, nor that the two mechanisms are mutually exclusive. Plowright et al <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> argue that the problematic aspects of persistence via migration and horizontal transmission diminish under several hypothesized scenarios. For example, if some young-of-the-year receive maternal immunity (which subsequently wanes), the period of recruitment of susceptible individuals to the population would be extended <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Further, if anthropogenic perturbations have altered the spatial structure of the metapopulation, this may result in changed spatial dynamics and connectivity between colonies <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, given the lack of clear empirical evidence indicating the manner in which Hendra virus is maintained within populations, we do suggest that the recrudescence concept remains plausible and merits increased attention. We also would note that our simulated patterns of infection agree with the infection patterns observed in the field in <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and that our model structure per se provides a set of ecologically/epidemiologically interpretable cause-effect relationships capable of generating those patterns. Breed et al. <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> found increased levels of seroprevalence of HeV during late pregnancy and the first few weeks of lactation, suggesting an endemic infection with periodic pulses of viral transmission during pregnancy. These authors further interpreted their findings as being consistent with a scenario of persistent infection with viral latency and recrudescence, as had been proposed by H.E. Field (unpublished data). Breed et al. <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> also noted that an increase in viral transmission associated with pregnancy is consistent with the temporal pattern of some Hendra virus spillover events to horses. The observed temporal synchrony of spill-over events from flying-fox populations separated from each other by considerable distances also raises some questions concerning the ability of the immigration of infected individuals to generate such synchrony.</p><p>In contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern, Breed et al. <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> observed that seroprevalence of Hendra virus in a spectacled flying-fox population in northern Australia gradually increased over a two-year period, suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period. They found that pregnancy and lactation were significant risk factors for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to Hendra virus, with antibody titres being significantly higher in females than males, and with the highest titres occurring in pregnant animals. They also found temporal variation in antibody titres, suggesting that immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. Plowright et al. <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> also identified a serological association with age, pregnancy and lactation, and a positive Hendra virus serostatus. In our model, we discounted the significance of lactation because these previous studies analysed serological data not infection data. Given the described association between pregnancy and a positive serostatus, the association between lactation and serostatus likely reflects the same infection event, putatively in (the preceding) pregnancy. Similarly, we discounted a specific association between late pregnancy and a positive serostatus <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Those authors did not suggest a differential association between late versus early pregnancy and serostatus, but rather that the association resulted from the ability to accurately detect late pregnancy (but not early pregnancy) with the technique used.</p><p>Recrudescing henipavirus infections have been reported in humans, although infectiousness following recrudescence has not been described. Field and Kung <xref rid="pone.0080430-Field3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> noted that henipavirus infection in humans has been associated with viral latency and subsequent recrudescence. In addition, apparent recrudescence has been reported in flying-foxes, with evident bat-to-bat transmission following recrudescence <xref rid="pone.0080430-Breed1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These findings suggest infectiousness following recrudescence in flying-foxes, but not in humans, a scenario not unexpected given the likely different pathogenesis and immune dynamics in the natural host and in spillover hosts. Persistence of other viral diseases such as measles has been associated with population heterogeneity (age structure, social structure) and population spatial structure (metapopulations existing in spatially discrete patches) <xref rid="pone.0080430-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0080430-Merler1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Population heterogeneity facilitates the persistence of infection if different population segments are infected at different times. Population spatial structure facilitates the persistence of infection if local infections in spatially-discrete patches die out sequentially rather than simultaneously and allow reinfections to occur through migration between patches.</p><p>In addition to recrudescence providing a plausible mechanism of Hendra virus persistence in flying-fox populations, it also plausibly explains the often observed &#x02018;pattern&#x02019; of equine cases, namely temporal clustering over spatially disparate locations. While this pattern is likely associated with a suite of ecological, climatic and other factors, the presence of virus obviously represents the &#x02018;necessary&#x02019; component within an epidemiological &#x02018;necessary and sufficient&#x02019; causality paradigm. Twenty-eight of the 42 incidents of Hendra virus infection in horses reported to date have occurred in June (8), July (13), or August (7) <xref rid="pone.0080430-Biosecurity1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Our results suggest that recrudescence in a single female sometime during pregnancy would be sufficient to precipitate a pulse of infection in the preceding year's pups (&#x02248;10% of the population) and other susceptible individuals in the colony, with the peak infection prevalence occurring during one of these months, even if an epidemic had passed through the population the previous year. Were this scenario to occur in disparate colonies, it would facilitate disparate equine cases clustered in time. Thus, to the extent that risk of infection in horses is related to viral prevalence in flying-foxes, post-recrudescence pulses of infectious flying-foxes provide a plausible causal mechanism for the observed pattern of infection in horses.</p><p>Clearly, an accurate understanding of the infection dynamics of Hendra virus in flying-fox populations is crucial for the development of effective management strategies to reduce the risk of disease spillover from flying-foxes to horses and humans. Although simulated disease dynamics produced by immigration of infected individuals versus recrudescence were indistinguishable when viewed from the perspective of a local colony, which was the focus of the present study, our results suggest that differences should emerge when viewed from a meta-population perspective. Simulation of the effect of connectivity (level of immigration) among colonies on meta-population disease dynamics in flying foxes (assuming no recrudescence) indicated that median frequencies and sizes (maximum amplitudes) of local epidemics were related directly and inversely, respectively, to level of connectivity <xref rid="pone.0080430-Plowright1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These results can be predicted theoretically based on the epidemiological concept of a threshold susceptible population size <xref rid="pone.0080430-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> together with the often-assumed analogy between aggregations of hosts and pathogen habitat patches within a meta-population dynamics context <xref rid="pone.0080430-Hanski1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Pathogen dynamics depend on the level of mixing within local host populations (number and frequency of contacts between infected and susceptible individuals), as well as the level of connectivity among host sub-populations (number and frequency of immigrants from infected to susceptible sub-populations). Based on our results, if a significant proportion of local epidemics is initiated by recrudescence of resident individuals, then we would not expect to find a significant relationship between median epidemic frequencies or sizes and level of connectivity among colonies.</p><p>Additionally, field observations may facilitate hypothesis-testing. If recrudescence of resident individuals is a significant source of new infections, we would expect that the variability in proportion of infected individuals within regions and among regions would not differ significantly. Hopefully, our ideas will promote increased investigation into the importance of recrudescence as a mechanism contributing to the persistence of Hendra virus in flying-fox populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0080430.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
