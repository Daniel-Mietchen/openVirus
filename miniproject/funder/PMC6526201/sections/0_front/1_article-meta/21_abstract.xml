 <p>The Spanish Flu of 1918 reached every continent, infected one-third of the world's population and claimed over 50 million lives [1]. The centenary of this event presented a stark reminder of the threat of infectious disease epidemics to global health and security. These threats persist, fuelled in part by features of modern-day living such as climate change, globalisation, deforestation and population growth [2]. While progress has been made for managing infectious disease epidemics, critical gaps in leadership, governance, coordination and finance remain [3].</p>
