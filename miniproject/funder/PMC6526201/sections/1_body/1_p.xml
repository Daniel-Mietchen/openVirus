<p>Patient-centred clinical research provides much needed evidence for clinical management and public health decisions in an infectious disease epidemic [
 <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Building capability for clinical research is a core component of preparedness and the case for investment has been well made [
 <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For many emerging infectious diseases, effective diagnostics, medications and vaccines are simply not available [
 <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and where these medical countermeasures are available, the evidence for their use in infectious disease epidemics is often limited. In many instances the point at which an epidemic occurs is the only time to gather data and generate new knowledge regarding disease characterisation, prevention and treatment. Experience from previous epidemics highlights how time and again, the research response is delayed and the narrow window of opportunity for enrolling patients during peak epidemic waves is missed. To be effective, research must be fast, flexible and integrated with the frontline response. However, research takes time to conceive, prepare, deliver and disseminate. Multisite, multi-country research responses are often needed to ensure sufficient patient numbers for conclusive results across demographics and research teams must navigate the requirements of multiple regional and national administrative and regulatory systems. Preparation must take place before and in anticipation of outbreaks and should address the multiple political, ethical, administrative, contractual, regulatory, logistic, economic and societal factors that influence the viability of conducting research in an outbreak.
