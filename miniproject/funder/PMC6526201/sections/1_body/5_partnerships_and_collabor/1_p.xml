<p>Infectious disease epidemic research preparedness requires strong interdisciplinary and cross-border collaborations with a clear focus on local capacity building and local leadership in epidemic hotspots. Strong partnerships are built on trust and commitment to a common purpose; and take time, both to build and sustain. However, there are multiple challenges to building equitable and mutually supportive partnerships. These include unequal access to funding, academic reward systems that incentivise competition over cooperation, silo-thinking reinforced by (artificial) disciplinary boundaries and commonly held assumptions regarding mutual capacities or needs. Fragmentation and competition among stakeholder groups, research initiatives and disciplines represent a lost opportunity for shared expertise and learning, and to strengthen global, national and regional research preparedness. A shared value base must ensure fairness and equity in opportunities, process, benefits, costs and outcomes [

The meeting resulted in strengthened partnerships across the clinical research networks and disciplines, including proposals for a cross-network advisory group working on mitigation of operational barriers in different global regions.
