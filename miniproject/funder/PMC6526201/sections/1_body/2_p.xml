<p>Members of the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) [
 <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have funded clinical research networks across multiple global regions, and in particular in sub-Saharan Africa. These networks have different models of operation adapted to different global regions and contexts, but are united by a common goal: to build capacity for delivering clinical research in response to infectious disease epidemics. The Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics (PREPARE) increases the ability for rapid clinical research response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks that are of public health concerns in Europe. In September 2018, these networks came together at a public meeting in Brussels coordinated by GloPID-R and PREPARE. The meeting aimed to share learning and solutions about how to overcome common bottlenecks when delivering research in this challenging context [

In total, 97 delegates from 24 countries attended the meeting, including infectious disease specialists, social scientists, microbiologists, field epidemiologists, public health specialists, regulators, policy makers and funders. Through expert-led presentations, workshops and discussion, delegates considered how progress can be made, particularly in three key areas (
