<p>The unique questions posed by infectious disease outbreaks call for innovation to the conception and design of clinical studies to provide answers that are pragmatic, workable and bolster public health responses. For example, studies orientated to enrolling patients with syndromic presentations of likely candidate infectious disease outbreaks during intra-epidemic periods would seamlessly continue enrolling patients at the point of an outbreak, and have the capacity to move rapidly from an observational to interventional mode. A suite of observational studies within the PREPARE consortium uses this approach to enrol patients with arthropod borne viral compatible febrile illness, sepsis-like-syndromes and acute respiratory infection [

 <sup>4</sup>E, a pragmatic trial that has recruited over 3000 patients across 21 primary care networks in 15 European Union countries to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of oseltamivir for patients with influenza-like illness in primary care [

Interdisciplinary approaches are also key; for example, integrated social science research provides insight into multi-stakeholder understanding, and acceptability of research and can ensure contextually and culturally appropriate research features. Social science networks are now being funded to contribute to this work. Identifying ways to feedback outcomes of research, as well as considering wider questions about integration of research findings, are often neglected yet important areas of focus.
