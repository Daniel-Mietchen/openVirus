<p>The scientific, ethical and regulatory requirements of clinical research are such that many research activities are necessarily sequential: protocols must set out the design of research before a study can be approved; ethical and other regulatory bodies must confirm their approval before patients can be recruited; patient or proxy consent must (usually) be obtained before patient data and samples can be collected; and data must be cleaned before it is analysed and findings disseminated. Rapid deployment of clinical studies requires innovations to research design, approval and delivery that reduce delay along this sequential process. For example, clinical research questions for likely candidate outbreaks can be pre-formulated: “hibernating” or “sleeping” studies can be pre- or partially approved [
