<p>Clinical research operates in a wider policy, regulatory and socio-political context. Key features of that context can operate as a barrier or an enabler to the delivery of clinical research during an ID outbreak. Preparedness for clinical research needs a strong policy context and needs to occur across sectors, professional disciplines and population groups. Processes and mechanisms for rapid response are needed among regulatory bodies, ethical review boards and funding communities. Progress has been made, for example, experience from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has led to pre- defined regulatory templates being developed for clinical trials of vaccines. These pre-prepared templates would expedite regulatory review for trials being deployed in a pandemic. However, preparedness initiatives need to move faster and further if they are to effectively support clinical research initiatives. A survey of Research Ethics Committees and National Competent Authorities across European Member states found that the majority of respondents did not know of, or did not have, expedited review processes, and those that knew of such processes, were not aware of the standard operating procedure to follow if required to expedite review [

Clinical research contracts and local site agreements often create the greatest time delay and pragmatic, sensible legal and administrative solutions are required. Socio-political trends signifying a rise of populism and anti-science movements also need to be actively countered to build an engaged, informed and receptive public to participate and benefit from infectious disease clinical research. Funding models that allow for nimble shifting of funds and importantly for sustainability of infectious disease research initiatives are needed to meet the unpredictable challenges of infectious disease clinical research preparedness. New models of research governance that promote and foster co-operation and collaboration are also essential.
