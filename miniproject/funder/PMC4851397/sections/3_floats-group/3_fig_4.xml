  <title>Sea-level pressure conditions that characterized an epidemic year.</title>
  <p>A composite analysis was performed by separately averaging the SLP data for the years in which the highest (HIGH) and lowest (LOW) DF incidence were recorded in French Guiana. The contours (at 0.5Â°C intervals) show the HIGH minus the LOW differences in the SLP from July to December to illustrate the conditions that characterized a typical epidemic year. Filled-in areas indicate significant differences at the 5% confidence interval and were calculated using Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
