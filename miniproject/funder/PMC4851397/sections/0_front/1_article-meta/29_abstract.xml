 <title>Author Summary</title>
 <p>Climatic determinants are amongst the most frequently cited in studies aimed at understanding and explaining the dynamics of vector-borne infections, and dengue in particular. French Guiana, a French overseas territory in which the vector 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is well established, experiences an epidemic cycle of dengue with large and prolonged epidemics occurring approximately every 3 years. Dengue is one of the most prioritized infectious diseases, and it requires an intense mobilization of local public health authorities, health services, and health professional and vector control services. A specific surveillance, preparedness and response plan has been developed based upon these needs. Gaining an accurate understanding of the drivers of dengue transmission is required to develop a model to predict the risk of an epidemic and to plan activities aimed at controlling it. Here, we assessed the effects of climatic factors on dengue spread to develop a predictive model of the epidemics in French Guiana on a country-wide scale. The goal of the model is to anticipate and plan both preventive and control activities. Given climate conditions, the model predicts that a dengue epidemic is likely to occur in early 2016. These conditions, which are favorable for 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito proliferation, could also enhance the diffusion of other arboviruses, such as the Zika virus, in northeastern South America.
