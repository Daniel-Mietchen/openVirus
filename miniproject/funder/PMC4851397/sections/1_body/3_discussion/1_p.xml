<p>We investigated the relationship between climate and DF outbreaks in French Guiana to assess the possibility of including climate factors as predictors of epidemiological risk. Our findings highlighted a strong association between large-scale climate patterns and epidemic conditions in French Guiana. A simple and efficient statistical model was established to predict epidemic years. This model uses the summer Equatorial Pacific Ocean SST conditions six months prior to the mean onset month of the epidemic (July-1 –August-1) and the SLP of the Azores High three months prior (November-1), and it appropriately forecasted eight of the ten outbreaks that occurred in the 1991–2013 period. Outbreaks occurred after [i] warming in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean and [ii] northward displacement of the Azores High, which causes a rainfall deficit at the end of the dry season. This work refines the results of Gagnon et al. [
