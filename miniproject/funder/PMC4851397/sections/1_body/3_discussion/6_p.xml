<p>Future studies should attempt to validate hypotheses regarding the impact of the identified climate factors and associated meteorological patterns (i.e., the rainfall deficit at the end of the dry season) on direct measurements of vector behavior and breeding sites. Among other possible future developments, we plan to take into account the sub-country incidence of dengue to model the propagation of epidemics within the country.</p>
