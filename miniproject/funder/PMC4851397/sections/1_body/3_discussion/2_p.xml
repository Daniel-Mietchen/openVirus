<p>Warming events in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean are known to modify the mean climate over South America. During a warming phase, the northern region of the continent experiences drought conditions because the eastern subsidence of the Walker circulation is reinforced, which weakens convection and precipitation [

However, our analysis showed that anomalous SST patterns did not precisely correlate with El Niño events. Indeed, the SST anomalies of El Niño events were more intense in winter months. Importantly, certain epidemic years corresponded to strong (1997–1998) and moderate (1992, 2009–2010) El Niño events, although this association was not systematic. For example, an El Niño event did not occur from 2005–2006, but French Guiana did subsequently experience a dramatic epidemic.
