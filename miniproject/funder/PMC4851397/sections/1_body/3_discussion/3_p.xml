<p>In northern South America, rainfall is associated with water vapor that is transported from the north Atlantic via the northeasterly trade winds and thus from the SLP gradients. At the end of the dry season (Octoberâ€“November), the convergence of trade winds transports moisture over French Guiana, which fuels convection and precipitation. Positive SLP anomalies over the Azores High favor a northward position of the ITCZ over the Atlantic. Precipitation consequently decreases over the north part of South America in November.</p>
