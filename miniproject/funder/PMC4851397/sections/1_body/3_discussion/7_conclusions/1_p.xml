<p>Among the wide panel of factors that can influence DF outbreaks, these results suggest that large-scale climate factors play an important role. We found that the climatic indices that were assessed in this study were important for DF monitoring and for predicting outbreaks in French Guiana over a period of 2â€“3 months. This delay may give public health authorities the ability to anticipate outbreaks and implement social communication and vector control measures, and to adapt healthcare capacity and increase preparedness in a timely manner. Importantly, this model could be easily and regularly updated using newly collected data that was retrieved from the ongoing dengue surveillance system. Because the identified climate indicators are simple and easy to access, they could be used to estimate the probability of future epidemics occurring according to climate change simulations and help to evaluate the effectiveness of potential intervention strategies.</p>
