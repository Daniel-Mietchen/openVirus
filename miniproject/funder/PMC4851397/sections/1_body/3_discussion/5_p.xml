<p>Our findings indicate that an important rainfall deficit at the end of the dry season enhances the risk of epidemic in the following year, and these types of conditions are likely to impact the vector population. Two non-exclusive main hypotheses related to mosquito densities can be stated. First, the eggs of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, which is the only urban vector for DF in French Guiana, are known to be able to resist desiccation and to thereby survive dry episodes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. During a particularly dry season, the majority of the breeding sites dry up, but when the first rains of the wet season occur, their breeding sites are once again hydrated, and their eggs hatch synchronously, resulting in a rough proliferation of adult mosquitoes that is favorable to the emergence of an epidemic via to their introduction to infectious patients. The second hypothesis is related to human behaviors. Although precipitation is known to contribute to the multiplication of breeding sites, drought can also indirectly expand the vector’s range. Indeed, during pronounced dry seasons, some people may adapt their lifestyles by maintaining additional water-collection containers. Thus, because of increases in breeding sites around and within households, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> can maintain significant background densities during the dry season. As a consequence, the virus can remain in the area during the dry season, leading to a higher potential of an epidemic when the wet season returns. Further entomological field investigations should be performed to test these hypotheses. The evolution of the surveillance system that was used for data collection beginning in 2006, following the introduction of new laboratories and new methods of diagnosis, increased the difficulty of performing meaningful comparisons of the scope of epidemics, particularly those that occurred before 2006. It is also important to take the circulating serotypes into consideration to enhance the assessment of the model’s predictions. Circulating serotypes that have affected only a small portion of the population before the predicted year could play a role by increasing the transmission risk, given the size of the susceptible population. Conversely, serotypes that have recently caused epidemics could limit the transmission risk despite propitious climatic conditions. In this study, we explored the reason that the model wrongly predicted certain epidemiological situations looking at the predominant serotypes. Two of the four years that were wrongly predicted could be explained by the serotypes circulating during the previous year. In 1999, for which the model erroneously predicted an epidemic, both circulating serotypes (DENV1 and DENV4) had already caused epidemics in 1997 and 1998. In addition, the 2001 epidemic, which was not predicted by the model, was caused by DENV3, which had not caused an epidemic in the ten previous years. Other well-known factors that might play a key role in transmission, including the immune status of the host population or the presence of outbreaks in neighboring countries, were not included in the present analysis. Finally, considering the potential competitive viral suppression in vectors that can be caused by co-infections, the emergence of new viruses that can also be transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in French Guiana, such as the Zika virus, could limit the transmission of dengue fever. It will be interesting to see how the emergence of the Zika virus in 2016 may interacts with dengue fever transmission in a propitious climatic context.
