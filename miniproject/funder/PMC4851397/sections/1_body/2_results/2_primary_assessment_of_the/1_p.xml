<p>Spearman’s lagged correlations indicated the presence of associations between DF and monthly pre-epidemic climate factors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004681.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Among El Niño indicators, the Niño 3 area index showed the highest correspondence with DF. A significant negative correlation was observed between DF and rainfall in October (r = -0.49, p-value = 0.02) and November (r = -0.52, p-value = 0.01), which are one and three months before the mean onset of the epidemics, respectively. El Niño event-related indices and temperatures were not significantly associated with DF (p-value &gt; 0.05). However, an interesting, persistent, positive and nearly significant correlation was observed between the Niño 3 area index and DF during the summer months, and this relationship deserves further investigation.
