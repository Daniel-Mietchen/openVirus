<p>Forecasts for 2014 and 2015 (not included in the training dataset) indicated that the model predictions were consistent with the non-epidemic conditions that were observed in French Guiana (the DF IR/100 000 inhabitants was 350 in 2014 and 106 for January to September, 2015) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In 2016, as a result of the warm SST conditions over the Equatorial Pacific Ocean that occurred in August and July (25.26Â°C) and the high pressures over the Azores High in November (1021.36 hPa), the model predicted that French Guiana would likely experience an outbreak (probability of 0.92).
