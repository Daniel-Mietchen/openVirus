<p>The multivariate model that included the two predictors EPO-JA-SST and AH-N-SLP yielded the best results for the AIC (27) and AUC (0.88), which suggested that it had good predictive value. Warming in the mean Equatorial Pacific Ocean SST in July–August and the strengthening of the Azores High in November greatly increased the probability that an outbreak would occur in the following year in French Guiana (

Outbreaks in the years 2001 and 2005 were incorrectly predicted to be non-epidemic, and two years were predicted as false alarms (1994 and 1999). Finally, the LOOCV δ of 0.18 indicates that the model was robust and that only 18% of the years were misclassified when the LOOCV procedure was used. Yearly cross-validated probabilities are shown in
