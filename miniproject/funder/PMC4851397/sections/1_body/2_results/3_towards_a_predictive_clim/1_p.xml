<p>Based on previous results, the following climate indices were included in logistic binomial univariate and multivariate models (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): (1) October–November, mean rainfall in French Guiana (FG-ON-RAIN); (2) July–August, mean Equatorial Pacific Ocean (2° N-20°S, 135°W-90°W) SST (EPO-JA-SST); and (3) November, Azores High (45°N-35°N, 40°W-20°W) SLP (AH-N-SLP). Because previous SST and SLP indices were found to be associated with rainfall in French Guiana, their common association in the same model was discarded.
