<p>The year-to-year variability in DF incidence rates in French Guiana was described over a 23-year period from 1991–2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004681.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The monthly mean cycle of DF standardized anomalies showed that there was strong seasonality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004681.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The mean onset of the high incidence period was in January (positive anomalies) during the short rainy season. DF case peaks generally occurred in March, and the anomalies then decreased until May (negative in June). The high incidence period was therefore defined as January–May. Eight major outbreaks (third tercile) were identified: 1992, 1997, 1998, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013 (
