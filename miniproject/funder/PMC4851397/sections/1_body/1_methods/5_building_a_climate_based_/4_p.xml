<p>Second, a cross-validation on chunks of multiple years was performed to measure the model stability. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) (i.e. 23-fold) was used. The model was refitted according to the number of observations, and the observations were then temporarily removed one by one. The resulting LOOCV Î´ was the cross-validation estimate of prediction error.</p>
