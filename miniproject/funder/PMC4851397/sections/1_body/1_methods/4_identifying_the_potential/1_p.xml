 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Different El Niño-related SST and sea level pressure (SLP) indices were tested, including Niño areas 1 to 4, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the multivariate ENSO index (MEI). Yearly DF incidences were correlated with the monthly climate data for each month in the preceding year.
