<p>Second, the relationships between DF outbreaks and large-scale atmospheric and oceanic parameters were assessed using a composite analysis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and following an exploratory approach. The composite method was used to identify the conditions that characterized a typical epidemic year and to assess the optimal indices to use to analyze DF outbreak predictions. Two samples (the composites) were built that contained the climate data for both epidemic and non-epidemic years. The differences between the means of the two samples were calculated at each grid point between 50°N-50°S and 150°W-0°E. The significance of the differences between the epidemic and non-epidemic years was assessed using Student’s
