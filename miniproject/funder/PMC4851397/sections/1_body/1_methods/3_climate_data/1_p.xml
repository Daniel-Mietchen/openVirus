<p>We used sets of meteorological parameters and large-scale atmospheric and global SST data for 1990–2013 for this study. Meteorological records included rainfall, temperature and relative humidity and were obtained from Météo-France. We calculated monthly country means from these daily station data throughout the study period. A set of atmospheric and SST predictors was constructed from the ERA-Interim reanalysis data that were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts [
