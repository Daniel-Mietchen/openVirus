<p>French Guiana is an overseas region of France that is located in northern South America between Brazil and Surinam. The climate is equatorial, hot and wet. The monthly mean temperatures (near 27°C) and relative humidity, which rarely falls below 80%, are nearly constant year-round. Spatial variations across the territory, particularly in the coastal area (regrouping 90% of the population), are low. Among meteorological parameters, only rainfall presents significant seasonal variations influenced by the migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The mean annual cumulative rainfall is approximately three meters, and there are four alternating seasons: a long rainy season from the beginning of April to mid-July, a long dry season from mid-July to mid-November, a short rainy season from mid-November to mid-February, and a shorter dry season from mid-February to the beginning of April. Large inter-annual variations in the total cumulated rainfall have been observed, and they are partly governed by large-scale atmospheric and oceanic patterns. A well-documented issue is the impact of El Niño conditions. During El Niño (La Niña) years, a rainfall deficit (surplus) occurs in French Guiana [
