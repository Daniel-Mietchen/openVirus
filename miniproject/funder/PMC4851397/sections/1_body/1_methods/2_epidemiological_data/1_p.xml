<p>Epidemiologic data on DF were obtained from two different sources, depending on the collection period. For the data from 1991–2006, a surveillance system was used, and data were based on a weekly census of biologically confirmed cases (BCCs) that were recorded by the Arbovirus National Reference Centre, which is based at the Pasteur Institute of French Guiana. In 2006, a multi-source surveillance system was implemented by the Regional Epidemiology Unit of the Institut de Veille Sanitaire that included all seven biological laboratories (public hospital and private laboratories) that are located in the coastal area. Concurrently, in 2006, a new dengue diagnostic test based on NS1 antigen detection was made available to all laboratories, and it contributed substantially to improving surveillance. Cases were biologically confirmed by isolating the virus and detecting viral RNA using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR), NS1 antigen detection methods or serological tests that are based on an immunoglobulin M (IgM)-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) [

The DF incidence rates in French Guiana, which are defined as the yearly number of cases/100 000 inhabitants, were calculated for the 1991–2013 period. A standardization procedure was performed separately for the 1991 –April 2006 and May 2006–2013 periods. For this procedure, we used a z-score scaling method to take into account the improvement in the epidemiological surveillance system that was observed in April 2006. This approach led to a trend toward increasing numbers of cases and enabled us to work with a single dataset. The standardization was calculated using the following equation:

The epidemic years were identified by applying the tercile method to the normalized and standardized sum of the monthly cases that occurred during the high incidence period. The first tercile was defined as the “low” incidence group, the second was defined as the “intermediate” incidence group, and the third was defined as the “high” incidence group.
