 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Infection is caused by the dengue virus (DENV), which has four closely related serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that are transmitted to humans by infected 
 <italic>Aedes sp</italic>. mosquitos. Infection produces a spectrum of illnesses that range from indiscernible or mildly nonspecific febrile syndrome to severe disease forms, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Currently, there are no specific dengue therapeutics, and prevention strategies are limited to vector control measures [
