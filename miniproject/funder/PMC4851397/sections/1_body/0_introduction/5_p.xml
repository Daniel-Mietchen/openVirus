<p>Thus, even if associations between El Ni√±o conditions, meteorology and DF epidemics are suspected, there is currently no climate-based model to assist in developing an early warning system in French Guiana. Based on the 
 <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis put forward in Gagnon et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the current study explores the potential of integrating sea surface temperature (SST) conditions to serve as a proxy for epidemic risk several months before the onset of a DF outbreak. In addition, we push our analysis further by also investigating the use of large-scale atmospheric circulation and regional climate patterns as more optimal indicators for predicting outbreaks. Using a long-term epidemiological surveillance dataset, this study explores the possibility of using a predictive model to assist public health authorities in implementing timely, appropriate and efficient prevention and mitigation strategies.
