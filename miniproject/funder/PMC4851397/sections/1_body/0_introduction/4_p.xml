<p>Interactions between climate and DF outbreaks have been studied worldwide [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The findings of these studies suggest that the effects of climate parameters on the incidence of DF can vary widely from one study site to another [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and that they depend largely on local context and epidemiological patterns. In South America, studies designed to determine the impact of climate on DF epidemics have suggested a role for El Niño events as triggers for epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. El Niño conditions are likely to influence DF dynamics indirectly by modulating temperature, humidity and rainfall. In French Guiana, the sole study that focused on the DF-climate relationship identified a synchronous positive association between the occurrence of El Niño events, warmer temperatures, less abundant rainfall and dengue epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004681.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These results were obtained using basic analytical methods, and the study investigated El Niño conditions on a coarse annual scale. These results must be explored further, particularly if they are to be useful for prediction purposes. Moreover, the quality of epidemiological data (i.e., estimated suspected cases) that were available for the period covered by the study (1963–1993) was highly questionable.
