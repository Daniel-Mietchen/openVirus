  <title>Mice have high tissue viral loads 7 days post infection.</title>
  <p>Mice were infected with 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV, euthanized at day seven (young) or day eight (adult), and tissue viral loads were determined by qRT-PCR as described in the text. Closed symbols indicate young mice (n = 3), open symbols indicate adult mice (n = 4), and the dotted line represents the limit of detection for the assay.
