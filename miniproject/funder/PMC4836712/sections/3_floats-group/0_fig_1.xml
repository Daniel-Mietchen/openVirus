  <title>ZIKV causes mortality and morbidity in AG129 mice.</title>
  <p>Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate the susceptibility of AG129 mice to ZIKV. Young mice were inoculated f.p. with several doses (n = 3 for doses 10
   <sup>5</sup>−10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU and n = 6 for doses 10 and 1 PFU; 10
   <sup>2</sup> PFU was done as two separate independent replicates with n = 3 for each) of ZIKV (
   <bold>A</bold>). All mice challenged with 10
   <sup>4</sup>−1 PFU succumbed 8 d PI. Young (n = 4) and adult mice (n = 6) were inoculated f.p. with 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV (
   <bold>B</bold>). Mice were monitored until day 10 PI. Changes in weight were calculated daily for ZIKV- and mock-infected mice (
   <bold>C</bold>). Error bars represent standard error of the mean.
