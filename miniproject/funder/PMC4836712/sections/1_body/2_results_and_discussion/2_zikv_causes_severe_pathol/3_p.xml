<p>ZIKV was first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in Uganda in 1947 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and 20 years later isolated from humans in Nigeria. Since then, the virus has spread to other regions of the world, and now ZIKV has become an emerging global health problem due to recent outbreaks in Micronesia, French Polynesia, Cook Island, Easter Island, and presently the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, other than its phylogenetic relationship to other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, with few exceptions [e.g., 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], no information is known about molecular mechanisms controlling ZIKV virulence and pathogenesis. Progress with understanding ZIKV pathogenesis has been lacking for myriad reasons, primary among them is the absence of a small animal model that does not rely on intracerebral inoculation of the virus. Similar to what has been demonstrated for DENV in wildtype mice, we postulate that ZIKV proteins likely cannot bind and degrade the homologs for STING [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and STAT-2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; therefore, ZIKV-infected wildtype mice induce efficient IFN-α/β responses that prevent ZIKV replication. Here, we report that ZIKV is capable of causing morbidity and mortality in mice lacking IFN-α/β and IFN-Ɣ receptors. Although, AG129 mice may not perfectly model ZIKV infection of humans, we believe they will be valuable for studying the virulence/attenuation of ZIKV and developing hypotheses to be tested in focused non-human primate studies. In fact, AG129 mice have been useful to study dengue because they experience a vascular leak-like syndrome with features reminiscent of severe dengue disease in humans (e.g., high viral load and soluble NS1 levels, low platelet count, high TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 levels) and display DENV tropism similar to what has been observed in humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, they also will be useful for testing potential vaccines and antiviral compounds against ZIKV, because even though they lack a functional interferon response, AG129 mice do develop normal humoral and cellular T cell responses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. AG129 have been used for numerous vaccine, antiviral, and supportive therapy studies [e.g., 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. While improving animal models for ZIKV will be a major challenge moving forward, this model can be used for a number of applications, as long as the specific characteristics of the model are kept in mind and considered in the context of the questions being asked.
