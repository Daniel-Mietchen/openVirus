<p>In order to characterize ZIKV-induced disease further, we measured viral titer in serum from young AG129 mice infected with 10
 <sup>5</sup>, 10
 <sup>3</sup>, and 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU of ZIKV and adult AG129 mice infected with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004682.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In young mice, viral titer in the serum was observed to peak on day two in all animals infected with ZIKV. No significant differences in viral titers were observed between inoculum doses (p&gt;0.05). In adult mice, viral titer in the serum also peaked on day two and there was no significant difference in viral titers between young and old mice (p&gt;0.05). We also attempted to determine systemic spread of the virus using qRT-PCR. In the absence of type I and II IFN responses, infection with ZIKV led to rapid viral dissemination, most likely by infecting and commandeering migratory dendritic cells and/or macrophages, as has been reported for ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and other flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Viral loads were high in all tissues and were comparable between young and old mice receiving 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004682.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The highest viral loads were observed in brains from young mice (e.g., one mouse had 11.69 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral copies/g in the brain). Because the animals were not perfused with phosphate-buffered saline prior to tissue collection, some virus detection may be from blood; however, no detectable serum viremia was observed in mice after six days PI.
