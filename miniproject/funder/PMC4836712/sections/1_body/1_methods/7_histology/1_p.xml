<p>At the time of necropsy, liver, spleen, brain, kidney, intestine, heart, skeletal muscle and lung from four mice for biological replicate one and five mice for biological replicate two were harvested and immediately fixed for 16â€“24 hours in 10% paraformaldehyde. Tissues for paraffin embedding were submitted to the Histology Laboratory at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where they were processed and sectioned before staining with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E). Sections were viewed from ZIKV-infected and mock-infected samples and slides were analyzed for histopathological changes. H&amp;E-stained sections were viewed by light microscopy.</p>
