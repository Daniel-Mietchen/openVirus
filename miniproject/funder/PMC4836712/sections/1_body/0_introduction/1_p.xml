 <italic>Zika virus</italic> (ZIKV; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) has emerged out of Africa and caused outbreaks of febrile disease in Yap islands of the Federated states of Micronesia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], French Polynesia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and Oceania; and in late 2015 Brazil reported the first known local transmission of ZIKV in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The current outbreak in the Americas is cause for great concern because ZIKV appears to be spreading nearly uncontrolled with at least 24 countries and territories experiencing autochthonous spread, including Puerto Rico. Eventual local spread in the southern United States seems inevitable. Clinically, infection with ZIKV resembles dengue fever and several other arboviral diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but has been linked to neurological syndromes and congenital malformation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Alarmingly, the rate of microcephaly (small head, reduced brain size, impaired neurocognitive development) in infants born to pregnant women has increased significantly (20-fold in 2015) in areas with high ZIKV incidence in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that ZIKV infection may be causing this and other birth defects [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; resulting in numerous CDC travel advisories and several countries recommending women delay pregnancy for up to two years. Prior to this, ZIKV existed in relative obscurity with only sporadic human infections until the end of the last century [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The virus is believed to have originated in Africa, where it still circulates enzootically among unknown vertebrate hosts (presumably nonhuman primates), and is transmitted by arboreal 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These cycles lead to sporadic outbreaks of spillover infection in Africa, but most human cases around the globe result from ZIKV emergence into a human-mosquito cycle involving 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and/or other urban or peri-urban 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, e.g., 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes hensilli</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004682.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite the continued spread of the virus, there remain no effective antiviral therapies or licensed vaccines.
