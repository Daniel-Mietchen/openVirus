  <p>Saliva from 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Los Angeles, CA, USA, infected with either MA66, PR15, or BR15 ZIKV was collected in capillary tubes 14 (MA66 and PR15) or 15 (BR15) dpf. Vero cell plaque assays were performed on RT-qPCR positive saliva expectorants to quantify infectious viruses. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 2.3 PFU and is shown as a dashed line. Dots below the dashed line represent saliva samples with no detectable plaques.
