   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> from Los Angeles ingested blood from viremic ZIKV-infected interferon receptor deficient mice that had been inoculated with different ZIKV strains. Each colored box represents an individual mosquito sample showing the magnitude of ZIKV RNA detected in each body (B), legs+wings (LW), and saliva (S). The red to blue color scale shows high (red) to low (blue) ZIKV RNA levels. Samples with no detectable ZIKV RNA are colored white. ZIKV BR15-infected mosquitoes were not tested 21 dpf.
