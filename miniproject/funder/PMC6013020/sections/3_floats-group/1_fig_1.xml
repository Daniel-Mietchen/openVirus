  <title>Infecting (bodies), disseminating (legs+wings) and transmitted (saliva) ZIKV RNA levels 14 or 15 days after 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> orally ingested one of three Asian lineage ZIKV strains.

  <p>Each dot represents the mean log
   <sub>10</sub> ZIKV genome copies per tissue or saliva sample from an individual 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic>. 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> from Los Angeles, California, USA, were fed on viremic mice infected with ZIKV from Malaysia 1966 (MA66), Puerto Rico 2015 (PR15) or Brazil 2015 (BR15). Mosquitoes exposed to BR15 were assayed 15 dpf, MA66 and PR15 cohorts were assayed 14 dpf. Each dot represents the mean of two or more RT-qPCR technical replicates. The dashed lines represent the limits of detection (LOD). Dots below dashed line represent tested samples with an undetectable Ct or a Ct value of &gt;38. The LOD for saliva was lower than for tissues because RNA was extracted from a higher proportion of the saliva sample volume. Asterisks show significant differences in means across groups of the same tissue type, 
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01, ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc test. No asterisk indicates no significant difference across groups.
