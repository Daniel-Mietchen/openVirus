<p>To confirm infectivity and measure the transmitted ZIKV dose, plaque assays were performed on 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> saliva collected 14 or 15 dpf to enumerate infectious ZIKV in Vero cell plaque forming units (PFU). Out of 45 RTq-PCR positive saliva samples that were tested by plaque assay, 32 (71%) yielded at least 1 detectable plaque. The expectorated PFU varied by viral strain: the MA66-infected individuals transmitted 13±4 PFU (mean±SE, N = 13) compared to 29±6 for PR15 (N = 13) and 35±8 for BR15 (N = 6; ANOVA, df = 2, F = 3.8,
