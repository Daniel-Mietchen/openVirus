<p>Mice were inoculated with 5 log
 <sub>10</sub> Vero plaque forming units (PFU) of ZIKV via subcutaneous injection. ZIKV-infected mice were presented to mosquitoes 2 days post-inoculation, at peak viremia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006524.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Mice were anesthetized prior to mosquito exposure with a ketamine (VETone Zetamine CIII, 75 mg/kg), xylazine (AnaSed, 10 mg/kg), and acepromazine (AceproJect, 1 mg/kg) solution administered intraperitoneally. The ZIKV viremia in each mouse was determined by Vero cell plaque assay from 30 μL of whole blood collected immediately prior to the mosquito feed. Viremic mice were presented for two cohorts of adult female mosquitoes 30–60 minutes on one of three arrangements depending on species: (1) 25

All mosquitoes had constant access to 10% sucrose before and after blood-feeding, except during a 24-hour starvation period prior to presentation of the viremic mice. At days 14 and 21 post bloodfeed, mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized at -20°C for 5 minutes and then legs and wings were removed with forceps while immobilized on ice. Saliva was collected by inserting the proboscis into a capillary tube containing fetal bovine serum (FBS, GenClone) for 20 minutes. Individual bodies, legs+wings, and the saliva sample from each mosquito were stored separately in 2 mL tubes containing a 5 mm glass bead and 250 μL Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 50μg/mL of penicillin/streptomycin and 20% FBS. All samples were stored at -80°C until further processing.
