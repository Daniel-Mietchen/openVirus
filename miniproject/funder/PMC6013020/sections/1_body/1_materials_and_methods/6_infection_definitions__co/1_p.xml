<p>In this study, we calculated infection rates as the number of RT-qPCR positive individual bodies divided by the number of individuals that ingested blood and were tested, dissemination rates as the number of RT-qPCR positive pooled leg &amp; wing sets from each individual divided by the number of individuals that ingested blood and were tested, and transmission rates as the number of RT-qPCR positive saliva samples divided by the total number of individuals that ingested blood and were tested. For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic>, multiple cohorts of the same species fed on different mice infected with the same ZIKV strain with slight (≤1 log
 <sub>10</sub>) variations in viremias. Preliminary analysis across same-species cohorts that fed on different mice infected with the same ZIKV strain revealed no significant differences (Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) in infection, dissemination and transmission rates. We therefore combined the data presented for each ZIKV strain for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic>, while also reporting the magnitudes of viremia in all mice (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006524.t001">Table 1</xref>). Comparisons of ZIKV RNA levels and PFU in saliva samples between ZIKV strains was performed using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for pairwise comparisons (reported as 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>adj</sub>) and ZIKV RNA detection rates were compared using two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests (scipy.stats). Data were plotted using matplotlib (Python).
