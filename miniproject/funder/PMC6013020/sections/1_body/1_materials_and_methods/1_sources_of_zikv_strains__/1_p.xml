<p>Three Asian-lineage strains of ZIKV were used in our experiments. A 2015 Puerto Rican strain was isolated from human serum in 2015 (PR15, PRVABC59), passaged 4 times in Vero cells, and sequenced. The coding sequence for the complete genome of the passaged we used was identical to GenBank accession number KX601168. An Asian-lineage Malaysian ZIKV strain isolated from

 <xref rid="pntd.0006524.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) that had been passaged in suckling mouse brains 6 times and once in Vero cells before it was received from the Centers for Disease Control was passaged once more in Vero cells. The complete coding genome sequence of our passage of MA66 was 100% identical to GenBank accession number KX601167.1. A Brazilian strain isolated from human serum in 2015 (BR15, SPH2015) was passaged 3 times in Vero cells and sequenced. The complete genome coding sequence of BR15 was identical to GenBank accession number KU321639. Strains MA66 and PR15 were obtained from Dr. Aaron Brault at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort Collins, Colorado. Dr. Mike Busch at Blood Systems Research Institute, San Francisco, CA, provided the BR15 strain. All ZIKV strains and their source Vero cells were confirmed mycoplasma negative by PCR according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions (Agilent Mycoplasma Plus PCR Primer Kit, Santa Rosa, CA.)
