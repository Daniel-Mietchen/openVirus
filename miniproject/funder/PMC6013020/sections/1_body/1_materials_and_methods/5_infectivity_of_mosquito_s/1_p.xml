<p>To estimate infectious ZIKV in expectorated 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> saliva, viral titrations were performed on a random sample of RT-qPCR-positive saliva samples at the second or third thaw in Vero cell culture by plaque assay. In brief, cell monolayers were inoculated with 110 μL of undilute saliva from individual mosquitoes mixed with DMEM containing 2% (vol/vol) FBS, and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. After a one hour incubation period to allow for viral infection of cells, 0.8% agarose/DMEM was added to cover the cells. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 8 days. The cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.05% crystal violet. Plaques were visualized as holes in the Vero cell monolayer and counted to determine PFU values. The limit of detection of the assay was 2.3 PFU where 110 μL of the total saliva sample (250 μL) was inoculated directly onto the cells. Since the volume of saliva was limited, each sample was tested in just 1 replicate.
