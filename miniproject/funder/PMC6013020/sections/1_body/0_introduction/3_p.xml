<p>Previous studies demonstrate that ZIKV vector competence is more complex than simple mosquito species-level designations, and thus region-specific mosquito genotypes and multiple ZIKV strains must be evaluated to assess region-specific vector competence. For example, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypt</italic>i from the Dominican Republic transmit ZIKV isolated from Cambodia in 2010 (FSS 13025) and Mexico in 2015 (MEX1-7) more effectively than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Salvador, Brazil [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Singapore [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006524.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The source of virus also matters; fresh ZIKV was more infectious in comparative studies than freeze-thawed virus [
