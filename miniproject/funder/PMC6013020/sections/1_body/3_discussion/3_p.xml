<p>A possible explanation for the lower transmissibility of MA66 at 14 dpf is that it lacks a A188V mutation in the NS1 gene that both PR15 and BR15 possess, which has been linked to higher infectivity (where infectivity can influence transmissibility) in mosquitoes when interferon-deficient mice are used for blood-feeding [
