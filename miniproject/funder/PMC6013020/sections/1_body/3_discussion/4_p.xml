<p>Among ZIKV MA66-infected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, we observed that mosquitoes with low RNA copy numbers in bodies were less likely to transmit than those with infections that exceeded 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> genomes per body. This pattern is consistent with the presence of a midgut barrier to infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006524.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In that case, the mosquitoes with low body RNA levels represent infections that have not escaped the midgut while mosquitoes with high body RNA levels correspond to individuals with ZIKV that has disseminated to secondary amplification tissues.
