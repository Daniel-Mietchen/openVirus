<p>This laboratory vector competence study confirmed that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Los Angeles, California, USA, can transmit Asian lineage ZIKV and that 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tarsalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> are inefficient ZIKV vectors. Given that 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are poor ZIKV vectors and seek primarily non-human hosts, they are unlikely to facilitate a ZIKV outbreak. Thus, vector control efforts targeting ZIKV should remain focused on reducing urban 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations.
