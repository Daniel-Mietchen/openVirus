Underreporting of HBV and HCV infections has long been identified as a problem. Few reports have described the accuracy of state surveillance case registries for recording clinically-confirmed cases of HBV and HCV infections, or the characteristics of populations associated with lower rates of reporting.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Objective</title><p>The primary objective of the current study is to estimate the proportion of HBV and HCV infections that went unreported to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDoH), among patients in the Geisinger Health System of Pennsylvania. As a secondary objective, we study the association between underreporting of HBV and HCV infections to PDoH, and the select patient characteristics of interest: sex, age group, race/ethnicity, rural status, and year of initial diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Design</title><p>Per medical record review, the study population was limited to Geisinger Health System patients, residing in Pennsylvania, who were diagnosed with a chronic HBV and/or HCV infection, between 2001 and 2015. Geisinger Health System patient medical records were matched to surveillance records of confirmed cases reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDoH). To quantify the extent that underreporting occurred among the Geisinger Health System study participants, we calculated the proportion of study participants that were not reported to PDoH as confirmed cases of HBV or HCV infections. An analysis of adjusted prevalence ratio estimates was conducted to study the association between underreporting of HBV and HCV infections to PDoH, and the select patient characteristics of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>Geisinger Health System patients living with HBV were reported to PDoH 88.4% (152 of 172) of the time; patients living with HCV were reported to PDoH 94.6% (2,257 of 2,386) of the time; and patients who were co-infected with both viruses were reported to PDoH 72.0% (18 of 25) of the time. Patients living with HCV had an increased likelihood of being reported if they were: less than or equal to age 30 vs ages 65+ {PR = 1.2, [95%CI, (1.1, 1.3)]}, and if they received their initial diagnosis of HCV during the 2010&#x02013;2015 time period vs the 1990&#x02013;1999 time period {PR = 1.08, [95%CI, (1.05, 1.12)]}.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings in this study are promising, and suggests that PDoH has largely been successful with tracking and monitoring viral hepatitis B and C infections, among persons that were tested for HBV and/or HCV. Additional efforts should be placed on decreasing underreporting rates of HCV infections among seniors (ages 65 and over), and persons who are co-infected with HBV and HCV.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Pennsylvania Department of Health co-authors do not have any financial interests or relationships to disclose.

Viral hepatitis B and C infections are often characterized as silent epidemics, to some extent, because the majority of the persons infected with HBV or HCV are not aware that they are infected until they are screened for the virus, or until their liver disease progresses to cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several years later. Together, HBV and HCV infections are the leading causes of death from cirrhosis and HCC [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The high burden of HBV infections in the United States, is largely due to the migration of foreign-born persons from HBV endemic countries. Persons living with HBV in the United States are largely foreign born and may account for as many as 50% - 70% of HBV infections in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In spite of routine childhood vaccination and targeted vaccination of at-risk populations, the prevalence of HBV infections in the United States has not seen a significant decrease in the 21<sup>st</sup> century [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The high burden of HCV infections in the United States, in part, is due to the increasing rates of injection drug use among young adults who reside in suburban and rural communities. Recent advances in the treatment of HBV and HCV infections has fostered hope that these infections can eventually be eliminated from the US population.</p><p>Both viruses can cause either acute infection or chronic infection, a distinction that is important to both clinicians and public health officials. Acute HBV and HCV infections, are short term illnesses that occurs within six months of being exposed to the HBV and HCV, respectively. A large percentage of persons (75% - 85%) infected with HCV, will not clear the virus, and will develop a chronic HCV infection [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A small percentage (5%) of persons infected with HBV, will not clear the virus, and will develop a chronic HBV infection [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although chronic HBV and HCV infections account for 99% of all viral hepatitis infections in the United States, chronic HBV is only reportable in 46 states and chronic HCV in only 41 states [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Conversely, acute (new) HBV and HCV infections that meet the CDC/CSTE case definitions are reportable conditions in every state.

Underreporting of these infections to state health departments and then to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has complicated the understanding of the true viral hepatitis infectious disease burden. Estimation of viral hepatitis prevalence, incidence, and mortality has been complicated by the inability in most instances to correct for the bias caused by underreporting of these infections. Reporting of viral hepatitis infections has been severely limited by lack of resources and manpower at the local level necessary for evaluation of laboratory reports, and follow-up of reports to complete case reporting [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such efforts are labor-intensive for public health department staff, as, for example, an average of four documents per case need to be evaluated to distinguish between acute, resolved, or chronic HCV case status [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Laboratory reports can be electronically transmitted or manually entered by local health departments, clinical providers, infection control personnel, or laboratories. PDoH began receiving electronic laboratory reports, during 2005. Once a HBV or HCV laboratory report is entered into PA-NEDSS, it is assigned to a public health expert for review. The reviewer conducts an investigation, consistent with the Pennsylvania viral hepatitis protocol for ascertaining if the infection meets the CDC/CSTE criteria for an acute/chronic HBV infection, or an acute/chronic HCV infection. PDoH employs several data quality strategies to ensure that duplicate laboratory reports are assigned to an unique state-assigned case identifier number.</p><p>In total, medical records for 2,533 study participants were merged with surveillance data records stored in PA-NEDSS. Data cleaning, standardization and extracting fields of interests were performed to prepare for matching. Data variables used in the matching process were the patient&#x02019;s: first and last names; date of birth, zip code, street address, and city of residence.

Further, none of the select patient characteristics: gender, age group, race/ethnicity, rural-urban classification, or initial_diagnosis_year, were found to be statistically associated with a HBV infected patient&#x02019;s infection going unreported to PDoH (<xref rid="pone.0217455.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Geisinger Health System patients living with HCV were reported to PDoH, 94.6% (2,257 of 2,386) of the time (<xref rid="pone.0217455.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The adjusted percentage of Geisinger Health System patients living with HCV that were reported to PDoH, was also 94.6% (<xref rid="pone.0217455.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Patients under the age of 31, had the highest reporting rate, with only 3.5% of their infections unaccounted for in the state registry (PA-NEDSS). Although HCV underreporting rates were minimal, when compared to adults &#x0003c; age 31 (adults whom were at least 65 years old), were 20% less likely to have their HCV infections reported to PDoH (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.2, [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 1.3]) (<xref rid="pone.0217455.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Underreporting of HCV infections, initially diagnosed during the 1990&#x02013;1999 time period, was more problematic. Geisinger Health System patients, initially diagnosed during 1990&#x02013;1999, were 8% less likely to have their HCV infections reported to PDoH, when compared to patients initially diagnosed during 2010&#x02013;2015, (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.08, [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.12]). (<xref rid="pone.0217455.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Geisinger Health System patients who were co-infected with both viruses (n = 25), were reported to PDoH, 72.0% (18 of 25) of the time. Male patients living with both viruses, were just as likely as female patients to go unreported to PDoH (P-value = 0.3408).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the United States, all persons who test positive for HBV or HCV infections, should be reported to their state health departments to facilitate more precise measurements of the true burden of HBV and/or HCV infections. In Pennsylvania, all persons who test positive for HBV or HCV infections, must be reported to PDoH, cited in 28 Pa. Code &#x000a7; 27.21a. Prior to this study, very little was known about the extent that underreporting of HBV or HCV infections occurred in Pennsylvania. In this study, the assessment of underreporting was limited to Geisinger Health System patients whom were residents of Pennsylvania, enrolled as CHeCS participants, and diagnosed with a chronic HBV or HCV infection between 2001 and 2015. All of these patients should have been accounted for in the Pennsylvania viral hepatitis state registry (PA-NEDSS).</p><p>Based on the findings of this study, we concluded that 11.6% and 5.4% of the chronic HBV and HCV infections, went unreported to PDoH, respectively. This suggests that PDoH and public health providers in Pennsylvania were largely successful with registering HBV and HCV infections in PA-NEDSS, with respect to persons who tested positive for HBV or HCV infections. Findings from a similar CHeCS cohort of patients in Michigan, concluded that 18.0% and 35.0% of chronic HBV and/or HCV infections went unreported to the Michigan Department of Health, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The differences in the underreporting rates, may be due to the inherent differences in the state populations, and viral hepatitis surveillance practices. Underreporting was more substantial among patients that were living with both viruses, with 28.0% going unreported to PDoH. This suggests that PDoH and public health providers in Pennsylvania were less successful among persons who tested positive for both viruses. HBV and HCV co-infections are generally associated with increased risk of severe liver disease and liver cancer [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The lower reporting rate, among persons infected with both viruses, may be due to confusion surrounding how state investigators should have classified those infections. The CDC/CSTE case definitions do not address HBV and HCV coinfections.</p><p>As it pertains to secondary objective of this study: we concluded that the association between the select patient characteristics and underreporting of HBV infections to PDoH, was not statistically significant. However, underreporting of chronic HCV infections was more problematic among seniors (ages 65 and over), with 20.6% of the seniors living with HCV going unreported to PDoH. The Pennsylvania Hepatitis C Screening Act 87 (PA-HCV 87), enacted in 2016, will help decrease the underreporting of HCV infections to PDoH, among the baby boomer generation, persons born between 1945 and 1965 [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Subsequently, as Pennsylvania&#x02019;s baby boomer population continue to age, PA-HCV 87 will also have a more impactful role in decreasing underreporting of seniors, ages 65 and over. The baby boomer population accounts for 75.0% of chronic viral hepatitis infections, in the United States [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Underreporting of chronic HCV infections was also problematic among Geisinger Health System patients initially diagnosed with a HCV infection during 1990&#x02013;1999. CDC and CSTE have made substantial progress since the 1990s to standardize the viral hepatitis case definitions for viral hepatitis infections, and computerized reporting via the National Electronic Transmission Surveillance System (NETSS), and the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The 1990s also correspond to a time-period when viral hepatitis infections were reported to state health departments largely by transmitting case reports via telephone faxes or US mail. The low reporting rates in the 1990s, may also reflect the inefficiency in reporting HBV and HCV infections during that time period. The increased utilization of electronic laboratory reporting systems (ELR), coincides with significant increases in funding to state health departments, via the CDC Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity co-operative agreement, since 1995 [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the findings in this Pennsylvania based-study are promising, but do not account for underreporting among Pennsylvania&#x02019;s general population that were not tested for HBV and/or HCV. Throughout the United States, the percentage of persons living HCV, who are among the undiagnosed and unaware of their infection status, may be as high as 42.0% - 50.0%; and the percentage of persons living HBV, who are undiagnosed and unaware of their infection status, may be as high as 20.0% - 31.0% [<xref rid="pone.0217455.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Second, these data are specific to a modern and well-integrated health care system and are therefore not generalizable to the entire state or nation. Reporting in a particular health system may not reflect reporting rates in other settings even within the same state. Third, some health system patients may have been diagnosed and reported in another state, despite current residence in the state of analysis. Fourth, our sample size was limited, particularly for the analysis of co-infections (n = 25), which may have prohibited us from fully exploring associations within the data.</p><p>The implications of this public health study, transcend the state of Pennsylvania. PDoH, Geisinger Health System of Pennsylvania, and the CDC were able to collaborate on this important study, by agreeing to share data and ideas. CDC and state health departments often collaborate to solve public health problems. The added dimension of collaborating with public health providers (hospitals, commercial laboratories, and insurance companies), will continue to help integrate ELR and EMR systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Scott Holmberg Division of Viral Hepatitis, CDC, for editorial assistance, as well as the CDC Epidemiology Elective Program for its support of co-author Perry Dubin.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Disclaimer</title><p>The findings and conclusions in this paper are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0217455.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><source>Institute of Medicine.
