<p>The estimated 3.5 million hepatitis C (HCV) infections and 1.0–2.0 million hepatitis B (HBV) infections represent the largest infectious disease epidemic in the United States, but have remained largely a “silent epidemic”[
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] despite their high burden of disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Viral hepatitis B and C infections are often characterized as silent epidemics, to some extent, because the majority of the persons infected with HBV or HCV are not aware that they are infected until they are screened for the virus, or until their liver disease progresses to cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several years later. Together, HBV and HCV infections are the leading causes of death from cirrhosis and HCC [
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The high burden of HBV infections in the United States, is largely due to the migration of foreign-born persons from HBV endemic countries. Persons living with HBV in the United States are largely foreign born and may account for as many as 50% - 70% of HBV infections in the United States [

 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In spite of routine childhood vaccination and targeted vaccination of at-risk populations, the prevalence of HBV infections in the United States has not seen a significant decrease in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century [
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The high burden of HCV infections in the United States, in part, is due to the increasing rates of injection drug use among young adults who reside in suburban and rural communities. Recent advances in the treatment of HBV and HCV infections has fostered hope that these infections can eventually be eliminated from the US population.
