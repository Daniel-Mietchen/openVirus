<p>Underreporting of viral hepatitis infections has long been identified as a problem [

 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Underreporting of these infections to state health departments and then to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has complicated the understanding of the true viral hepatitis infectious disease burden. Estimation of viral hepatitis prevalence, incidence, and mortality has been complicated by the inability in most instances to correct for the bias caused by underreporting of these infections. Reporting of viral hepatitis infections has been severely limited by lack of resources and manpower at the local level necessary for evaluation of laboratory reports, and follow-up of reports to complete case reporting [
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such efforts are labor-intensive for public health department staff, as, for example, an average of four documents per case need to be evaluated to distinguish between acute, resolved, or chronic HCV case status [
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CDC and state health departments rely on surveillance data collected and maintained by state health departments to inform strategies related to monitoring and tracking thousands of viral hepatitis infections each year.
