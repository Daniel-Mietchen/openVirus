<p>In total, medical records for 2,533 study participants were merged with surveillance data records stored in PA-NEDSS. Data cleaning, standardization and extracting fields of interests were performed to prepare for matching. Data variables used in the matching process were the patient’s: first and last names; date of birth, zip code, street address, and city of residence. Levenshtein’s algorithm was used to identify identical matches between the two data systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Levenshtein’s algorithm (also called Edit-Distance) calculates the least number of edit operations (deletions, insertions, or replacement) that are necessary to modify one string to obtain another string. A matching score between 0 and 100 was created for each matched pair based on similarity. Non-identical matches deemed to be acceptable were those that had a matching score of 85 or greater.
