Pennsylvania’s version of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (PA-NEDSS) has provided an electronic platform for streamlining disease reporting, and is used by Pennsylvania’s public health professionals for disease surveillance, outbreak detection, and case management [
 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Laboratory reports can be electronically transmitted or manually entered by local health departments, clinical providers, infection control personnel, or laboratories. PDoH began receiving electronic laboratory reports, during 2005. Once a HBV or HCV laboratory report is entered into PA-NEDSS, it is assigned to a public health expert for review. The reviewer conducts an investigation, consistent with the Pennsylvania viral hepatitis protocol for ascertaining if the infection meets the CDC/CSTE criteria for an acute/chronic HBV infection, or an acute/chronic HCV infection. PDoH employs several data quality strategies to ensure that duplicate laboratory reports are assigned to an unique state-assigned case identifier number.
