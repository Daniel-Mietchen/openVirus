<p>With the prevalence ratio (95% confidence interval) as the measure of association between each patient and underreporting of viral hepatitis B and C infections in Pennsylvania, we used version 9.4 SAS-callable SUDAAN version 11 (RLOGIST procedure) to calculate the unadjusted proportion of chronic HBV or HCV infections diagnosed among Geisinger patients during 2000–2015, that were reported to PDoH as either an acute or chronic infection. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to study the association between each of the patient characteristics and the outcome variables {log-odds of HBV (HCV) reporting}. In the multiple logistic regression models fitted, independent covariates included patient characteristics with the following categories: Sex (male, female); Age-group (0–30, 31–44, 45–54, 55–64, ≥65 years); Race-ethnicity (black non-Hispanic, white non-Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Island non-Hispanic, Hispanic); Rural_Status (urban, rural); Initial_Diagnosis_Year (prior to 1990, 1990–1999, 2000–2009, 2010–2015). Reporting_status (reported, unreported) was the dependent variable in the multiple logistic regression models. We used the Wald Chi-square test to identify statistically significant prevalence ratios (p&lt;0.05).</p>
