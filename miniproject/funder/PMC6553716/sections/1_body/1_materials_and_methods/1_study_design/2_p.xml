<p>Patients were included in the chronic hepatitis B and C cohorts based on fulfillment of a combination of laboratory-based and 
 <italic>International Classification of Diseases</italic>, 
 <italic>Ninth Revision</italic> (
 <italic>ICD-9</italic>)–based criteria. In brief, for inclusion in the hepatitis B cohort, patients had to fulfill at least 2 criteria (ie, 2 positive laboratory tests consistent with current HBV infection [positive for HBV surface antigen, e-antigen, or DNA test]), or a positive laboratory test and an 
 <italic>ICD-9</italic> diagnosis code, or 2 
 <italic>ICD-9</italic> diagnosis codes obtained at least 6 months apart. Patients in all phases of chronic HBV infection (immune-tolerant, immune-active, and inactive or “immune carrier”) were included. For the hepatitis C cohort, a similar approach was used. The hepatitis C cohort was comprised of patients having ICD-9 diagnosis codes indicative of a hepatitis C infection, and either of the following: alanine aminotransferase elevation, a positive hepatitis C antibody test, or a positive hepatitis C RNA test, at least 6 months apart from the hepatitis C diagnosis date per the ICD9 classification. An expanded overview of the CHeCS inclusion criteria is shown in
