  <title>Box 5. Criteria for identifying clinically confirmed cases of HBV and HCV infection in a cohort study– Pennsylvania, 2001–2015</title>
  <p>Confirmed chronic HBV infection if either of the following criteria are met*</p>
  <p>Criteria 1</p>
  <p>Specialist and primary-care provider documentation criteria</p>
  <p>Written/dictated description in a progress note by a specialist (hepatologist, gastroenterologist, or infectious disease specialist) or patient’s primary-care provider† that describes patient as having chronic HBV infection, being a HBV carrier, or having nonreplicating HBV.</p>
  <p>Criteria 2</p>
  <p>Laboratory criteria</p>
  <p>Any two of the following test results at least 6 months apart: HBsAg positive, HBV DNA positive, or HBeAg positive. (Any combination of these tests performed ≥6 months apart is acceptable.)</p>
  <p>Confirmed chronic HCV infection if either of the following criteria are met§</p>
  <p>Criteria 1</p>
  <p>Specialist and primary-care provider documentation criteria</p>
  <p>Written/dictated description in a progress note by a specialist (hepatologist, gastroenterologist, or infectious disease specialist) or patient’s primary-care provider† that describes patient as having chronic HCV infection.</p>
  <p>Criteria 2</p>
  <p>Laboratory criteria</p>
  <p>Has any of the following test results:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
   <list-item>
    <p>Anti-HCV (hepatitis C antibody) positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA or ELISA)</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>HCV RIBA (recombinant immunoblot assay) positive</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>HCV RNA detectable</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Report of HCV genotype AND followed ≥6 months later by either of the following:</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>HCV RNA detectable</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Report of HCV genotype</p>
   </list-item>
  </list>
  <p>Criteria 3</p>
  <p>Combination clinical and laboratory criteria</p>
  <p>Patient has not presented with acute hepatitis (a discrete onset of any sign or symptom consistent with acute viral hepatitis [e.g., anorexia, abdominal discomfort, nausea, or vomiting, and either 1) jaundice or dark urine, or 2) serum ALT levels &gt;400 IU/L]) AND has either of the following:</p>
  <list list-type="bullet">
   <list-item>
    <p>HCV RNA detectable</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Report of HCV genotype</p>
   </list-item>
  </list>

  <p>Abbreviations: HBV = hepatitis B virus; HCV = hepatitis C virus; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HBeAg = hepatitis B e antigen; ICD-9 = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision; EIA = enzyme immunoassay; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RIBA = recombinant immunoblot assay; ALT = alanine aminotransferase.</p>
  <p>* Patients who are confirmed per these criteria to have had chronic HBV infection at any point, but who later cleared the disease (spontaneously or as a result of treatment), belong in the cohort and should be classified as having a confirmed case of HBV infection.</p>
  <p>† This must be a textual description within a progress note, with or without an ICD-9 code. The primary-care provider should appear to have an informed, confident basis for the diagnosis based on serologic results and/or patient history, or the citation of outside laboratory studies that corroborate the diagnosis.</p>
  <p>§ Patients who are confirmed via these criteria to have had chronic HCV infection, but who have been successfully treated and have cleared HCV RNA, belong in the cohort and should be classified as having a confirmed case of HCV infection.</p>
