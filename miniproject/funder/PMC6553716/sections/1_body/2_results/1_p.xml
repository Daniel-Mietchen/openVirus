<p>Among the 2,533 Geisinger Health System study participants, 6.8% (n = 172) were living with HBV and 94.2% (n = 2,386) were living with HCV (Tables

 <xref rid="pone.0217455.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Co-infections (patients infected with HBV and HCV) were present in 1.0% (n = 25) of these patients. Men accounted for 60.5% (104 of 172) of the HBV infections (

A disproportionate number of those infected with HBV were Asian/Pacific Islanders [17.4% or (30 of 172)], and a disproportionate number of those infected with HCV were non-Hispanic whites [89.9% or (2,144 of 2,386)]. It should be noted that Asian/Pacific Islanders and non-Hispanic whites represent 3.5% and 82.4% of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s population, respectively [
