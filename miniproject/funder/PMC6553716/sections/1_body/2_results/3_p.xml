Patients under the age of 31, had the highest reporting rate, with only 3.5% of their infections unaccounted for in the state registry (PA-NEDSS). Although HCV underreporting rates were minimal, when compared to adults &lt; age 31 (adults whom were at least 65 years old), were 20% less likely to have their HCV infections reported to PDoH (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.2, [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 1.3]) (

Geisinger Health System patients, initially diagnosed during 1990–1999, were 8% less likely to have their HCV infections reported to PDoH, when compared to patients initially diagnosed during 2010–2015, (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.08, [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.12]).
