<p>As it pertains to secondary objective of this study: we concluded that the association between the select patient characteristics and underreporting of HBV infections to PDoH, was not statistically significant. However, underreporting of chronic HCV infections was more problematic among seniors (ages 65 and over), with 20.6% of the seniors living with HCV going unreported to PDoH. The Pennsylvania Hepatitis C Screening Act 87 (PA-HCV 87), enacted in 2016, will help decrease the underreporting of HCV infections to PDoH, among the baby boomer generation, persons born between 1945 and 1965 [

Subsequently, as Pennsylvania’s baby boomer population continue to age, PA-HCV 87 will also have a more impactful role in decreasing underreporting of seniors, ages 65 and over. The baby boomer population accounts for 75.0% of chronic viral hepatitis infections, in the United States [

Underreporting of chronic HCV infections was also problematic among Geisinger Health System patients initially diagnosed with a HCV infection during 1990–1999. CDC and CSTE have made substantial progress since the 1990s to standardize the viral hepatitis case definitions for viral hepatitis infections, and computerized reporting via the National Electronic Transmission Surveillance System (NETSS), and the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) [

The 1990s also correspond to a time-period when viral hepatitis infections were reported to state health departments largely by transmitting case reports via telephone faxes or US mail. The low reporting rates in the 1990s, may also reflect the inefficiency in reporting HBV and HCV infections during that time period. The increased utilization of electronic laboratory reporting systems (ELR), coincides with significant increases in funding to state health departments, via the CDC Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity co-operative agreement, since 1995 [
