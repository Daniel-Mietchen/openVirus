<p>Based on the findings of this study, we concluded that 11.6% and 5.4% of the chronic HBV and HCV infections, went unreported to PDoH, respectively. This suggests that PDoH and public health providers in Pennsylvania were largely successful with registering HBV and HCV infections in PA-NEDSS, with respect to persons who tested positive for HBV or HCV infections. Findings from a similar CHeCS cohort of patients in Michigan, concluded that 18.0% and 35.0% of chronic HBV and/or HCV infections went unreported to the Michigan Department of Health, respectively [

The differences in the underreporting rates, may be due to the inherent differences in the state populations, and viral hepatitis surveillance practices. Underreporting was more substantial among patients that were living with both viruses, with 28.0% going unreported to PDoH. This suggests that PDoH and public health providers in Pennsylvania were less successful among persons who tested positive for both viruses. HBV and HCV co-infections are generally associated with increased risk of severe liver disease and liver cancer [

 <xref rid="pone.0217455.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The lower reporting rate, among persons infected with both viruses, may be due to confusion surrounding how state investigators should have classified those infections. The CDC/CSTE case definitions do not address HBV and HCV coinfections.
