<p>This study has several limitations. First, the findings in this Pennsylvania based-study are promising, but do not account for underreporting among Pennsylvaniaâ€™s general population that were not tested for HBV and/or HCV. Throughout the United States, the percentage of persons living HCV, who are among the undiagnosed and unaware of their infection status, may be as high as 42.0% - 50.0%; and the percentage of persons living HBV, who are undiagnosed and unaware of their infection status, may be as high as 20.0% - 31.0% [

Second, these data are specific to a modern and well-integrated health care system and are therefore not generalizable to the entire state or nation. Reporting in a particular health system may not reflect reporting rates in other settings even within the same state. Third, some health system patients may have been diagnosed and reported in another state, despite current residence in the state of analysis. Fourth, our sample size was limited, particularly for the analysis of co-infections (n = 25), which may have prohibited us from fully exploring associations within the data.
