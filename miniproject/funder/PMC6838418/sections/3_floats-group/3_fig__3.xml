  <p>NS1-treatment of differentiating microvascular endothelial cells results in impaired tubulogenesis.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>(a)</bold> Microvascular endothelial TIME cells grown in Matrigel for 16 h, after which cells had differentiated and formed tubular structures, were treated, or not, with 6 μg NS1/ml for an additional 9 h. After harvesting the cells, RNA was prepared and qRT-PCR analyses performed for the expression of mRNAs of

   <italic>CD44</italic>. The data shown is from three independent experiments performed in triplicates ± SEM. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Cell lysates of the differentiated tubular endothelial cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for HAS2, HYAL2 and CD44, as well as GAPDH as loading control; the densities of the bands were quantified from three independent experiments by ImageJ (depicted by numbers). 
   <bold>(c)</bold> The hyaluronan in 25 h conditioned media from untreated or NS1-treated differentiating endothelial cells, were analyzed for size by agarose electrophoresis, as described in Materials and Methods. 
   <bold>(d)</bold> Microvascular endothelial cells were subjected to NS1 treatment (lower panel) or not (upper panel) during their growth in Matrigel for an additional 9 h after formation of tubular structures. The effect of NS1 on the vessel-like structures are shown. Numbers 1, 2, 3 indicate the order of asynchronous disassembly of vessel-like structures. Scale bars, 100 μm. In
