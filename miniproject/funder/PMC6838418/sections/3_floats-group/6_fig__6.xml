  <p>Effect of NS1, CD44 depletion and hyaluronan on VE-cadherin localization.</p>
  <p>Human microvascular endothelial TIME cells (2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 12-well plates), transfected with CD44 siRNA or control, scrambled siRNA, were stimulated with 25 g/ml hyaluronan overnight, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for VE-cadherin (green) and actin filaments (TRITC-phalloidin; red). Photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 immunofluorescence microscope. Arrows indicate the co-localization of VE-cadherin with actin fibers. Arrowheads indicate the discontinuity and fragility of VE-cadherin. Scale bars, 10 μm.
