  <p>Dengue virus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines synergize with NS1 to promote hyaluronan synthesis involving several signaling pathways.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>(a)</bold> The levels of TGFβ, MCP-1, IL-6, TNFα, IL-8 and IL-10 were analyzed in 108 dengue patients both in febrile and critical phases, and compared to twenty healthy individuals. 
   <bold>(b-c)</bold> Dermal fibroblasts 
   <bold>(b)</bold> and microvascular endothelial cells grown under proliferative conditions 
   <bold>(c)</bold> were treated (filled bars), or not (open bars), with NS1 (3 μg/ml) alone or in combination with TGFβ (1 ng/ml) or TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. The expression levels of mRNAs for 
   <italic>HAS2, CD44</italic> and 
   <italic>TLR4</italic> were determined by RT-PCR. The levels of hyaluronan in 24 h conditioned media were also determined (right panels) (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, triplicate determinations of each independent experiment). 
   <bold>(d-e)</bold> Dermal fibroblasts 
   <bold>(d)</bold> and endothelial cells 
   <bold>(e)</bold> were treated with NS1 (3 μg/ml) for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates were prepared and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for the phosphorylated and total amount of p65 NF-B, Akt, Erk1/2 and p38 MAP-kinase. 
   <bold>(f)</bold> Quantification of three independent experiments of dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells are depicted in gray and black bars respectively. * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 when compared to the non-treated controls. In 
   <bold>(a-c)</bold> and 
   <bold>(f)</bold>, results are means ± SEM. *
