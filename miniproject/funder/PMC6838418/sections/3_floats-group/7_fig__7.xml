  <p>Schematic illustration of a possible mechanism for NS1-induced increased endothelium permeability.</p>

   <bold>(a)</bold> Under physiological conditions, balanced expression of CD44 and hyaluronan levels contribute to cell-to-cell adhesion by cross-bridging between cells and maintaince of an intact glycocalyx. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> During severe dengue virus infection, the excessive levels of partly fragmented hyaluronan occupy the reduced number of CD44 receptors, thus preventing efficient cross-bridging. In addition, disruption of the glycocalyx layer may contribute to increased permeability. It should be noted that in cells in which CD44 had been knocked down, NS1 still enhanced the disruption of junctional proteins, such as VE-cadherin (
