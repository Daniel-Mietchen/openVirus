  <p>Hyaluronan-CD44 interactions are important for the stability of intercellular adhesion junctions.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>(a)</bold> Confluent monolayers of microvascular endothelial cells expressing or depleted of CD44, were pre-treated or not with exogenous hyaluronan (25 μg/ml) or Hermes1 antibodies (50 μg/ml) overnight. Then, cell monolayers were co-treated or not with 6 μg/ml NS1 protein and some cultures also with 
   <italic>Streptomyces</italic> hyaluronidase (5 units/ml) for 6 h. The permeability was determined by using an in vitro transwell permeability assay (n = 3). 
   <bold>(b-c)</bold> Confluent microvascular endothelial cells, expressing or depleted of CD44, grown on Matrigel-coated coverslips, were treated as described in 
   <bold>(a),</bold> fixed and stained for VE-cadherin (green), phalloidin (red), and DAPI (blue) 
   <bold>(c;</bold> quantified in 
   <bold>b)</bold>. Asterisks indicate representative para-cellular gaps between endothelial cells. See also
