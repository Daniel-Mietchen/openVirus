  <p>Serum hyaluronan levels increase robustly in patients with dengue fever and constitute a biomarker for disease severity.</p>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Flow chart of the enrollment of patients during dengue outbreaks. Twenty healthy adults were enrolled as control group for comparison. Laboratory-confirmed dengue patients, and gram-negative bacilli (GNB), gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia and influenza A virus (Flu A) infected patients were enrolled and analyzed. For further comparison between dengue patients without and with warning signs (WS), patients who did not visit hospital or were not evaluated day by day within 3 days after symptoms onset (
   <italic>n</italic> = 142) were excluded from the analyses described in panels 
   <bold>g</bold> and 
   <bold>h</bold> below.

   <bold>(f)</bold> Correlation between circulating NS1 concentrations and serum hyaluronan levels in patients with dengue fever (

   <bold>(g)</bold> Serum hyaluronan levels from 108 patients who provided paired serum samples during their febrile and critical phases, respectively, exhibiting WS or not. 
   <bold>(h)</bold> ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve of the serum hyaluronan concentration in febrile and critical phases show that it is a predictor of the occurrence of WS throughout the entire period of illness. Area under curve (AUC) was 0.68 and 0.69 respectively (See also Fig. S1 e). In
