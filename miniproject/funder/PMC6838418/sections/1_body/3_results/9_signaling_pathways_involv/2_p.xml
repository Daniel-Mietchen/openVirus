<p id="p0260">To gain insights into the signaling pathways evoked by NS1 which can mediate increased hyaluronan production and signaling, we investigated the activation status of key signaling molecules in fibroblast (

 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> e) cultures. Whereas NS1-treatment of fibroblasts did not affect the NF-B signaling pathway, in endothelial cultures an increase in NF-kB activation was observed within 15 min of NS1 treatment that lasted, with a slight decrease, for up to 4 h (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> e). Other signaling pathways, including Akt, and Erk1/2 and p38 MAP-kinases, were activated within 15 min after NS1-treatment, followed by a similar attenuation pattern, both in fibroblasts and endothelial cultures (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, d-f). Thus, NS1 induces several signaling pathways in both cell types.
