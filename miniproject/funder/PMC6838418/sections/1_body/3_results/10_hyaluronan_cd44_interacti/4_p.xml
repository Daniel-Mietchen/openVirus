 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, under basal conditions VE-cadherin was distributed in a striped or jagged fashion delineating confluent and resting endothelial cells, and colocalized with F-actin. There was no significant change in the total VE-cadherin protein expression levels in NS1-treated cells, with or without combination with hyaluronan or Hermes1 pre-treatment, compared to non-treated endothelial cells, neither did depletion of CD44 affect its expression (Fig. S4), suggesting that hyaluronan/CD44 does not affect VE-cadherin expression. Importantly, stimulation with NS1 or hyaluronan, or CD44 depletion, caused re-distribution and fragility of VE-cadherin (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis of TRITC-phalloidin-stained endothelial cells revealed that hyaluronan stimulation induced both longer (Fig. S5 a) and thicker (Fig. S5 b) F-actin stress fibers compared to control cells; CD44 depletion also promoted the formation of longer and thicker F-actin stress fibers (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S5). Notably, a co-localization of VE-cadherin with the ends of F-actin stress fibers at sites of cell-cell junctions, was observed. Our observations support the notion that NS1, or treatment with hyaluronan or CD44 suppression, affects VE-cadherin and cytoskeletal associations, modulating endothelial-endothelial intercellular junctions (
