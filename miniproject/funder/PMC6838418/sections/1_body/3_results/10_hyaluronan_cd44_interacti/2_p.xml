<p id="p0265">Recently, we demonstrated a critical role of the hyaluronan - CD44 axis in normal vessel formation [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of CD44 and hyaluronan on the integrity of untreated and NS1-treated confluent endothelial cell monolayers, using an in vitro endothelium permeability assay. Confluent monolayers not exposed to NS1 exhibited a basal permeability, which was increased by about 3-fold when hyaluronan was added to the culture media or when cells were depleted of CD44 (
