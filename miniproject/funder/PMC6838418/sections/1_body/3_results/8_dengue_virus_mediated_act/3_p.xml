<p id="p0250">Because TGFβ and TNFα are potent stimulators of HAS2-synthesized hyaluronan in several cell types [
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], we investigated the effects of these mediators on NS1-induced hyaluronan production in fibroblast (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b) and endothelial (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c) cultures. The analysis demonstrated that fibroblasts stimulated with TGFβ or TNFα in combination with NS1 exhibited about 2-fold and 4-fold increases in 
 <italic>HAS2</italic> expression, respectively, compared to cell cultures treated with NS1 only (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b). In TIME cells, TNFα stimulation also significantly increased the NS1-induced 
 <italic>HAS2</italic> expression, however, TGFβ did not (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c). In addition, we investigated the effects of TGFβ and TNFα alone or in combination with NS1 on the expression levels of 
 <italic>CD44</italic> and 
 <italic>TLR4,</italic> encoding a receptor for NS1, in these cultures. Neither TGFβ nor TNFα, alone or in combination with NS1, significantly affected 
 <italic>CD44</italic> mRNA expression, whereas TNFα in combination with NS1, synergistically induced the expression of 
 <italic>TLR4</italic> in fibroblast cultures (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> b). In microvascular endothelial cultures, NS1 alone markedly induced the expression of 
 <italic>TLR4</italic>, which was partially decreased when NS1 was combined with TGFβ or TNFα. Neither TGFβ nor TNFα, alone or in combination with NS1, significantly affected the transcription of 
 <italic>CD44</italic> in endothelial cells (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c). The hyaluronan levels increased significantly in both fibroblasts and endothelial cell cultures treated with TGFβ and TNFα in combination with NS1.
