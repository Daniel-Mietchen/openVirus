<p id="p0230">TIME cells grown on Matrigel differentiated to tubular structures within 16 h, forming a network. Because hyaluronidase-dependent hyaluronan fragmentation and CD44 expression [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] are involved in the differentiation of microvascular endothelial cells, we investigated the effect of NS1 treatment on expressions of hyaluronan synthases and hyaluronidases, as well as 
 <italic>CD44</italic>, during tubular morphogenesis of TIME cells (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> a). CD44 can occur as a standard form as well as several variant forms as a result of differential splicing; however, the TIME cells contain almost exclusively the standard CD44 isoform [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the transcriptional activities of 
 <italic>HAS1</italic>, 
 <italic>2</italic>, 
 <italic>3</italic>, and 
 <italic>HYAL1</italic>, as well as the constitutively highly expressed 
 <italic>HYAL2</italic>, were significantly induced after treatment of the vessel-like structures for 9 h with NS1. Importantly, NS1 treatment significantly suppressed the expression of the 
 <italic>CD44</italic> transcripts during endothelial differentiation (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> a). In accordance, the protein levels of HAS2 and HYAL2 were markedly increased, whereas that of CD44 was decreased by about 30%, after 9 h of NS1 treatment of the endothelial cell vessel-like structures (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> b). Interestingly, exposure of differentiated TIME cell to NS1 resulted in the production of increased levels of fragmented hyaluronan in the conditioned medium (
