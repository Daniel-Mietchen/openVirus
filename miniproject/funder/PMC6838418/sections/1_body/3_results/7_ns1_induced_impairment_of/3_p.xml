<p id="p0235">Monitoring the network formed by differentiated TIME cell cultures treated with NS1 by time-lapse microscopy for up to 9â€¯h, revealed a reversal of the endothelial cell self-assembly into tubular structures in NS1-treated cultures. The rate of the endothelial cell detachment from the vessel-like structures was asynchronous (
