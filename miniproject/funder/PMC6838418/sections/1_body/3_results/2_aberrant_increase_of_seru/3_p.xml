<p id="p0175">Because severe dengue infection is associated with vascular dysfunction, and since hyaluronan is a major component of the endothelial glycocalyx and is involved in the regulation of endothelial permeability [

 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], we investigated the levels of hyaluronan in serum of the patients. The 250 dengue infected patients provided consecutive serum samples during the febrile, critical and/or recovery phases. Interestingly, serum hyaluronan levels increased about 100-fold in patients with dengue fever (mean value: 1002 ng/ml) compared to healthy controls (

The highest concentrations were reached between 4 and 5 days (about 4000 ng/ml) and declined 8 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms, periods corresponding to the critical and recovery phases, respectively. The hyaluronan levels remained elevated during the recovery phase (
