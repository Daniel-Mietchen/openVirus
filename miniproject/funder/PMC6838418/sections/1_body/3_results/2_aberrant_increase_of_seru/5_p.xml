<p id="p0185">For comparison, the levels of hyaluronan were also determined in serum of patients infected with other agents, i.e. gram-negative bacilli (GNB; 50 patients), gram-positive cocci (GPC; 9 patients) and influenza A virus (Flu A; 41 patients) on the day of hospital visit. Notably, dengue patients exhibited 5-fold, 10-fold and 40-fold higher hyaluronan levels in comparison to GNB, GPC and Flu A infected patients, respectively (

Thus, dengue virus infection triggers an accumulation of hyaluronan, much higher than that induced during infection with influenza virus A or bacteria. Interestingly, high plasma NS1 levels in dengue patients correlated with higher circulating hyaluronan levels (from 182 dengue patients); a 10-fold increase in the circulating viral NS1 protein was accompanied with a 10-fold increased serum hyaluronan levels (
