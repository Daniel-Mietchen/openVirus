<p id="p0220">We compared the organization of hyaluronan matrices in dermal fibroblast (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> d) and TIME cell (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> e) cultures in response to NS1 treatment. Interestingly, in NS1 treated fibroblast cultures, hyaluronan matrices formed a fibrous network spanning multiple cells, in comparison to untreated cultures (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> d; each channel is shown separately in Fig. S3 a). Abundant hyaluronan-rich fibrous cables, longer than 20 μm weaving over the cells were predominantly seen in NS1-treated fibroblast cultures, compared to untreated control cells (Fig. S3 b and c, respectively). Hyaluronan-rich fibrous network structures were formed to a much lesser extent around TIME cells compared to fibroblasts (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> e; each channel is shown separately in Fig. S3 a); instead the hyaluronan-based matrices in microvascular endothelial cultures exhibited dot-like structures. The specificity for hyaluronan staining was verified by saturation of b-HABP with excess of hyaluronan prior its addition, leading to abrogation of hyaluronan staining (Fig. S3 d).
