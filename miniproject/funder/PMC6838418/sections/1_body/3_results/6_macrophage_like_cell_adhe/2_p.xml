<p id="p0225">In an effort to understand the increased immune response associated with dengue infection, we investigated how PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophage-like cells adhered to hyaluronan matrices surrounding dermal fibroblasts (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> f) and microvascular endothelial cells (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> g). We observed an increase in adhesion of CD44 expressing macrophage-like cells onto hyaluronan cables and hyaluronan-rich dot-like structures around NS1-treated fibroblasts and endothelial cultures, respectively. Blocking of CD44-hyaluronan interactions with Hermes 1 antibodies resulted in about 30% and 70% suppression of macrophage adhesion to NS1-treated dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells, respectively (
