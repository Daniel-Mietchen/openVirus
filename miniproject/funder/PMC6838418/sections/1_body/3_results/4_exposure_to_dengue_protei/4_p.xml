<p id="p0215">The NS1-induced increase in the mRNA levels of the HAS isoforms was accompanied by increased hyaluronan concentrations in the cell culture media of both fibroblasts and endothelial cells (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> c). Fibroblasts produced 5â€“10 times more hyaluronan than endothelial cells. Since the HAS2 isoform dominated, at least in fibroblasts, it is likely that HAS2-synthesized hyaluronan accounted for most of the excessive hyaluronan levels.
