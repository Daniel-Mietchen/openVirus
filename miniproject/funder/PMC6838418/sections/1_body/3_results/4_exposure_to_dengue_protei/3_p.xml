<p id="p0210">NS1 treatment of proliferating TIME cells significantly induced the expressions of 
 <italic>HAS1</italic>, 
 <italic>HAS2</italic> and 
 <italic>HAS3</italic>, as well as 
 <italic>HYAL1</italic>, but had no effect on the intrinsic constitutively high transcription of 
 <italic>HYAL2</italic> and 
 <italic>CD44</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> b). Notably, the induction of 
 <italic>HAS2</italic> transcription was more profound than 
 <italic>HAS1</italic> and 
 <italic>HAS3</italic> after 24â€¯h of exposure to NS1, and was accompanied by increased HAS2 protein expression (
