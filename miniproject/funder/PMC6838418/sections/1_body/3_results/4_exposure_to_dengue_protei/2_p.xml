<p id="p0205">To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the excessive accumulation of hyaluronan in serum of dengue-infected individuals, we investigated the effects of recombinant viral NS1 protein; the preparation contained monomeric and oligomeric forms as revealed by immunoblotting (Fig. S2 a). Using fluorescein diacetate / propidium iodide assay, we verified that treatment of dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells with up to 9 μg NS1/ml did not affect the viability of cells (Fig. S2 b and d). NS1 treatment of dermal fibroblasts potently stimulated the expression of 
 <italic>HAS1</italic>, 
 <italic>HAS2</italic> and 
 <italic>HAS3</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a). Noteworthy, the basal 
 <italic>HAS2</italic> transcript levels in fibroblast cultures was 100-fold higher than 
 <italic>HAS1</italic> and 
 <italic>HAS3</italic> transcripts, and it was further 3-fold increased at 6 h after NS1 treatment (Fig. S2 c). NS1 did not affect the amount of 
 <italic>HYAL1</italic> and 
 <italic>HYAL2</italic> transcripts, but significantly increased the high basal 
 <italic>CD44</italic> mRNA level in dermal fibroblasts (
