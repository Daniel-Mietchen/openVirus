<p id="p0200">In addition, the predictive role of serum hyaluronan levels in discriminating dengue WS-negative and WS-positive cases was explored by analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The analyses showed significant discriminatory power of serum hyaluronan levels from febrile phase (the area under curve, AUC = 0.68, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .002) and critical phase (AUC = 0.69, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .001) of dengue infection, to distinguish WS-positive from WS-negative patients (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> h). Serum hyaluronan levels correlated negatively to platelet counts (Fig. S1 b) and positively to NS1 plasma concentrations (Fig. S1 c). Increased hyaluronan levels are also seen in patients with other diseases, e.g. diabetes. Subdivision of our cohort in patients with (
 <italic>n</italic> = 23) and without (
 <italic>n</italic> = 85) diabetes, revealed borderline elevation of hyaluronan levels in both febrile and critical phases (Fig. S1 d). The sensitivity and specificity for febrile phase hyaluronan level were 76% and 55%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity for critical phase hyaluronan level were 65% and 74%, respectively (Fig. S1 e). Furthermore, we divided the 108 patients into 4 groups according to their febrile phase (early) serum hyaluronan levels (0–25, 25–50, 50–75, 75–100 percentiles ranking, respectively). We found that the percentage of patients with warning signs (left panel), nadir platelet counts &lt;50,000/μl (left middle panel), hematocrit level increasing &gt;20% (middle panel), hypoalbuminemia &lt;30 mg/ml (right middle panel) and occurrence of pleural effusion or ascites (right panel), increased gradually along with the increase of febrile phase serum hyaluronan levels (Fig. S1 f). The latter three symptoms and signs are typical manifestations of plasma leakage in dengue patients. These findings demonstrate that the serum hyaluronan level is a useful biomarker to predict the occurrence of warning signs during the entire disease course. Thus, the febrile phase serum hyaluronan level can be used to predict the progress of disease, and thereby determine which dengue patients need hospitalization.
