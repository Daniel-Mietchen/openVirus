<p id="p0190">In an effort to evaluate the importance of hyaluronan as a possible prognostic biomarker for dengue WS positive and severe dengue, the levels of hyaluronan and warning signs were analyzed in the febrile and critical phases of 108 patients (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> g, and 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Forty-two patients were evaluated as WS-negative and 66 were WS-positive. In total, 15 patients progressed to severe dengue and all of them had warning signs (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Table S1). The means of febrile-phase and critical-phase hyaluronan levels were significantly higher in patients with warning signs compared with those without (

 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In univariate analysis among 108 patients, age ≥ 65 years, secondary infection, febrile phase serum hyaluronan level ≥ 70 ng/ml, and critical phase serum hyaluronan level ≥ 2700 ng/ml, were all risk factors for occurrence of warning signs (
