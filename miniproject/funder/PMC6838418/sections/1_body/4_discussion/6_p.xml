<p id="p0300">Previous studies have demonstrated key regulatory roles of cytokines released by monocytes/macrophages, T cells and endothelial cells, in the pathogenesis of dengue virus infection [

 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The release of soluble mediators and cytokines, such as TGFβ, MCP-1, IL-6, MMPs and TNFα, predispose endothelial cells to apoptosis and endothelial damage [

 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], NS1-mediated induction of HASs and HYALs drives the release of both fragmented hyaluronan and pro-inflammatory cytokines promoting inflammation. Our data demonstrated activation of Akt, p38, and Erk1/2 in both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, as well as of NF-B in endothelial cells, in response to NS1; however, the precise signaling pathways activated by NS1 that induces hyaluronan synthesis, remain to be elucidated.
