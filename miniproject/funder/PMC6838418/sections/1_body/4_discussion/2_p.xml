<p id="p0280">We demonstrate that NS1-mediated increase in circulating hyaluronan predicts the occurrence of warning signs during dengue virus infection, and promotes endothelial hyper-permeability involving perturbed CD44-hyaluronan interactions accompanied by F-actin stress fibers and VE-cadherin re-organization. The circulating levels of dengue virus NS1 protein in patients with dengue virus infection range between 0.02 and 15 μg/ml [

Circulating NS1 is thought to play key regulatory roles in the pathology of dengue virus infection, but insights into the pathogenesis of severe vascular leakage have been hampered by the lack of an animal model that accurately mimics the transient capillary permeability syndrome seen in patients [

Previous studies have reported increased serum hyaluronan levels and a potential association to dengue severity, but the increased levels of hyaluronan was detected at later infection phases and the underlying molecular mechanisms were not elucidated [

 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We have confirmed and extended these findings, by studying a larger and early-enrolled cohort of dengue virus infected patients. We provide evidence that hyaluronan levels higher than 70 ng/ml during early infection, is an independent predictor for occurrence of warning signs and thus severe dengue fever. Importantly, we show that high circulating NS1 levels, indicative of disease severity, correlate with high concentration of serum hyaluronan (
