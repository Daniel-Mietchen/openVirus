<p id="p0295">Our previous studies on the differentiation of TIME cells demonstrated that CD44 was predominantly localized at the fusion sites during tubulogenesis, and that knock-down of CD44 or HYAL2 resulted in an inability of endothelial cells to differentiate and form tubular structures [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The inability of CD44-depleted microvascular endothelial cells to form vessel-like structures, together with our previous studies that hyaluronan fragments trigger CD44-mediated tubulogenesis in a CXCL1-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], suggest key regulatory roles for hyaluronan-engaged CD44 and chemokines in angiogenesis. In addition to degrade hyaluronan, HYAL2 has been reported to regulate the formation of the glycocalyx via CD44-ERM-related cytoskeletal interactions [
 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], to serve as a viral entry receptor [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and to regulate CD44 alternative splicing events affecting cell phenotype in progressive fibrosis [

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), resulting in the formation of proinflammatory fragmented hyaluronan-rich matrices, and may have contributed to disorganization of the glycocalyx layer [
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Intriguingly, the hyaluronidase TMEM2 (homolog to KIAA1199) [
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] was recently shown to have a pivotal role in normal angiogenesis during embryonic development, by balancing hyaluronan depolymerization [
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Furthermore, the accumulated knowledge about the role of HYAL1 and HYAL2 in glycocalyx function support the notion that hyaluronan is important for endothelial cell function [
