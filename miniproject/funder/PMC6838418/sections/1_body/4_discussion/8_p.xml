<p id="p0310">There are 4 different serotypes of dengue virus epidemics globally. In our cohort, most of the patients were infected by the type 2 serotype, and the recombinant NS1 protein we used for in vitro study was also obtained from this viral strain. Further analyses of patients infected by the different serotypes, the effect of the different NS1 proteins, and the involvement of increased levels of hyaluronan, are ongoing.</p>
