 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. During the inflammatory phase after a virus infection, cells synthesize and secrete hyaluronan that form inflammatory cable-like hyaluronan-rich structures [
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Analysis of the effects of the dengue NS1 protein on dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cell cultures revealed that the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and signaling of hyaluronan was modulated. Fibroblasts produced 5â€“10 times higher levels of hyaluronan compared to endothelial cells (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> c), however, given that during viremia and presence of large amounts of NS1, endothelial cells in the entire circulation may be exposed to NS1, their contribution to the elevated hyaluronan levels in dengue patients may be substantial. Importantly, NS1 exposure resulted in the deposition of different forms of hyaluronan-rich matrices in fibroblasts and endothelial cultures, and both structures attracted immune cells (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Indeed, the size of hyaluronan macromolecular structures play a pivotal role not only for the physical, but also for the immunological properties of tissues. Whereas alveolar macrophages constitutively bind, take up and degrade hyaluronan [

 <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>], the capacity of monocytes to bind hyaluronan is induced in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation or infection [
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Our observations that depletion of CD44 or treatment with excessive amounts of hyaluronan leads to enhanced endothelial hyper-permeability suggests that the size and signaling of hyaluronan matrices have an important role in the regulation of vessel function.
