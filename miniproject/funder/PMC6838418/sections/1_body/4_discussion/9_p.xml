<p id="p0315">In conclusion, our data show that the dengue NS1 protein and pro-inflammatory factors stimulate hyaluronan biosynthesis and alters hyaluronan-CD44 interactions leading to disorganization of intercellular junctions and vascular leakage. Discerning the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased vascular permeability will help to formulate a strategy to prevent plasma leakage during dengue infection.</p>
