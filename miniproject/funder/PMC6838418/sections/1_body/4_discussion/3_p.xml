<p id="p0285">Patients with severe dengue sometimes show life-threatening increase in vascular permeability. Important regulators of vascular permeability are endothelial tight junctions and adherence junctions. In particular, homophilic interactions of VE-cadherin molecules between endothelial cells regulate the intercellular junctions by undergoing actin-controlled movement along intercellular contacts [

Our findings show that NS1 treatment did not affect the amount of VE-cadherin in endothelial cells, however, its localization was rearranged, which was accompanied by a rearrangement of actin filaments resulting in increased gaps between endothelial cells (

Stimulation with hyaluronan or knockdown of CD44 resulted in similar morphological alterations, suggesting that the effect of NS1 on rearrangement of VE-cadherin and actin filaments is, at least partially, mediated by perturbed hyaluronan-CD44 interactions.
