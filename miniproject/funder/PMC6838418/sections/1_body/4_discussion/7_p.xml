<p id="p0305">Through interaction with TLR4 on monocytes, NS1 has been shown to trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines promoting vascular leakage during dengue infection [

 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>]. In addition, NS1-induced plasma leakage is associated with perturbation of endothelial glycocalyx and intercellular junctions, including adherens junctions [
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In a recent study, NS1-induced vascular leakage was shown to be independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocalyx layer components, such as sialic acid and heparan sulfate proteoglycans [
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that NS1 protein via TLR4 disrupts endothelial barrier function triggering vascular leakage [

 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. NS1 has been shown to promote the destruction of adherens and tight junctions [
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The expression of CD44 promotes the assembly of junctional proteins and its abrogation leads to reduction of VE-cadherin leading to opening of intercellular gaps [
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Our observation that the NS1-induced decreased expression of CD44 is connected with an increased endothelial permeability (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), is consistent with this notion. We also observed that exogenously added hyaluronan potentiated NS1-mediated endothelial cell permeability, suggesting that excessive levels of hyaluronan causes occupation of CD44 expressed by the endothelium, and thus perturb normal hyaluronan-CD44 interactions, as schematically depicted in 
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>.
