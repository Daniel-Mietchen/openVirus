<p id="p0130">In order to investigate the recruitment of immune cells to dermal fibroblasts and TIME cells, human THP-1 immortalized monocyte-like cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. P1585, St. Louis, MO, USA), 5 ng/ml for 48 h, to obtain monocyte-derived macrophage-like cells [

Fibroblasts and TIME cells were seeded on the coverslips, and then incubated in media containing 0.5% FBS or 2% FCS, respectively, together with 3 μg/ml NS1, in the absence or presence of a monoclonal CD44 antibody (Hermes1; 50 μg/ml, Bio X Cell, BE0262), which specifically inhibits the binding of hyaluronan to the CD44 receptor. After 24 h, THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophage-like cells, detached by EDTA, were co-cultured with fibroblasts or TIME cells for 20 min. After gentle washing with serum-free RPMI-1640 medium, the coverslips were fixed and stained for hyaluronan and CD44, as described above. Ten randomly taken 20× fields were obtained for each condition and the bound THP-1 cells were counted.
