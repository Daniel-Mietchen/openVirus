Patients (≥20 years) were prospectively enrolled, and their blood samples were provided on the first day of hospital visit, as well as three and seven days later, if the patient was still in the hospital and agreed to provide more samples. The time of symptoms onset for each patient was recorded immediately after enrollment to minimize recalling bias. All patients in the group had dengue fever, and all methods used in the evaluation and management of the patients were according to the criteria defined by the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Patients' demographic information, pre-existing diseases, clinical manifestations and laboratory data, were collected by standardized data collection forms. Hematology and biochemistry tests were performed at the Department of Laboratory Medicine of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital.
