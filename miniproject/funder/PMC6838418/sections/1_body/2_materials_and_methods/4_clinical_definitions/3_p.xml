<p id="p0080">Patients were evaluated daily within the hospital according to the symptoms of severity as listed in the WHO 2009 guidelines, i.e. [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] abdominal pain or tenderness; [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] persistent vomiting; [
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] clinical fluid accumulation; [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] mucosal bleeding; [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] lethargy or restlessness; [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] liver enlargement &gt;2 cm; [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] increase in hematocrit concurrent with rapid decrease in platelet count. For each patient it was determined whether WS developed (≥1 of these 7 symptoms and signs) or not. Clinical fluid accumulations (including pleural effusion and ascites) were confirmed by ultrasound examination. Patients were followed until their recovery or discharge from the hospital (including discharge due to death). If WS developed at any time during the illnesses, the patients were considered to be in the WS-positive group, otherwise, they were considered to be in the WS-negative group. WS-positive patients who never got severe dengue throughout the illnesses were defined as “moderate cases”. In order to compare patients without and with WS and minimize the confounding effects of patient management, we excluded patients who did not visit the hospital to receive treatment within three days after their symptoms onset in the further analysis. This step made sure that patients for further analyses were evaluated, treated, and followed up by the recommendations based on the WHO 2009 guidelines.
