<p id="p0070">We identified anti-dengue IgG and IgM antibodies in laboratory-confirmed dengue patient's serum. Qualitative measurement of human anti-dengue IgG and IgM antibodies were performed by an ELISA according to the manufacturer's instruction (Abcam, ab108728, and ab108729, Bristol, United Kingdom). Following the WHO 2009 guidelines, primary and secondary dengue infections were distinguished based on the IgG/IgM antibody ratios. Dengue infection was defined as primary if the IgG/IgM ratio was &lt;1.4 (patient's sera at 1/20 dilutions), and secondary if the ratio was &gt;1.4. The laboratory-confirmed cases with samples that were negative in the IgG capture ELISA assay during the febrile phase (within 3â€¯days of illness) were also classified as primary cases, regardless of the IgG/IgM ratio [
