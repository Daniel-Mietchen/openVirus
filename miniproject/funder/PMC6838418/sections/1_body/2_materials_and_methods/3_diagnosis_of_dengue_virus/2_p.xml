<p id="p0065">All the laboratory diagnostic methods for dengue virus infection were performed at the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Department of Health, Taiwan. Laboratory-confirmed dengue patients meant that the patient had at least one positive result from a NS1 Ag STRIP (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) or a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) using patients' serum [

Further serotyping using real-time RT-PCR of nonstructural protein genes were analyzed by detection with serotype-specific primers and probes (Table S2). In brief, the viral RNA was extracted using Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Cat. No. 52906, Chatsworth, CA, USA), treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I and reverse transcribed using PrimeScript reagent kit (TaKaRa, Cat. No. RR037A, Kyoto, Japan), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was evaluated for dengue viral serotypes by real time RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems, 7500, Foster, USA).
