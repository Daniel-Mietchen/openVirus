<p id="p0135">Dermal fibroblasts and TIME cells, growing under proliferative or differentiating conditions, were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μM Leupeptin, 9100 KIU/ml Aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM NaF, 1 mM orthovanadate) and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. TIME cells cultured on Matrigel were subjected to Dispase digestion prior to cell lysis. Protein concentration was measured by utilizing a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher scientific, Gothenburg, Sweden). Samples with equal protein content were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by wet transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, GE Healthcare, Sweden). Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA in Tris buffered saline (TBS) supplemented with 1% Tween 20, and incubated with antibodies (listed in Table S2) at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/10000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gothenburg, Sweden, Cat# 65–6120, RRID:
