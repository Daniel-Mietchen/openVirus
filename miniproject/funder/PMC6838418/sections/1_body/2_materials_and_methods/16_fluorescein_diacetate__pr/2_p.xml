<p id="p0160">Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) (Sigma-Aldrich, D6883, USA) and propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. P4170, USA) stainings were performed to detect viable and dead cells, respectively, in fibroblasts and TIME cultures upon treatment with viral NS1 protein. Briefly, untreated cells or cells treated with NS1 (up to 9 μg/ml) for different time periods up to 72 h, were stained in serum-free medium containing 8 μg/ml FDA or 20 μg/ml PI at room temperature for four min, in the dark. After washing by PBS, each sample was analyzed with fluorescence microscopy. Cell viability was measured by counting the FDA-signal (viable green fluorescent cells) and the PI-signal (red nuclei PI-stained dead cells) among 300 cells.</p>
