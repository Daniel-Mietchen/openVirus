<p id="p0145">The permeability of confluent endothelial TIME cell monolayers, treated or not with NS1, was measured by an in vitro transwell permeability assay that mimic human endothelium in vivo [
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In brief, TIME cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>), expressing or depleted of CD44, were grown in a 24-Transwell® (pore size: 0.4 μm; Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA) for 5 days until a confluent monolayer was formed. Silencing of CD44 was obtained by transient transfection with 20 nM siRNA (ON-TARGET
 <italic>plus</italic> SMARTpool from Dharmacon, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sweden) using SilenFECT transfection reagent (Biorad laboratories AB, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fresh starvation media was added in the upper chambers in the absence or presence of exogenously added hyaluronan (25 μg/ml of a molecular mass of 1000 kDa; Q-Med, Sweden) and Hermes1 antibodies (50 μg/ml) overnight. Next, some of the samples were treated for 6 h with NS1 protein (6 μg/ml) with or without 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> hyaluronidase (5 units/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, H1136, USA), then media was aspirated, and 200 μl fresh serum-free media containing 3 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (GE Healthcare, RPN1231, UK) was added. To measure the HRP that leaked through the endothelial monolayer, the inserts were moved to a new 24-well plate with 500 μl/well of serum-free media and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Media from each lower chamber (20 μl), was transferred to a 96-well plate and analyzed for HRP activity by adding 100 μl 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, T4444, USA). The color development was detected by an EnSpire Multimode Reader (PerkinElmer, Sweden) at 450 nm.
