<p id="p0165">Data were presented as numbers; chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was performed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to detect which factors were associated with warning signs. Factors which significantly associated in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. The ROC curve was used to examine the predictive value of hyaluronan. The optimal cutoff value of hyaluronan to distinguish patients with warning signs from those without was selected using maximized Youden index, which was defined as [sensitivity+specificity]-1. For examination of the null hypothesis that AUC is equal to 0.5, which indicates no prediction is possible, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. Continuous variables from patients were analyzed by Student's
