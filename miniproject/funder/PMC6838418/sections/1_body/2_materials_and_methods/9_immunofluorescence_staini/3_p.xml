<p id="p0125">To detect VE-cadherin and actin filaments in confluent monolayers of TIME cells grown on Matrigel-coated coverslips (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 12 well plates), cell cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and blocked with IgG-free 1% BSA. Cultures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies against VE-cadherin (4 μg/ml) followed by anti-mouse Alexa-fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) for 1 h. Actin was visualized by TRITC-phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 30 min. The nuclei were stained with DAPI and the slides were mounted with ProLong gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher, P36930, Eugene, OR, USA). Photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 immunofluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss AB, Sweden) using Velocity software, and staining was quantified using Image J.
