<p id="p0120">Human dermal fibroblasts (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and proliferating TIME cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates. After 24 h of starvation, untreated or NS1-treated cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min followed by three washes with PBS containing 10% ethanol, and quenching with 100 mM glycine for 30 min. Non-specific binding was then blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA, 5% goat serum (Thermo Fisher, Sweden) and streptavidin plus biotin (Molecular Probes, Cat. No. E-21390, Eugene, Oregon, USA). After washings, cells were incubated over-night with biotinylated-hyaluronan binding protein (b-HABP; 3 μg/ml) [

 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Alexa Fluor 488-Streptavidin conjugate (1:1000; Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-mouse antibodies (1:1000; Molecular Probes) were used to detect hyaluronan and CD44, respectively. As a specificity control for hyaluronan staining, b-HABP was preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μg/ml hyaluronan prior to its addition to the cultures.
