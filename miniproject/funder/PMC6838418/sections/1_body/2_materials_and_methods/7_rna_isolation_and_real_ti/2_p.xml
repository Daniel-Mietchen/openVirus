<p id="p0105">Total cellular RNA was extracted from dermal fibroblasts and TIME cells (cultured under proliferative or differentiating conditions), using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Ref. No. 74106, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. Differentiating TIME cells were released by digestion of the Matrigel for 45 min, at 37 °C, with 400 μl of 50 U Dispase/ml (BD Biosciences). The enzymatic activity was then inhibited by addition of 800 μl of 10 mM EDTA in PBS. After centrifugation and washings in PBS, RNA or protein (see below) were prepared from the cell lysates. Then, one μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad, Cat. No. 1708891, Sweden). Real-time qPCR was carried out on a Biorad bcfx96 cycler using KAPA SYBR Fast (Techtum Lab AB, Sweden) in triplicates (95 °C, 2 min; 40 × (95 °C, 10 s; 60 °C, 30 s)). The primer sequences used for
