<p id="p0155">Conditioned media from dermal fibroblasts treated with NS1 for 24 h, was collected and precipitated by 10% (
 <italic>v</italic>/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice for 15 min. The mixture were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatants discarded. The pellets were re-suspended in 100 μl distilled water and 1 ml chilled 100% acetone was added. After vortexing, samples were left at −20 °C overnight, and then centrifuged. The pellets were then air-dried, lysed in 2× sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by wet transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and an overnight incubation with NS1 antibodies (dilution 1/500). Immunocomplexes were detected with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilution 1/10000; Invitrogen, Life Technologies Europe BV, Sweden).
