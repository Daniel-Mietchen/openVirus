<p id="p0140">An in vitro three-dimensional tubulogenesis assay that simulates the final stages of in vivo vessel formation, i.e. cellular differentiation, elongation into tubular structures and lumenogenesis was established, as described [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In brief, ice-cold 12-well plates were coated with 200 μl growth factor-reduced Matrigel (13.5 mg/ml; Corning, Cat. No. 356231, Bedford, MA, USA) per well, resulting in an 1 mm thick gel. After Matrigel solidification (at 37 °C for at least 30 min), 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TIME cells were seeded on top of the gel-containing plates. The morphogenesis of TIME endothelial cells into tube-like structures appeared after about 6 h and lasted up to 25 h. Time-lapse microscopy (Nikon-Eclipse Ti—U, Japan) was performed on TIME cells differentiated for 16 h before treatment with NS1 or not, followed by time-lapse monitoring for up to 9 h.
