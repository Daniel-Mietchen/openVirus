<p id="p0115">Fibroblasts (100,000 cells/well) or TIME cells (200,000 cells /well) in 6-well plates, were grown in media containing 10% FBS (fibroblasts) or 5% FCS (TIME cells) for 24 h, then starved for an additional 24 h in media supplemented with 0.5% FBS or 2% FCS, respectively. The quiescent cells were then cultured for the indicated time periods in the absence or presence of NS1 protein (recombinant dengue virus serotype 2 non-structural protein 1 derived from strain Thailand/16681/84 and purchased from Enzo, ENZ-PRT105–0100, NY, USA), TGFβ (TGFβ1, Peprotech Nordic, Sweden), TNFα (Peprotech Nordic, Sweden), or combinations thereof. The NS1 protein was reported to be endotoxin-free, by using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (&lt;0.1 EU/ml in 25 μg of NS1). Conditioned media were collected and the hyaluronan levels were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described before [
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The specificity of this assay is based on the highly specific and irreversible binding of hyaluronan to immobilized G1 global domain of aggrecan.
