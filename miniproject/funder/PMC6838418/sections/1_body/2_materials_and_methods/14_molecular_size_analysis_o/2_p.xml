<p id="p0150">Analysis of the size of hyaluronan produced by endothelial microvascular conditioned media, was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis, essentially as described in the online protocol (PEGNAC_HA_Size; NHLBI award number PO1HL107147). Briefly, the supernatants of differentiated TIME cells treated, or not, with NS1 were collected after 25 h and incubated with proteinase K (Ambion, Cat. No. #AM2546) at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/μl at 60 °C for 4 h. Then 4 volumes of pre-chilled (−20 °C) 100% ethanol were added to each sample, followed by incubation overnight at −20 °C. Samples were then centrifuged (4000 rpm for 10 min, room temperature) and the pellets were washed by 1 ml pre-chilled (−20 °C) 75% ethanol. Then the suspensions were centrifuged and the supernatant was removed with a pipette. After the pellets had air-dried for 20 min at room temperature, 200 μl of 100 mM ammonium acetate (Sigma, Cat. No. #A1542) was added to each sample, followed by vortexing and a short spin down. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, proteinase K was heat inactivated at 100 °C for 5 min. Then the samples were chilled on ice for 5 min and nucleic acids were digested by DNase (25 U/μl, overnight at 37 °C). The DNase was then inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min and samples were precipitated again by pre-chilled 100% ethanol (overnight, −20 °C). The samples were then centrifuged, the supernatants discarded, and the pellets washed with 1 ml pre-chilled (−20 °C) 75% ethanol. After another centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant were discarded, and samples were left to air-dry (20 min). Pellets were re-suspended by adding 100 μl of 100 mM ammonium acetate, then lyophilized on a centrifugal vacuum concentrator, re-suspended in 15 μl of 10 M formamide, and left overnight at 4 °C. Then the samples were loaded on a 2% agarose gel (SeaKem GTG Agarose, made with TAE buffer), and electrophoresed at 100 V (constant voltage) for 50 min. Hyaluronan standards of known sizes were run in parallel (1000 kDa and 480 kDa, Q-Med and Pharmacia, respectively, Uppsala, Sweden; 120 kDa, Hylumed Medical, Genzyme, MA, USA; 30 kDa, Fidia Farmaceutici S.p.A., Italy) [

 <sub>2</sub>O. After incubation overnight at room temperature in the dark, the gel staining solution was replaced by dH
 <sub>2</sub>O. After 1 h de-staining, the gel was scanned (Epson).
