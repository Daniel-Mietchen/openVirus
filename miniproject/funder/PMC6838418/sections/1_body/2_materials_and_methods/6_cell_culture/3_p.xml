 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The cells were cultured in endothelial growth medium (EBM-2, PromoCell, Cat. No. C-22221, Heidelberg, Germany), supplemented with 5% or 2% (under starvation) fetal calf serum (FCS), 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.5 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor, 10 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor, 20 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor, 1 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 0.2 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and used between passages 18 and 30. Under proliferative conditions, TIME cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> on plastic dishes, and under differentiating conditions cells were grown on Matrigel (13.5 mg/ml; Corning, Cat. No. 356231, Bedford, MA, USA) forming vessel-like structures. Both fibroblasts and endothelial TIME cells were free from mycoplasma contamination.
