   <title>Evidence before this study</title>
   <p id="p0010">Dengue virus infection, transmitted by mosquitos, rapidly increases due to global climate warming and international travelling, and causes suffering and consumes health care resources. A subset of patients, e.g. adults exposed to second infection or being older than 65 years, and infants born by dengue-immune mothers, experience a life-threatening condition including exacerbated inflammation and vascular hyper-permeability. The viral protein NS1 plays a crucial role in these biological outcomes. No suitable animal model exists that recapitulate the human immune-pathological events involved in severe dengue, and there is no effective and safe dengue vaccine. Thus, early biomarkers that can predict severe dengue disease are lacking, and the mechanisms involved in the vascular hyper-permeability have not been elucidated.</p>

   <title>Added value of this study</title>
   <p id="p0015">We have studied a large cohort of dengue virus infected patients (Taiwan outbreaks 2014, 2015), and have shown that high circulating NS1 levels, indicative of disease severity, correlate with high concentration of serum hyaluronan. Moreover, hyaluronan levels higher than 70 ng/ml during early infection, was found to be an independent predictor for occurrence of warning signs and thus risk of severe dengue fever. The NS1-induced increase in the levels of polydisperse hyaluronan and its altered organization, together with suppression of its receptor CD44, were found to be accompanied by perturbed endothelial intercellular junctions, including alterations of actin filaments and VE-cadherin and increased paracellular gaps, and enhanced vascular permeability.</p>

   <title>Impact</title>
   <p id="p0020">Our findings provide physicians with a useful tool to identify patients at risk and in need of hospitalization. Moreover our findings suggest a mechanism for the increased vascular permeability in severe dengue, and identify hyaluronan-CD44 signaling as a possible target for therapy to alleviate vascular leakage during dengue virus infection.</p>
