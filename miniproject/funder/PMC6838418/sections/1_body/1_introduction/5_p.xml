<p id="p0040">The rapid spreading of dengue virus infections has become a public health concern, and about 50% of the world's population is now at risk of infection [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Dengue is a vector-borne virus that is transmitted to human host by mosquito skin bites. Clinically, dengue infection is characterized by febrile, critical and recovery phases. Moreover, the disease is characterized by vascular leakage and sometimes a severe life-threatening bleeding that has been linked to exacerbated immune cell activation [

 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>]. High levels of the dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) in the circulation, induces release of inflammatory cytokines from infected monocytes and T cells via binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) receptors, promoting vascular leakage [

 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>]. NS1 affects the integrity of endothelial cell monolayers by disruption of components in the endothelial glycocalyx layer [

 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying the role of NS1 in the pathogenesis of severe dengue infection are not well understood [
