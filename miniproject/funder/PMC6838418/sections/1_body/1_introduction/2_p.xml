<p id="p0025">The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is present in virtually all tissues in the body, and plays key roles in regulation of tissue homeostasis, including vascular integrity [

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. An aberrant accumulation of hyaluronan occurs in inflammation/infection and cancer, conditions where a plethora of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines are released [

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hyaluronan induces signaling through its interactions with cell surface hyaluronan receptors, including CD44 and RHAMM [

 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>], resulting in altered cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. The dysregulated synthesis and turnover of hyaluronan in disease is mediated by synthetic (HAS1, HAS2, HAS3) and catabolic (HYAL1,2 and the KIAA1199 homolog TMEM2) enzymes, which are regulated in response to growth factors and cytokines, as well as bacterial and viral infections [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The newly synthesized hyaluronan is extruded through the plasma membrane for assembly into pericellular or extracellular matrices [
