<p id="p0030">Hyaluronan is turned over rapidly by internalization via CD44 expressed by stromal cells and macrophages, and via the hyaluronan receptor LYVE1 in lymphatic endothelial cells [

 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In inflamed tissues, the amount of hyaluronan increases as a result of altered biosynthesis, degradation and/or capacity for uptake locally and in lymph nodes, liver and kidneys [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], leading to enhanced release of hyaluronan into the general circulation. In blood vessels, some of the hyaluronan is incorporated in the endothelial glycocalyx layer primarily consisting of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronan which weaves into the glycocalyx interacting with CD44 in caveolae microdomains on the luminal side of the endothelium [

 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Caveolae microdomains are a special type of lipid rafts where hyaluronan-CD44 signaling takes place affecting actin regulation and contacts between endothelial cells by modulating the expression and distribution of intercellular junction proteins, such as VE-cadherin [
