High circulating levels of the viral protein NS1, indicative of disease severity, correlated with high concentrations of serum hyaluronan. NS1 exposure decreased the expression of CD44 in differentiating endothelial cells impairing the integrity of vessel-like structures, and promoted the synthesis of hyaluronan in dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells in synergy with dengue-induced pro-inflammatory mediators. Deposited hyaluronan-rich matrices around cells cultured in vitro recruited CD44-expressing macrophage-like cells, suggesting a mechanism for enhancement of inflammation. In cultured endothelial cells, perturbed hyaluronan-CD44 interactions enhanced endothelial permeability through modulation of VE-cadherin and cytoskeleton re-organization, and exacerbated the NS1-induced disruption of endothelial integrity.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Pharmacological targeting of hyaluronan biosynthesis and/or its CD44-mediated signaling may limit the life-threatening vascular leakiness during moderate-to-severe dengue virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Fund</title><p>This work was supported in part by grants from the <funding-source id="gts0005">Swedish Cancer Society</funding-source> (2018/337; 2016/445), the <funding-source id="gts0010">Swedish Research Council</funding-source> (2015-02757), the <funding-source id="gts0015">Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research</funding-source>, <funding-source id="gts0020">Uppsala University</funding-source>, <funding-source id="gts0025">the Ministry of Science and Technology</funding-source>, Taiwan (106&#x02013;2314-B-037-088- and 106&#x02013;2915-I-037-501-), <funding-source id="gts0030">Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital</funding-source> (KMUH103-3&#x0202f;T05) and <funding-source id="gts0035">Academy of Finland</funding-source>.

A subset of patients, e.g. adults exposed to second infection or being older than 65&#x0202f;years, and infants born by dengue-immune mothers, experience a life-threatening condition including exacerbated inflammation and vascular hyper-permeability. The viral protein NS1 plays a crucial role in these biological outcomes. No suitable animal model exists that recapitulate the human immune-pathological events involved in severe dengue, and there is no effective and safe dengue vaccine. Thus, early biomarkers that can predict severe dengue disease are lacking, and the mechanisms involved in the vascular hyper-permeability have not been elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="p0015">We have studied a large cohort of dengue virus infected patients (Taiwan outbreaks 2014, 2015), and have shown that high circulating NS1 levels, indicative of disease severity, correlate with high concentration of serum hyaluronan.

The NS1-induced increase in the levels of polydisperse hyaluronan and its altered organization, together with suppression of its receptor CD44, were found to be accompanied by perturbed endothelial intercellular junctions, including alterations of actin filaments and VE-cadherin and increased paracellular gaps, and enhanced vascular permeability.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Impact</title><p id="p0020">Our findings provide physicians with a useful tool to identify patients at risk and in need of hospitalization.

An aberrant accumulation of hyaluronan occurs in inflammation/infection and cancer, conditions where a plethora of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines are released [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hyaluronan induces signaling through its interactions with cell surface hyaluronan receptors, including CD44 and RHAMM [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>], resulting in altered cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. The dysregulated synthesis and turnover of hyaluronan in disease is mediated by synthetic (HAS1, HAS2, HAS3) and catabolic (HYAL1,2 and the KIAA1199 homolog TMEM2) enzymes, which are regulated in response to growth factors and cytokines, as well as bacterial and viral infections [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The newly synthesized hyaluronan is extruded through the plasma membrane for assembly into pericellular or extracellular matrices [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Hyaluronan is turned over rapidly by internalization via CD44 expressed by stromal cells and macrophages, and via the hyaluronan receptor LYVE1 in lymphatic endothelial cells [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>]. The hyaluronan levels in the serum of middle-aged persons is normally 30&#x02013;40&#x0202f;ng/ml, but increases during certain pathological conditions [<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In inflamed tissues, the amount of hyaluronan increases as a result of altered biosynthesis, degradation and/or capacity for uptake locally and in lymph nodes, liver and kidneys [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], leading to enhanced release of hyaluronan into the general circulation. In blood vessels, some of the hyaluronan is incorporated in the endothelial glycocalyx layer primarily consisting of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronan which weaves into the glycocalyx interacting with CD44 in caveolae microdomains on the luminal side of the endothelium [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Serum hyaluronan levels correlated negatively to platelet counts (Fig. S1 b) and positively to NS1 plasma concentrations (Fig. S1 c). Increased hyaluronan levels are also seen in patients with other diseases, e.g. diabetes. Subdivision of our cohort in patients with (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;23) and without (<italic>n</italic>&#x0202f;=&#x0202f;85) diabetes, revealed borderline elevation of hyaluronan levels in both febrile and critical phases (Fig. S1 d). The sensitivity and specificity for febrile phase hyaluronan level were 76% and 55%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity for critical phase hyaluronan level were 65% and 74%, respectively (Fig. S1 e). Furthermore, we divided the 108 patients into 4 groups according to their febrile phase (early) serum hyaluronan levels (0&#x02013;25, 25&#x02013;50, 50&#x02013;75, 75&#x02013;100 percentiles ranking, respectively).

The latter three symptoms and signs are typical manifestations of plasma leakage in dengue patients. These findings demonstrate that the serum hyaluronan level is a useful biomarker to predict the occurrence of warning signs during the entire disease course. Thus, the febrile phase serum hyaluronan level can be used to predict the progress of disease, and thereby determine which dengue patients need hospitalization.</p></sec><sec id="s0125"><label>3.3</label><title>Exposure to dengue protein NS1 differentially modulates hyaluronan biosynthesis and CD44 expression in dermal fibroblasts and microvascular endothelial cells</title><p id="p0205">To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the excessive accumulation of hyaluronan in serum of dengue-infected individuals, we investigated the effects of recombinant viral NS1 protein; the preparation contained monomeric and oligomeric forms as revealed by immunoblotting (Fig. S2 a).
