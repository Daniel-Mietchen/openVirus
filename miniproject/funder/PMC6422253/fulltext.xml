To identify the most promising cellular targets for a host-directed approach against influenza, we performed a comparative small interfering RNA (siRNA) loss-of-function screen of IV replication in A549 cells. Analysis of four different IV strains including a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 strain, an influenza B virus (IBV) and two human influenza A viruses (IAVs) revealed 133 genes required by all four IV strains. According to gene enrichment analyses, these strain-independent host genes were particularly enriched for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. In addition, 360 strain-specific genes were identified with distinct patterns of usage for IAVs versus IBV and human versus avian IVs. The strain-independent host genes served to define 43 experimental and otherwise clinically approved drugs, targeting reportedly fourteen of the encoded host factors. Amongst the approved drugs, the urea-based kinase inhibitors (UBKIs) regorafenib and sorafenib exhibited a superior therapeutic window of high IV antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity. Both UBKIs appeared to block a cell signaling pathway involved in IV replication after internalization, yet prior to vRNP uncoating. Interestingly, both compounds were active also against unrelated viruses including cowpox virus (CPXV), hantavirus (HTV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and showed antiviral efficacy in human primary respiratory cells. An <italic>in vitro</italic> resistance development analysis for regorafenib failed to detect IV resistance development against this drug. Taken together, the otherwise clinically approved UBKIs regorafenib and sorafenib possess high and broad-spectrum antiviral activity along with substantial robustness against resistance development and thus constitute attractive host-directed drug candidates against a range of viral infections including influenza.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Conventional medications against influenza infections, including vaccination and antiviral drug therapy, are targeted against viral determinants&#x02013;an approach collectively referred to as pathogen-directed. However, influenza viruses mutate fast and quickly develop resistance to these pathogen-directed treatments. An alternative, yet not well established, is to block host cellular molecules required by the virus to successfully multiply. Such a host-directed approach is anticipated to be more robust against the development of drug resistance. This notion is founded on the different modes of action of the two principal approaches: Virus-directed therapeutics target the virus itself. Thus, just a single mutation could abrogate sensitivity to a virus-directed therapeutic. In contrast, it is unlikely that viruses can easily circumvent a pharmacological blockage of a cellular factor by means of just a few mutations. Instead, the virus needs to either exploit an immediate parallel cellular pathway or adjust its replication cycle to a different cellular factor&#x02013;the latter being a process likely to require multiple mutations, if possible at all. To identify the most promising targets for a host-directed therapy, we performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen with four different influenza virus strains using a lung epithelial cell line. Subsequently, we tested a series of drugs, specific for the products of the genes that are required for replication of all four influenza virus strains tested. Regorafenib and sorafenib, two chemically related urea-based kinase inhibitors already clinically approved for cancer treatment, turned out to be effective inhibitors of all influenza viruses and displayed low cytotoxicity. These drugs blocked viral replication at an early stage of the life cycle not only in cell lines but also in human primary respiratory cells. Moreover, these drugs exhibited high efficacy even against unrelated viruses. In addition, no development of resistance was observed against regorafenib, which was used in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay representatively of urea-based kinase inhibitors. Our results suggest that regorafenib and sorafenib are promising drug candidates for a host-directed therapy of influenza and other viral infections.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>BMBF</institution></funding-source><award-id>FK0316180C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Thomas F.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB740HE3763/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrmann</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the German Ministry of Education and Research through the eBio project ViroSign (FK0316180C) to TFM and AH, and by the German Research Foundation (SFB740 HE3763/15) to AH.

Epidemics are usually caused by human IAV strains of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, as well as IBVs. The source for influenza pandemics has in the past often been provided by avian IAVs that managed to adapt to humans as a host. Current preventive and therapeutic measures target viral proteins and include vaccination as well as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Unfortunately, a single mutation of the targeted site can lower the efficacy of a virus-directed drug by two to three orders of magnitude. Consequently, isolates resistant against all approved DAAs have been identified [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need for new anti-IV drugs which are less prone to the development of resistance.</p><p>IAVs and IBVs encode only 10 to 16 proteins and rely heavily on various host cellular functions to multiply. As cellular proteins are integral parts of the viral life cycle, they also represent medical intervention points. The CCR5-inhibitor maraviroc, which is used in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus infection, provides the proof-of-concept for host-directed therapy of an infectious disease [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The expected advantage of targeting cellular factors over viral factors is that resistance is less likely to develop: even if the virus mutates, the cellular protein will remain blocked. The only way for the virus to develop drug resistance is to utilize alternative cellular pathways. Such alternatives exist for certain pathways, highlighted by the ability of IVs to adapt to different types of sialic acids as receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or different importins for nuclear import of viral ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs) [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there might also be cellular bottlenecks to which development of resistance is impeded. One example for a drug targeting such a bottleneck is the microRNA-122 inhibitor miravirsen, which underwent clinical trials for treatment of hepatitis C virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and for which a very high barrier against development of resistance was observed [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To systematically identify the human genes exploited by IVs, several loss-of-function screens have been conducted by independent laboratories including our own [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In these studies, more than 1,000 genes have been proposed to be growth relevant. However, mainly IAVs of subtype H1N1, such as A/WSN/1933(H1N1) (WSN) and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1), have been used in the published screens. Thus, it is unclear to which extent the published genes are relevant for other IV types, such as H3N2 IAV, avian-adapted IAVs, or IBVs, and which genes are best suited for a pan-specific host-directed therapy of influenza.</p><p>Here, we performed a large-scale, comparative small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen with a human H1N1 IAV (WSN), a human H3N2 IAV (A/Panama/2007/1999(H3N2), PAN), an avian H5N1 IAV (A/Vietnam/1203/2004(H5N1), VN), and an IBV (B/Thuringia/02/2006xB/Vienna/33/2006, THW) to identify suitable targets for a host-directed influenza therapy.</p><p>Next, we screened drugs targeting genes required for replication of all four viruses for antiviral activity. Costs for development of a new drug are tremendously high. A more cost-efficient way to generate drugs for a new indication is to repurpose existing drugs approved for other indications. Successful examples of repurposed drugs include bupropion, chlorpromazine, and celecoxib [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We identified the UBKIs regorafenib [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and sorafenib [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]&#x02013;approved for specific cancer indications&#x02013;as highly promising candidates for a host-directed therapy of influenza.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Comparative siRNA screen identifies IV strain-independent host factors</title><p>The siRNA screen was set up as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. Based on previous loss-of-function studies with IVs, we designed an siRNA library targeting 128 genes identified to be growth relevant in at least two out of a panel of six published screens [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the 461 genes identified in the primary screen of our own group [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and 717 genes associated with the human kinome, since kinase genes were the most overrepresented gene category in several loss-of-function-screens [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In total, this library targeted 1,208 genes with 3,482 siRNAs (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s013">S1 Table</xref>). We first screened the library for immunogenicity and cytotoxicity to exclude siRNAs which induce an interferon (IFN) response and cause cell death, respectively. We identified 678 cytotoxic siRNAs, but no immunogenic siRNAs. In total, we excluded 211 genes from further analyses due to the cytotoxicity of the corresponding siRNAs, leaving 997 genes. Subsequently, the library was screened for production of infectious virus progeny. First, the raw data of the virus replication screens were normalized to a non-targeting siRNA and an siRNA targeting a proviral gene (IAV: viral NP gene, IBV: cellular gene XPO1). Then, the normalized data for all siRNAs targeting a given gene were summarized by the collective mean and the collective strictly standardized mean difference (cSSMD), as described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Employing collective mean &#x0003e; 0.5 and cSSMD &#x02265; 1 as cut-off criteria, we identified between 258 (WSN) and 468 (VN) proviral genes for each virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A set of 133 genes was identified as proviral in all four virus replication screens (strain-independent genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Based on the average effect of the siRNAs tested, knockdown of thirteen genes impaired viral replication by an order of magnitude or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We analyzed these strain-independent genes for enrichment of gene groups using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and/or Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity H Systems; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com/">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).

Taking these results together, the nucleocytoplasmic transport appears to be the cellular process which is most sensitive to perturbation with respect to replication across all IV strains tested. Consequently, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking likely represents an attractive target for the development of host-directed therapeutics. Further highly sensitive processes include cell cycle regulation, RNA splicing, translation, and tRNA charging. Interestingly, the latter has not been identified as enriched in previous studies. The full results of the screens on siRNA and gene level, as well as the gene group enrichment analyses, are shown in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s014">S2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s017">S5</xref> Tables.

By clustering these genes we found four clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).

We screened 39 of these drugs and four related compounds for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity in A549 cells. Seventeen drugs inhibited multiple round replication of WSN with an IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003c; 10 &#x003bc;M (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s023">S11 Table</xref>). For fourteen of these highly active compounds, the selectivity index (SI) was &#x0003e; 10, which we considered a useful therapeutic window. Three of these drugs targeted the gene FLT4, which was also among the top three hits in the siRNA screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Therefore, we decided to focus on two of the FLT4 inhibitors&#x02014;regorafenib and sorafenib&#x02014;in more detail.

While the virus titer in the supernatant of DMSO-treated cells increased up to 8 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU/ml until 48 h post infection (p.i.), we could not detect virus in the supernatant of regorafenib- or sorafenib-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

Among these strain-independent genes, those involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, cell cycle regulation, RNA splicing, translation, and tRNA charging were highly enriched.</p><p>While several of these gene requirements have been previously noted [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], tRNA charging has not been seen in previous screens of human IAVs [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The exact implication of tRNA charging in IV replication remains to be characterized. Yet, it might affect translation since charged tRNAs constitute the substrates for protein synthesis. According to our results, the cellular process most strictly required for IV replication across all strains is the nucleocytoplasmic transport. Therefore, agents blocking nucleocytoplasmic transport represent attractive future candidates for a host-directed therapy of influenza. In accordance with this, promising results have been published with the exportin 1 inhibitor verdinexor [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, a recent study demonstrated that IAVs quickly become resistant to depletion of importin-&#x003b1;7, another factor involved in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, when an in vivo model is used and that the resistant virus even gained higher virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to further explore the therapeutic potential of cellular factors in general as antiviral drug target.</p><p>The <italic>de novo</italic> development of drugs is a long and expensive process, making the repurposing of pharmaceuticals for new indications an attractive strategy. By drug database screening, we identified several approved or experimental drugs targeting strain-independent host factors. Most of these drugs were screened in A549 cells for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity rendering fourteen with a potential for therapeutic application. We focused on the FLT4 inhibitors regorafenib and sorafenib and found that in addition to VEGFR3 at least three other RTKs (FGFR1, VEGFR1, PDGFRB) targeted by these drugs are relevant to IV replication. Therefore, the antiviral activity of regorafenib and sorafenib is likely to be due to the inhibition of several target proteins in parallel, and may even include further kinases. Both drugs interfered with fusion of the viral and the endosomal membranes. Impairment of an early step in the IV life cycle, such as fusion, necessarily would affect all downstream steps. Consequently, it remains an open question if regorafenib and sorafenib affect additional (post-fusion) steps of viral replication. Interestingly, the broad-range RTK inhibitor genistein as well as a broad-range RTK inhibitor mix (containing the VEGFR/PDGFR inhibitor SU4312), have been shown to inhibit the uptake of IV virions [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], indicating that while some RTKs are required for internalization, others are required for fusion. It is possible that regorafenib and sorafenib inhibit kinases involved in endosomal maturation or block kinases that phosphorylate the V-ATPase subunits, since their phosphorylation status regulates their activity and thus endosomal acidification [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Future studies will shed more light on the mechanisms involved in the UBKI-mediated block of fusion.</p><p>Regorafenib and sorafenib not only affected IV but also HTV, VSV, and HSV1. The effects on viruses using the endocytic route were stronger than the effect on those mainly fusing directly with the plasma membrane. The effect of regorafenib on avian IV was milder than on human IV. This was unexpected, since we incorporated regorafenib in our small molecule screen because one of its targets, FLT4, was universally required in the siRNA screen. Possibly, other targets of regorafenib (s. above) are strain-specific. The molecular mechanism underlying the differential effect of regorafenib on human and avian IVs is not clear but appears to be independent of the fusion pH of the HA protein of the different viruses. Recent studies showed that prior to fusion, pH-dependent conformational rearrangements&#x02013;especially of the M1 protein&#x02013;take place within the lumen of the virion, and these rearrangements are important for efficient uncoating [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As these processes require luminal acidification, they are dependent on the activity of the viral M2 ion channel. Thus, the IV strain-specific effect of regorafenib might be due to differences in the M1 or M2 proteins. Another possibility is that, as discussed above, regorafenib impairs steps in the viral replication cycle downstream of fusion, and in a strain-specific manner. Nevertheless, due to the broad antiviral activity, regorafenib and sorafenib might be suited for a host-directed therapy of various viral diseases. This indicates a clear benefit compared to current influenza treatments, which are only effective against IV. In addition, both drugs efficiently inhibited IV replication in primary human respiratory cells, implying that our findings might indeed have a physiological relevance.</p><p>A recent study investigated the impact of 273 kinase inhibitors on IAV replication and reported only intermediate effects for regorafenib and sorafenib [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The cause of this discrepancy is not clear but might be due to differences in the assay setup. Furthermore, the previous study used an avian IV strain, and avian IVs are less sensitive to regorafenib treatment according to our results. In line with our findings, sorafenib mono-treatment has previously been found to impair replication of various viruses such as adenovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71, hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, mumps virus, polyomavirus BK, Rift Valley fever virus, and West Nile virus, respectively, and combinatorial treatment with sildenafil led also to inhibition of dengue virus, rabies virus, and yellow fever virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, regorafenib treatment has been reported to affect adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and mumps virus, as well [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, different mechanisms of antiviral activity have been described, including inhibition of entry, viral protein translation, and viral egress [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. An effect of these drugs on viral fusion has, to our knowledge, not been reported so far. In conclusion, our study and the existing literature support the notion that regorafenib and sorafenib possess (A) broad antiviral activity and (B) different mechanisms of antiviral activity.</p><p>Surprisingly, the efficacy of regorafenib and sorafenib in primary cells from bronchi was much lower than in the pneumocyte-derived cell line A549. This difference might be related to the different origin of the cell types (bronchi versus alveoli) but also to the different degrees of nativeness (primary cells versus cell line). To explore this further, the effect of these drugs on IV replication should be tested in additional relevant primary cell types (from upper respiratory tract and alveoli), followed by a suitable <italic>in vivo</italic> model of IV replication. In an initial animal experiment, regorafenib showed a rather weak antiviral effect in mice. However, regorafenib also exhibits a considerably lower efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic> in murine compared to human cells. Thus, the preliminary <italic>in vivo</italic> data might underestimate regorafenib&#x02019;s true <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy in a system which resembles the human host more closely, e.g. the ferret [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Consequently, experiments with such highly authentic animal models need to be performed in a future study to better judge the clinical applicability of regorafenib and sorafenib.</p><p>Importantly, we did not observe development of resistance against regorafenib and sorafenib even after up to eight passages in cell culture. This indicates that UBKIs impose a strong barrier towards the development of viral resistance, exceeding the threshold of the viral M2 ion channel-directed drug amantadine, which occurs after three to five passages shown by us and others [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Interestingly, the passaged virus, that gained resistance to amantadine, now replicates at a higher rate compared to the initial virus. The mutation probably increases viral fitness slightly, in line with the fact that all currently circulating pH1N1 viruses are resistant to amantadine, despite a lack of selection pressure since amantadine is no longer used for therapy [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In contrast, even after eight passages development of resistance to approved viral NA inhibitors, such as zanamivir, was neither observed by us nor are has it been reported by others, to our knowledge. To compare the resistance profiles of viral NA inhibitors and regorafenib/sorafenib, long-term studies need to be performed.</p><p>The current gold standard in influenza therapy are the DAAs oseltamivir and zanamivir, which target the viral neuraminidase. The IC<sub>50</sub> of these drugs is in the low nanomolar range [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We observed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3 nM for zanamivir in our experimental system, which outperforms regorafenib and sorafenib. However, oseltamivir and zanamivir lack activity against unrelated viruses. Furthermore, resistance against oseltamivir and zanamivir has been reported in the clinic [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, regorafenib and sorafenib might represent a valuable alternative to the current standard.</p><p>An existing uncertainty of sorafenib as host-directed therapeutic against influenza is its immune modulatory effects. An impairment of dendritic cell differentiation and function has been observed [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In case of T cells and natural killer cells, inhibitory but also stimulatory effects have been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Nevertheless, the seroprotection rates induced by influenza vaccination do not differ between cancer patients undergoing sorafenib treatment and controls [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The effects of regorafenib on the immune response have not been thoroughly characterized yet. Although interference with the immune response represents a potential disadvantage for an antiviral drug, its use might nonetheless be beneficial as long as the antiviral effects significantly overcompensate for the immunomodulatory effects. This, however, can only be addressed in suitable animal models.</p><p>For approval of cancer therapeutics, such as regorafenib and sorafenib, more severe adverse events are tolerable than for influenza drugs considering influenza is usually not lethal. Although the therapeutic margin of regorafenib/sorafenib is indeed lower compared to standard anti-influenza drugs, such as zanamivir, it is still larger than that of ribavirin, a drug approved for treatment of several virus infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The most prominent side effects of regorafenib and sorafenib are rash and hypertension. However, both UBKIs are usually administered over weeks or months during cancer therapy, whereas a few days might be sufficient in case of influenza treatment. Although short-term treatment would not necessarily prevent any occurrence of adverse events, the duration of side effects would be shortened and the impairment of patients&#x02019; quality of lives lowered compared to cancer treatment. In addition, it might be possible to apply both UBKIs locally by inhalation, in contrast to the systemic administration used for cancer therapy, which would allow lower dosing (relative to the bodyweight) and thus potentially reduce adverse events. Furthermore, especially in cases of severe influenza or acute respiratory distress syndrome, the potential side effects of regorafenib/sorafenib may be acceptable. With the standard dosing regimen (160 mg, once daily), the plasma concentration of regorafenib reaches a maximum of 3.6 &#x003bc;M and stays above the IC<sub>50</sub> for IAV replication in A549 cells (i.e. &#x0003e; 0.89 &#x003bc;M) for at least 48 h [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Standard administration of sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily) achieves a plasma concentration of approximately 4 &#x003bc;M, which is stable for at least 24 h [<xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus, there is reason for confidence that regorafenib and sorafenib are viable treatment options.</p><p>In summary, our siRNA screening campaign identified nucleocytoplasmic transport as the host cellular process that is most strictly required for replication across all tested IV strains. Subsequent small molecule screening showed that the two UBKIs regorafenib and sorafenib have powerful broad range antiviral activity, are also efficacious in primary cells, and impose a barrier towards the development of resistant virus strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Ethical permissions</title><p>All animal work was conducted in accordance with European regulations and approved by the Berlin state authorities, Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Gesundheit und Soziales (Reg No: G0206/12 and 0321/08).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Cells</title><p>A549 adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelials (ATCC CCL-185) were normally grown in DMEM media (Thermo Fischer) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (hiFCS, Biochrom;) (DMEM complete medium).
