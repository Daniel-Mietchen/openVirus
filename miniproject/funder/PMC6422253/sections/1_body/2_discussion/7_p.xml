<p>Surprisingly, the efficacy of regorafenib and sorafenib in primary cells from bronchi was much lower than in the pneumocyte-derived cell line A549. This difference might be related to the different origin of the cell types (bronchi versus alveoli) but also to the different degrees of nativeness (primary cells versus cell line). To explore this further, the effect of these drugs on IV replication should be tested in additional relevant primary cell types (from upper respiratory tract and alveoli), followed by a suitable 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model of IV replication. In an initial animal experiment, regorafenib showed a rather weak antiviral effect in mice. However, regorafenib also exhibits a considerably lower efficacy 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in murine compared to human cells. Thus, the preliminary 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data might underestimate regorafenibâ€™s true 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy in a system which resembles the human host more closely, e.g. the ferret [
