<p>A recent study investigated the impact of 273 kinase inhibitors on IAV replication and reported only intermediate effects for regorafenib and sorafenib [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The cause of this discrepancy is not clear but might be due to differences in the assay setup. Furthermore, the previous study used an avian IV strain, and avian IVs are less sensitive to regorafenib treatment according to our results. In line with our findings, sorafenib mono-treatment has previously been found to impair replication of various viruses such as adenovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71, hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, mumps virus, polyomavirus BK, Rift Valley fever virus, and West Nile virus, respectively, and combinatorial treatment with sildenafil led also to inhibition of dengue virus, rabies virus, and yellow fever virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, regorafenib treatment has been reported to affect adenovirus, coxsackievirus, and mumps virus, as well [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, different mechanisms of antiviral activity have been described, including inhibition of entry, viral protein translation, and viral egress [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. An effect of these drugs on viral fusion has, to our knowledge, not been reported so far. In conclusion, our study and the existing literature support the notion that regorafenib and sorafenib possess (A) broad antiviral activity and (B) different mechanisms of antiviral activity.
