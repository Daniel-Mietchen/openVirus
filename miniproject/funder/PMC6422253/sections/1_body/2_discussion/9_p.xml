<p>The current gold standard in influenza therapy are the DAAs oseltamivir and zanamivir, which target the viral neuraminidase. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of these drugs is in the low nanomolar range [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We observed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3 nM for zanamivir in our experimental system, which outperforms regorafenib and sorafenib. However, oseltamivir and zanamivir lack activity against unrelated viruses. Furthermore, resistance against oseltamivir and zanamivir has been reported in the clinic [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, regorafenib and sorafenib might represent a valuable alternative to the current standard.
