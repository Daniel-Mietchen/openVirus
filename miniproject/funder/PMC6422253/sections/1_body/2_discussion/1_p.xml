<p>We present here a large-scale comparative loss-of-function screen for IV replication. We also included an avian IAV strain and an IBV strain. An avian strain has only been tested in one other published screen [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereas no IBV strain was in the focus of previous loss-of-function screens. Due to the comparative nature of the present screen, we were able to detect strain-specific differences in host factor requirement. The number identified, several hundred strain-specific genes and gene groups, was unexpectedly large. The impact of these genes and gene groups on viral replication differed in many instances either between the three human IVs versus the avian IV strain and between the three IAVs versus the IBV strains. These differences likely reflect evolutionary divergence (IAV vs. IBV) or adaptation to divergent hosts (human IV vs. avian IV).
