<p>Apart from identifying differences between IVs, the present study was designed to identify genes and cellular processes which are conserved parts of the viral replication cycle across the different types of IVs. We identified 133 host cell genes that are strictly required for replication of all four IV strains tested. Among these strain-independent genes, those involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, cell cycle regulation, RNA splicing, translation, and tRNA charging were highly enriched.</p>
