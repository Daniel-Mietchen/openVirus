<p>Importantly, we did not observe development of resistance against regorafenib and sorafenib even after up to eight passages in cell culture. This indicates that UBKIs impose a strong barrier towards the development of viral resistance, exceeding the threshold of the viral M2 ion channel-directed drug amantadine, which occurs after three to five passages shown by us and others [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Interestingly, the passaged virus, that gained resistance to amantadine, now replicates at a higher rate compared to the initial virus. The mutation probably increases viral fitness slightly, in line with the fact that all currently circulating pH1N1 viruses are resistant to amantadine, despite a lack of selection pressure since amantadine is no longer used for therapy [

In contrast, even after eight passages development of resistance to approved viral NA inhibitors, such as zanamivir, was neither observed by us nor are has it been reported by others, to our knowledge. To compare the resistance profiles of viral NA inhibitors and regorafenib/sorafenib, long-term studies need to be performed.
