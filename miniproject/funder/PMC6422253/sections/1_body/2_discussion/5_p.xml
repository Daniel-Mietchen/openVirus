<p>Regorafenib and sorafenib not only affected IV but also HTV, VSV, and HSV1. The effects on viruses using the endocytic route were stronger than the effect on those mainly fusing directly with the plasma membrane. The effect of regorafenib on avian IV was milder than on human IV. This was unexpected, since we incorporated regorafenib in our small molecule screen because one of its targets, FLT4, was universally required in the siRNA screen. Possibly, other targets of regorafenib (s. above) are strain-specific. The molecular mechanism underlying the differential effect of regorafenib on human and avian IVs is not clear but appears to be independent of the fusion pH of the HA protein of the different viruses. Recent studies showed that prior to fusion, pH-dependent conformational rearrangements–especially of the M1 protein–take place within the lumen of the virion, and these rearrangements are important for efficient uncoating [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As these processes require luminal acidification, they are dependent on the activity of the viral M2 ion channel. Thus, the IV strain-specific effect of regorafenib might be due to differences in the M1 or M2 proteins. Another possibility is that, as discussed above, regorafenib impairs steps in the viral replication cycle downstream of fusion, and in a strain-specific manner. Nevertheless, due to the broad antiviral activity, regorafenib and sorafenib might be suited for a host-directed therapy of various viral diseases. This indicates a clear benefit compared to current influenza treatments, which are only effective against IV. In addition, both drugs efficiently inhibited IV replication in primary human respiratory cells, implying that our findings might indeed have a physiological relevance.
