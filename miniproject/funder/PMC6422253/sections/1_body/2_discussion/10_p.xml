<p>An existing uncertainty of sorafenib as host-directed therapeutic against influenza is its immune modulatory effects. An impairment of dendritic cell differentiation and function has been observed [

Although interference with the immune response represents a potential disadvantage for an antiviral drug, its use might nonetheless be beneficial as long as the antiviral effects significantly overcompensate for the immunomodulatory effects. This, however, can only be addressed in suitable animal models.
