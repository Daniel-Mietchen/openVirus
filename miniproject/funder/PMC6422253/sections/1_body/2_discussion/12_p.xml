<p>In summary, our siRNA screening campaign identified nucleocytoplasmic transport as the host cellular process that is most strictly required for replication across all tested IV strains. Subsequent small molecule screening showed that the two UBKIs regorafenib and sorafenib have powerful broad range antiviral activity, are also efficacious in primary cells, and impose a barrier towards the development of resistant virus strains.</p>
