<p>While several of these gene requirements have been previously noted [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], tRNA charging has not been seen in previous screens of human IAVs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The exact implication of tRNA charging in IV replication remains to be characterized. Yet, it might affect translation since charged tRNAs constitute the substrates for protein synthesis. According to our results, the cellular process most strictly required for IV replication across all strains is the nucleocytoplasmic transport. Therefore, agents blocking nucleocytoplasmic transport represent attractive future candidates for a host-directed therapy of influenza. In accordance with this, promising results have been published with the exportin 1 inhibitor verdinexor [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, a recent study demonstrated that IAVs quickly become resistant to depletion of importin-Î±7, another factor involved in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, when an in vivo model is used and that the resistant virus even gained higher virulence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to further explore the therapeutic potential of cellular factors in general as antiviral drug target.
