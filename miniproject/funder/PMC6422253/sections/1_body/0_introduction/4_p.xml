<p>Next, we screened drugs targeting genes required for replication of all four viruses for antiviral activity. Costs for development of a new drug are tremendously high. A more cost-efficient way to generate drugs for a new indication is to repurpose existing drugs approved for other indications. Successful examples of repurposed drugs include bupropion, chlorpromazine, and celecoxib [
