<p>IVs are the cause of seasonal epidemics with up to 500,000 fatalities per year [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] as well as occasional pandemics with increased infection and mortality rates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Epidemics are usually caused by human IAV strains of the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2, as well as IBVs. The source for influenza pandemics has in the past often been provided by avian IAVs that managed to adapt to humans as a host. Current preventive and therapeutic measures target viral proteins and include vaccination as well as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). Unfortunately, a single mutation of the targeted site can lower the efficacy of a virus-directed drug by two to three orders of magnitude. Consequently, isolates resistant against all approved DAAs have been identified [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need for new anti-IV drugs which are less prone to the development of resistance.
