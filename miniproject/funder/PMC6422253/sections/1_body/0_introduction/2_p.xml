<p>IAVs and IBVs encode only 10 to 16 proteins and rely heavily on various host cellular functions to multiply. As cellular proteins are integral parts of the viral life cycle, they also represent medical intervention points. The CCR5-inhibitor maraviroc, which is used in the therapy of human immunodeficiency virus infection, provides the proof-of-concept for host-directed therapy of an infectious disease [

The expected advantage of targeting cellular factors over viral factors is that resistance is less likely to develop: even if the virus mutates, the cellular protein will remain blocked. The only way for the virus to develop drug resistance is to utilize alternative cellular pathways. Such alternatives exist for certain pathways, highlighted by the ability of IVs to adapt to different types of sialic acids as receptors [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there might also be cellular bottlenecks to which development of resistance is impeded. One example for a drug targeting such a bottleneck is the microRNA-122 inhibitor miravirsen, which underwent clinical trials for treatment of hepatitis C virus infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and for which a very high barrier against development of resistance was observed [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To systematically identify the human genes exploited by IVs, several loss-of-function screens have been conducted by independent laboratories including our own [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In these studies, more than 1,000 genes have been proposed to be growth relevant. However, mainly IAVs of subtype H1N1, such as A/WSN/1933(H1N1) (WSN) and A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1), have been used in the published screens. Thus, it is unclear to which extent the published genes are relevant for other IV types, such as H3N2 IAV, avian-adapted IAVs, or IBVs, and which genes are best suited for a pan-specific host-directed therapy of influenza.
