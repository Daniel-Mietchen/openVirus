<p>Next, we assessed the breadth of regorafenib’s and sorafenib’s antiviral activity. First, we tested the compounds with a panel of six human and three avian IAVs as well as two IBVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Both drugs were active against all strains tested. However, regorafenib only had a moderate, statistically not significant effect on the avian IAVs. We speculated that the differences between the avian and the human IVs were due to differences in the acid stability of the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins: the less stable the HA protein, the higher the pH at which fusion takes place (and the less acidification of the endosomes is required for fusion) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we determined the fusion pH for a human IAV (PAN), an IBV (THW), and an avian IAV (A/Mallard/Germany/439/2004(H3N2), MAL) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). To our surprise, the fusion pH for THW and MAL was almost identical and the fusion pH of PAN was even higher. Thus, the HA protein of MAL is not more acid sensitive than that of PAN and THW. The molecular mechanism underlying the low sensitivity of avian IVs against regorafenib thus remains to be illuminated.
