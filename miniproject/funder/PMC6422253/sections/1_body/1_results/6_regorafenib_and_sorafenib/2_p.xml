<p>Next, we tested the effect of the UBKIs on the non-related viruses cowpox virus (CPXV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), hantavirus (HTV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). We observed strong effects on HTV, and VSV but only mild effects on CPXV and HSV1. This difference is likely due to the different mechanisms of entry between the viruses: HTV and VSV enter host cells exclusively via the endocytic route [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], whereas CPXV and HSV1 can enter by direct fusion with the cellular plasma membrane, as well as via the endocytic route [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Of note, we applied both inhibitors at 3 μM, as this dose was neither cytotoxic in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), used with CPXV, HSV1, and VSV, nor in HEL-derived megakaryocytes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s009">S9A Fig</xref>), used with HTV. In conclusion, regorafenib and sorafenib display antiviral activity against all viruses tested, particularly those that rely exclusively on the endocytic route.
