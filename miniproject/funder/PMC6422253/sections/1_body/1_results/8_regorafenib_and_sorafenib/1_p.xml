<p>Finally, we wanted to test the sensitivity of UBKIs to the development of resistant viruses, and we selected regorafenib and sorafenib as representative UBKIs. To this end, we passaged the IAV strain A/England/195/2009(H1N1) serially in MDCK cells in the presence of 3 μM of sorafenib. In addition, we included amantadine, an inhibitor of the viral M2 protein, and zanamivir, an FDA approved neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor as positive controls within this study. Since nearly all circulating IAV strains are already resistant to the group of adamantanes, we used a recombinant virus mutant that contains a mutation (N31S) within the viral M2 gene that makes the virus susceptible to amantadine treatment [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], a very important feature for serial passaging experiments. In congruence with previous studies that demonstrated full resistance to DAAs of the group of adamantanes within a few rounds of passaging, we observed resistance against amantadine after 3 passages. However, even after 8 passages no resistance development could be observed when virus replication was inhibited using sorafenib or zanamivir (
