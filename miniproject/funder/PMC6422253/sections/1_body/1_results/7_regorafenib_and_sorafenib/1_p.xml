<p>We next tested if regorafenib and sorafenib are also active in more physiological systems, such as mouse and human primary cells. Both UBKIs showed antiviral activity in mouse lung epithelial cells, however with lowered efficacy and increased cytotoxicity compared to human cells (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> in BALB/c mice. Regorafenib or vehicle was administered once daily via the oral route. Mice were infected intranasally with 4.4 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/animal, 2 h after the first administration of regorafenib or vehicle, respectively. Two days post-infection, mice were culled, and the viral load in the lungs was determined by plaque assay. In line with the results obtained with mouse lung epithelial cells, we observed a reduced, albeit not significantly changed viral load in the lungs of regorafenib-treated mice (
