<p>The siRNA screen was set up as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. Based on previous loss-of-function studies with IVs, we designed an siRNA library targeting 128 genes identified to be growth relevant in at least two out of a panel of six published screens [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the 461 genes identified in the primary screen of our own group [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and 717 genes associated with the human kinome, since kinase genes were the most overrepresented gene category in several loss-of-function-screens [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In total, this library targeted 1,208 genes with 3,482 siRNAs (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s013">S1 Table</xref>). We first screened the library for immunogenicity and cytotoxicity to exclude siRNAs which induce an interferon (IFN) response and cause cell death, respectively. We identified 678 cytotoxic siRNAs, but no immunogenic siRNAs. In total, we excluded 211 genes from further analyses due to the cytotoxicity of the corresponding siRNAs, leaving 997 genes. Subsequently, the library was screened for production of infectious virus progeny. First, the raw data of the virus replication screens were normalized to a non-targeting siRNA and an siRNA targeting a proviral gene (IAV: viral NP gene, IBV: cellular gene XPO1). Then, the normalized data for all siRNAs targeting a given gene were summarized by the collective mean and the collective strictly standardized mean difference (cSSMD), as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Employing collective mean &gt; 0.5 and cSSMD ≥ 1 as cut-off criteria, we identified between 258 (WSN) and 468 (VN) proviral genes for each virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A set of 133 genes was identified as proviral in all four virus replication screens (strain-independent genes) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Based on the average effect of the siRNAs tested, knockdown of thirteen genes impaired viral replication by an order of magnitude or more (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We analyzed these strain-independent genes for enrichment of gene groups using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and/or Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity H Systems; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). We combined the results depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref> and visualized them as interaction map (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Taking these results together, the nucleocytoplasmic transport appears to be the cellular process which is most sensitive to perturbation with respect to replication across all IV strains tested. Consequently, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking likely represents an attractive target for the development of host-directed therapeutics. Further highly sensitive processes include cell cycle regulation, RNA splicing, translation, and tRNA charging. Interestingly, the latter has not been identified as enriched in previous studies. The full results of the screens on siRNA and gene level, as well as the gene group enrichment analyses, are shown in Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s014">S2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s017">S5</xref> Tables. Of note, we did not identify any factor which was antiviral for all four strains, probably because our gene set was selected to identify proviral genes.
