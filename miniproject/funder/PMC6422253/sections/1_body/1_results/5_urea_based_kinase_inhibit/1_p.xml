<p>One of the first intracellular steps of the viral replication cycle is the fusion of the viral membrane with the endosomal membrane, a process that depends on endosomal acidification [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Again, we first tested the effect of regorafenib and sorafenib on the fate of the classical CME cargos EGF and transferrin, which also depends on endosomal acidification [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. EGF is typically degraded in lysosomes, whereas transferrin is recycled to the plasma membrane. As expected, the intracellular level of EGF (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s006">S6B Fig</xref>) gradually decreased over time in DMSO-treated cells. In contrast, treatment with regorafenib or sorafenib blocked the decrease in intracellular EGF and transferrin levels, most likely due to an impairment of endosomal acidification. Next, we directly characterized the effect of regorafenib and sorafenib on fusion of virus particles with the endosomal membrane. To this end, we simultaneously labeled IV particles with two lipophilic dyes generating a FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, DiOC18 (green) and Dil (red). Intact labeled virions appear red due to FRET from DiOC18 to DiI, whereas a shift towards green color occurs when the membranes fuse and the fluorophores become dispersed, reducing the FRET [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, our data suggest that both regorafenib and sorafenib impair cellular processes relevant for the fusion process, as indicated by qualitative (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g005">Fig 5G</xref>) were strongly affected upon regorafenib and sorafenib treatment.
