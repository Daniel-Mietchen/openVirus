<p>We wanted to identify the main step of the viral replication cycle that is blocked by regorafenib and sorafenib. The IV replication cycle starts with attachment of the virion by binding to sialic acid residues on the host cell surface [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Neither regorafenib nor sorafenib affected attachment, whereas 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (
 <italic>Cp</italic>) neuraminidase, an enzyme removing sialic acid residues from the cell surface, impaired this process considerably, as indicated by fluorescence microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Upon attachment, IV particles enter the cells mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], although macropinocytosis as an alternative entry route has been described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. First, we assessed the effect of regorafenib and sorafenib on the uptake of two conventional substrates of CME: epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transferrin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Neither of the two agents affected the internalization of EGF (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) or transferrin (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Accordingly, the internalization of virus particles was not affected by regorafenib or sorafenib treatment, as indicated by fluorescence microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that regorafenib and sorafenib do not affect the internalization of IV by host cells.
