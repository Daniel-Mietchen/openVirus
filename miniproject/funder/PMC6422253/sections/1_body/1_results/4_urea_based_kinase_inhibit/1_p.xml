<p>The gene FLT4 encodes the protein vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Both regorafenib and sorafenib belong to the class of urea-based kinase inhibitors (UBKIs), which are known to inhibit several other kinases as well as VEGFR3 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consequently, using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated knockout cell lines for the main targets of regorafenib/sorafenib and examined the effect on replication of the IV strain WSN. The strongest effect was observed with knockdown of FLT4, but silencing of FGFR1, FLT1 (encoding VEGFR1), and PDGFRB also markedly reduced viral replication (
