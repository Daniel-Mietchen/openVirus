<p>We extended our search from differentially required genes to differentially required pathways, cellular compartments, and molecular functions. For this, we first queried the Gene Ontology database [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the Reactome database [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for terms represented by ≥ 2 tested genes and again identified terms with strain-specific effects by a mixed effects model. Overall, 3,235 terms were represented by our siRNA library and 884 of these displayed significantly different effects on the four viral strains. Two processes for which the avian IV strain VN was less sensitive than the three IAVs were nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-кB) activation (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s019">S7 Table</xref>). Another cellular function with strain-dependent relevance is the cellular RNA polymerase activity, for which interference affected the IBV strain the most and the avian IV the least (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s020">S8 Table</xref>). In summary, we often observed strain-specific host cell genes or processes to differ between IAVs and the IBV, or between human IVs and the avian IV. The full list of differentially required genes and gene ontologies and pathways can be found in
