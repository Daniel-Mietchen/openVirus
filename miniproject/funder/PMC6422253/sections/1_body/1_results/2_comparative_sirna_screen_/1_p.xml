<p>Although the primary aim of this study was to identify genes universally required by all prototypes of IVs, we also searched for entities differentially required between the four viral strains. We therefore analyzed the data sets with a hierarchical statistical model based on linear mixed effects. Subsequently, we filtered the results and obtained 360 strain-specific genes. By clustering these genes we found four clusters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Genes in cluster 1 were especially relevant for the avian IAV VN but much less for the human H1N1 IAV WSN (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Genes in cluster 3 were especially relevant for VN and the human H3N2 IAV PAN but much less for THW (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Genes in cluster 4 were most essential to replication of THW but much less for VN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Twenty-one genes could not be assigned to any cluster (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Taking the results from the cluster analysis of the strain-specific genes together, most of the differences were identified between the IAVs and the IBV, or the human IVs and the avian IV.
