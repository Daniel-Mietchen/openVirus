<p>To identify drugs suitable for repositioning towards a host-directed anti-influenza therapy, we screened the 133 strain-independent pro-IV genes for approved drugs or drugs in clinical trials, using the Ingenuity database, identifying 41 drugs targeting 14 genes (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We screened 39 of these drugs and four related compounds for antiviral activity and cytotoxicity in A549 cells. Seventeen drugs inhibited multiple round replication of WSN with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 μM (Supplementary 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s023">S11 Table</xref>). For fourteen of these highly active compounds, the selectivity index (SI) was &gt; 10, which we considered a useful therapeutic window. Three of these drugs targeted the gene FLT4, which was also among the top three hits in the siRNA screen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Therefore, we decided to focus on two of the FLT4 inhibitors—regorafenib and sorafenib—in more detail. We determined the SIs of regorafenib and sorafenib to be 16 and 82, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), when adding the agents 2 h prior to infection. After quantifying the dose dependency of the antiviral effect of regorafenib and sorafenib, we investigated the time dependency of both compounds, employing the highest non-cytotoxic dose (3 μM each). While the virus titer in the supernatant of DMSO-treated cells increased up to 8 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/ml until 48 h post infection (p.i.), we could not detect virus in the supernatant of regorafenib- or sorafenib-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Subsequently, we compared preventive (2 h prior to infection) and therapeutic (4 h post infection) application of both drugs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Using the preventive approach, no virus could be detected with either of the two compounds. When applying the drugs therapeutically, a more than 10
 <sup>9</sup>-fold reduction of the viral load was observed with sorafenib, and no virus could be detected in the supernatant of regorafenib-treated cells.
