<p>A549 cells were washed with PBS and pre-incubated for 30 min with small molecules (3 μM), an equivalent of DMSO, or with 1.5 U/ml of neuraminidase from 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, under normal culture conditions. Cells were inoculated for 1 h at 4°C with 0.002 hemagglutination units per cell of IAV strain PAN labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 dye as described in ‘Labeling of IV with Alexa Fluor 647’. After removing unbound virus by washing with ice-cold PBS twice, cells were analyzed for virus attachment either qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy or quantitatively by flow cytometry. For quantitative analysis, cells were harvested by scraping and precipitated by centrifugation (1200 x g, 5 min, 4°C). For both analyses, cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde. For image acquisition, nuclei were stained with DAPI and mounted in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich), whereas samples for flow cytometry analyses were precipitated and resuspended in PBS again. Finally, either representative images were acquired on an inverted FV-1000 MPE laser scanning microscope (Olympus) using a 60x UPlanSApo water objective (numerical aperture 1.2) (Olympus) or Alexa Fluor 647 intensity was determined using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Three independent experiments were performed in duplicates and for each duplicate measurement 10,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.
