<p>As we did not observe a correlation of signals in the IFN induction assay and the virus replication assay (using the siRNA level data of the WSN screen, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007601.s012">S12 Fig</xref>), we regarded all sample siRNAs as non-inducers of IFN. The cut-off for cytotoxic siRNAs according to WST-1 assay was selected based on the point closest to (1,1) of a receiver operating characteristic curve using the siRNA level data of the WST-1 and the virus replication assay with IV strain WSN for Allstars and siPLK1. The cut-off for cytotoxic siRNAs according to the cell number determination assay was set as the meanâ€”3 x SD of the cell count for Allstars.
