<p>In contrast to the IFN induction, WST-1, and cell number determination assays, virus replication screens were not analyzed on siRNA but on gene level. For identification of genes required by all four IVs, NPI-normalized input data were used. Genes with collective mean &gt; 0.5 and cSSMD ≥ 1 were regarded as proviral. Genes with collective mean &lt; -1 and cSSMD ≤ 1 were regarded as antiviral. All other genes were regarded as neutral. Genes identified as proviral with all four IV strains tested are designated “strain-independent genes”.</p>
