<p>Raw data from the individual assays were analyzed with R (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>) using the cellHTS2 package using either “normalized percent inhibition” (NPI; used for analysis of IFN induction and cell viability screens and virus replication screens to identify strain-independent genes and processes) or “percent of control” (POC; used for analysis virus replication screens to identify strain-specific genes and processes) for raw data normalization [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. For NPI normalization, raw data were scaled relative to an inactive and an active siRNA as described in ‘siRNA screen execution’. For POC normalization, raw data were scaled only relative to non-targeting siRNA Allstars. Screen results were analyzed based on three replicates. To ensure high data quality, only replicate plates with a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient ≥ 0.45 and a background-to-signal ratio’ of ≥ 5 were analyzed. The background-to-signal ratio’ was calculated by dividing the plate’s average raw data value for the inactive control siRNA (Allstars) by the value of the respective active control (i.e., poly I:C, or anti-PLK1, -NP, or -XPO1 siRNA). IFN induction and cell viability assays were only analyzed on siRNA level. For analysis of virus replication screens, siRNA results were summarized on gene level using the collective mean and cSSMD estimated by the method of moments [
