<p>A549 wildtype or A549-IFN-Luc cells were transfected with siRNAs in 384-well format as previously described for A549 wildtype cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. After 24 h, the A549-IFN-Luc cells were subjected to IFN induction assay as described below. After 48 h, the A549 wildtype cells were either subjected to cell viability assays (WST-1 assay, cell number determination assay) or virus replication assay as described below. All multi-well pipetting steps were performed using a Biomek FX
 <sup>P</sup> Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter). The siRNA library was composed of a validated human kinome library and a custom designed siRNA library (Qiagen) in total containing 3,482 siRNAs targeting 1,208 human genes. On each plate, control RNAs were included: non-targeting siRNA Allstars (14 wells) as negative control for all assays, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C, final concentration: 2 μg/ml, 6 wells, poly(I:C)-LMW, Invivogen) as positive control for the IFN induction assay, an siRNA targeting the cellular gene PLK1 (siPLK1, 4 wells, [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) as positive control for cell viability assays, and an siRNA targeting the IAV NP gene in case of IAV (8 wells, [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]) or an siRNA targeting the cellular gene XPO1 (8 wells, target sequence: 5’-CTGTGTCAGTTTGTAATGGAA-3’) in case of IBV, respectively, as positive control for virus replication assays. All siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen.
