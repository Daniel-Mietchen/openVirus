<p>Female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were housed under pathogen-free conditions in biosafety level 2, according to the German Animal Protection Law (Tierschutzgesetz TierSchG). The animal experiments were approved by the local authorities (Landesamt f√ºr Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin LAGeSo, Reg No.: G0206/12). Eight-week-old female mice orally received regorafenib (100 mg/kg, a dose shown to be not toxic for mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) and vehicle control, respectively, formulated as solution in PEG400/125 mM aqueous methanesulfonic acid (80/20) with seven mice per group. Four h later, mice were intranasally infected with 4.4 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of IAV strain A/England/195/2009(H1N1). Twenty-four h after the first dose, regorafenib and vehicle, respectively, were administered again. The mice were euthanized 48 h p.i. and the viral load in the lungs was determined. To this end, the lungs were homogenized, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the amount of infectious virus progeny was determined by plaque assay as described above.
