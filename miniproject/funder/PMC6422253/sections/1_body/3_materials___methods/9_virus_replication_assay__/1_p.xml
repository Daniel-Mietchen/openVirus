<p>To test the effect of siRNAs, virus replication assay was started 48 h post-transfection. To test the effect of small molecules, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h with small molecules under normal culture conditions. To test the effect of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletion, A549-CRISPR/Cas9 cells were subjected to the assay 10 days post selection. Then, cells were inoculated with virus diluted in infection buffer. Transfected A549 cells were inoculated with an MOI of 0.01 (WSN, PAN), 0.04 (VN), or 2.6 (THW). Small molecule-treated A549 and MLE 12 cells were inoculated with WSN with an MOI of 0.02, A549-CRISPR/Cas9 cells were inoculated with WSN with an MOI of 0.005 and MDCK cells were inoculated with WSN with an MOI of 0.001. After 40 min, plain infection medium or infection medium containing small molecules, respectively, containing 1 Î¼g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) were added, and the cells were incubated under normal culture conditions for 24 h (WSN in MDCK), 36 h (WSN in all A549-derived cells, PAN, VN), 48 h (WSN in MLE 12), or 96 h (THW). Virus load was determined by inoculating (new) MDCK cells with the supernatants followed by fluorescence microscopic analysis of infection. To this end, MDCK cells were washed and inoculated with undiluted supernatant for 1 h. Virus was removed and MDCK cells were cultivated for 6 h under normal culture conditions with infection medium. Cells were stained for viral NP protein and nuclei and the infection rate (i.e. the rate of NP positive cells) determined as described previously [
