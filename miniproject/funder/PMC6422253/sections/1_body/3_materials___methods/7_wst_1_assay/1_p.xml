<p>In siRNA-transfected A549 cells, WST-1 assay was performed 48 h post transfection. To assess cytotoxicity of small molecules, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 36 h (A549) or 48 h (HEL-derived megakaryocytes, hAECB, MDCK, MLE 12,). Cells were washed with infection buffer and cultured for 30 min in presence of DMEM supplemented with 9 Î¼M BSA, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml P/S, 25 mM HEPES (cell culture grade) (infection medium) containing 10% of WST-1 reagent (Roche). Finally, light absorbance at 460 nm and 590 nm was quantified using the EnVision Multilabel Reader and cell viability was defined as the difference of absorbance at 460 nm and 590 nm.</p>
