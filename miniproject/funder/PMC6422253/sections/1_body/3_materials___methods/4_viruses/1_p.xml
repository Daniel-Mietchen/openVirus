<p>Influenza virus strains A/Puerto Rico/8/1934(H1N1), A/Panama/2007/1999(H3N2), A/Mallard/Germany/439/2004(H3N2) (all provided by T. Wolff, Robert Koch Institute, Germany), A/Hamburg/04/2009(H1N1) (provided by S. Becker, University of Marburg, Germany), A/Victoria/3/1975(H3N2) (described recently in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]), A/FPV/Bratislava/1979(H7N7) (provided by S. Ludwig, University of Münster, Germany), B/Thuringia/02/2006xB/Vienna/33/2006 (provided by Avir Greenhills Biotechnology, Austria, [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (provided by T. Frensing, Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems, Germany) were grown in the allantoic cavities of 9- or 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Seeds of influenza virus strains A/WSN/1933(H1N1) (provided by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, USA) and A/Vietnam/1203/2004(H5N1) (provided by Y. Kawaoka, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA) were produced by reverse genetics as described in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], respectively. Virus seeds were subsequently propagated in the allantoic cavities of 9- or 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs and used for experimentation. The amantadine sensitive A/England/195/2009–M2
 <sub>N31S</sub>(H1N1) virus was generated using reverse genetics. A plasmid-based system that allows rescue of a prototypic first wave pH1N1 virus A/England/195/2009 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] was employed. The plasmid encoding segment 7 vRNA was mutated to generate an amino acid change in the M2 coding region at amino acid 31 from N to S. Influenza virus strain A/England/691/2010(H3N2) was obtained through the MOSAIC consortium [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. A/England/195/2009(H1N1) were described recently. Vesicular stomatitis virus strain Indiana (provided T. Wolff) was grown in MDCK cells. Recombinant, GFP expressing viruses cowpox virus strain Brighton Red (provided by K. Tischer, Freie Universität Berlin, Germany), herpes simplex virus 1 strain KOS K26GFP (provided by P. Desai, John Hopkins University, USA), and hantavirus strain Hantaan 76–118 were grown in Vero E6 cells. For experiments, virus stocks were diluted to the desired MOI in PBS containing 9 μM bovine serum albumin (BSA), 492 μM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 901 μM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (infection buffer), unless stated otherwise.
