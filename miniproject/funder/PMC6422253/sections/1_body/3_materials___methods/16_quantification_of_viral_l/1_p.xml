<p>To test the effect of small molecules on the viral load of cell culture supernatants, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h with small molecules under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were inoculated with an MOI of 0.001 of WSN diluted in infection buffer. After 40 min, infection medium containing small molecules containing 1 Î¼g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) were added, and the cells were incubated under normal culture conditions for up to 48 h. In case of therapeutic small molecule application, cells were not pre-treated with small molecules prior to infection, but small molecules were added 4 h post infection. Virus load was determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells using an agar overlay medium [
