<p>To analyze primary infection, A549, and HEL cells as well as hAECB were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h with small molecules (3 μM) or an equivalent of DMSO under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were inoculated with an MOI of 0.1 (CPXV, HSV1, VSV), 0.3 (IVs), or 1.5 (HTV), respectively, for 30 min at 4°C. Unbound virus was removed and the cells cultivated for 6 h (IV, VSV) or 24 h (CPXV, HSV1, HTV) in presence of small molecules. Then, the rate of infected cells was determined by microscopically quantifying the number of cells positive for viral antigen. In case of IVs and VSV, presence of the NP protein was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence analysis using primary antibodies MCA400 (IAVs, AbD Serotec), MCA403 (IBVs, AbD Serotec), polyclonal-anti hantavirus N protein and V5507 (VSV, Sigma-Aldrich). In case of CPXV and HSV1, presence of GFP was investigated by fluorescence analysis. Microscopic analysis was performed as described previously [
