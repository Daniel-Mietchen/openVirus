<p>MDCK cells were washed with PBS and pre-incubated for 2 h with the different chemical compounds at the indicated concentrations or an equivalent of DMSO under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were inoculated with an MOI of 0.001 of IAV strain A/England/195/2009–M2
 <sub>N31S</sub> or WSN for 30 min at 4°C. Unbound virus was removed and the cells cultivated for 24 h in the presence of small molecules and TPCK-treated trypsin. Tissue culture supernatants were harvested, cells and debris removed by centrifugation (5 min, 4°C, 1,400 x g), and the supernatants stored at 4°C. Virus load in cleared supernatants was quantified by plaque assay. This procedure was performed five (WSN) or eight (A/England/195/2009–M2
 <sub>N31S</sub>) times, always using the supernatant of the latest passage for inoculation.
