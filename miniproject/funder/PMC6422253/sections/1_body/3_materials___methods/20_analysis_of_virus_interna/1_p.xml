<p>A549 cells were pre-treated with small molecules and infected as described in ‘Analysis of virus attachment’. Dynasore was applied at 100 μM. One hour after inoculation, cells were incubated in presence of small molecules for an additional 45 min under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were analyzed for virus internalization either qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy or quantitatively by flow cytometry. For quantitative analysis, cells were harvested by scraping, precipitated by centrifugation (1200 x g, 5 min, 4°C) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For both analyses, cells were blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with an anti-H3N2 HA protein antiserum (ViroStat) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 1% BSA at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody (Thermo Fischer) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 1% BSA at room temperature for 3 h. Finally, either representative images were acquired as described for ‘Analysis of virus attachment’ (qualitative analysis) or Alexa Fluor 647 and Alexa Fluor 488 intensities were determined using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) (quantitative analysis). Three independent experiments were performed in duplicates and per duplicate measurement, 10,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p>
