<p>A549 cells were washed with PBS and pre-incubated for 2 h with small molecules (3 μM) or an equivalent of DMSO under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were inoculated with an MOI of 0.3 of IAV strain WSN for 30 min at 4°C. Subsequently, unbound virus was removed and the cells were cultivated for 4 h in the presence of small molecules. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the GeneJET RNA purification kit (Thermo Fischer) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For reverse transcription, oligo(dT) primer was used. Resulting cDNAs were quantified by quantitative PCR with oligonucleotides specific for viral NP mRNA (5’-CTCGTCGCTTATGACAAAGAAG-3’ and 5’-AGATCATCATGTGAGTCAGAC-3’), viral M1 mRNA (5’-GACCAATCCTGTCACCTC-3’ and 5’-GATCTCCGTTCCCATTAAGAG-3’), viral M2 mRNA (5’-GAGGTCGAAACGCCTAT-3’ and 5’-CTCCAGCTCTATGTTGACAAA-3’), and cellular GAPDH mRNA (5’-GGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCATGAC-3’ and 5’-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAG-3’). Data were analyzed as described previously [
