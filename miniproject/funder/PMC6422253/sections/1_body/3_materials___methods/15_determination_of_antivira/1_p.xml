<p>The antiviral potency and cytotoxicity of small molecules in A549 cells were tested in 384-well format, and all multiwell pipetting steps were performed using a Biomek FX
 <sup>P</sup> Laboratory Automation Workstation. The antiviral potency and cytotoxicity of small molecules in MLE 12 cells were tested manually in 96-well format. Small molecules were three-fold serially diluted in infection medium generating eight different concentrations. Then, small molecules were applied to the cells and the assays were performed as described above. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for A549 cells were calculated using the R software package drc [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for MLE 12 cells were calculated using Prism (GraphPad Software;
