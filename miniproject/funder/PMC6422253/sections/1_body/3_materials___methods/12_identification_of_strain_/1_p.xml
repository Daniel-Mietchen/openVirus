<p>POC-normalized data were analyzed for host cell genes and pathways with virus strain-specific relevance with a mixed effects model using R with the library _nlme (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and only groups represented by ≥ 2 genes were analyzed. Genes/gene groups with a false discovery rate-adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 for the interaction between the factors “virus” and “treatment” were regarded to be differentially required between the tested viruses. Differentially required entities with a POC-score ≥ 2 for all four and differentially required entities not classified as pro- or antiviral for any of the four viruses, respectively, were excluded from further analyses and the remaining genes and gene groups were designated “strain-specific genes” and “strain-specific pathways”, respectively. Strain-specific genes were furthermore analyzed with the clustering algorithm CLICK [
