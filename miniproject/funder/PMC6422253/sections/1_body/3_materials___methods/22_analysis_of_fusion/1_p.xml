<p>A549 cells grown in glass-bottom dishes (35 mm, uncoated, MatTek Cooperation) were washed once with PBS and pre-incubated with small molecules for 30 min (bafilomycin A1: 200 nM; regorafenib and sorafenib: 3 μM) or an equivalent of DMSO, respectively, and Hoechst under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were inoculated at 4°C with 62.5 μg/ml of IAV strain PAN simultaneously labeled with DiOC18 and DiI as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. After 15 min, the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and subsequently cultivated under normal culture conditions in the presence of small molecules. Cells were live-imaged for 65 min as described for ‘Analysis of virus attachment’. For quantification, images of three independent experiments at indicated time points were summarized on the z-axis and particle recognition was performed using ImageJ (
