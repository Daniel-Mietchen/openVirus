<p>Fusion pH was determined as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In brief, human red blood cell ghosts were incubated with R18-labeled virus of strains PAN, THW, and MAL. Unbound virus was removed and the virus-ghost suspension incubated at different pH values. Finally, the fluorescence dequenching of R18 was recorded and used to determine the EC
 <sub>50</sub>, which specifies the fusion pH, and the Hill coefficient.
