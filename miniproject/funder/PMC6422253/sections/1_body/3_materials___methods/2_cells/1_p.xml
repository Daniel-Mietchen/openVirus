<p>A549 adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelials (ATCC CCL-185) were normally grown in DMEM media (Thermo Fischer) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (hiFCS, Biochrom;) (DMEM complete medium). A549 cells to be infected with CPXV or HSV1 were grown in absence of sodium pyruvate. A549-IFN-Luc cells were generated by lentiviral transduction using the Cignal Lenti ISRE Reporter (luc) Kit CLS-008L (Qiagen) and grown in DMEM complete medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (Thermo Fischer). A549-CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cells were generated as described below and grown in DMEM complete medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml blasticidine and 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. The primary human airway epithelial cells from bronchi (hAECB, Epithelix Sarl) were propagated using NIH/3T3 cells gamma-irradiated with 30 Gy as feeders, using a 3:1 mixture of Ham’s F-12 nutrient mix (Invitrogen) and DMEM supplemented with 5% hiFCS, 0.4 μg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μg/mL recombinant human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 8.4 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich), 24 μg/mL adenine (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL recombinant human EGF (Thermo Fischer) and 9 μM Y27632 (Miltenyi Biotec). When hAECB reached 80 to 90% confluence, they were separated from feeders by differential trypsinization and passaged to new culture vessels with CnT-Prime Airway medium (CELLnTEC). HEL 92.1.7 human erythroleukemia cells (HEL cells, ATCC TIB-180) were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Thermo Fischer) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml P/S and 10% hiFCS and differentiated into megakaryocytes at infection using stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate [

MDCK Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (ATCC CCL-34) and Vero E6 African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were grown in DMEM complete medium without sodium pyruvate. MLE 12 SV40-transformed mouse lung epithelial cells (ATCC CRL-2110) were grown in DMEM/Ham’s F10 media (Thermo Fischer) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 nM hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 2% hiFCS. NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells (ATCC CRL-1658) were grown in DMEM complete medium lacking antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37°C under humidity and 5% CO
