<p>A549 cells grown on glass slides were washed with PBS and pre-incubated for 30 min with small molecules (3 μM) or an equivalent of DMSO, under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were transferred to 4°C, washed twice with cold PBS, and inoculated with an MOI of 5 of IAV strain PAN. After 1 h, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated for 3 h (uncoating) or 4.5 h (vRNP import) in the presence of small molecule inhibitors and 100 μM cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) under normal culture conditions. Then, cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA for 4 h. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies targeting either the IAV M1 (MCA401, AbD Serotec) or NP (EMD Millipore) proteins, respectively, diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 1% BSA, followed by a 5 h incubation step with an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature. Finally, nuclei were stained by 30 min incubation with DAPI at room temperature and the slides mounted in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence microscopic analysis was conducted as described for ‘Analysis of virus attachment’. Images of uncoating assay were segmented with CellProfiler 2.1.1 (
