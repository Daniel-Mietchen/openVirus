  <p>MDCK cells were pre-treated with 3 μM regorafenib or an equivalent amount of DMSO for 2 h, infected with MOI 0.001 of IV strain WSN and cultivated for 24 h in presence of reagents. Virus titer in tissue culture supernatants was determined and the supernatants were used for inoculation of the next passage. The experiment was terminated after 5 passages. Data represent mean ± SD of technical replicates.</p>
