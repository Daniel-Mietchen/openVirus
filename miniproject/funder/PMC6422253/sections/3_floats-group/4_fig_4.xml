  <title>UBKIs do not affect entry of IAV into host cells.</title>
  <p>(A and B) A549 cells were pre-treated with small molecules at 3 μM, an equivalent amount of DMSO, or 
   <italic>Cp</italic> neuraminidase, for 30 min. Cells were incubated at 4°C with IAV strain PAN labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (red), fixed and stained with DAPI (blue), and subjected to (A) microscopic analysis (scale bar = 10 μm) or (B) flow cytometry. Data in (B) represent DMSO-normalized mean ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments (mean values are significantly different: one-way ANOVA: p = 0.0004; Dunnett´s multiple comparison test for comparison with DMSO control, ns: not significant (p-value &gt; 0.05), ***: p-value ≤ 0.001). (C and D) A549 cells were pre-treated with small molecules at 3 μM, an equivalent amount of DMSO, or 100 μM dynasore for 30 min. After virus attachment for 1 h at 4°C, cells were cultivated in presence of the compounds for 45 min at 37°C to induce virus internalization, then stained for DNA (DAPI, blue) and (extracellular) IV hemagglutinin (HA) protein (green) and subjected to (C) microscopic analysis (scale bar = 10 μm) or (D) flow cytometry. Red signals represent internalized virus particles, yellow (sufficiently Alexa Fluor 647-labeled) and green (insufficiently Alexa Fluor 647-labeled) signals represent cell surface-bound virus particles. Data in (D) represent mean ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments (mean values are significantly different: one-way ANOVA: p = 0.0011; Dunnett´s multiple comparison test for comparison with DMSO control, ns: not significant (p-value &gt; 0.05), **: p-value ≤0.01.
