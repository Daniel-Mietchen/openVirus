  <title>Result of the siRNA screen.</title>
  <p>(A) Setup of the siRNA screening campaign. (B) Classification of the 997 genes investigated with the four IV strains. (C) Venn diagram of genes required for replication of the individual viruses. (D) Virus titers relative to negative control upon knockdown of genes most strictly required for IV replication. Data represent the mean of all siRNAs targeting the specified gene. Data are from the siRNA screen. Positive control: IAV segment 5 (WSN, PAN, VN), XPO1 (THW). Negative control: Non-targeting scrambled sequence siRNA. (E) The genes required for replication of all four IV strains were subjected to gene group enrichment analysis using DAVID functional annotation clustering. Data represent the geometric means of the clusters’ p‐values for the top 10 ranking clusters. (F) The same data as in (E) were analyzed using IPA for enrichment of canonical pathways. Data represent the pathways’ p‐values for the top 10 ranking pathways.</p>
