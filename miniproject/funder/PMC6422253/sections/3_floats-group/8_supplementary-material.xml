  <title>Strain-specifically required genes can be assigned to one of four clusters.</title>
  <p>(A) Strain-specific genes were identified by mixed effects analysis and clustered using the CLICK algorithm [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Data represent mean and standard deviation (SD) of the normalized viral load upon knockdown of the genes in the individual clusters. A.u.: arbitrary units. Twenty-one genes (B) could not be assigned to any cluster. Data represent the mean of the normalized viral load for the siRNAs targeting the individual genes. Data analyzed are from the screen outlined in
