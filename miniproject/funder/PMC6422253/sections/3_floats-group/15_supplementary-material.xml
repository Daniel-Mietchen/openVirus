  <p>Cells were cultivated for 48 h in presence of small molecules at different concentrations prior to conduction of WST-1 assay. Data represent signal in WST-1 assay relative to the vehicle control expressed as mean ± SEM of n = 3 technical replicates. (A) HEL cell-derived megakaryocytes. (B) hAECB. (C) MDCK cells. (D) To test for potential cytotoxicity of FLT4 inhibitors at the concentration used in experiments shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g006">Fig 6</xref>, both inhibitors were added to cultures for 48 h at a concentration of 6.25 μM. Data represent mean ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments (mean values are not significantly different: one-way ANOVA: p = 0.697).
