  <title>Antiviral efficacy of UBKIs in murine cells and mice.</title>
  <p>(A and B) Dose-response curves in MLE 12 cells. For determination of virus replication, MLE 12 cells were pre-treated with regorafenib (A) or sorafenib (B) at different concentrations for 2 h, infected with IV strain WSN and cultivated for 36 h in presence of small molecules. Virus titers in tissue culture supernatants were determined as described in ‘Materials and Methods’. Data represent mean ± SEM of n = 3 technical replicates. For determination of cell viability, MLE 12 cells were cultivated for 36 h in the presence of small molecules at different concentrations prior to WST-1 assay. Data indicate signal intensity in WST-1 assay relative to vehicle control and represent mean (n = 2) ± SEM. (C) Eight-week-old female mice (n = 7) were orally treated with regorafenib and vehicle control, respectively, with seven mice per group. Four h later, mice were intranasally infected with 4.4 x 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of IAV strain A/England/195/2009(H1N1). Twenty-four h after the first dose, regorafenib and vehicle, respectively, were administered again. The mice were euthanized 48 h p.i. and the viral load in the lung homogenates determined. Individual values, mean and SEM are presented. The virus load of treated animals was not significantly different to controls (p = 0.317, Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test).
