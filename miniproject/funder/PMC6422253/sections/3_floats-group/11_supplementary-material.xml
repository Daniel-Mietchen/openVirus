  <title>UBKIs do not affect internalization of CME cargos.</title>
  <p>(A) A549 cells were serum-starved for 3 h and subsequently pre-treated with small molecules (dynasore: 100 μM, regorafenib/sorafenib: 3 μM) or an equivalent amount of DMSO for 30 min. Cells were incubated at 4°C with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 1 h. To induce internalization of EGF, cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 min. The amount of internalized EGF was quantified by flow cytometry. Data represent mean ± SEM of n = 3 independent experiments specified in arbitrary units (a.u). The one-way ANOVA of the log-transformed data provided evidence for different mean values (p = 0.052). Unadjusted post-tests led to a significant difference between DMSO and dynasore (p = 0.024). The adjusted p-value for comparison with DMSO was 0.071 for dynasore and non-significant (ns) for regorafenib and sorafenib. (B) Cells treated as in (A) but using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled transferrin. One-way ANOVA of the log-transformed data suggests significantly different mean values (p = 0.028). In contrast to regorafenib and sorafenib, adjusted post-tests for multiple testing led to a significant difference between DMSO and dynasore (p = 0.037).</p>
