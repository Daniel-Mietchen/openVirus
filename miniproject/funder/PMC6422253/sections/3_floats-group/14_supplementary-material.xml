  <title>Fusion pH of representative IV strains.</title>
  <p>(A) Virus of strains PAN, THW, and MAL were labeled with the lipophilic dye R18. Labeled viruses were incubated with human red blood cell ghosts followed by incubation at different pH values. Finally, fluorescence dequenching (FDQ) of R18 was recorded. A.u.: arbitrary units (B) The EC
   <sub>50</sub> (which defines the fusion pH) and the Hill coefficient of the curves depicted in (A) are shown. EC
   <sub>50</sub>: pH at which FDQ is half maxima. SEM of EC
   <sub>50</sub> and Hill coefficient, respectively, are standard errors determined by nonlinear regression.
