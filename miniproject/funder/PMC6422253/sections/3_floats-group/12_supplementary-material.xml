  <p>(A) A549 cells were pre-treated with small molecules or DMSO as described for 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007601.g004">Fig 4</xref> before incubation at 4°C with EGF-A647. After a 10 min pulse, cells were further incubated at 37°C for 30, 60, or 120 min with EGF-free medium before fixation. The amount of internalized EGF-A647 was quantified by flow cytometry. Data represent mean (n = 3) ± SEM of independent experiments relative to obtained values after 10 min. (B) Same experimental setup as in (A) but using transferrin-Alexa-488. Two-way ANOVA for (A) and (B) suggests that time and group are significant factors, whereas the interaction is not significant. Comparison with the DMSO control at the respective time point was adjusted for multiple testing: *: p-value ≤ 0.05, **: p-value ≤ 0.01.
