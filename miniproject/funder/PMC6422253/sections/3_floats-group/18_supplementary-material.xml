  <title>Missing correlation of IFN induction with virus replication.</title>
  <p>Based on the siRNA level data of the WSN screen the IFN induction data were plotted vs. the virus replication data. Since no correlation of signals in the IFN induction assay and the virus replication assay was observed, all sample siRNAs were treated as non-inducers of IFN.</p>
