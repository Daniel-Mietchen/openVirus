  <title>Several gene categories are strain-specifically required.</title>
  <p>Strain-specific gene categories were identified by mixed effects analysis. Exemplary gene categories are shown. Data represent average virus titers upon knockdown of genes of the respective categories relative to negative control. Number of tested genes and siRNAs associated with the respective category as well as p-value of mixed effects analysis are specified in boxes. (A) Gene Ontology (GO) category nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich repeat containing receptor signaling pathway. This pathway activates NF-ÐºB [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007601.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. (B) GO category regulation of RNA splicing. (C) GO category RNA polymerase II transcription cofactor activity.
