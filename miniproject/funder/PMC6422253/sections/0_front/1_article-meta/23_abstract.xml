 <p>Conventional medications against influenza infections, including vaccination and antiviral drug therapy, are targeted against viral determinants–an approach collectively referred to as pathogen-directed. However, influenza viruses mutate fast and quickly develop resistance to these pathogen-directed treatments. An alternative, yet not well established, is to block host cellular molecules required by the virus to successfully multiply. Such a host-directed approach is anticipated to be more robust against the development of drug resistance. This notion is founded on the different modes of action of the two principal approaches: Virus-directed therapeutics target the virus itself. Thus, just a single mutation could abrogate sensitivity to a virus-directed therapeutic. In contrast, it is unlikely that viruses can easily circumvent a pharmacological blockage of a cellular factor by means of just a few mutations. Instead, the virus needs to either exploit an immediate parallel cellular pathway or adjust its replication cycle to a different cellular factor–the latter being a process likely to require multiple mutations, if possible at all. To identify the most promising targets for a host-directed therapy, we performed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen with four different influenza virus strains using a lung epithelial cell line. Subsequently, we tested a series of drugs, specific for the products of the genes that are required for replication of all four influenza virus strains tested. Regorafenib and sorafenib, two chemically related urea-based kinase inhibitors already clinically approved for cancer treatment, turned out to be effective inhibitors of all influenza viruses and displayed low cytotoxicity. These drugs blocked viral replication at an early stage of the life cycle not only in cell lines but also in human primary respiratory cells. Moreover, these drugs exhibited high efficacy even against unrelated viruses. In addition, no development of resistance was observed against regorafenib, which was used in an
