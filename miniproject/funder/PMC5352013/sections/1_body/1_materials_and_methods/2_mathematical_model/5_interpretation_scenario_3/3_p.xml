<p>Maximum likelihood estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>

  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> were obtained by minimizing the negative logarithm of the above mentioned likelihood functions. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from the profile likelihood. To compare goodness-of-fit among all scenarios, we calculated Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). To assess the presence of the time-dependent trend in the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> estimates, a test of trend for a continuous variable (i.e., Jonckheere-Terpstra test) was employed. We also explored possible correlations between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> and the proportions of GII and GII.4 among the total of reported virus detections. Pearson’s moment correlation was employed for determining the correlation.
