 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173996.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates our proposed model building. Once a person is environmentally exposed to norovirus (i.e., via shellfish or other contaminated foods), index case(s) are classified as foodborne NVIs. Some of the foodborne NVIs decline to extinction, but the remainder involve chains of human-to-human secondary transmissions with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> in year 
 <italic>y</italic> (hereafter, we employ a piecewise constant reproduction number by 1 year). If the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> is very large, a certain number of secondary, tertiary and further cases may occur. In such a situation, the majority of cases are caused by human-to-human transmission. In contrast, foodborne cases will be in the majority if a large number of individuals acquire NVIs directly from contaminated foods and if very few human-to-human transmissions follow. The judgment at the prefectural institute of public health regarding the most plausible route of transmission (i.e., whether the outbreak event was foodborne or human-to-human) must take place by investigating the following: (i) the presence of a common source of infection (e.g., common food items) among the diagnosed cases and, (ii) the contact history among the cases during the outbreak investigation (

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> mirrors the fraction of human-to-human transmission events among the total.
