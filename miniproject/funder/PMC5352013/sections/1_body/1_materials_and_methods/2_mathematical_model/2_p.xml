<p>Here, we have built a parsimonious statistical model to describe the data-generating process and estimate the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> from the dataset. Let 
 <italic>q</italic> be the proportion of the human-to-human transmission events among the total of outbreak events. Because 
 <italic>q</italic> is interpreted in several different ways, we built three different models to capture the data-generating process of each interpretation scenario. In each model, the following assumptions were made. (1) We disregard a partly immunized heterogeneous population due to exposures in earlier years and any herd immunity effects are reflected in the estimate of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> (in a homogeneous manner). (2) Heterogeneous susceptibility and contact are ignored. (3) An individual experiences one exposure event per year at most (i.e. our model does not account for multiple infection events with noroviruses in a year). (4) Ascertainment bias of cases does not affect the fraction of foodborne NVI outbreak events among the total notified events (i.e., the ascertainment process is independent of the reporting process of the major route of transmission). (5) Index cases were environmentally transmitted (e.g. can be attributed to a responsible food item).
