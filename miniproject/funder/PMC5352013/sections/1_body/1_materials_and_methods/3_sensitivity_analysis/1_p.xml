<p>When the reported outbreak events were classified as foodborne or human-to-human transmissions, a substantial number of outbreak events remained cause “unknown”. Such events accounted for 17.1% to 47.5% of all the reported outbreak events from 2000 to 2016. We conducted the following two types of analysis: (i) we discarded those cause “unknown” events by assuming that the missing data occurred completely at random, and (ii) we added a certain fraction of the cause “unknown” data to the foodborne transmissions and the remaining fraction to the human-to-human transmission events. When we allocated the unknown causes to the two known groups, we varied the proportion to be added to the human-to-human transmission events from 0%–100%.</p>
