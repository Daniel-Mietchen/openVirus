<p>Another sensitivity analysis was carried out to examine the impact of ascertainment bias on our estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>, because outbreaks with human-to-human transmissions may have been more likely detected and reported, and it is valuable to quantify the impact of such bias. To do so, we varied the count data of outbreaks, 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> human-to-human and 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> foodborne outbreaks, by introducing a factor of ascertainment, 
 <italic>c</italic>. That is, without ascertainment, 
 <italic>c</italic> is assumed to be equal to 1. Nevertheless, if human-to-human outbreaks are 
 <italic>c</italic> times more likely reported, the observed proportion of human-to-human outbreaks should change to 
 <italic>cm</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>/{(
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>+
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>)(1- 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>/(
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>+
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>)+
 <italic>cm</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>/(
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>+
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>)} where 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> and 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> are unbiased (actual) numbers of human-to-human and foodborne outbreaks in that adjusting formula. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> was then estimated using the biased counts of human-to-human and foodborne outbreaks by varying 
 <italic>c</italic> from 0.5 to 5.0.
