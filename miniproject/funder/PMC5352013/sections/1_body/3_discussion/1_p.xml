<p>The present study estimated the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> for NVIs from 2000/01 to 2015/16 by assessing their time-dependent patterns and exploring the possible association between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> and the norovirus genotype. Since the data generating process cannot fully ascertain the mode of transmission, the corresponding uncertainties were addressed by employing three possible scenarios to interpret the data. An apparent increase in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> (with small fluctuations) was observed under all the scenarios, along with positive correlations between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> and the proportions of GII and GII.4 among the total number of viruses identified. The increasing pattern of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> was better captured by a simple model with a linear trend plus the step function effect of introducing RT-PCR to laboratory diagnosis than a model with step function alone, implying that the increase in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> was not only caused by the widespread introduction of RT-PCR at one time. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to successfully describe the time-dependent change in NVI transmissibility using empirically observed epidemiological data.
