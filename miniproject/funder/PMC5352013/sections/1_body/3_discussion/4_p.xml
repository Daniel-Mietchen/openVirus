<p>Scenarios 1 and 3, which rely on the random sampling of outbreaks or the random distinction of sporadic cases without any offspring from other series of cases, appeared to fit to observed data equally well in statistical sense. While our estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> in recent years were consistent with those published in the USA [
 <xref rid="pone.0173996.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it must be noted that the use of proportional data for human-to-human transmission among the total number of reported cases would inherently face ascertainment and reporting biases. That is, compared with sporadic cases, cases that are attributable to human-to-human transmission are more likely to be diagnosed and are also more likely to be notified, as has been noted in modeling studies that have focused on the human-animal interface [

 <xref rid="pone.0173996.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In fact, one prefecture arbitrarily but descriptively defined a human-to-human transmission outbreak as an outbreak in various facilities where more than 10 cases a day or more than half of all residents developed severe symptoms [
 <xref rid="pone.0173996.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We have thus conducted a sensitivity analysis, quantifying the impact of ascertainment bias on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> estimates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173996.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Our 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> may have been potentially overestimated, influencing any policy relevant decisions derived from the magnitude of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> (i.e. absolute value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>), but the relative change in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> over time is likely to be unaffected by ascertainment and reporting biases.
