<p>As the second limitation, by grouping all noroviruses in a single epidemic season into one category our analysis rests on an estimation of the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>. While the present study explored possible correlations between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> and the proportion of certain genogroups and genotypes, an aggregated analysis had to be adopted because of the unlinked nature of the empirical data between each single outbreak event and the specific genogrouping and genotyping. Third, our estimation did not explicitly account for herd immunity. Only by assuming that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> reflects both the transmissibility and susceptible fraction of the population could a homogeneously defined estimate be derived from the data. The ignorance did not allow us to decompose 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> into the actual transmissibility of a particular year 
 <italic>y</italic> and a possible partially immune fraction in the same year. Only by collecting more structured data (e.g. an age-structured long-time series combining the transmission route and virus genogrouping), would we be able to explicitly address the issue of herd immunity, and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> estimates presented here might have been potentially overestimated. Fourth, we did not account for any index cases arising from (other) unrecognized chains of transmission. Given that such index cases exist, the estimate of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> could be greater than what have been estimated in this article.
