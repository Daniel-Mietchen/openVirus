<p>Growth in norovirus transmissibility over time implies that the infection has become a more human-to-human transmissible disease. This finding was achieved by exploring the long-time series data from 2000 to 2016, and the time-dependent change indicates that NVI in the early period may differ somewhat from the time-dependent changes seen in recent infections. For instance, foodborne cases of NVI arising from bivalve molluscan shellfish (raw oysters) have decreased relatively as a fraction among the total number of infected individuals in Japan [
