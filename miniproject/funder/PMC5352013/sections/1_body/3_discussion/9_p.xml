<p>In summary, a time-dependent increase in NVI transmissibility was identified in Japan, indicating that noroviruses better fitted to humans have selectively caused the human-to-human transmissions. This increase in norovirus transmissibility has coincided with an increase in the proportions of GII and GII.4 among all the viruses detected, implying a possible association between transmissibility and this genotype and genogroup. Evolutionary dynamics are perhaps responsible for the changing epidemiology of noroviruses, thereby elevating the relative importance of human-to-human transmission as compared with classical foodborne infections. We believe that our findings will greatly enhance current understanding of the ecoepidemiology of noroviruses. However, we cannot help but stress the importance of continued monitoring of the fraction of human-to-human transmission outbreaks among the total outbreak events to better capture the evolutionary nature of norovirus and investigate effective control strategies against it.</p>
