<p>Four other limitations should be noted. First, technical changes in laboratory methods, reporting rules for NVIs and any other time events were not explicitly taken into account for the 16 year study period. As mentioned in Methods, the widespread use of RT-PCR in and after 2007 was one important factor that could have contributed to increased proportion of reported GII.4 cases from around 2006. We have thus modeled

 <sub>y</sub> using a step function with and without linear trend, and it was shown that the step function with linear trend was favored. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that the step function qualitatively captured the increase in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> in any case, and we cannot exclude the possibility that RT-PCR had an impact on

 <sub>y</sub>. At least, we have shown that there was a linearly increasing trend that has not been explained by the introduction of single laboratory technique. Other reasons, e.g. disproportionally improved surveillance of human-to-human transmission especially at healthcare facility, cannot be excluded, and indeed, we have shown that an improved ascertainment would lead to an increase in

 <sub>y</sub>. Nevertheless, we do not have any explicit indication of such disproportionate improvement as compared to published studies on the relationship between the transmissibility and GII or GII.4 [
