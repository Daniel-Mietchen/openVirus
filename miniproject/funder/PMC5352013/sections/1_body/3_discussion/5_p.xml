<p>As mentioned in Methods, foodborne outbreaks have been frequently differentiated from human-to-human outbreaks due to the need to link the outbreak to a source of infection (e.g. a shared food item) among cases. Cases in the foodborne outbreaks are likely tested, because public health needs to verify that a particular foodborne outbreak was caused by novoviruses, and in that sense, the environmental exposure event can be regarded as well identified in the empirical observation. Rather than the validity of environmental exposures, we have not been sure as to the data generating process of “unknown” category data. We have thus conducted a sensitivity analysis in
