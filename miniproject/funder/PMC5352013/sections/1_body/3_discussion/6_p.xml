<p>It should be noted that we employed three possible scenarios to address the uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of the mode of transmission. Scenario 1 assumed random sampling of all outbreaks, while it is likely that large epidemics may be easily reported compared with small outbreaks. Scenario 2 assumed random sampling of cases, while in reality more severe cases are likely reported than mild ones. Scenario 3 assumed that the presence of one secondary transmission as human-to-human outbreak, but it does not capture the tendency that the presence of two or more secondary transmissions lead to greater ascertainment than only one secondary transmission. While it is evident that each did not fully capture the observed patterns of the data, we were not able to exclude any scenario as long as each could theoretically lead to the observation of empirical data in Japan, and thus, we believe that employing three models and comparing estimates were the best practice to address the uncertainty surrounding the mode of transmission.</p>
