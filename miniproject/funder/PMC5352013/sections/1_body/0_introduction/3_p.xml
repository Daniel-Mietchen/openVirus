<p>Antigenic evolution most likely involves evolutionary changes in virus transmissibility. To assess such transmissibility, the reproduction number (i.e., the average number of secondary infections generated by one primary case) hereafter called 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub>, is an indispensable and representative epidemiological measurement. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> does not dynamically change in a finer time scale than year, and in every single year the interpretations of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> are analogous to those of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, except the fact that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> is assumed to be able to vary by years. When it comes to the transmissibility of NVIs, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> has been estimated in a few published studies, where the estimated basic reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) broadly ranged from 2–18 in closed or semi-closed environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0173996.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0173996.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the transmissibility has yet to be estimated for an entire human population and, notably, we have yet to explore any possible signature of time-dependent changes in the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> of NVI to decipher the transmissibility.
