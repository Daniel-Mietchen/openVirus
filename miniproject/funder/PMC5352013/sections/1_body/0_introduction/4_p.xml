<p>Therefore, in the present study, we have explored whether a time-dependent signature exists for norovirus transmissibility by investigating the epidemiological dataset for Japan [

  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> for NVI as a function of time using the national surveillance data and employing a few parsimonious mathematical models. We also explored the possible impact of the predominance of genogroup GII and genotype GII.4 on the time-dependent change in NVI transmissibility. These study objectives were accomplished using the following methods and data.
