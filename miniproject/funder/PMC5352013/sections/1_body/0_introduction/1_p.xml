<p>Norovirus, a member of the 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The virus is known to be a major causal agent of acute gastroenteritis in humans, especially during the winter season. Outbreaks of norovirus infection (NVI) have huge societal and health care costs globally because the virus has a strong infectious nature and perceived acute symptoms shortly after illness onset [

 <sup>3</sup> virus particles [

Since norovirus was first recognized, possible interventions to prevent secondary transmissions with it have been sought, but controlling it is difficult because of its speed of infection, the mild, nonspecific symptoms it causes, and its multiple transmission routes.
