<p>As part of the evolutionary process, viruses change their pathogenesis, virulence and transmissibility characteristics. As seen in the evolution of influenza virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0173996.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the multistrain dynamics of norovirus is considered to involve antigenic drift (i.e., changes in epitopes within the capsid P2 domain) and shift (e.g., overlapping recombination in open reading frame, ORF 1, and ORF 2), which allows the virus to escape the pressure of human immunity [
