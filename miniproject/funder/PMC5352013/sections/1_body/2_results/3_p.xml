<p>Possible correlations were explored between the estimated

 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> value and the GII genogroup and the GII.4 genotype proportions among the total (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173996.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As we can identify the time-dependent increasing trend in the proportions of the GII genogroup and the GII.4 genotype among the total (p&lt;0.05), a positive correlation was observed between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> in each scenario and the proportion of GII. A positive correlation was also the case between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> and the proportion of GII.4, although the correlation in scenario 2 was only marginally significant.
