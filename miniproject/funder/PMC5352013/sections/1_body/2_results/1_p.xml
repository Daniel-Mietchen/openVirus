 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173996.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the time-dependent dynamics of the reported norovirus outbreaks from 2000 to 2016 in Japan. A total of 9,264 outbreaks were reported from 2000/01 to 2015/16 seasons, among which 4,516 were human-to-human, 2,465 were foodborne and the remaining 2,283 were of unknown etiology. Mean and standard deviation (SD) of the reported outbreaks per year were 579 and 280 outbreaks, respectively, and the maximum was 1,388 in 2006/07 and minimum was 220 outbreaks in 2002/03. The minimum after 2006/07 was 373 outbreaks in 2015/16. Every year the peak month for infections was December (
