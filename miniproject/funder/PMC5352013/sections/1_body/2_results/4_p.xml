 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0173996.e008">8</xref>), we examined if observed proportions were biased by time-dependent artefact (e.g. caused by the time-dependent change in the laboratory diagnostic method). Considering that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> could be described only by the step function dividing the overall time-dependent pattern into those before and during 2006/07 season and afterwards, AIC values of scenario 1, 2 and 3 were 542.5, 3774.4 and 8793.5, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173996.g005">Fig 5</xref>). If we additionally account for the linearly increasing time trend in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>, the AIC was calculated at 480.7, 3728.9 and 8782.8, respectively, for scenarios 1, 2 and 3. Namely, the model fit was always better for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> that combines step function (separating before and after 2007) with linear trend than

 <sub>y</sub> with step function only.
