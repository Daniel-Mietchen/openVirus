 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173996.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the 
 <italic>R</italic>

  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> estimates based on each interpretation scenario. Under scenario 1, the

 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> ranged from 1.11 (95% CI; 1.09–1.14) to 4.15 (95% CI; 3.91–4.38) and peaked in 2006/07. Adopting scenario 2, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> was estimated to range from 1.06 (95% CI; 1.06–1.07) to 1.16 (95% CI; 1.16–1.17). Small increases in the estimate occurred in 2005/06, 2013/14 and 2015/16. Under scenario 3, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> ranged from 0.11 (95% CI; 0.09–0.14) to 3.29 (95% CI; 3.05–3.52). The estimate exceeded the value of 1 in 2004/05. Employing the trend test, time-dependent increases in estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> were identified in all three scenarios (p&lt;0.05). Using AIC, scenarios 1 and 3 both appeared to yield the best fit (AIC = 100.3), followed by scenario 2 (AIC = 310.1).
