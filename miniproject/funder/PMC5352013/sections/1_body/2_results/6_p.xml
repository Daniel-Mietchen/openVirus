<p>Using the empirical data in 2015/16 season, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173996.g007">Fig 7</xref> explores the impact of ascertainment bias of human-to-human outbreaks on the estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub>. Overall, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> appears to be overestimated if the ascertainment bias is large. Among three scenarios, scenarios 1 and 3 yielded 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> that are more sensitive to the increase in ascertainment factor 
 <italic>c</italic> than scenario 2. In scenarios 1 and 3, increase of 
 <italic>c</italic> by 1.0 led to an increase in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>y</sub> by 1.05.
