  <title>Estimates of the reproduction number of noroviruses in relation to missing data.</title>
  <p>Black squares, gray triangles, and white circles correspond to the estimated reproduction number in 2015/2016 as based on interpretation scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. “Ignored” results represent the data obtained after discarding the “unknown” cause category datasets. By allocating a certain fraction of “unknown” causes to the human-to-human transmission outbreaks, the relative changes in the estimated reproduction number could be explored. Whiskers extend to the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals.</p>
