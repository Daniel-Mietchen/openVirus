  <title>Estimates of the yearly reproduction number of noroviruses in relation to the ascertainment of human-to-human transmission outbreaks.</title>
  <p>Black squares, gray triangles, and white circles represent the yearly reproduction numbers in 2015/16 season in our interpretation scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Whiskers extend to the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals. We set the factor of ascertainment 
   <italic>c</italic>, i.e. the relative frequency of human-to-human outbreaks to be reported compared with foodborne outbreaks, as a coefficient that represents the ascertainment bias. Observed frequency data in 2015/16 season were assumed as unbiased and 
   <italic>c</italic> = 1.
