  <title>The data-generating process used for investigating norovirus outbreak events.</title>
  <p>Foodborne cases (dark gray) generate secondary cases via human-to-human transmissions (light gray). Given the final size distribution, let 
   <italic>q</italic> be the proportion of major epidemics among the total environmental exposures. The expected final sizes of the major and minor outbreaks are expressed as 
   <italic>z</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>major</italic>
   </sub> and 
   <italic>z</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>minor</italic>
   </sub>, respectively. Judgment of a human-to-human transmission outbreak is considered to have taken place based on the presence of chains of secondary transmissions (i.e. major epidemic), the presence of at least one secondary case, or simply the random sampling result from the final size.
