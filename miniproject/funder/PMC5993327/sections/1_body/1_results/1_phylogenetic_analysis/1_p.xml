<p>We used 20 envelope sequences (1,485 nucleotides) of DENV-1 isolates obtained from patients in SJRP, from 2008 to 2012, for the phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that the isolates were subdivided into two lineages within genotype V. Isolates 59/2011, 287/2011, 354/2011, 395/2011, 422/2011, 430/2011, 437/2011, 442/2011, 492/2012 and 516/2012 were grouped within one lineage previously called L1 or lineage II [
