<p>When deduced protein envelope sequences were analyzed, a total of four amino acid (aa) substitutions were observed between the two groups of isolates from SJRP. Those aa substitutions were observed at positions 338, 394 (located in domain III), 428 and 436 (located in the stem loop region). The aa observed in SJRP isolate sequences within L1 were as follows: 338, serine; 394, arginine; 428, valine; and 436, valine; whereas SJRP isolates within L6 presented leucine, lysine, leucine and isoleucine residues, respectively. A comparison between the complete genome sequences of the L1 and L6 lineages from SJRP (287/2011 and 484/2012, respectively) revealed 56 aa differences (
