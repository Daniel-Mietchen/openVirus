<p>The L6 lineage was first identified in SJRP in 2008, and the L1 lineage was detected only in 2010. These two lineages of DENV-1, genotype V, co-circulated in SJRP from 2010 until 2012. Based on sequencing or genotyping analysis by Taqman-based qPCR, 64 serum samples were identified as infected by L1 from 2010 to 2012, whereas 102 samples obtained from 2008 to 2015 were identified as L6, resulting in a total of 166 discriminated samples. In SJRP, L6 became the dominant circulating lineage after 2013 (
