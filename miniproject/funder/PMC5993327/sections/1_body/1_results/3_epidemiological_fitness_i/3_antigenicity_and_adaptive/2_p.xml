<p>To confirm 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> the reduced antigenicity observed for the L6 sequences using bioinformatics, eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were immunized with L1 and L6 isolates, and spleen cells were collected to analyze B and T cell activation by flow cytometry. B cell activation was measured by analyzing CD21
 <sup>+</sup>/CD40
 <sup>+</sup> expression, and L6 did not appear to activate B cells (
