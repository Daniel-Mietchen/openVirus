<p>Previous studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] hypothesized that lineages with lower antigenic potential could have better epidemiological fitness. Thus, we conducted an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis using 20 DENV-1 sequences that had been previously clustered into the L1 and L6 lineages to verify potential antigenic differences in polyprotein. We found that four aa substitutions in the sequences grouped in the L1 lineage increased the B and T epitope antigenic scores. Sequences clustered into L6 displayed diminished antigenicity (
