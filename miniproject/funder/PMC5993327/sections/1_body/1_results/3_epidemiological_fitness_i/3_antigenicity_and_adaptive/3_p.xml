<p>To confirm whether the L1 and L6 isolates would differentially stimulate human leukocytes, PBMCs from 11 healthy donors were mock-treated or infected with each isolate and B and T lymphocyte activation was analyzed; anti-DENV serology was performed in 9 donors to determine whether they were dengue naive or had been previously infected; serum was not available for 2 donors. Among those 9, seven were dengue naive, one showed anti-DENV IgG (but we could not evaluate the serotype nor whether there was primary or secondary infection), and one showed inconclusive serology result.</p>
