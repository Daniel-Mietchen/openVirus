<p>B cell activation was evaluated by measuring total IgM levels in culture supernatants. We observed that L1 induced slightly higher, but not significant levels of IgM, in comparison to L6 (

Regarding CD38 and HLA-DR expression on T cells, we observed that 8 donors showed a higher T cell activation in response to L1 than to L6 isolates; those included six dengue naive and two with undetermined serology. Four donors showed a slightly higher response induced by L6; those included two dengue naive, one dengue positive, and one inconclusive (
