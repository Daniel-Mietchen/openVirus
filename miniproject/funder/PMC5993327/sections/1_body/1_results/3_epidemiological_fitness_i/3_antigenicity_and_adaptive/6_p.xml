<p>Because effective innate and adaptive immune responses would eventually translate into the control of viral replication, we evaluated the levels of virus in serum samples of patients infected with the L1 or L6 DENV-1 lineages from 2008 to 2014. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006525.g007">Fig 7</xref>, the levels of virus in patients infected with L6 were 3.5-fold higher in serum than in patients infected with L1 viruses (
