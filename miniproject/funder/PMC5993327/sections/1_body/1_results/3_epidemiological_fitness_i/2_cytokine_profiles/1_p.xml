<p>Because viral fitness and suppression of the type I IFN response could not account for our epidemiological findings, we focused on evaluating the immune responses in patients infected with either lineage of DENV-1. The most immunogenic lineage would be replaced in a given population because enhanced immune responses would result in decreased viral loads and a lower chance of transmission in humans. Initially, sera from 72 patients presenting with dengue without warning signs, infected with either L1 or L6 lineages, were tested for 29 cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and growth factors.</p>
