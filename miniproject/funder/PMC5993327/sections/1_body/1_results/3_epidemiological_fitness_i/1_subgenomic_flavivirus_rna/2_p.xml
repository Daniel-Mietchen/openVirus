<p>Evaluation of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in HepG2 cells showed that the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in cells infected with L6 was 10-fold higher than that in cells infected with L1 (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.6932; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006525.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). According to our findings, both lineages were unable to inhibit IFN expression or the IFN-induced response. Thus, the proposed model for epidemiological fitness based on sfRNA [
