<p>DENV-2 lineages can inhibit type I interferon responses via subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) production. In DENV-2, the greater expression of sfRNA relative to genomic RNA (gRNA) can be responsible for improved fitness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, higher sfRNA:gRNA production ratios could have accounted for the epidemiological fitness of DENV-1 in our population.
