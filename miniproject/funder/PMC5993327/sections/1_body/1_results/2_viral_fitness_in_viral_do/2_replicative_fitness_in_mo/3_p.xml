<p>After analyzing the viral replication of lineages in cell culture and mosquitoes, our results suggested that L1 displayed improved viral fitness, contradicting our epidemiological findings. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental outcomes because they could fail to represent the complexity of natural transmission cycles, and differences in fitness can be demonstrated under forms of selective pressure such as coinfection [

To examine the potential of coinfection to explain our results, we performed a viral competition assay in which Aag-2 cells and mosquitoes were coinfected with L1 and L6 isolates and the relative amount of each virus was quantified. When present in culture concomitantly, L1 viruses replicated approximately one log faster than L6 viruses in Aag-2 cells, a statistically significant difference, except at 24 hours post infection (hpi) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006525.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that viral-related factors or viral-specific fitness do not account for the dominance of the circulating L6 lineage without replacement by L1.
