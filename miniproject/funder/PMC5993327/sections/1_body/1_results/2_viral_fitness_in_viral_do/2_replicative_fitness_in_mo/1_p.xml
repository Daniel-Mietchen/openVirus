<p>For a virus lineage to establish a fitness advantage over others, it must be able to infect and disseminate in mosquitoes at a higher rate, thus establishing a higher transmission potential [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from two populations: PPCampos (captive) and Dom Pedro (wild). Consistent with the results obtained in C6/36 and Aag-2 cells, we observed that both lineages infected the mosquitos, resulting in a greater number of genome copies of L1 viruses. Indeed, the levels of L1 viruses were greater than those of L6 viruses in either the bodies or the heads after single infections in PPCampos (
