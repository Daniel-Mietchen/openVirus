<p>We tested 96 sera from symptomatic DENV-1 (L1 or L6)-infected patients for anti-dengue IgG antibodies to identify differences in the presence of prior heterologous exposure to DENV infection in both patient populations. Cross-reactive immunity can interfere with the risk of a second infection for a specific lineage of DENV-1, but primary (negative IgG) or secondary (positive IgG) DENV infections were similar in both groups (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006525.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Due to L6 persistence, we would have expected L6 viruses to replicate more efficiently (better replicative fitness) than L1 viruses. Therefore, an additional factor, such as transmission potential by the vector, could have been a contributor and were, therefore, investigated.
