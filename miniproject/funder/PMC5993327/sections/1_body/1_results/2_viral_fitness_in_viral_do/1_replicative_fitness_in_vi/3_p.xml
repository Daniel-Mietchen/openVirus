<p>In mosquito cell lines (C6/36 and Aag-2), L1 viruses had higher replication rates than L6 viruses by approximately one log
 <sub>10</sub>. Viral replication of L1 and L6 was also assayed in non-human primate cell lines (Vero E6 and LLC-MK2), in which similar results were obtained. Likewise, in a human cell line (HepG2), L1 viruses again demonstrated higher viral replication (
