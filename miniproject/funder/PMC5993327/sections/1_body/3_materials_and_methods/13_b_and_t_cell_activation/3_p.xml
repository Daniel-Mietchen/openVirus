<p>The human PBMCs (2x10
 <sup>5</sup> cells) were cultured with L1 or L6 DENV-1 at an MOI of 1.0 for 2 h. Control cultures were performed using supernatant from noninfected C6/36 cells (mock-infected). At 48 hpi, the cells were harvested and incubated with CD38-APC, HLA-DR-FITC and CD3-Pacific Blue (eBiosciences). The frequency of CD38
 <sup>+</sup>/HLA-DR
 <sup>+</sup> among the total PBMCs, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> or CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells for the analysis of PBMC activation was determined by flow cytometry using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) equipment and FlowJo software. Additionally, after 12 days of culture, the supernatants were harvested and the IgM or IgG levels were analyzed by capture ELISA. Briefly, the ELISA plates were incubated with anti-human IgM or IgG antibodies at 3 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4°C. The plates were blocked with PBS containing 10% FCS for 2 h at 37°C and washed with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and serial dilutions of the supernatant samples were added and incubated overnight at 4°C. Serial dilutions of purified human IgM or IgG were also added to generate a standard curve. The plates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-human IgM or IgG (1 mg/mL; Invitrogen) for 2 h at 37°C, washed and developed using pNPP substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction was read at 405 nm using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Also, the secretion levels of IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-8 were evaluated by ELISA, according to manufacturer’s protocol (PeproTech).
