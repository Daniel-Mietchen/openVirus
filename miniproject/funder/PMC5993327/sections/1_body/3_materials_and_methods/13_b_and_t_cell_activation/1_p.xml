<p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups (5 animals/group) and intraperitoneally immunized with 5x10
 <sup>5</sup> IP per mouse of DENV-1: L1 (group 1) or L6 (group 2). Mock C6/36 injections in L-15 medium (group 3) were used as controls. At 7 days p.i., the spleens from each group of mice were extracted, immersed in cold RPMI 1640 medium (Cultilab) and macerated. After centrifugation at 377 x g for 10 min, the erythrocytes were lysed in 9 mL of cold water. Lysis was stopped by adding 1 mL of 1.5 M PBS. The spleen cells were collected after centrifugation and resuspended in 1 mL of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco). To assess viability, an aliquot of cells was diluted 1:20 in 0.4% Trypan Blue solution (Invitrogen) and counted using a Neubauer chamber. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (Becton Dickinson, USA) specific for CD4
 <sup>+</sup>, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD21
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocyte subsets and activation markers (CD25, CD69, CD28 and CTLA-4) was then used for cell staining (see
