 <sup>6</sup> spleen cells were distributed in 96-well polystyrene conical bottom microwell plates and centrifuged at 377 x g for 10 min. After 30 min of incubation with the antibodies at 4Â°C, the cells were washed twice with 0.15 M PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Flow cytometry acquisition of 30,000 events/tube and analysis were performed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) equipment. Distinct gating strategies were used to analyze the lymphocyte subsets (CD4
 <sup>+</sup>, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets and CD21
 <sup>+</sup> B cells) with FlowJo software. The T lymphocyte CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> subsets were selected from the CD3
 <sup>+</sup> cell population, and B lymphocytes were selected using the CD21
 <sup>+</sup> marker. The frequency of cells was determined using quadrant statistics. Limits for the quadrant markers were always set based on negative populations and isotype controls. To analyze the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, the quadrants were always set for CD8 high populations to avoid including CD8 low NK cells. The results were expressed as percentages of cells for the different gated lymphocyte subpopulations analyzed. The expression of activation markers was evaluated inside each lymphocyte population by measuring the mean intensity fluorescence (MIF), which represents the number of molecules per cell.
