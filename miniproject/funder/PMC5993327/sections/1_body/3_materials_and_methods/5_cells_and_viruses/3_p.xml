<p>Initially, samples were selected to represent each lineage, and viral isolation was performed based on previous investigations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Briefly, viruses selected from L1 or L6 DENV-1 human sera were diluted 1:10 in L-15 and used to inoculate C6/36 cells, which were then incubated at 28°C for 7–10 days. Successful isolation was confirmed by RT-PCR of the culture supernatant, as previously described for the sequencing reaction, followed by PCR. PCR was performed to amplify an 1,855-bp fragment using 2 μL of cDNA, 5 μL of 10X buffer, 2 μL of dNTPs (10 mM/μL), 2 μL of primers d1s3 and d1a17 (10 μM), 1 μL MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.25 of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/μL; Sigma-Aldrich) and DEPC-treated water. The reactions were subjected to the following cycle conditions: 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 45 sec, 56°C for 45 sec and 72°C for 45 sec. A final extension step was performed at 72°C for 10 min. Amplification was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel.
