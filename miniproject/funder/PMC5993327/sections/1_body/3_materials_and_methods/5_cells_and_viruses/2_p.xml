<p>Mosquito, human and non-human primate cell lines were also used for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. C6/36 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Leibovitz's medium (L-15; Cultilab) and Aag-2 (kindly provided by Dr. João Trindade Marques, UFMG, Brazil) in Schneider’s insect medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at 28°C. Vero E6 and LLC-MK2 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Cultilab) and HepG2 cells (ATCC) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Cultilab) at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. All culture mediums were supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) for maintenance or 10% for expansion, excluding Aag-2, for which 8% FBS, 10 U/mL of penicillin, 10 g/mL of streptomycin and 250 μg/mL of amphotericin B were used (Gibco).
