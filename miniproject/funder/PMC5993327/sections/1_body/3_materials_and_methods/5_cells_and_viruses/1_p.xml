<p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained after centrifugation of buffy coat samples over a ficoll-hypaque gradient. Moreover, human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were stably transfected with the reporter vector pISRE-Luc-Hygro containing an NdeI-Bst1107 site of pISRE-Luc (Stratagene) and cloned into vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Cells then referred to as HBMEC-ISRE-Luc were kindly provided by Dr. Laura Helena Vega Gonzales Gil, CPqAM, FIOCRUZ, Recife-PE, Brazil. Both human primary cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Cultilab) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco) (complete medium) at 37Â°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere.
