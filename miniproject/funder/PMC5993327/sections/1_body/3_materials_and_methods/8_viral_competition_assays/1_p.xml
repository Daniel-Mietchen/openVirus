<p>Aag-2 cells were coinfected with L1 and L6 isolates mixed at an equal ratio (1:1) at an MOI of 0.1, and the supernatants were harvested at 24, 48 and 72 hpi, as previously described for the growth curves. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, and the relative amounts of L1 and L6 viruses in each dual infection were calculated based on the developed genotyping assay.</p>
