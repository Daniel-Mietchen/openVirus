<p>HBMEC-ISRE-Luc cells were mock-treated or infected with DENV-2 (strain 16681), L1 or L6 DENV-1, in the presence or absence of IFN-β (1000 U– 2 ng/mL; PeproTech). After 48 hpi, the cells were lysed using cell culture lysis reagent (CCLR; Promega), and the supernatants were collected after centrifugation. The luciferase activity was measured by mixing 20 μL of cell lysate with 50 μL of Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega), and the light produced was measured using a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega). The results are shown in relative light units (RLUs).</p>
