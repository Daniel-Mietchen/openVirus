 <sup>6</sup> cells (C6/36, Aag-2, Vero E6, LLC-MK2 and HepG2) were plated in each well of a 24-well plate 24 h prior to infection. Five cell lines were infected with L1 or L6 isolates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1:30 h in triplicates. The cells were then washed with 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove unabsorbed virus and then incubated in 1 mL of maintenance medium. The supernatants were harvested at 24, 48 and 72 hpi for relative quantification using the SYBR Green Real-Time PCR assay with the GoTaq qPCR Master Mix kit (Promega) and primers Den_F (5’-TTAGAGGAGACCCCTCCC-3’) and Den_R2 (5’-GAGACAGCAGGATCTCTGG-3’), as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions with primer Den_R2. The qRT-PCR reaction was also performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
