<p>In addition, full-length sequences of viral RNA genomes from SJRP were sequenced using next-generation sequencing with Illumina 
 <bold>MiSeq System (Illumina)</bold> as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, isolates were subjected to RNA extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen), followed by quantification using a PicoDrop (Picodrop Limited). RNA was treated with DNAse I (Sigma-Aldrich), and reverse transcription-PCR was performed with random primers (50 ng; Invitrogen) using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After sequencing, the obtained sequences were assembled and edited using Geneious v.7.1.4 (Biomatters Ltda), and polyprotein sequences were aligned and translated to compare aa substitutions. Two sequences (287/2011 and 484/2012) were selected to represent the L1 and L6 lineages, respectively.
