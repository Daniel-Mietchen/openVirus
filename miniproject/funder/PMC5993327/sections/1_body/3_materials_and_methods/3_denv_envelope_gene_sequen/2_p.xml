<p>An analysis of the amplicons was performed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The PCR product (40 μL) was purified using 2.8 μL of 3 M sodium acetate and 1.2 μL of cold absolute ethanol. The samples were stored overnight at -20°C or for 1 h at -80°C and subsequently centrifuged at 16,100 x g for 20 min. The pellet was washed with 200 μL of 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 16,100 x g for 10 min. The dried pellet was resuspended in 20 μL of Milli-Q water. Twenty nanograms of purified PCR products were used as templates in 20 μL of cycle sequencing reactions using 2 μL of 1X Sequencing buffer, 2 μL of BigDye Terminator v.3.0 (Applied Biosystem), 1 μL of forward and reverse primers (3.2 μM) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006525.s005">S1 Table</xref>) and DEPC-treated water; these samples were submitted to 96°C for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec and 60°C for 4 min. Precipitation of sequencing reactions was performed using ethanol/EDTA as recommended by the BigDye Terminator kit v.3.0 (Applied Biosystems) protocol. The samples were resuspended in 10 μL of Hi-Di Formamide (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with ABI PRISM 3130 equipment (Applied Biosystems).
