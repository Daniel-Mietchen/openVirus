<p>Twenty DENV-1-positive samples were used to amplify the envelope gene sequence, followed by nucleotide sequencing using the Sanger-based method with a previously described primer [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions with primer d1a16. PCR was performed to amplify a 1,855-bp fragment, of which 1,485 bp corresponded to the entire DENV-1 E gene. The reaction consisted of 2 μL of cDNA, 5 μL of 10X Accutaq LA buffer, 2.5 μL of dNTPs (10 mM/μL), 1 μL of DMSO 2%, 1 μL of primers d1s3 and d1a17 (10 μM), 0.5 μL of Accutaq LA DNA polymerase (5 U/μL; Sigma-Aldrich) and DEPC-treated water. The reactions were submitted to the following cycle conditions: 98°C for 30 sec, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec, 50°C for 20 sec and 68°C for 1 min and 30 sec. A final extension step was performed at 68°C for 10 min.
