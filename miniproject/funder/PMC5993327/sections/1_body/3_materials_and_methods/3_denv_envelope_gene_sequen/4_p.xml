<p>To obtain insight into the genetic relationship among DENV-1 strains, envelope sequences obtained from different DENV-1 isolates from SJRP and other geographic sites were aligned using ClustalW [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], taking into account the codon sequences. Amino acid sequences were predicted, and substitution patterns were analyzed. Phylogenetic and coalescent analyses were conducted using BEAST package v.1.8 with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Input files for BEAST were generated using BEAUTI v.1.8.1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and the year each strain was isolated/obtained was used as a calibration point. Analyses were performed using the General Time Reversible nucleotide substitution model with four gamma categories (GTR + 4G), the Bayesian Skyline method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and a relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) molecular clock. Two independent runs (100 million chains, discarding the first 10 million steps) were run, and parameters and trees were sampled every 10,000 steps. The convergence of parameters was checked with Tracer v1.6.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and uncertainties were addressed as 95% Bayesian Credible Intervals (BCI). Using Tree Annotator v. 1.8.1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was generated and then visualized in Figure Tree v. 1.4.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
