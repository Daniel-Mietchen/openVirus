<p>Cells total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions with primers D1GSR. The qRT-PCR reaction was performed using two different mixes, and it consisted of 5 μL of cDNA, 12.5 μL of 2X GoTaq qPCR Master Mix, 2 μL of forward and reverse primers (10 μM), 0.25 μL of CXR reference dye and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 μL per reaction. To quantify gRNA, primers D1GSF and D1GSR were used; otherwise, D1SF and D1GSR were used for sfRNA quantification. The reactions were subjected to the following cycle conditions, with data collected at 55°C and 60°C: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 55°C for 1 min. A final dissociation step was conducted at 60–95°C. The results were obtained using a standard curve and by analyzing the melting curve (~ 84.5°C) to approximately CT 35. Quantification of gRNA and sfRNA levels was performed as described previously [
