<p>We observed predominantly dengue without warning signals. All the samples used in this study were collected untill 5 days of the 
 <italic>symptoms</italic> onset. The serum samples were subjected to molecular biological and serological diagnostic tests for dengue. Initially, DENV infection was confirmed using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and multiplex nested PCR (M-N-PCR) assays as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which distinguishes the four serotypes. Ninety-six DENV-1-positive samples were tested for anti-dengue IgG antibodies, as recommended by the SERION ELISA classic Dengue IgG test kit (Virion Serion).
