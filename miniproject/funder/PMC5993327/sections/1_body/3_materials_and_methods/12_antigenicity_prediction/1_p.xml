 <italic>In silico</italic> analyses of the putative antigenic potential of L1 and L6 lineages were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, 20 amino acid sequences encoding the DENV-1 polyprotein were first aligned using the Multalin interface (

The consensus sequence coding for Capsid, Envelope and NS1 proteins was submitted to the BepiPred 1.0 server (

The mean value of the epitope propensity scores for each sequence was then classified and plotted according to its potential immunogenicity.
