<p>When it was not possible to obtain an amplicon of the envelope gene region or complete genomic sequences, lineage discrimination of DENV-1-positive samples was performed using the TaqMan Real-Time PCR genotyping assay and the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) with two primers and probe sets for the envelope (2021_F, 2021_R and 2021_P1) and NS5 (8587_F, 8587_R and 8587_P2) regions, as shown in
