<p>The One-Step qRT-PCR reaction was performed using two different master mixes and consisted of 7 μL of RNA sample, 12.5 μL of 2X RT-PCR buffer, 1 μL of forward and reverse primers (20 μM), 0.75 μL of probe (10 μM), 1 μL of 25X RT-PCR enzyme mix and nuclease-free water in a total volume of 25 μL per reaction. To identify the L1 lineage, primers 2021_F and 2021_R and probe 2021_P1 were used; 8587_F, 8587_R and 8587_P2 were used for lineage L6 identification. The reactions were subjected to the following cycle conditions, with data collections at 60°C: 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 10 min, 60°C for 30 sec and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. A final extension step was conducted at 60°C for 30 sec. Genotyping was performed using human sera and standardized samples (to provide standard curves) to allow the relative quantification of virus levels. All qRT-PCR reactions were performed using a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).</p>
