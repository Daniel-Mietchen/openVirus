Infected PPCampos (n = 80) and Dom Pedro (n = 60) females were maintained in cages with 10% glucose solution until day 14 after the experimental infection (complete extrinsic incubation period). They were then dissected, and total RNA was extracted from their bodies and heads (with attached salivary glands) using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described previously [
