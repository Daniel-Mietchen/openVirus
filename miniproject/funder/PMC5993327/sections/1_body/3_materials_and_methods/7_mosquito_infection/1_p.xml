 <italic>aegypti</italic> eggs from populations PPCampos (captive; maintained approximately 15 years in an insectary at the Laboratório de Entomologia Médica, CPqRR, FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte-MG, from Campos dos Goytacazes-RJ) and Dom Pedro (wild; collected in 2014 in district Dom Pedro of Manaus-AM) were used in this study according to a previous description [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Briefly, the larvae were hatched in an insectary at a temperature of 28°C and relative humidity of 80%, and infections were performed using 3 to 5-day-old female mosquitoes (Dom Pedro from the F2 generation) using a glass feeding device containing 2/3 of blood mouse (
