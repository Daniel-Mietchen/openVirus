<p>The infection rate (IR) was then calculated as the individual proportion of all experimentally infected mosquitoes, in which DENV was detected in the body. Similarly, the vector competence (VC) was calculated, in which DENV was detected in the head (indicating the virus escaped the midgut barrier, completing its life cycle). However, the disseminated infection rate (DIR) is the proportion of DENV-infected mosquito heads of all infected mosquitoes with virus dispersed in the body (DIR = VC/IR).</p>
