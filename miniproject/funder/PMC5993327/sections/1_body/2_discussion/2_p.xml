<p>Since 2008, the L6 lineage of DENV-1 (genotype V) has circulated in SJRP. The duration of the circulation of this lineage in the population allowed us to consider it an endemic lineage. In mid-2010, a different Brazilian lineage arose: L1. This newly introduced lineage appeared to have improved viral fitness compared to L6; thus, L1 was expected to replace L6 as the dominant strain. From the emergence of the L1 lineage until 2012, the epidemics in SJRP appeared to follow the path of other epidemics, and the CR event would occur. However, the L1 lineage did not displace L6, but rather both co-circulated without a clear predominance. L1 started to decline until its complete disappearance in 2013. This finding raised questions about differences in the fitness between the lineages, which were investigated by our group.</p>
