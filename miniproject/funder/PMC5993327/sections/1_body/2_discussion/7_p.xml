<p>Previous antibody immunity to dengue could also play a role in epidemic dynamics. For example, the immunological status of the population could interfere with L1 propagation through an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon. Waning immunity due to a prior DENV infection can alter the outcome of the present infection, as observed in Nicaragua [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. High titers of pre-infection cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies drastically reduce the probability of a severe disease in a second infection, although this protective effect is not observed against all DENV serotypes [
