<p>Viral fitness is an important contributing factor to CR and, on some occasions, it can account for the persistence of the strain. In other DENV epidemics, improved replicative fitness of the emerging strain has been responsible for the dominance of the newer lineage. For example, the replicative fitness advantage of the NI-2B lineage over the NI-1 lineage in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> could have contributed to the CR event, resulting in the dominance of NI-2B in Managua [
