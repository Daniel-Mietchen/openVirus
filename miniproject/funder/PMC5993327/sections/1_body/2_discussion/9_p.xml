<p>The latter studies suggested that immune responses to L1 were enhanced and more pro-inflammatory and led us to investigate in greater detail adaptive immune responses in patients infected with the L1 or L6 lineages. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> analysis suggested that the L1 lineage was potentially more immunogenic than the L6 lineage. These predictions were confirmed by studies in mice that showed increased immunogenicity of L1, as assessed by greater B and T cell activation. Unfortunately, we did not have access to PBMCs derived from L1 or L6 infected patients, and only the sera were available. Therefore, it was not possible to assess directly T cell recall responses to L1 and L6 viruses. However, experiments in human PMBCs infected with either lineage showed that the L1 lineage induced stronger responses than those infected with L6 viruses. Altogether, he data suggest that different DENV isolates might induce distinct levels of B and T cell activation. L1-induced response was mostly associated to IFN-γ production, whereas L6 induced activation was driven to inflammatory IL-8 secretion. Distinct T cell phenotype and function, with increased T cells activation and IFN-γ production might then be associated to disease control [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Altogether, these studies suggest that the adaptive immune responses in infected individuals triggered by L1 were stronger than those triggered by L6.
