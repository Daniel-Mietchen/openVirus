<p>In the SJRP epidemic, differences in the replicative fitness could have accounted for the persistence of L6 even after the introduction of the new lineage (L1). However, the L1 had higher replication rates than L6 in mosquito, human and non-human primate cell lines. It also had an increased fitness in two different populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and thus could have a higher potential for transmission than L6. Unfortunately, it was not possible to analyze viral levels in mosquitos collected at that time. In theory, the coinfection of vectors with both lineages can result in competition and can accurately represent the natural transmission cycles. However, the superior viral fitness of L1 in mosquito cell culture indicates that coinfections do not have any effect on viral fitness. In fact, all tests conducted by our group revealed superior viral fitness of L1, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, the better replicative fitness L1 would induce its dominance and not its replacement by L6. Some studies theorize that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infections can sometimes fail to predict the actual dynamics of DENV epidemics [
