<p>The current dogma indicates that, after infection with a certain DENV serotype, only a heterologous DENV serotype can cause infection in the same individuals. However, studies using non-human primates have indicated that new inoculations with either the same or different genotypes of DENV-2 can cause a persistent boost in neutralizing antibodies [

Because L6 only weakly stimulates B and T cells, it may not increase immunological memory, nor may it induce the development of neutralizing antibodies in sufficient titers to protect against a new exposure. Although further work with specific experiments are needed to strengthen this evidence, it appears that neutralizing antibodies may quickly control infections, preventing more severe disease; however, they may not avoid future infections. A similar mechanism has been proposed for studies in Nicaragua [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and may provide an explanation for the maintenance of L6 for such a long period in the population. High viral loads of L6 enhance the probability of vector transmission of the L6 lineage. However, despite the better replicative fitness, the L1 lineage appears to elicit a stronger immune response, preventing broader propagation of this lineage due to the extinction of the susceptible population.
