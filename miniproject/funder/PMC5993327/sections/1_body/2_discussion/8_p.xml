<p>Because previously reported mechanisms were unable to explain the persistence of L6, we evaluated various aspects of the immune response in order to provide an alternative explanation to our findings. To assess possible differences in immunological responses, a panel of 29 cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and growth factors were measured in plasma of patients. Dengue infection was associated with the increase of several cytokines in serum of patients. Overall infection with the L6 lineage was associated with greater increases of cytokines with anti-inflammatory (IL-1RA and IL-13) or Th2-like activity (IL-13 and CCL11). In contrast, infection with the L1 lineage was associated with greater increase of cytokines with Th1/Th17â€“like activity (IL-12 and IL-17) and IL-7, a cytokine that promotes lymphocyte development in the thymus and maintains survival of naive and memory T cell homeostasis in the periphery. The exact role of these cytokines in the context of dengue infection is not precisely know but these results clearly show that the L1 lineage had a tendency to generate immune responses usually associated with resistance to dengue infection whereas the L6 lineage the tendency to generating cytokines with anti-inflammatory activity or that block Th1/Th17 responses.</p>
