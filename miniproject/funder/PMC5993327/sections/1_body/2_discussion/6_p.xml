<p>Evasion of interferon responses by the virus could be a factor underlying the maintenance of the L6 lineage in the population. This has been identified as a determinant of epidemiological fitness in the lineage dominance of DENV-2 (PR-2B) in Puerto Rico [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During flavivirus infections, short flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are produced by the incomplete degradation of viral RNA by the host-cell exonuclease Xrn1. These sfRNAs are associated with the pathogenesis of flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The high expression of sfRNAs could have inhibited type I interferon responses and facilitated evasion of the immune response. In a study conducted in Puerto Rico, the PR-2B lineage produced elevated expression of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) relative to genomic RNA (gRNA) during replication. Notably, sfRNA could bind TRIM25 and inhibit the IFN response. Thus, higher sfRNA:gRNA ratios are associated with superior epidemiological fitness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although L6 had higher sfRNA:gRNA ratios than L1, which in turn could increase its epidemic potential, it did not appear to be related to IFN inhibition, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Both lineages appeared to be incapable of inhibiting the IFN response and produced similar levels of type I IFN
