<p>Our prediction would be that differences in immune response would necessarily have to associate with altered viral loads, if these responses were to affect the likelihood of one strain to override the other. Indeed, patients infected with the L6 lineage, the one with significantly decreased immune activation, were those with the higher viral loads. We would expect that the high viral L6 loads would enhance the probability of transmission of the L6 lineage to the vector and, consequently, to another host.</p>
