<p>To understand the forces that drive DENV epidemics, it is crucial to develop efficient control methods for this disease. The introduction of new lineages and CR is important for maintenance of the disease in a given population. CR is a well-documented event that occurs in many epidemics when a new DENV strain emerges and displaces the endemic strain, even between viruses of the same serotypes and genotypes. This process usually causes an increase in both the number of cases and the severity of the disease [
