<p>Lineages of the same serotype may present different characteristics in transmissibility, virulence and antigenic properties, some of which may lead to increased fitness and could be related to a greater epidemic potential [

 <italic>the capacity of a virus to produce infectious progeny in a given environment</italic>, 
 <italic>whereas the capacity of a virus to become dominant in a given region has been called epidemiological fitness</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The latter is determined by a combination of factors, including the genetics of the viral strain, transmission potential by the vector and human system interactions [
