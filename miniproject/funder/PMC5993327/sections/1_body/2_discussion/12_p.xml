<p>Based on our data, the absence of CR together with the superior epidemiological fitness of L6 in SJRP was a result of the human immune system functioning as a bottleneck that favored the L6 lineage to achieve a broader distribution, even with lower viral fitness. The model is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006525.g008">Fig 8</xref>. The inability of the L1 lineage to replace the endemic L6 lineage in this city shows that the interplay between replicative, immunological and epidemiological features that affect the dynamics of viral propagation is far more complex than previously suspected. In this case, the lower viral immunogenicity for B and T cells associated with host immunological factors counteracts the superior viral fitness, contributing to the lineage dominance.
