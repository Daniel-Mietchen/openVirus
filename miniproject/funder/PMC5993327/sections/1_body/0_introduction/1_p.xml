<p>The spread of dengue (DENV) over the past several decades has made this arbovirus infection a major public health concern of global impact [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease has a complex epidemiological pattern and a high economic impact globally and is considered hyperendemic, 
 <italic>i</italic>. 
 <italic>e</italic>. dengue fever has a high incidence and/or prevalence rate affecting all groups equally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Worldwide, it is estimated that 390 million new DENV infections occur annually [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and this number will likely increase with the creation of new vector habitats due to climate change [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Because of their wide distribution, particularly in urban and peri-urban environments in tropical and subtropical regions, mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus are the main vectors of this disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. DENV can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that are classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as 
 <italic>dengue without warning signs</italic>, 
 <italic>dengue with warning signs</italic> and 
 <italic>severe dengue</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Previous infections with a heterologous type are usually, but not exclusively, associated with progression to more severe disease [
