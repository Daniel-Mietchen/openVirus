<p>Since the mid-1980s, DENV-1 has been circulating in Brazil. All Brazilian DENV-1 isolates described to date belong to genotype V, which is subdivided into three distinct clades (lineages 1, 3 and 6) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These lineages were introduced into Brazil at different times, and CR or the co-circulation of different lineages has been observed in the country [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This pattern of co-circulation of different lineages was also observed in São José do Rio Preto (SJRP), São Paulo, Brazil.
