<p>There are four genetically distinct serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to -4) that share similar epidemiological features [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Each serotype is divided into distinct groups defined as genotypes, which in turn subdivided in different lineages [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The circulation of the virus is characterized by frequent lineage turnover, in which a lineage of circulating viruses is usually replaced by a new lineage, a well-documented phenomenon known as clade replacement (CR). CR can lead to an increase in the number of cases and in the severity of the disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In previous CR events, an established lineage circulating for a number of years in a given population is replaced when a new lineage is introduced. This replacement is usually followed by the extinction of the previous lineage after a period of co-circulation of both lineages [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
