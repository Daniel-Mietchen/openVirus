  <title>Rank of antigenicity, B and T cell activation and viral load of DENV-1 lineages.</title>
  <p>(A) Twenty DENV-1 sequences from SJRP (L1 and L6) subjected to B and T antigenicity prediction and classified according to their immunogenic potential. (B, C and D) Analysis of B (B), CD4 (C) and CD8 T (D) cell activation in C57BL/6 at 7 days post-infection by flow cytometry (Student’s T test). (E, F and G) Average and individual data for IgM levels by an ELISA (E); CD4 (F) and CD8 T (G) cell activation frequency obtained in PBMCs from healthy donors by flow cytometry (Student’s T test).</p>
