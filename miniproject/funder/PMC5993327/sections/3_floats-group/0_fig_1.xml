  <title>Evolutionary relationship between DENV-1 isolates and co-circulation of the two lineages from SJRP.</title>
  <p>(A) Phylogenetic tree of DENV-1 after Bayesian inference based on envelope nucleotide sequences with aa substitutions, characterizing the L1 and L6 lineages from SJRP, which are shown in blue and red, respectively. (B) Comparison of amino acid substitutions between the representative complete genome sequences of L1 and L6 lineages from SJRP (287/2011 and 484/2012, respectively). (C) Circulation of DENV-1 lineages (L1 and L6) in SJRP from 2008 to 2015 based on sequencing and genotyping data.</p>
