In S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto, Brazil, we observed that the L6 lineage of DENV-1 (genotype V) remained the dominant circulating lineage even after the introduction of the L1 lineage. We investigated viral fitness and immunogenicity of the L1 and L6 lineages and which factors interfered with the dynamics of DENV epidemics. The results showed a more efficient replicative fitness of L1 over L6 in mosquitoes and in human and non-human primate cell lines. Infections by the L6 lineage were associated with reduced antigenicity, weak B and T cell stimulation and weak host immune system interactions, which were associated with higher viremia. Our data, therefore, demonstrate that reduced viral immunogenicity and consequent greater viremia determined the increased epidemiological fitness of DENV-1 L6 lineage in S&#x000e3;o Jos&#x000e9; do Rio Preto.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Since 2008 L6 is the endemic lineage that has circulated in SJRP. In 2010, the L1 lineage was first identified in the city. For a period, both lineages co-circulated, and then in 2013, L1 began to diminish until it was no longer detected in the population. Differences in replicative fitness are usually the main factor for clade replacement (CR) in DENV epidemics. However, despite the better viral fitness of the emerging lineage, the absence of CR could not be explained by these differences alone. Here, we combine epidemiological, phylogenetic, molecular and immunological analyses to provide a more precise understanding of the role of fitness in lineage dynamics with the persistence of L6 even after the introduction of L1 without CR. Differences in immune responses elicited by DENV-1 L1 and L6 lineages (genotype V), but not viral fitness in mosquito or human cells, explain the dynamics of circulating DENV in a city of Brazil.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>FAPESP</institution></funding-source><award-id>2013/21719-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1102-2419</contrib-id><name><surname>Nogueira</surname><given-names>Maur&#x000ed;cio Lacerda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012/11733-6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1102-2419</contrib-id><name><surname>Nogueira</surname><given-names>Maur&#x000ed;cio Lacerda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (BR)</institution></funding-source><award-id>2015/22750-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mota</surname><given-names>Manlio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>CNPQ</institution></funding-source><award-id>INCT/DENGUE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teixeira</surname><given-names>Mauro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work is funded by Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP), Grants # 2012/11733-6 and 2013/21719-3 to MLN and 2015/22750-7 to TMP and by INCT-Dengue/CNPq.

The introduction of new lineages and CR is important for maintenance of the disease in a given population. CR is a well-documented event that occurs in many epidemics when a new DENV strain emerges and displaces the endemic strain, even between viruses of the same serotypes and genotypes. This process usually causes an increase in both the number of cases and the severity of the disease [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although relatively common, the forces that dictate whether CR will occur are not completely understood. Genetic variations may alter viral fitness; however, the interplay of this factor with epidemiological factors has not been defined.</p><p>Since 2008, the L6 lineage of DENV-1 (genotype V) has circulated in SJRP. The duration of the circulation of this lineage in the population allowed us to consider it an endemic lineage. In mid-2010, a different Brazilian lineage arose: L1. This newly introduced lineage appeared to have improved viral fitness compared to L6; thus, L1 was expected to replace L6 as the dominant strain. From the emergence of the L1 lineage until 2012, the epidemics in SJRP appeared to follow the path of other epidemics, and the CR event would occur. However, the L1 lineage did not displace L6, but rather both co-circulated without a clear predominance. L1 started to decline until its complete disappearance in 2013. This finding raised questions about differences in the fitness between the lineages, which were investigated by our group.</p><p>Lineages of the same serotype may present different characteristics in transmissibility, virulence and antigenic properties, some of which may lead to increased fitness and could be related to a greater epidemic potential [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The viral fitness is defined by <italic>the capacity of a virus to produce infectious progeny in a given environment</italic>, <italic>whereas the capacity of a virus to become dominant in a given region has been called epidemiological fitness</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The latter is determined by a combination of factors, including the genetics of the viral strain, transmission potential by the vector and human system interactions [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Investigations of the factors involved in lineage replacement have revealed important implications for advancing our understanding of DENV epidemiology, evolutionary dynamics and control [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Viral fitness is an important contributing factor to CR and, on some occasions, it can account for the persistence of the strain. In other DENV epidemics, improved replicative fitness of the emerging strain has been responsible for the dominance of the newer lineage. For example, the replicative fitness advantage of the NI-2B lineage over the NI-1 lineage in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> could have contributed to the CR event, resulting in the dominance of NI-2B in Managua [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Replacement of the NI-1 lineage by the NI-2B lineage was also associated with an increase in disease severity.</p><p>In the SJRP epidemic, differences in the replicative fitness could have accounted for the persistence of L6 even after the introduction of the new lineage (L1). However, the L1 had higher replication rates than L6 in mosquito, human and non-human primate cell lines. It also had an increased fitness in two different populations of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and thus could have a higher potential for transmission than L6. Unfortunately, it was not possible to analyze viral levels in mosquitos collected at that time. In theory, the coinfection of vectors with both lineages can result in competition and can accurately represent the natural transmission cycles. However, the superior viral fitness of L1 in mosquito cell culture indicates that coinfections do not have any effect on viral fitness. In fact, all tests conducted by our group revealed superior viral fitness of L1, <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, the better replicative fitness L1 would induce its dominance and not its replacement by L6. Some studies theorize that <italic>in vitro</italic> infections can sometimes fail to predict the actual dynamics of DENV epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, differences in replicative fitness did not explain the observed pattern of L6 persistence.</p><p>Evasion of interferon responses by the virus could be a factor underlying the maintenance of the L6 lineage in the population. This has been identified as a determinant of epidemiological fitness in the lineage dominance of DENV-2 (PR-2B) in Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. During flavivirus infections, short flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) are produced by the incomplete degradation of viral RNA by the host-cell exonuclease Xrn1. These sfRNAs are associated with the pathogenesis of flaviviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The high expression of sfRNAs could have inhibited type I interferon responses and facilitated evasion of the immune response. In a study conducted in Puerto Rico, the PR-2B lineage produced elevated expression of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) relative to genomic RNA (gRNA) during replication. Notably, sfRNA could bind TRIM25 and inhibit the IFN response. Thus, higher sfRNA:gRNA ratios are associated with superior epidemiological fitness [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although L6 had higher sfRNA:gRNA ratios than L1, which in turn could increase its epidemic potential, it did not appear to be related to IFN inhibition, as previously reported [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Both lineages appeared to be incapable of inhibiting the IFN response and produced similar levels of type I IFN <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting this was not the mechanism underlying the differences observed.</p><p>Previous antibody immunity to dengue could also play a role in epidemic dynamics. For example, the immunological status of the population could interfere with L1 propagation through an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon. Waning immunity due to a prior DENV infection can alter the outcome of the present infection, as observed in Nicaragua [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. High titers of pre-infection cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies drastically reduce the probability of a severe disease in a second infection, although this protective effect is not observed against all DENV serotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, no significant differences in the frequency of anti-dengue IgG antibodies were found in our patients.</p><p>Because previously reported mechanisms were unable to explain the persistence of L6, we evaluated various aspects of the immune response in order to provide an alternative explanation to our findings. To assess possible differences in immunological responses, a panel of 29 cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and growth factors were measured in plasma of patients. Dengue infection was associated with the increase of several cytokines in serum of patients. Overall infection with the L6 lineage was associated with greater increases of cytokines with anti-inflammatory (IL-1RA and IL-13) or Th2-like activity (IL-13 and CCL11). In contrast, infection with the L1 lineage was associated with greater increase of cytokines with Th1/Th17&#x02013;like activity (IL-12 and IL-17) and IL-7, a cytokine that promotes lymphocyte development in the thymus and maintains survival of naive and memory T cell homeostasis in the periphery. The exact role of these cytokines in the context of dengue infection is not precisely know but these results clearly show that the L1 lineage had a tendency to generate immune responses usually associated with resistance to dengue infection whereas the L6 lineage the tendency to generating cytokines with anti-inflammatory activity or that block Th1/Th17 responses.</p><p>The latter studies suggested that immune responses to L1 were enhanced and more pro-inflammatory and led us to investigate in greater detail adaptive immune responses in patients infected with the L1 or L6 lineages. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis suggested that the L1 lineage was potentially more immunogenic than the L6 lineage. These predictions were confirmed by studies in mice that showed increased immunogenicity of L1, as assessed by greater B and T cell activation. Unfortunately, we did not have access to PBMCs derived from L1 or L6 infected patients, and only the sera were available. Therefore, it was not possible to assess directly T cell recall responses to L1 and L6 viruses. However, experiments in human PMBCs infected with either lineage showed that the L1 lineage induced stronger responses than those infected with L6 viruses. Altogether, he data suggest that different DENV isolates might induce distinct levels of B and T cell activation. L1-induced response was mostly associated to IFN-&#x003b3; production, whereas L6 induced activation was driven to inflammatory IL-8 secretion. Distinct T cell phenotype and function, with increased T cells activation and IFN-&#x003b3; production might then be associated to disease control [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Altogether, these studies suggest that the adaptive immune responses in infected individuals triggered by L1 were stronger than those triggered by L6.</p><p>Our prediction would be that differences in immune response would necessarily have to associate with altered viral loads, if these responses were to affect the likelihood of one strain to override the other. Indeed, patients infected with the L6 lineage, the one with significantly decreased immune activation, were those with the higher viral loads. We would expect that the high viral L6 loads would enhance the probability of transmission of the L6 lineage to the vector and, consequently, to another host.</p><p>The current dogma indicates that, after infection with a certain DENV serotype, only a heterologous DENV serotype can cause infection in the same individuals. However, studies using non-human primates have indicated that new inoculations with either the same or different genotypes of DENV-2 can cause a persistent boost in neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because L6 only weakly stimulates B and T cells, it may not increase immunological memory, nor may it induce the development of neutralizing antibodies in sufficient titers to protect against a new exposure. Although further work with specific experiments are needed to strengthen this evidence, it appears that neutralizing antibodies may quickly control infections, preventing more severe disease; however, they may not avoid future infections. A similar mechanism has been proposed for studies in Nicaragua [<xref rid="pntd.0006525.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and may provide an explanation for the maintenance of L6 for such a long period in the population. High viral loads of L6 enhance the probability of vector transmission of the L6 lineage. However, despite the better replicative fitness, the L1 lineage appears to elicit a stronger immune response, preventing broader propagation of this lineage due to the extinction of the susceptible population.</p><p>Based on our data, the absence of CR together with the superior epidemiological fitness of L6 in SJRP was a result of the human immune system functioning as a bottleneck that favored the L6 lineage to achieve a broader distribution, even with lower viral fitness. The model is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006525.g008">Fig 8</xref>. The inability of the L1 lineage to replace the endemic L6 lineage in this city shows that the interplay between replicative, immunological and epidemiological features that affect the dynamics of viral propagation is far more complex than previously suspected. In this case, the lower viral immunogenicity for B and T cells associated with host immunological factors counteracts the superior viral fitness, contributing to the lineage dominance.</p><fig id="pntd.0006525.g008" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0006525.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Proposed model for L6 lineage (red) dominant circulation without L1 lineage replacement (blue) in the SJRP population, with the main differences found between the two DENV-1 lineages.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pntd.0006525.g008"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The panel of 186 DENV-1 viruses used in the present study was collected from symptomatic patients from 2008 to 2015 in a public healthcare facility in SJRP (S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) as part of the flavivirus and hantavirus surveillance program in the city.

To assess viability, an aliquot of cells was diluted 1:20 in 0.4% Trypan Blue solution (Invitrogen) and counted using a Neubauer chamber. A panel of monoclonal antibodies (Becton Dickinson, USA) specific for CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD21<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte subsets and activation markers (CD25, CD69, CD28 and CTLA-4) was then used for cell staining (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006525.s009">S5 Table</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, 1x10<sup>6</sup> spleen cells were distributed in 96-well polystyrene conical bottom microwell plates and centrifuged at 377 x g for 10 min.
