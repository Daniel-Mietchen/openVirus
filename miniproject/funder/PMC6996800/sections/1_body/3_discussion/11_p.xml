<p>In summary, we demonstrate two important interrelated aspects: the first one refers to how the discarded cases, which resulted from reported cases of one arbovirus, can be considered as part of complementary notifications of another; the second concerns how the series of confirmed cases of one disease may affect the series of confirmed cases of another. Thus, these findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in criteria clinical- epidemiologic when these three arboviruses co-circulate in the same population. We would like to emphasize that we could not find in the literature similar results aiming to discuss or explore large sets of occurrences where inter-correlations of cases discarded from one arbovirus and confirmed in the other could exist. A possible exception is a small scale, clinically based study concerned to the definition of cases, whereby the analyses were performed by checking if the symptoms presented by patients, after a second analysis by trained specialists, were well associated to one specific arbovirus [
