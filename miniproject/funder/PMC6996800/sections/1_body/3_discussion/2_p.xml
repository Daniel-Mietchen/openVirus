<p>The strong positive correlation found in the analyses shows that the notification series of dengue was significantly impacted by Zika, and vice-versa. A reasonable interpretation is that an increase of individuals notified as Zika contributes to an increase of wrong notification of dengue cases within two scenario: people with Zika were wrongly classified as dengue (and vice-versa), or perhaps both viruses infected the same individuals. The results also indicate that the series of confirmed Zika cases increased the series of discarded dengue cases and that, among those discarded, there were indeed confirmed Zika cases. The series of confirmed cases of dengue affects significantly and positively (increasing) the series of discarded cases of Zika, which can be explained by the awareness of the consequences accounted by Zika at the end of 2015.</p>
