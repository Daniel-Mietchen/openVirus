<p>The notifications of Zika and dengue had overall weaker effects on the notification of suspected chikungunya cases, as indicated by the smaller correlation values between the corresponding series. The association of these values with Granger scores indicates a possible influence in 4 out of the 12 possible combinations. Considering confirmed and discarded cases of Zika and chikungunya, the unrestricted model was not able to find associations between these series. The analyses suggest that they did not affect each other and probably their notifications happened as independent events in Brazil. As to the mutual influence of dengue and chikungunya notifications, Granger scores show that possibly a small amount of confirmed and discarded cases of dengue were either confirmed cases of chikungunya or dengue notification were increased by the notification of chikungunya. In opposition to these specific combinations, the remaining results show either the failure to reject the null hypothesis, as in the result for chikungunya and Zika cases, or a very small correlation value, as for both confirmed dengue and chikungunya cases. Thus, the remaining they also support the conclusion that the notifications of dengue and Zika happened independently of the notification of chikungunya.</p>
