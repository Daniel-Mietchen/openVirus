<p>Our studies based on a rather simplified linear model can be complemented by future works, where the analysis proceeds either through non-linear methods or through a more comprehensive and adequate model. A detailed study, probably based on the symptoms presented by patients, may also contribute to having better estimations for the quantity of cases that can be assigned for each disease. All suppositions made here are based only on a temporal analysis of the time series of notifications. Therefore, including a spatial analysis would clarify more issues regarding the surveillance of co-circulation of arboviruses and how zones with higher incidences handled with the notifications of the cases.</p>
