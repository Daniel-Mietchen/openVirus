<p>We used data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). We collected weekly reported data of suspected cases of dengue (from 2010 to 2017), chikungunya (from 2014 up to 2017), and Zika (from 2015 up to 2017) viruses. We only considered cases that presented non-null information about the temporal variable, i.e., week of notification or week of first symptoms. We further separated the cases into confirmed and discarded, following the final classification information as used by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Confirmed cases are all suspected cases of disease, excluding those discarded or inconclusive. This classification can be based on clinical/epidemiological criteria, namely presence of clinical symptoms in the same area and time as other probable cases, or on clinical/laboratory criteria, namely the presence of clinical symptoms and a positive IgM ELISA result, viral RNA detection via PCR, NS1 viral antigen detection, or positive viral culture [

Discarded cases are defined as any suspected case that satisfies at least one of the following criteria: negative laboratory diagnosis (IgM serology); a laboratory confirmation of another disease; clinical and epidemiological compatibility with other diseases. Inconclusive cases of dengue and chikungunya (â‰² 10% reported cases) were excluded from the analyses. However inconclusive cases of Zika represented about 30% (110,656/361,396 registered cases) of all notified cases from 2015 to 2017, accounting for about 56% (33,863/60,972 registered cases) of the Zika notifications in 2015. Once specific Zika laboratory tests were unavailable in that period, for the purpose of the carried analyses, we considered inconclusive Zika cases as confirmed Zika cases.
