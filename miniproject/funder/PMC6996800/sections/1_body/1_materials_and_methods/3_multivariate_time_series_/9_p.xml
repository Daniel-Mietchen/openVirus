<p>The steps to construct and analyse a VAR(
 <italic>p</italic>) model amounts to: (i) estimate the VAR coefficients by a multivariate Least Squares Estimation; (ii) select the 
 <italic>p</italic> (lag) order using AIC; (iii) test for normality of residuals by representing their ordered values as a function of theoretical quantiles, by probability plots that show how the they depart from normal curve, and by the analysis of the partial (cross-)correlation function (PCF) between them; (iv) perform pair-wise Granger tests among the 6-dimensional estimated multivariate series.
