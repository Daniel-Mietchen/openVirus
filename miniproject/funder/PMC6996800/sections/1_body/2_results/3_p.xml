<p>Exploring the linear dependence between the series of confirmed and discarded cases, per epidemiological week, during the whole corresponding periods, for dengue, chikungunya and Zika in the country, we see that the slope 
 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>D</italic>
 </sub> of the linear relation for dengue is 2.0, while yearly based evaluations lead to a mean value 〈

 <sub>

 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> = 2.3 (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 1). It means that, on average, for every ten confirmed cases of dengue, about 4 cases are discarded. For chikungunya and Zika, the slopes are 3.2 and 3.6 respectively.
