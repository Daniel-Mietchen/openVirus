<p>Although chikungunya presents lower incidence compared with Zika and dengue, in 2015 we notice an inverted pattern in the proportion of confirmed and discarded cases compared to those reported by dengue and Zika. In 2017, where the proportion of discarded cases is higher for dengue and Zika, chikungunya shows a pattern with a higher proportion of confirmed cases in the first semester and lower in the second. The proportions of confirmed cases are more common both in the first and second semesters.</p>
