<p>The restricted model excluding the series of chikungunya has a better performance (AIC = 48.50, lag order = 13) regarding the multi-series model including the six series. An analysis of the residuals and model fitting similar to what is presented here was also done, again showing better results. The Granger tests performed for these four series also stay in agreement with the results for the unrestricted model including the six series.</p>
