<p>Although it is clear a mutual influence of the cases of Zika and dengue, we also performed an analysis of the restricted models between the cases of Zika and chikungunya and the cases of dengue and chikungunya. The analysis between Zika and chikungunya also presents a better AIC value 41.67 (lag order = 13). However, the Granger tests shows three different results: i) confirmed cases of Zika affect discarded cases of chikungunya (Test statistic = 2.206, p-value = 0.011); ii) discarded cases of Zika affect confirmed cases of chikungunya (Test statistic = 2.447, p-value = 0.004); and iii) a borderline result where confirmed cases of Zika affect confirmed cases of chikungunya (Test statistic = 1.761, p-value = 0.053). To conclude, the Granger tests for the analysis between dengue and chikungunya (AIC = 52.06, lag order = 12) presented less relations among them, with only confirmed cases of chikungunya affecting discarded cases of dengue. Despite this, in both models, a visual analysis through the probability plot of the residuals does not suggest normality.</p>
