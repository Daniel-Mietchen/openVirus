<p>We conducted a 16-month clinical study of pediatric inpatients in a single referral hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. While all 701 children enrolled in the study had clinical suspicion of dengue on admission, dengue was biologically confirmed in only 558 (79.6Â %). This enabled us to compare children with dengue and those with non-dengue febrile illnesses. This information is particularly useful in resource-limited settings where dengue diagnostic tests are not readily available.</p>
