<p>The ROC curves (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) illustrate the accuracy of these various models in predicting concurrent diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed DHF/DSS or SD at hospital admission, based on the total number of WS included in each model. For DHF/DSS, the highest predictive value was obtained when patients presented two or more WS upon admission (AUC = 0.78). For SD, predictive value was maximized when patients presented with at least three WS at admission (AUC = 0.81).
