<p>From September 2011 to January 2013, a total of 1115 admitted cases presenting with acute febrile illness were evaluated, of which 701 (59 %) were clinically suspected of being dengue-positive as per the 1997 or 2009 WHO guidelines. Of these 701 suspected cases, 79 % (558/701) were laboratory-confirmed dengue cases, and 21 % (143/701) were laboratory-negative and classified as Other Febrile Illnesses (OFI). Of the dengue laboratory-positive cases, 531 (95.2 %) were confirmed by PCR (520 DENV-1; eight DENV-2; one DENV-3; two DENV-4); 27 had a negative PCR result and were confirmed by another test: eight by IgM seroconversion, eight by a four-fold increase of HI titer, and 11 by NS1. Among the 558 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases, gender was found to be evenly distributed (49.5 % female and 50.5 % male). The median duration of hospital stay was 3 days (Inter-Quartile Range [IQR] 2–4). Age varied between 1 and 15 years, with a median of 7 years (IQR 5–10), and 18.3 % were under 5 years of age. The median onset of fever prior to admission was 4 days (IQR 4–5) and did not differ between dengue and non-dengue febrile illnesses (Table
