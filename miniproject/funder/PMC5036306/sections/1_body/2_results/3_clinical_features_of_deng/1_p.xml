<p>The clinical features of both laboratory-confirmed and negative patients were compared using multivariate analysis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Supplementary Data Analyses). When the results of liver transaminases were included, we found the following five variables to be independently associated with laboratory-confirmed dengue: positive tourniquet test (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.32–3.59); absence of upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms (OR 2.53, 95 % CI 1.47–4.37); platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells per mm
 <sup>3</sup> (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.32–6.37); leukocyte count &lt; 4000 cells per mm
 <sup>3</sup> (OR 3.60, 95 % CI 2.04–6.37); and liver transaminases &gt; 60 IU/mL (either AST or ALT; OR 2.31, 95 % CI 1.42–3.75). When we excluded the results of ALT/AST testing, as these tests may not always be available in resource-limited settings, the following six variables were associated with laboratory-confirmed dengue infection: nausea or vomiting (OR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.10–2.98); absence of URI symptoms (OR 2.59, 95 % CI 1.63–4.14); positive tourniquet test (OR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.43–3.44); liver enlargement (OR 2.97, 95 % CI 1.31–6.74); platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells per mm
 <sup>3</sup> (OR 2.37, 95 % CI 1.48–3.82); and leukocyte count &lt; 4000 cells per mm
 <sup>3</sup> (OR 2.96, 95 % CI 1.82–4.83).
