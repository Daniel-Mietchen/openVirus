<p>JJS: This is due to the fact that only 26 of the 50 cases received an IgM test. We restricted the assessment of Zika positivity by PCR or IgM to those 26 patients (this was to remove the possibility of bias from including all 50 patients: those who received an IgM test would be inherently more likely to be reported as Zika+, and if they were different in any way from the 24 who did not receive an IgM test, this could result in unforeseen biases).</p>
