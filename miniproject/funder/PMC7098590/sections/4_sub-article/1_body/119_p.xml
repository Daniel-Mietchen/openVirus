<p>Table 5: The sample size seems to be reduced to 26, although all patients have been tested using at least PCR? It seems that these are patients that have been assessed using IgM AND PCR instead IgM or PCR? What is the rationale to only take this subset here, where the other tables use the full sample as denominator? The conclusions seem to be thin, and based on multiple testing and wide confidence intervals. The text reports a ‘significant’ difference in dyspnea and a ‘trend’ in facial diplegia, dysphagia and dysarthria. What is a ‘trend’ and does the confidence interval take into account multiple testing? Would the authors consider phrasing these findings a bit more careful keeping in mind that these could as well be chance findings? E.g., we might as well say that there is a trend that PCR or IgM positivity (regardless of symptoms) is protective of GBS based on Table 4.</p>
