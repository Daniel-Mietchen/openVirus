<p>Reviewer #1: In this article, the authors included patients from three states of northeastern Mexico between August 2017 and June 2018, in order to establish whether the endemic circulation of Zika virus (ZIKV) was associated with the development of Guilla√≠n-Barre syndrome (GBS). It is a case-control study, the cases corresponded to hospitalized or outpatient with GBS, with diagnostic certainty of grades 1 to 3 according to the classification of Brighton Collaboration Criteria. For each patient they included 3 controls (2.8) seen in emergency visits or hospitalized, with non-febrile illness for 48 hours, paired with cases by sex and age + minus 10 years, and seen in the same hospital within seven days of each case. After the interview, serum and urine were taken in both groups to determine exposure to ZIKV, dengue virus and Chikungunya virus by viral RNA amplification (PCR) and detection of IgM antibodies to ZIKV.</p>
