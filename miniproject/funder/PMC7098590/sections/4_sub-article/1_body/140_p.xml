<p>4-LINE 107: Measures used to assess ZIKV status seem duplicative and create some confusion with respect to how the results are interpreted. For example, PCR-positive cases will be present also in the second group (Positive PCR assay or positive IgM assay) so that it is not clear how many patients were PCR- and IgM-positive, how many were only PCR-positive; and how many were only IgM-positive. Please clarify.</p>
