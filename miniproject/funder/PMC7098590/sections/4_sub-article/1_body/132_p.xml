<p>Reviewer #3: The paper “Zika Virus infection and Guillain Barré syndrome in Northeastern Mexico: a case-control study”, authored by Gongora-Rivera F. et al., is an interesting and well written manuscript that assesses the relationship between the occurrence of Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS) and ZIKA virus infection. The authors did not find evidence of a link between laboratory evidence of ZIKA virus infection and the occurrence of GBS, but they did find a significant association when considering the antecedent of ZIKA’s typical signs and symptoms. I found the conclusion for this work supported previous evidence on this topic, assessing the impact on neurological complications related to acute infection with ZIKA virus in a specific population, in Northeast Mexico.</p>
