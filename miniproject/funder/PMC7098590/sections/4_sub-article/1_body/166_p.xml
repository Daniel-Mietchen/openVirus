<p>JJS: We concur with the reviewer that the clinical signs and symptoms of dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika can be clinically indistinguishable. And, had we the necessary aliquots of serum to conduct these investigations, we would most certainly have done so. We were, however, limited by the availability of the necessary aliquots of serum. Nonetheless, there was no clear evidence of a great deal of circulating dengue or Chikungunya virus in Monterrey at the time, as evidenced by lack of PCR findings for both these viruses. We have, however, mentioned in the discussion / limitations that this does represent a substantial limitation in our findings (page 18, line 406). It has similarly been clarified in the methods. </p>
