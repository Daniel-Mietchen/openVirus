<p>Regarding the diagnostic methods: The authors present a surprising proportion of RT-PCR positive patients both in the cases as control group (22%). We tend to believe that RT-PCR in general is highly specific, and that a positive result could be considered as Zika. False negatives are much more common, since, in settings as these, we are often too late. We know from GBS cases that were preceded by symptomatic ZIKV infection, that these would often occur 5-10 days after symptom onset. If we allow time before sampling these patients (here:5-52 days, we expect few to still have viral RNA in their blood or urine. Even in a peak of an epidemic, sampling symptomatic patients would likely not yield such high counts. Cross-validation of the results with a different method, IgM/neutralization would be of great value here to interpret the results. Can the authors clarify the diagnostics by at least providing crosstabulation with the IgM. It would be crucial to get more clarity on this issue, since this is one of the most relevant exposure assessments in the manuscript.</p>
