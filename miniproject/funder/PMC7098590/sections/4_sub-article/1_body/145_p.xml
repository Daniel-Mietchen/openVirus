<p>JJS: We are aware of the reports of prolonged viremia, although the reports in the literature are relatively few. The reviewer is correct that we are unable to say with any degree of certainty the duration of viremia in our cases. We cannot, however, a priori assume that this is reflective of a prolonged viremia. </p>
