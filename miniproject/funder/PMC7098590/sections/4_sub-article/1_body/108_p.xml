<p>JJS: We concur with the reviewer that the proportion / percentage of cases and controls having positive results by PCR testing was much higher than expected. We also agree that it is more likely to have false negatives by PCR due to the timing issue. Unfortunately, during this investigation, there was so little sample left after routine bloodwork and PCR testing that we were, in the vast majority of cases, unable to ‘confirm’ the PCR results with concomitant serology. However, the definitive testing to substantiate this is not feasible.</p>
