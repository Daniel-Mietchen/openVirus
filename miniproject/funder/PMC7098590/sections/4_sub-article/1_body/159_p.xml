<p>JJS: The main purpose of Table 5 (now Table 6) is to determine if patients with Zika-associated GBS were clinically different from those with non-Zika-associated GBS. This was done using two slightly different definitions for Zika diagnosis (Zika diagnosis by PCR or IgM, or Zika diagnosis by PCR or IgM and rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis). The suggested changes would alter the comparisons: we would be seeing if, out of patients testing positive for Zika by PCR or IgM, whether those who had previous Zika symptoms differed clinically from those who did not have previous Zika symptoms (this also asks of those who tested negative for Zika by PCR or IgM, whether those who had previous Zika symptoms differed clinically from those who did not have previous Zika symptoms). These were not the research questions we were interested in. For the sake of clarity, we did add a footnote that specified which patients were included in these analyses. </p>
