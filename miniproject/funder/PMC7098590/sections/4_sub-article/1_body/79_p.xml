<p>The first problem we encountered with the study is that the characteristics of the control group are not well described, at least in general terms. Such as the proportion of outpatients and hospitalized patients. It would be important to describe if in the control group there were patients with neurological disease, especially with GBS and, if among the emergency included patients, there were patients with minor trauma or trivial conditions and otherwise previously healthy, who would be representative of the “open” population. With some of these data, the general characteristics of the control group would be clearer.</p>
