<p>JJS: As the reviewer rightly points out, part of the investigation was conducted during periods of relatively low, and even absent, Zika transmission. While we would like to give the readers a sense of the burden of Zika virus infection over the study period, unfortunately accurate, complete, and consistent data do not exist for these time periods in the Monterrey region, or for Mexico in general. Based upon the data that we were able to glean, Zika was still circulating during 2016 -2018, and based on what we know from 2016-2018, it seems like Zika incidence was highest during the fall through early winter, which seems to correspond roughly to an increase in GBS cases (and subsequent controls). We appreciate the reviewerâ€™s request for an epidemiologic curve, but when we formatted one, it did not appear to very well address the question posed by the reviewer, and we chose to omit it. </p>
