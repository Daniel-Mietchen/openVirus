<p>Reviewer #2: Soares et al. describe a case-control study in Mexico assessing the association between Zika infection and GBS. They enroll 50 cases and match 1:3 141 controls to these. They assess Zika infection using RT-PCR in all and IgM in some patients. They find a similar and high proportion of Zika infection in both groups based on RT-PCR. Lab results in combination with at least one symptom does provide a signal that favors the hypothesis that there is an association between Zika infection and GBS.</p>
