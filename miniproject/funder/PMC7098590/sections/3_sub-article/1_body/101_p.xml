<p>4-LINE 107: Measures used to assess ZIKV status seem duplicative and create some confusion with respect to how the results are interpreted. For example, PCR-positive cases will be present also in the second group (Positive PCR assay or positive IgM assay) so that it is not clear how many patients were PCR- and IgM-positive, how many were only PCR-positive; and how many were only IgM-positive. Please clarify. This is very important since PCR and IgM positivity are not synonymous from a pathophysiological perspective, but rather reflect two different processes that can occur during the infection. It is my understanding that these criteria were chosen because not all cases and controls have a serology for ZIKV performed. This is unfortunate since GBS is considered a post-infectious complication such that antibodies rather than viremia seem more likely a measure of a post-infectious state. Still, this test was obtained in only half of the cases and 80% of controls. It will be very interesting to analyze the subgroup of patients with a serology test and its relation with GBS over the total of cases and controls with this test available, and also those patients with coexistence of PCR and IgM (if any). Therefore, authors can considerate these measures to assess ZIKV status: positive PCR; positive IgM; positive PCR and IgM.</p>
