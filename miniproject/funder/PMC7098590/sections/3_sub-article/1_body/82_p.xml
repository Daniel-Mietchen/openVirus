<p>From surveillance reports (PAHO, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2017/2017-phe-zika-situation-report-mex.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2017/2017-phe-zika-situation-report-mex.pdf</ext-link>), it seems that the ZIKV outbreak took place in 2016, 2017. Could the authors in the introduction give some indication of the level of circulation, especially during the study period (August 2017, June 2018). Is this the tail of the epidemic, especially into 2018 was there any ZIKV circulation? How were the cases distributed over time? If the authors could provide an epidemic curve combined with when cases were sampled?
