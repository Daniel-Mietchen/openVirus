<p>6-Table 1. Results from the serology are missing. Please, add results from IgM assay against ZIKA. In a footnote it can be clarified for how many cases and how many controls serological testing was available. It also would be interesting express how many patients (if any?) were both PCR- and IgM- positive. Even when flavivirus infection is traditionally related to short viremias, followed by a rise of antibodies, some ZIKV infections have shown unusually prolonged viremias (more studies in pregnant woman). And even some recent studies link this prolonged viremia overlapping with peaking of specific antibodies, with the pathogenesis of congenital disease.</p>
