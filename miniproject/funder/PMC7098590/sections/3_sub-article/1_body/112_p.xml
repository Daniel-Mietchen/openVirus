<p>13-The authors develop a complete and correct analysis of appropriate bibliography. I consider the main limitation of this work, the lack of serology test for ZIKV for almost half of the cases (and actually, it is hard to find in the manuscript, how many of cases and controls had a positive result). This limitation is briefly mention in the discussion (LINE 261-262). Because GBS is a post-infectious event, is expected to find this clinical manifestation in synchrony with the presence of antibodies. It would be interesting to evaluate if exist an association with the presence of IgM against ZIKV and GBS, considering only that subgroup of cases and controls.</p>
