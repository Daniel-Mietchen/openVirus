<p>Much of the ‘significance’ relies on the combination of Lab results and one symptom (Rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis). Could the authors be more precise in explaining what these symptoms mean and how they were obtained: from clinical examination or the survey? E.g. does ‘joint pain’ mean that the subject had one day of joint pain 55 days before GBS onset (since the interview period mentions 2 months). A survey example could be provided in the supplementary material. Are these self-reported? What would classify as ‘conjunctivitis’ and what as ‘rash’? Do the authors agree that this information is crucial to interpret the likelihood of these (often aspecific) symptoms to be truly indicators for Zika virus infection.</p>
