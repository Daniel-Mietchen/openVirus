<p>Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy presenting classically with ascending progressive weakness, sensory changes, and hyporeflexia [

 <xref rid="pone.0230132.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. GBS is usually precipitated by a preceding infection or other antigenic stimuli [
 <xref rid="pone.0230132.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One of the pathophysiological mechanisms linked to GBS is molecular mimicry, as some pathogens may have antigens similar to peripheral nerve myelin and/or axonal epitopes [
