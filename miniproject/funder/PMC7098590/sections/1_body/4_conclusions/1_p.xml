<p>The accumulated evidence suggests a link between ZIKV infection and/or illness and GBS. Our study found a statistically significant association with symptomatic ZIKV but not with asymptomatic ZIKV infection alone. This finding supports a conclusion that the ZIKV association with GBS is stronger with ZIKV illness. Although the incidence of asymptomatic ZIKV is known to be several-fold higher than symptomatic ZIKV, our study suggests that during ZIKV epidemics, increases in GBS will occur primarily among those with antecedent symptomatic ZIKV.</p>
