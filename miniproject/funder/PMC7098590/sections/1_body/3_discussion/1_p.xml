<p>Our study suggests that symptomatic ZIKV infection (laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection plus one or more typical symptoms) but not asymptomatic ZIKV infection was associated with GBS compared to controls. When we combined laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection and the presence of typical symptoms of ZIKV, there appeared to be more symptomatic ZIKV case-patients in the GBS group than in the control group. Furthermore, this subgroup also showed some subtle differences in their clinical presentation. The only other study in which symptoms and laboratory evidence consistent with a ZIKV illness were combined in order to assess an association of increased ZIKV with increased cases of GBS was one conducted in Brazil after ZIKV was first introduced into that country. The previous study reported no significant association between recent 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection (a positive or equivocal IgM test result for ZIKV or DENV) and GBS. However, being a case-patient was significantly associated with evidence of recent 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection when combined with clinical criteria for suspected ZIKV disease (rash with at least two other ZIKV-like symptoms). At the time of assessment in that study, unlike the current study, all living GBS case-patients were at least five months out from neurologic symptom onset and the laboratory criteria were based on a recent 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection (a positive or equivocal IgM test result for ZIKV or dengue). [
