<p>Other observational studies have also suggested a close association between GBS and ZIKV. In one Dutch study of cases returning from Suriname with ZIKV infection, one out of 18 patients (5.5%) developed GBS [

 <xref rid="pone.0230132.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a rate considerably lower than those previously observed in Polynesia and the Americas. In one early study of a ZIKV-infection outbreak in Yap (Micronesia), it was estimated that 73% of the population over three years of age had been infected (in a population of around 10,000 people), and no cases of GBS were reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0230132.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lastly, in a recent study carried out in the Gulf Mexican state of Veracruz, Mexico, where 28 cases of GBS were described, only two (7.1%) had positive anti-ZIKV IgG and none had positive IgM or PCR in serum [
 <xref rid="pone.0230132.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. And, although there are numerous case control studies related to Zika virus infections and GBS, our study is unusual and particularly valuable because it highlights differences between symptomatic vs asymptomatic Zika virus infections as they relate to GBS, not just the relationship of Zika virus infection in general to GBS.
