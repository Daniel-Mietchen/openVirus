<p>The seminal French-Polynesian study found a strong association between ZIKV and GBS [
 <xref rid="pone.0230132.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], although similar to other assessments, the authors did not compare the strength of the GBS association with symptomatic ZIKV infection compared to asymptomatic ZIKV infection. Unlike the French Polynesia, Puerto Rico, and New Caledonia studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0230132.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], our study does not support an association between ZIKV and GBS in Northeastern Mexico when using laboratory evidence of infection alone. However, other studies from Latin American and Asia Pacific do not show a significant association between ZIKV and GBS [
