<p>Of the 16 GBS case-patients with an antecedent typical ZIKV symptom, six (38%) had a positive PCR test for ZIKV; none had a positive PCR test for DENV or CHIKV. For GBS case-patients, seven of 10 (70%) that had laboratory evidence for ZIKV infection by PCR or IgM also had typical ZIKV symptoms compared to two of 16 (13%) of those that tested negative for ZIKV (OR: 16.3, 95% CI: 2.2–121). In comparison, only four of 34 (12%) controls that had tested positive for ZIKV had typical ZIKV symptoms compared to five of 79 (6%) that tested negative for ZIKV (OR: 2.0, 95% CI 0.50–7.9). GBS case-patients with laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection were significantly more likely to have had typical ZIKV symptoms than controls with laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection (OR: 17.5, 95% CI: 3.2–96.6). This association remained statistically significant even in an analysis that included only case-patients with no febrile illnesses within 5 days prior to onset of GBS (OR 9.57 (95% CI: 1.07 to 85.35).</p>
