<p>We interviewed all available case-patients and controls to obtain information about demographics, risk factors (age, male sex), and exposures in the two months prior to interview, for controls or to onset of neurological symptoms for the GBS case-patients. Functional outcomes in patients with GBS were assessed based on residual motor deficits using the Hughes GBS Disability Scale. Following the interviews, serum and urine samples were collected from case-patients and controls, to determine exposure to ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV.</p>
