<p>To determine a possible association between GBS and a preceding ZIKV infection, we estimated that 49 case-patients and 147 controls would provide a power of 80% to detect a difference of 20% in ZIKV prevalence, with an alpha level of 5%. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize clinical and demographic data. We conducted analyses assessing potential associations between GBS and demographic characteristics, known GBS risk factors, antecedent illness in the two months prior to hospitalization, and molecular and serological evidence of ZIKV infections. To assess possible differences between GBS case-patients and the matched controls, we calculated matched odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals by conditional maximum likelihood estimation, aside from comparisons for which these calculations did not converge, for which we calculated unconditional maximum likelihood estimates with confidence intervals produced using normal approximation. For comparisons between ZIKV positive and ZIKV negative GBS case-patients, we calculated unconditional maximum likelihood estimates with confidence intervals produced using normal approximation. For comparisons with zero values in any cells (such that odds ratio calculations were not calculable) we assessed differences using Fisher exact p-values (p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant). We considered the presence of one or more of the following three antecedent symptoms–rash, joint pain and/or conjunctivitis–as having “typical” Zika symptoms.</p>
