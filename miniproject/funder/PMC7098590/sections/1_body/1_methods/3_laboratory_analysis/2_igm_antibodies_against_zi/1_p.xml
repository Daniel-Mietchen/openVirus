<p>IgM antibodies against ZIKV were determined by the use of the InBios ZIKV via an IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (InBios MAC-ELISA; InBios International, Inc., Seattle, WA). InBios ELISA was performed and results interpreted as described by the manufacturer. An immune status ratio (ISR) was determined by dividing the OD of the patient sample with the ZIKV recombinant. ISR values of 1.7 were considered presumptive positive for IgM antibodies to ZIKV.</p>
