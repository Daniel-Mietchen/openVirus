<p>Within the vast constellation of host–virus interactions described herein, how do we find the human proteins that block replication of a particular animal virus of concern? Here, we have one critical advantage: only proteins that bind viruses differentially between the old (animal) and new (human) hosts are relevant to zoonosis. A certain host transcription factor may be critically important to the replication of a virus, but if the virus can engage that transcription factor equally in its animal host and in humans, then it is not relevant to zoonosis. Indeed, the vast majority of mammalian proteins are highly conserved in sequence because they perform important functions that constrain their evolution. Viruses are expected to interact with animal and human versions of most host proteins equivalently. Thus, the vast majority of critical host–virus interactions will not be relevant to zoonosis.</p>
