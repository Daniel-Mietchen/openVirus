  <title>Declines in HAI titers against influenza A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2) and A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) virus after infection.</title>
  <p>In each panel the black regression lines indicate the rates of antibody waning from a fitted log-linear model, and the grey lines indicate the geometric mean titers at the center of each time point that sera were collected. There were 126 and 44 participants infected against A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2) and A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) respectively.</p>
