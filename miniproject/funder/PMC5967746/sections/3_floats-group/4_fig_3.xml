  <title>Correlation between HAI titers and protection against influenza A(H3N2) virus infection.</title>
  <p>The upper panel shows the number of uninfected and infected persons in each pre-epidemic titer range. The lower panel shows the estimated degree of protection associated with higher pre-epidemic titers, calculated as the relative risk reduction compared with the risk at a pre-epidemic HAI titer &lt;10.</p>
