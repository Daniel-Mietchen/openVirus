  <title>Comparison between susceptibility and age-standardized cumulative incidence of infection in four influenza A(H3N2) epidemics.</title>
  <p>The susceptibility index was calculated as 1 minus relative risk reduction compared with the risk at per-epidemic HAI titer &lt;10. The cumulative incidence of infection was standardized by age to the Hong Kong population in 2010. Each text 1 to 4 corresponds to epidemics 1 to 4 respectively.</p>
