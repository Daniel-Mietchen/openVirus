<p>We noted that the level of population immunity varied before each of the four epidemics, and we created a single statistic to represent population immunity by combining information on titer distributions and the protection associated with those titers. Using this summary statistic of immunity, we found that the largest A(H3N2) epidemic occurred with the lowest level of pre-epidemic immunity (

In further work, it would be of interest to examine alternative measures of population immunity and determine which could provide a best representation of the vulnerability of a population to a larger epidemic. For example, the level of immunity in children might be a particularly important aspect of the risk to the population as a whole for severe epidemics.
