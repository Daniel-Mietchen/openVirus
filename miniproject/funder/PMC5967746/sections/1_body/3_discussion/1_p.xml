<p>We conducted a longitudinal serologic study over five years, allowing us to estimate the cumulative incidence of influenza A(H3N2) virus infections in four consecutive epidemics in Hong Kong. We found that 7% - 19% of the population were infected in each of these epidemics, based on the standard definition of a four-fold rise or greater in homologous titers, and the incidence of infection was generally higher in children (
