<p>While we excluded vaccinated persons when estimating the cumulative incidence of infection, influenza vaccination coverage has been very low in Hong Kong, around 5%-10% overall, with coverage of around 40% in elderly individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and low in most other groups including children. If we had accounted for coverage of 40% in elderly individuals with effectiveness of around 40% against H3N2 infection in these years [
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], our estimates of the cumulative incidence of natural infection in that age group would have been 16% lower. Vaccination coverage of 5%-10% in the population as a whole, with effectiveness of 50% on average, would have had very little impact on our estimates of the overall cumulative incidence of infections.
