<p>Our estimates of the rate of antibody waning in HAI titers since infection in infected persons were similar to those in another study [
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], where the mean time to 2-fold decline in HAI titer was 92–175 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197504.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In addition, antibody declined more quickly in participants infected with A/Victoria/361/2011-like (in epidemics 3 and 4) viruses compared with participants infected with A/Perth/16/2009-like viruses (in epidemics 1 and 2). We identified a correlation of pre-epidemic HAI titers with protection against infection. The classic study by Hobson [
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and other studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], have identified a correlation of titers of 40 with 50% protection against infection, which is somewhat less than the 62% (95% CI: 55%, 68%) protection that we estimated was conferred by a pre-epidemic titer of 40 in our study. However, in contrast to most recent studies, our outcome was serologic evidence of influenza virus infection, not laboratory-confirmed influenza virus detection.
