<p>In conclusion, we estimated that 7% - 19% of the Hong Kong population were infected in each of the four H3N2 epidemics from 2010 to 2014, and re-infections in these epidemics were rare. With the single measure of pre-epidemic immunity which we created, we found that the largest H3N2 epidemic occurred with the lowest level of pre-epidemic immunity.</p>
