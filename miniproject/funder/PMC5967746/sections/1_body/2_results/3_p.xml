<p>Estimates of the cumulative incidence of A(H3N2) infections in each epidemic are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197504.t002">Table 2</xref>. Overall, 7%-19% of the population were infected in each epidemic. However, epidemic 2 (Mar-Jun 2012) was substantially larger than the other epidemics with an estimated overall attack rate of 19% (95% CI: 14%, 24%). The cumulative incidence of infection was generally the highest among children, but similar across different age groups in epidemics 2 and 3. Re-infections were rare, with evidence in a small number of participants followed in particular pairs of epidemics. Of the 707 unvaccinated participants who provided samples covering epidemics 1 and 2, we identified 0 (0%) with evidence of infection in both of those epidemics i.e. re-infection. Similarly, we identified 1/706 (0.1%) for epidemics 1 and 3, 0/689 (0%) for epidemics 1 and 4, 2/639 (0.3%) for epidemics 2 and 3, 2/677 (0.3%) for epidemics 2 and 4, and 0/576 (0%) for epidemics 3 and 4.
