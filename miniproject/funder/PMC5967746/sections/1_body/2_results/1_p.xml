<p>The timeline of our study is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197504.g001">Fig 1</xref>, including the periods of the 7 rounds of sera collection, along with local surveillance data on influenza epidemics. During the study period, there were four major H3N2 epidemics and each was neatly bracketed by rounds of sera collection: (1) August-October 2010 (bracketed by Rounds 2 and 3); (2) March-June 2012 (bracketed by Rounds 4 and 5); (3) July-October 2013 (bracketed by Rounds 5 and 6); and (4) June-July 2014 (bracketed by Rounds 6 and 7). The four epidemics are indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197504.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The first two epidemics were dominated by A/Perth/16/2009-like viruses [
