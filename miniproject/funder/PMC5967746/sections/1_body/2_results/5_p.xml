<p>We estimated a susceptibility index for each epidemic based on the distribution of pre-epidemic titers and the protection curve shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197504.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Compared with epidemics 1, 3 and 4, individuals were more susceptible to infection in epidemic 2 (susceptibility index = 0.88), and that epidemic had the highest overall cumulative incidence of infection of 19% (
