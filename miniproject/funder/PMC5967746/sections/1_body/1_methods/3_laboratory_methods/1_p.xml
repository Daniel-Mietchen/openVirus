<p>We used the HAI assay to quantify the antibody titers against prevalent influenza A(H3N2) strains in the serum samples. Antibody titers were determined by testing serial 2-fold dilutions from 1:10 to 1:10240 in duplicate. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that prevents complete hemagglutination in both duplicate wells was regarded as the antibody titer. We tested sera from Rounds 2–5 against the A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) virus, and those from Rounds 5–7 against the A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) virus. We tested paired specimens from the same participants from consecutive rounds in parallel to ensure valid inferences of infections via rises in consecutive HAI titers.</p>
