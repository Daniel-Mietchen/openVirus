<p>The primary outcome was serologic evidence of influenza A(H3N2) virus infection, which is defined as a four-fold or greater rise in HAI titers between consecutive paired sera. We identified major H3N2 epidemics from 2010 to 2015 using the weekly proportion of outpatient consultations with influenza-like illness multiplied by the weekly type/subtype-specific laboratory detection rates in the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection [

 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], defining the major H3N2 epidemics as those in which the proportion of samples positive for A(H3N2) exceeded 5% of all specimens submitted for at least 6 consecutive weeks. We estimated the cumulative incidence for each epidemic in four age groups (2-19y, 20-44y, 45-64y and â‰¥65y). Confidence intervals (CI) for the age-specific estimates were estimated by the exact binomial method; whereas those for the overall age group were estimated via the normal approximation and then age-standardized to the Hong Kong population in 2010. We excluded all participants with self-reported and unreported vaccination status in all analyses.
