<p>We estimated the rate of waning in HAI titers (in the absence of vaccination) against each virus strain by fitting log-linear regression models to HAI titers since infection in infected persons, in whom we had previously identified a ≥4 fold rise in HAI titers between paired sera and the titer value of the latter specimens being ≥20. We explored the waning rate since the time of infection, assuming that infections occurred in the peak of each community epidemic to determine the time since infection of the subsequent blood draws. We used logistic regression models to estimate the correlation of pre-epidemic HAI titers with protection against infection, where the reduction in the odds of infection risk at each HAI titer was estimated relative to an HAI titer &lt;10. Having established the protection against serologic evidence of influenza virus infection, we used these risks to estimate the susceptibility index for each age group of participant (1 minus mean of reduction in the infection odds) at each HAI titer. The index for each epidemic was calculated as the average of the index values of all participants sampled before the corresponding epidemic, standardized to the population age structure, and ranged from 0 (i.e. population fully protected) to 1 (i.e. population fully susceptible to influenza virus infection). All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>
