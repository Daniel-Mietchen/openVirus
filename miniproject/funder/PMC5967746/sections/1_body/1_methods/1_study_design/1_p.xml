<p>We designed a community-based open cohort study, with regular rounds of blood draws from cohort members, and regular replacement of participants that dropped out to maintain the sample size. The recruitment was on a household basis. At the start of the study in 2009, we used random digit dialing to approach people to participate in this study. People would be eligible to participate if they were at least 2 years of age and normally slept in the approached household for at least 5 nights per week. People who agreed to participate were invited to the study clinic where we collected baseline information on socio-demographics, any underlying medical conditions, and vaccination history, along with a 5ml clotted blood sample. The first round of blood draws was collected between July and September 2009 [

We continued the study, with blood collected approximately one year apart, for 5 additional years around the start of each calendar year from 2011 to 2015. Therefore, our study comprised a total of seven rounds of blood draws (Rounds 1â€“7). In each round, in addition to blood samples, we administered the baseline questionnaire to new participants, and a brief questionnaire to continuing participants. Participants were compensated with HK$100 (around US$13) in the form of cash voucher and, since Round 3, HK$20 (around US$2.5) cash.
