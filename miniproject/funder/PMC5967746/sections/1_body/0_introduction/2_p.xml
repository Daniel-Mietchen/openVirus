<p>In 2009 we began a population-based sero-epidemiologic study of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 [
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In that study we enrolled people from the general community using a systematic approach, and collected sera before and after the first wave of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections. We subsequently extended this study through to 2015, collecting sera approximately once per year, and replacing participants that dropped out to maintain a sample size of between 800 and 1200 persons in each round of blood draws. In each study round, participants from previous rounds were invited to continue participating in the study. Participants that dropped out were replaced by new participants recruited via the same recruitment approach, i.e. random digit dialing. We used the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to measure antibody titers against circulating viruses. We have reported data from the first 4 rounds of blood draws, that covered two epidemics of A(H1N1)pdm09 and one epidemic of A(H3N2) [
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Here we report data on influenza A(H3N2) virus infections in 4 consecutive epidemics in 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The objective of this study is to describe the overall and age-specific incidence of H3N2 infections in Hong Kong, and to examine patterns in individual and population immunity as represented by HAI titers.
