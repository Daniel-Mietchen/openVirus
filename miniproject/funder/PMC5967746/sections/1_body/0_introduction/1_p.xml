<p>Influenza virus infections account for a significant annual disease burden [

 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On average, influenza A(H3N2) epidemics tend to have the greatest impact on morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], particularly in elderly individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have also evolved more rapidly in more recent years, and between January 2000 and January 2015 there were 9 changes in the recommended A(H3N2) component of influenza vaccines compared to 4 changes in the A(H1N1) component including the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Many serologic studies were done during and after the 2009 influenza pandemic, to estimate the cumulative incidence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections in the first [

 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In comparison, there are relatively few population-based estimates of influenza A(H3N2) virus infections [

 <xref rid="pone.0197504.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nor are there studies describing the role of population immunity in shaping consecutive epidemics of influenza A(H3N2).
