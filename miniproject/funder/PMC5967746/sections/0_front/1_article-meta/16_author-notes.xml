   <bold>Competing Interests: </bold>I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: BJC has received research funding from Sanofi Pasteur for a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness. BJC is a Section Editor of PLoS ONE. This does not alter the authorsâ€™ adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. The authors report no other potential conflicts of interest.
