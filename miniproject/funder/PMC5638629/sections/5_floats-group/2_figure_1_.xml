  <title>Zika virus epidemics in Feira de Santana and Brazil (2015–2016).</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Comparison of weekly notified Zika cases (full red line) with monthly Microcephaly cases (blue bars) in Feira de Santana (FSA), overimposed with total Zika cases at the level of the country (BR, black dotted line). BR data for weeks 50–52 was missing. Green area highlights the time period for the Micareta festival and the dotted grey line the date of first notification. Incidence series is available as Dataset 3 and Microcephaly series as Dataset 4. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Age distribution and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for the 2015 (blue) and 2016 (green) FSA epidemics (data available as Dataset 2). The top panel shows the number of cases per age (full lines) and the proportion of total cases per age class (dashed lines), which peak at the age range 20–50. The bottom panel shows the age-stratified incidence risk ratio (IRR, plus 95% CI ), with the red dotted line indicating
