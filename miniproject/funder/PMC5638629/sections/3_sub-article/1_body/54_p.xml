<p>There should be a bit more context of other work on ZIKV and climate; it's not accurate to say "the effects of local climate variables, such as temperature and rainfall, have not yet been explored in relation to Zika transmission." That's true in some ways, but not that generalizable. A number of studies are already cited, e.g. Bogoch et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Perkins et al., 2016; Messina et al., 2016. This manuscript should point out what is unique here.</p>
