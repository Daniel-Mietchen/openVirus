<p>1) The relationship between the Zika epidemic in FSA vs. the rest of Brazil is still not very clear, although it is improved from before. For example, in the last paragraph of the Introduction it states that Zika peaked elsewhere in the country in 2016. That may be true for some locations, but data suggest otherwise for many of the most affected states. As the authors now note, Zika case surveillance changed substantially in 2016. Clearly higher case numbers are associated with this, but microcephaly numbers were much higher for many states as a result of the 2015 epidemics, so in fact many of the NE states in particular likely had much bigger epidemics in 2015, and FSA may be a very good representation of what happened in those states, not an anomaly as implied in the manuscript. The authors even found evidence of a 4-fold increase in reported FSA between 2015 and 2016. In my view, this is a very important finding and emphasizes how little we know about 2015, even in area with relatively strong surveillance.</p>
