<p>This manuscript fits a model with entomological, epidemiological and climactic variables to data on Zika cases during the 2015/16 outbreaks in one city in Brazil. The model suggests that most susceptibles were infected during the 2015 wave which led to lower incidence in the 2016 wave, and would prevent further epidemics till some years in the future.</p>
