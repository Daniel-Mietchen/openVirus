<p>- The bimodal posterior distribution for infectious and incubation period in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C-D</xref> suggest there could be an issue with the model fitting. Two possibilities come to mind: either a lack of parameter identifiability in the model itself, or poor mixing of the MCMC chains. I would suggest testing for each of these. What do the pairwise correlations between the posteriors look like? What is the effective sample size of the MCMC outputs for each parameter? According to 
 <xref rid="table4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, there are 8 parameters estimated â€“ what do the posteriors look like for the other 4?
