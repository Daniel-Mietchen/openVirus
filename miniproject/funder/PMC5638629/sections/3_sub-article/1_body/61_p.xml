<p>While we agree that it is not very helpful to speculate about exactly when the Zika epidemic peaked in different parts of Brazil, we think the overall message is still misleading â€“ it currently appears to suggest that the epidemic in FSA was earlier than the rest of the country when the quality of surveillance in 2015 is probably not good enough to make such conclusions. A more appropriate message could be that detailed analysis of FSA indicated a large epidemic in 2015, which could possibly have occurred in other places although this was not picked up by the limited surveillance at that time.</p>
