<p>- The context of the results is seriously misleading about the epidemiology of ZIKV in the rest of Brazil, specifically comparing 2015 to 2016. The state of Bahia is unique in that substantial surveillance was done in 2015. Zika did not become nationally reportable until January 2016, when reported case numbers increased substantially. From both microcephaly reports and anecdotal information, however, it is clear that massive outbreaks occurred in other states in 2015 (e.g. Pernambuco). This is not a problem with the model per se, but it is a big limitation to the conclusion that FSA was different from the rest of Brazil, (e.g. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Results, second paragraph and fourth paragraphs; Discussion, second paragraph). These sections should be rewritten to specifically address the uncertainty in national reporting (almost complete), remove national versus FSA comparison of the epidemiology, and highlight how this model and other models could tell us something about what likely happened in other places. We see that as one of the strengths of this approach and it is not explored at all.
