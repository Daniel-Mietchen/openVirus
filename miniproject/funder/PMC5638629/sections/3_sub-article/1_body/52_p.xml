<p>The finding about infants is notable, but also susceptible to a clear bias. It should be clearly noted that there may be an increased probability of reporting infants for whom care is often prioritized, both by families who would seek it and institutions who would provide it. This likely increased even more after recognition of the association with microcephaly. Furthermore, this dataset may offer a unique opportunity to assess changes in reporting as that became clear. This would be true for both infants and women of reproductive age.</p>
