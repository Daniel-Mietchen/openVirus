<p>- I found 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> hard to interpret. It seems the authors have selected a colour gradient so the line appears to go through the central microcephaly data point of 27, which makes it difficult to identify which regions produce high and low case numbers. It is also not clear to me what 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> adds, other than normalising the results by the population size â€“ in which case, should the numbers not be 6.2 times smaller (as the population is 620,000)?
