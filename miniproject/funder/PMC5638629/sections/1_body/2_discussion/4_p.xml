<p>The implicit consideration of climate variables as drivers of vector biology allowed us to ascertain the relative roles of temperature, humidity and rainfall for Zika’s basic and effective reproductive potentials (

 </inline-formula>, respectively). Similar to other studies in temperate and tropical settings, we found that temperature, with its direct influence on mosquito lifespan, aquatic development and extrinsic incubation period, was the key driver of seasonal oscillations in the transmission potential (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Feldstein et al., 2015</xref>). Rainfall, on the other hand, only seemed to play a marginal role and we argue that it may be a relevant player for arboviral transmission mainly in tropical regions subject to intense rain seasons, such as areas in South East Asia (

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hii et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Xuan et al., 2014</xref>). We also noted that the correlations between climatic variables and case counts were inverted when addressed against the transmission potential. For instance, while temperature was positively correlated with

   </msub>

 </inline-formula> it was negatively correlated with Zika cases. This implies that the transmission potential is readily responsive to climatic variation but that the Zika epidemics in FSA showed a slight but expected delay in relation to the peak in transmission potential, with case numbers generally increasing after a stable period of maximum

   <msub>
    <mi>R</mi>
    <mn>0</mn>
   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>. An interesting observation is that the 2015 epidemic peaked approximately 3 months after the estimated peak in the virus’s transmission potential, whereas there was much higher synchrony during the second wave in 2016. The same behaviour has been described for the CHIKV outbreak in FSA in 2014–2015 and which has been linked to highly discordant spatial distributions between the first two epidemics (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al., 2016b</xref>). It is likely that similar spatial effects (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2017</xref>) were present in FSA’s ZIKV outbreaks. Unfortunately we did not have access to sufficiently detailed spatial data to explore this hypothesis further.
