<p>The pattern of reported ZIKV infections in FSA was characterized by a large epidemic in 2015, in clear contrast to total reports at the country-level, peaking during 2016. Most notably for FSA was the epidemic decay in 2016 and fadeout in 2017. In order to resolve whether this was due to a lower transmission potential of ZIKV in 2016/2017 in FSA, we calculated the daily reproductive number (

   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>) between 2013 and 2017 but found no notable decrease in 2016. Interestingly, the maximum

 </inline-formula> in that period was observed in the season 2015/2016, coinciding with El Niño (

 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">van Panhuis et al., 2015</xref>). By fitting our model to weekly case data we also estimated the observation rate, i.e. the fraction of cases that were notified as Zika out of the estimated total number of infections. It has previously been reported that the vast majority of Zika infections go unnoticed (
 <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which is in agreement with our estimates of an observation rate below 1%. Based on this, around 65% of the local population were predicted to have been infected by ZIKV during the first wave in 2015, which is in the same range as the reported Zika outbreaks in French Polynesia (66%) (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2016</xref>) and Yap Island (73%) (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>). The accumulation of herd-immunity caused a substantial drop in the virus’s effective reproductive number (

  <math id="inf82">
   <msub>
    <mi>R</mi>
    <mi>e</mi>
   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>) and hence a significantly lower number of cases during the second wave in 2016 and subsequent demise in 2017. In the context of FSA, it is possible that the high similarity of case definition to DENV, the concurrent CHIKV epidemic, and the low awareness of ZIKV at that time could have resulted in a significant number of ZIKV infections being classified as either dengue or chikungunya. Furthermore, based on our analysis, we would argue that the percentage of correctly diagnosed ZIKV infections and infected individuals seeking medical attention must have been exceptionally low (both lower than 20%).
