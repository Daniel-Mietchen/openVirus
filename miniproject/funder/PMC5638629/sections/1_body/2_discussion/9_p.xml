<p>There are certain limitations to our approach, many of which could be revisited when more detailed data becomes available. For example, we assumed homogeneous mixing between human and mosquito hosts but it is possible that spatio-temporal heterogeneities may have played a role in FSA. Furthermore, we have curated and integrated functional responses of key entomological parameters to temperature, rainfall and humidity variation, which were originally reported for dengue viruses. Our fitting approach is also dependent on notified case data and it is possible that the reported cases are not representative of the initial expansion of the virus, which may have thwarted the obtained posterior of the introduction date. Finally, our future projections for the endemic and epidemic potential of ZIKV are based on average climatic trends of past years and do not capture the occurrence of natural variation between years, in particular for years affected by major Southern American climate events, such as the El Ni√±o (
