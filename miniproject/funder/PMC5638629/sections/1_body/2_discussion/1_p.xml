<p>Using an ento-epidemiological transmission model, driven by temporal climate data and fitted to notified case data, we analysed the 2015–2017 Zika outbreak in the city of Feira de Santana (FSA), in the Bahia state of Brazil and determined the conditions that led to the rapid spread of the virus as well as its future endemic and epidemic potential in this region. Given FSA’s high suitability for ZIKV mosquito-vectors and its particular geographical setting as a state commerce and transport hub, our results should have major implications for other urban centres in Brazil and elsewhere.</p>
