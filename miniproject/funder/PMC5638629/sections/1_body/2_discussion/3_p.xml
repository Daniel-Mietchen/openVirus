<p>The age structure of notified cases showed a higher than expected incidence risk ratio (IRR) for individuals under the age of 4 years and a lower than expected risk for individuals aged + 50 years. This contrasts the observation during the Zika outbreak on Yap Island in 2007, where all age classes, except the elderly, presented similar attack rates (

We note here, however, that the Yap Island analysis was based on both a retrospective analysis of historical hospital records and prospective surveillance (serology, surveys). It is therefore possible that the signatures amongst the youngest and oldest individuals in FSA may reflect deficiencies and/or biases in local notified data. Such signatures could emerge by both a rush of parents seeking medical services driven by a hyped media coverage or prioritization of child-care due to the emergence of microcephaly during the Zika epidemic and a small proportion of the elderly seeking or having access to medical attention. In fact, the increased risk in young children in 2016 may have been a result of increased awareness as well as the interventions by the WHO in the second year. We also found a small increase in IRR in the 20–34 years age group, particularly during 2016, which could be indicative of the small contribution of sexual transmission (
