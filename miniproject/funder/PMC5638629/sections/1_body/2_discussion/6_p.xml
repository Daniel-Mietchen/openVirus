<p>After calibrating our model to the 2015–2017 epidemic, we projected the transmission of ZIKV beyond 2017 using stochastic simulations and average climatic variables for this region. Without the possibility of externally acquired infections, local extinction was very likely by 2017 due to the high levels of herd-immunity. According to our study, Zika’s reproductive potential (

 </inline-formula>) reached its lowest point in 2017, and it is expected to remain low for the next couple of years, given the slow replenishment of susceptibles in the population through births. When explicitly modelling the importation of infectious cases our projections for the next two decades corroborated the conclusions of previous modelling studies that suggest a weak endemic potential for ZIKV after the initial exhaustion of the susceptible pool (

However, our simulations also showed that the future epidemic behaviour is strongly dependent on the frequency of re-introductions, where sporadic and unpredictable epidemics could still be in the order of hundreds of cases. Furthermore, given our estimated observation rate for the 2015–2017 epidemic, passive surveillance systems are unlikely to fully detect the scale and occurrence of such small epidemics, missing their actual public health impact, and as such efforts should thus be placed to improve ZIKV detection and diagnosis in order to optimize the local reporting rates and potential for control.
