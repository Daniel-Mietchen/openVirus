<p>In this study we have addressed the local determinants of ZIKV epidemiology in the context of a major urban centre of Brazil. Our results imply that control and surveillance of ZIKV should be boosted and focused in periods of high temperature and during major social events. These factors could identify windows of opportunity for local interventions to mitigate ZIKV introduction and transmission and should be transferable to other areas for which both temperature data and community event schedules are available. We further confirm that the high transmission potential of ZIKV in urban centres can lead to the exhaustion of the local susceptible pool, which will in turn dictate the long-term epidemic and endemic behaviour of the virus. Depending on the rate of re-introduction, sporadic outbreaks are to be expected, although these will be unlikely to result in a notable increase in the number of microcephaly cases due to their limited sizes and low risk per pregnancy. Nonetheless, these local sporadic occurrences could still have important public health consequences, and we argue that much better diagnostics and reporting rates are required for local authorities to detect and respond to such events in the near future. Our integrated mathematical framework is capable of deriving key insights into the past and future determinants of ZIKV epidemiology and its findings should be applicable to other major urban centres of Brazil and elsewhere.</p>
