<p>A phylogenetic analysis has proposed that the introduction of ZIKV into Bahia took place between March and September 2014, although without direct evidence for its circulation in FSA at that time (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Naccache et al., 2016</xref>). Our estimated date of introduction showed support for a date in early-mid December 2014, a few months after the proposed introduction into Bahia and just over 7 weeks before the first case of Zika was notified in FSA. Similar periods between the first notification and estimated introduction often represent the time taken to complete one or more full transmission cycles (human-mosquito-human) before a cluster of cases is generated of sufficient size for detection by passive surveillance systems (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Louren√ßo and Recker, 2014</xref>). The case data also shows a 2 months period after the first notification during which weekly case numbers remained extremely low. This long period was unexpected as persistent circulation of ZIKV could hardly be justified by the observed total of only 10 cases. Given our estimated observation rate, however, the number of ZIKV infections during this time could have amounted to over 2700 actual cases. In April, the number of cases increased rapidly, coinciding with the Micareta festival, which we argue may have played a role in igniting the exponential phase of the epidemic by facilitating human-vector mixing as well as a more rapid geographical expansion.
