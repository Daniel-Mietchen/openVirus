<p>Human sexual and vertical transmission of ZIKV is an important public health concern, especially within the context of potential Zika-associated microcephaly (MC) and other neurological complications in pre- and neonatals. With a total of over 10,000 live births in 2015 in FSA, our crude estimate for the risk of Zika-associated MC per pregnancy was below 4 cases per 100,000 individuals in a generalized population under an attack rate of 65%. As discussed elsewhere (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2016</xref>), this risk is extremely low when compared to other known viral-associated complications, such as those caused by infections by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the rubella virus (RV) (

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Naing et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore crucial to reiterate that what makes the ZIKV a public health concern is not necessarily the per pregnancy risk of neurological complications, but rather the combination of low risk with very high attack rates. Other studies have reported that the risk for complications during the

 </inline-formula> trimester was 1%, while the overall, full pregnancy risk was 0.42%, similar to our FSA estimates. For the Yap Island epidemic, no microcephaly cases have been reported. With an estimated 24 births per 1000 females (census 2000 as in (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>)) and using an overall risk of approximately 0.4% per pregnancy, only 0–3 cases per 100,000 individuals would have been expected. However, the island’s small population size (7391 individuals (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>)) together with a general baseline of 0–2 microcephaly cases per 100,000 in many areas of the world (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Butler, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">EUROCAT, 2003</xref>) would explain the absence of reported cases. It is also important to consider that a variety of birth defects have been found to be statistically associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy, of which MC is one possible outcome. While the risk for birth defects per pregnancy is consistently reported to be high, estimations for the risk of MC vary considerably. For example, recent clinical trials (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Honein et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brasil et al., 2016</xref>) suggested that the risk of Zika-associated MC could be an order of magnitude higher than the estimate reported in this or other previous studies (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>). At this stage it is not possible to explain these differences, but it is tempting to speculate that other factors must influence either the actual or estimated risk. For example, there could be diagnostic biases or differences between epidemiological and clinical studies. Alternatively, viral or host genetic background, as well as the pre-exposition to other arboviruses may influence the absolute risk experienced by local populations or cohorts.
