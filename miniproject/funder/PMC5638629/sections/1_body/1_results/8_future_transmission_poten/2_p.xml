<p>The amassed accumulation of herd-immunity during the first wave resulted in a marked difference between the estimated basic reproductive number,

 </inline-formula>) by the end of 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This in turn might explain the marked reduction in Zika cases in FSA in 2016, at a time when the virus was infecting large numbers of individuals elsewhere in the country (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). At the start of 2016,

   <msub>
    <mi>R</mi>

   <msub>
    <mi>R</mi>
    <mn>0</mn>
   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>, which increased to 5 by the beginning of 2017. Projecting into the future using average climate data for this region showed that the mean effective reproductive number is expected to remain low and close to 1 for the next few years, suggesting a very weak potential for ZIKV endemicity in the near future. In fact, the sporadic nature of Zika cases in 2017 strongly suggest that herd immunity in this region is at a sufficiently high level to prevent sustained transmission. Furthermore, during 2017, 
 <inline-formula>

   <msub>

    <mi>e</mi>
   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> was on average less than 1 (mean: 0.62, range: 0.25–1.06), and we would therefore argue that the small number of cases (1.4% of 2015–2017) were mostly a result of small transmission chains, either from resonant transmission from the previous year, or from introduction events from nearby locations. Crucially, this would also explain why our ODE model matched both the dynamics and the sizes of the first two epidemic waves in FSA between 2015 and 2016 but failed to capture the small number of cases during 2017 (
