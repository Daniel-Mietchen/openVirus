<p>Without external introductions of infectious individuals (human or vector) our results predicted an epidemic fade-out by 2017, in accordance with the lack of notified cases after March 2017 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore projected ZIKV’s epidemic potential over the next two decades (until 2040) using stochastic simulations (see Material and Methods) while assuming different rates of viral introduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Our results showed that the potential for ZIKV to cause another outbreak or to establish itself endemically in FSA is strongly dependent on the frequency of re-introductions, whereby higher rates of external introductions might in fact help to sustain high levels of herd immunity, whereas infrequent introductions are more likely to result in notable outbreaks. That is, semi-endemic behaviour was only observed in simulations with low introduction rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>), as these scenarios strike a fine balance between a low number of new cases affecting herd-immunity levels and population turnover. In contrast, high introduction rates quickly exhaust the remaining susceptible pool, resulting in very long periods without epidemic behaviours.
