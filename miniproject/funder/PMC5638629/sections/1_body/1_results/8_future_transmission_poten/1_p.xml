<p>As illustrated by the cumulative attack rate in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, and similar to estimates from other regions in the world (
 <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), nearly 65% of the population got infected by ZIKV by the end of 2015, which rose to over 75% (95% CI [76.9â€“84.3]) by the end of 2016. During the first wave most cases occurred off-season, here defined by our estimated daily reproductive number (
