<p>The spatial distribution of total notified cases for BR highlighted the expected clustering of ZIKV cases within the Bahia state by the end of 2015 as well as the wider geographical range by July 2016 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We speculate that the difference in geographical range could explain the higher number of cases observed during the 2016 epidemic at the country level. This, on the other hand, did not explain why the second epidemic in FSA was nearly 7 times smaller than the first and with only sporadic cases in 2017. To answer this question and to obtain robust parameter estimates of ZIKV epidemiological relevance we utilised a dynamic transmission model, which we fitted to notified case data and local climate variables of FSA within a Bayesian framework (see Materials and methods).
