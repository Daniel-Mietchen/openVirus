 </inline-formula> February 2015 the first Zika virus (ZIKV) case was reported in Feira de Santana (FSA). Weekly cases remained very low for the following two months, adding up to just 10 notified cases by the end of March that year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A rapid increase in the number of cases was observed in April, coinciding with Micareta, a local carnival-like festival that takes place across the urban centres of Bahia. The epidemic peaked in July 2015, which was followed by a sharp decline in notified cases over the next 1–2 months. This first epidemic wave was followed by a significantly smaller outbreak in 2016, peaking around March, and an even smaller outbreak in 2017 with no discernable epidemic peak.
