<p>The age distribution of notified ZIKV cases in FSA suggested a higher proportion of cases between 20 and 50 years of age, but with no discernible differences between the two epidemics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top panel). However, when corrected for the expected number of cases assuming an equal risk of infection per age class, we found the number of cases within this age group to be closer to most other groups (incidence rate ratio, IRR, close to 1, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom panel). The per capita case counts within the youngest age class (&lt;1 years) appeared higher than expected, with an IRR significantly above 1 and also higher in 2016 (IRR = 4.4, 95% CI [2.8, 7.0]) than in 2015 (IRR = 1.95, 95% CI [1.5, 2.6]), possibly indicating biased reporting and/or health care seeking with increased awareness of the disease. There was also a consistent trend towards reduced IRR in the elderly (&gt;65 years), although with significant uncertainties. Finally, a small increase in IRR could be detected in the 20–34 year olds, which could potentially be a signature of sexual transmission in this age group (
