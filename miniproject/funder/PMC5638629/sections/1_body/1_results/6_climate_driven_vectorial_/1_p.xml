<p>The reliance on 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes for transmission implies that the transmission potential of ZIKV is crucially dependent on temporal trends in the local climate. We therefore investigated daily rainfall, humidity and mean temperature data in FSA between 2013 and May 2017 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The data showed erratic fluctuations in rainfall with sporadic episodes of intense rain but without a clear seasonal trend. Temperature, on the other hand, presented a much clearer seasonal signature with fixed amplitudes between 22 and 27 degree Celsius, peaking between December and May. Humidity showed an intermediate scenario and appeared correlated with periods of intense rainfall but negatively correlated with temperature.
