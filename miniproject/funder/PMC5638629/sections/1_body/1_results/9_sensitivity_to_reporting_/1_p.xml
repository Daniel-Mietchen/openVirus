<p>In effect, our estimated observation rate entails the proportion of real infections that would have been notified if symptomatic and correctly diagnosed as Zika. Based on the previously reported Yap Island epidemic of 2007 (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>), the percentage of symptomatic infections can be assumed to be close to 18%. Unfortunately, measures of the proportion of individuals seeking medical attention and being correctly diagnosed do not exist for FSA, although it is well known that correct diagnosis for DENV is imperfect in Brazil (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis by varying both the proportions of infected symptomatic individuals seeking medical attention and the proportion of those being correctly diagnosed for Zika. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that if any of these proportions is less than 10%, or both between 15â€“20%, our observation rate of 3.9 per 1000 infections can easily be explained.
