<p>Finally we investigated the sensitivity of our results with regards to the expected number of newborns presenting microcephaly (MC). Following the observation that virtually all reported MC cases were issued before the summer of 2016 and with a lag of 5–6 months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we assumed that the vast majority of Zika-associated MC cases would have been a consequence of the first epidemic wave in 2015. We used the estimated attack rate of approximately 65% from 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and varied the local birth rate and the theoretical risk of MC to obtain an expected number of cases. In agreement with other reports (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cauchemez et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Jaenisch et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>), our model predicted a relatively low risk for MC given ZIKV infection during pregnancy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In particular, using a conservative total of 21 confirmed MC cases in FSA, i.e. rejecting suspected or other complications, we estimate an average risk of approximately 0.35% of pregnancies experiencing ZIKV infection. Including the 3 foetal deaths where ZIKV infections were confirmed during pregnancy, i.e. using a total of 24 cases, only increased the risk to 0.39%. More generally, based on the results from our fitting approach and using the average birth rates of FSA as guideline, we estimate that on average 3–4 MC cases are expected per 100 k individuals at 65% exposure to the virus.
