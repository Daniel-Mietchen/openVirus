<p>Of particular interest here was the very low observation rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), with a median of just under 0.004 (median = 0.0039, 95% CI [0.0038–0.0041]), which equates to less than 4 in 1000 infections having been notified during the epidemic in FSA. Although lower than other previously reported estimates, this would explain the relatively long period of low viral circulation before the epidemic took off in April 2015. That is, based on our estimates, there were around 2,700 Zika infections during the first 2 months, of which only 10 were notified. More importantly, when applying this rate to the total number of cases we found that by the end of the first epidemic wave around 65% (95% CI [57.0–72.9]) of the population in FSA had been infected by the virus. This high attack rate is not unusual for Zika, however, and is in general agreement with observations elsewhere (
