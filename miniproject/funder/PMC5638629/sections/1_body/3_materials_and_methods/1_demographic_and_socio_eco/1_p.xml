<p>Feira de Santana (FSA) is a major urban centre of Bahia, located within the state’s largest traffic junction, serving as way points to the South, the Southeast and central regions of the country. The city has a population of approximately 620.000 individuals (2015) and serves a greater geographical setting composed of 80 municipalities (
 <italic>municipios</italic>) summing up to a population of 2.5 million. Although major improvements in water supply have been accomplished in recent decades, with about 90% of the population having direct access to piped water, supply is unstable and is common practice to resort to household storage. Together with an ideal (tropical) local climate, these are favourable breeding conditions for species of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus of mosquitoes, which are the main transmission vectors of ZIKV, CHIKV and the dengue virus (DENV) that are all co-circulating in the region (
