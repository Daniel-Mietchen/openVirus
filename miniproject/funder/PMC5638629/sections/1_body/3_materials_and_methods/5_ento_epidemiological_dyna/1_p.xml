<p>The ordinary differential equations (ODE) model and the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting approach herein used are based on the framework previously proposed to study the introduction of dengue into the Island of Madeira in 2012 (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Louren√ßo and Recker, 2014</xref>). We have changed this framework to relax major modelling assumptions on the mosquito sex ratio and success of egg hatching, have included humidity and rainfall as critical climate variables, and have also transformed the original least squares based MCMC into a Bayesian MCMC. The resulting framework is described in the following sections, in which extra figures are added for completeness.
