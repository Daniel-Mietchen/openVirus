 </inline-formula> February 2015 the first ZIKV cases were reported in FSA, followed by a large epidemic that continued into 2016. The rise in ZIKV incidence in FSA coincided temporally with an increase in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al., 2016a</xref>), with an unprecedented total of 21 confirmed cases of microcephaly in FSA between January 2015 and May 2017. There is wide statistical support for a causal link between ZIKV and severe manifestations such as microcephaly (
