<p>The model is based on ordinary differential equations (ODE) describing the dynamics of viral infections within the human and mosquito populations (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations 1-5 and 6-10</xref>, respectively). The human population is assumed to be fully susceptible before the introduction of ZIKV and is kept constant in size throughout the period of observation. After an infectious mosquito bite, individuals first enter an incubation phase, after which they become infectious to a mosquito for a limited period of time. Fully recovered individuals are assumed to retain life-long immunity. We assumed that sexual transmission did not significantly contribute to transmission dynamics and therefore ignored its effects (
