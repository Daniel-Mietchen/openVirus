<p>Four parameters (baseline mosquito biting rate, mosquito sex ratio, probability of transmission from human-to-vector and human lifespan) were fixed to their expected mean values, taken from the literature (see 
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). To estimate the remaining parameters, alongside parameter distributions regarding the date of first infection, the human infectious and incubating periods, and the observation rate of notified ZIKV cases, we fitted the ODE model to weekly notified cases of ZIKV in FSA using a Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The results are presented both in terms of mean dynamic behaviour of the ODE under the MCMC solutions and posterior distributions of key epidemiological parameters. A full description of the fitting approach and the estimated parameters can be found in the section Materials and methods.
