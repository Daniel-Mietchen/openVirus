<p>For the dynamics of the vector populations we divided mosquitoes into two life-stages: aquatic and adult females. Adult mosquitoes were further divided into the epidemiologically relevant stages for arboviral transmission: susceptible, incubating and infectious. In contrast to human hosts, mosquitoes remain infectious for life. The ODE model comprised 8 climate-dependent entomological parameters (aquatic to adult transition rate, aquatic mortality rate, adult mortality rate, oviposition rate, incubation period, transmission probability to human, hatching success rate and biting rate), whose dependencies on temperature, rainfall and humidity were derived from other studies (see
