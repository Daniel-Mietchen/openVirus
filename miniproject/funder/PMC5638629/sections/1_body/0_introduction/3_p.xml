<p>In this study, focusing on an urban centre of Brazil (Feira de Santana), we explicitly model the mosquito-vector lifecycle under seasonal, weather-driven variations. Using notified case data of both the number of suspected Zika infections and confirmed microcephaly cases, we demonstrate how the combination of high suitability for viral transmission and a low detection rate resulted in an extremely high attack rate during the first epidemic wave in 2015. The rapid accumulation of herd-immunity significantly reduced the number of cases during the following year, when total ZIKV-associated disease was peaking at the level of the country. Projecting forward we find that the demographic loss of herd-immunity together with the frequency of reintroduction will dictate the risk of reemergence and endemic establishment of Zika in Feira de Santana. The conclusions of this study should be transferable to major urban centres of Brazil and elsewhere with similar climatic and demographic settings.</p>
