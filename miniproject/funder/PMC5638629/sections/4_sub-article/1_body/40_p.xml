<p>If Zika was to become an endemic disease then the average age of infection would mostly be determined by its reproductive number, as with most other endemic diseases. One could even speculate that the number of MC cases would be relatively low, if the average age of infection was significantly below child bearing age, but that would depend on a much better knowledge about host immunity to Zika as well as the risk of MC in pre-exposed mothers (see discussion above). Given our current knowledge we would feel uncomfortable to make a strong statement about the future occurrence of MC. For these reasons we decided not to enter further into this discussion in our manuscript apart from mentioning that what makes the ZIKV a public health concern is not the per pregnancy risk of neurological complications, but rather the combination of low risk with very high attack rates. High numbers of MC cases should therefore mainly be a phenomenon of major epidemics observed in fully susceptible populations but unlikely in the context of endemic circulation.</p>
