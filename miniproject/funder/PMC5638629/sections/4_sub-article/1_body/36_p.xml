<p>We would like to note that our submission preceded the publication of these clinical trials, and thank the reviewer for their reference. In our study we estimate the risk of MC per pregnancy and find it to be consistent with observations in Yap Island and the French Polynesia. The clinical studies mentioned above do not focus on MC alone, but report instead a wide variety of birth defects and associated risks. The general impression from clinical studies is that the risk for birth defects upon Zika infection is indeed high. For instance, Honein et al. report that “Birth defects were reported in 9 of 85 (11%; 95% CI, 6%-19%) completed pregnancies with maternal symptoms or exposure”, while Brasil et al. found that “Among 117 live infants born to 116 ZIKV-positive women, 42% were found to have grossly abnormal clinical or brain imaging findings or both”. Notably, the particular risk of MC in both studies is much lower than the risk for general birth defects (4/117 for Brasil et al., and 18/442 for Honein et al.) but is still ~10 times larger than the risk reported in our manuscript and for the French Polynesia.</p>
