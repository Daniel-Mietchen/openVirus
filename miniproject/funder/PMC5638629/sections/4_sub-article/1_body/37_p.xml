<p>At this stage it is difficult, if not impossible, to resolve these differences, but it is tempting to speculate that other (known) factors must influence either the actual or the estimated risk. For example, there may be significant differences in the estimation of Zika attack rates in pregnant women versus the general population due to cross-reactivity of serological assays. There may also be diagnostic biases or differences between epidemiological and clinical studies. Viral or host genetic background, as well as the pre-exposition to other arboviruses, may also influence the absolute risk experienced by local populations, although it is hard to see how this could explain a ten-fold difference in risk. In the absence of a definite explanation we had to resolve to simply discuss this issue in the Discussion of our manuscript, but we would be interested to hear from the reviewer(s) if they had another, plausible explanation.</p>
