<p>The spatial data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is at the level of the 
 <italic>municipio</italic>, equivalent to councils in the United Kingdom. The areas covered by municipios are large and extend far beyond the area of a city such Feira de Santana. Hence, while we agree that the data would be suitable for a 
 <italic>macro-spatial</italic> analysis, it cannot be used to explore spatial heterogeneities at the level of an urban centre. Furthermore, the geographic data is aggregated by month, whereas in this study we are exploring the ecological and epidemiological determinant of Zika transmission at a much finer temporal scale.
