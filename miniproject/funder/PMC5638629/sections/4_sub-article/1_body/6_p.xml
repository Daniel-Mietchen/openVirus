<p>We apologize for not providing any description about the stochastic implementation, which we have now added to our revised manuscript. In summary, we used multinomial distributions to sample the effective number of individuals transitioning between classes per time step, as implemented in our previous work and elsewhere. A detailed description of this approach can now be found in the Materials and methods section.</p>
