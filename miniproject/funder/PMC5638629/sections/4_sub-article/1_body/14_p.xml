<p>The decision of using a Poisson likelihood was based on previous experience, computational cost and the fact that we fit a small number of cases per time step in a large population size, in which case the Poisson distribution is a reasonable approximation for the Binomial. Poisson-based likelihoods have also been used successfully in other modelling approaches, and we have now referenced and justified our decision accordingly in the main text.</p>
