<p>The original 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> was intended to illustrate the sensitivity between the total of MC cases reported and the model estimations, in which the colours were chosen to have the mean at the total of 27 cases (orange line) and variation around this value fading away. The plot would show that under a very strict MC case definition (21, red diamond) or including all suspected counts (36, blue square) the risk of MC per pregnancy is similarly low. This implies that the public health impact of Zika is not necessarily due to high risk for complications 
 <italic>per se</italic> but rather the potentially explosive nature of Zika epidemics than can affect a significant number of pregnancies. The idea behind 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> was just to complement 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, showing normalised (per 100,000) MC case numbers. In this context, we confirm that the expected number was indeed 6.2 times smaller.
