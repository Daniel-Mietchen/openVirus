 <p>- I would have liked to see more discussed of estimates for the Î± and rho parameters, which control the extent to which environmental factors influence entomological dynamics. What contribution did humidity and temperature have? What are the implications for analysis in other settings, e.g. with stronger or weaker seasonal effects?</p>
