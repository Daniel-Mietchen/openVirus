<p>Our estimated cumulative attack rate of over 65% by the end of 2016 would suggest that major outbreaks are unlikely in the near future (the x-axes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> have been updated). As our updated dataset shows, there have been a number of Zika cases in 2017, possibly through external introductions or through low-level background transmission events. The nature of these mini-outbreaks will have a big influence on herd-immunity levels in the population, which in turn will dictate, to a certain degree, when a new epidemic would become likely (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B, C</xref>). However, the potential timing of a new outbreak is too speculative and depends on too many factors for any model to make accurate predictions.
