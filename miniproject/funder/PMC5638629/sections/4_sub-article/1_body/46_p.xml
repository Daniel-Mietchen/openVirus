<p>We apologize for not being clear on which data was used. The MCMC fits the ODE model output to the aggregated case counts and no age-related or spatial information is used. In fact, age-related information is not available in time and only as aggregated counts over an entire year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We have now made this clear in the Materials and methods section and explicitly mention that we fit case counts only, with no consideration of age or spatial information. We have further clarified that

  <sub>i</sub>
