<p>With regards to the introduction of infected hosts, this is also modelled stochastically with a fixed migration rate (of infected individuals) per year, which is varied between the sensitivity scenarios presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. In effect, different simulations with the same migration rate will experience introduction events at different time points. The mean and variation presented in the stochastic model output (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) represent the outcome of thousands of simulations and therefore include all possible scenarios in which introductions may have occurred, covering periods of both high and low
