<p>The simplifications in equation 20 and 24 had been done purely for computational reasons but we appreciate that this could raise doubts about the sensitivity of our results on these approximations. To avoid such problems we have revised the equations, now using their original formulations, and have updated the Materials and methods section accordingly. We would like to note, however, that this did not have an effect on our results.</p>
