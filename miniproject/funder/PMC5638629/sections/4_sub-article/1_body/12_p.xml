<p>Following the comments from the reviewers, we have revised 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We now include a uniform colour scale in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> to help “identify which regions produce high and low case numbers”, and with the updated MC data set, which has been further curated to include solely confirmed and rejected MC reports, we have also updated the estimated risk per pregnancy based on confirmed cases only. With regards to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, we would still argue that it complements 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, but we would be happy to leave it out of the manuscript if the reviewers / Editors feel it is superfluous.
