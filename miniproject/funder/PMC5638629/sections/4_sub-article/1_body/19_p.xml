<p>We found that the inclusion of a second observation rate did not change the model fit and results for 2015 and only slightly for 2016. In particular, the posterior of the observation rate in 2015 had virtually the same distribution (mean zeta = 0.0039, mean zeta’ = 0.0034). This resulted in very similar attack rates for 2015 between the two model variants. Consequently, our general conclusions for the epidemic behaviour in 2016-2017 were the same, whereby high levels of herd-immunity generated by the epidemic outbreak in 2015 significantly reduced Zika’s effective reproductive number and hence incidence. In contrast, the posterior mean of the second observation rate (zeta’) showed a 4-fold increase, suggesting that the implementation of the new surveillance system helped to detect / correctly diagnose a higher number of Zika cases.</p>
