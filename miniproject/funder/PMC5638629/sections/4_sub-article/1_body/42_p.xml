<p>We are happy to provide the data and MCMC samples we analysed in this work as supplementary data files (done in the revised version), and we hope that our new Materials and methods section will be sufficient to allow the interested reader to reproduce the figures under the assumption they have the required computing skills. However, we would question the necessity, or even usefulness, to upload our entire computer code plus script files that contain thousands of lines of code and make use of various programming languages, and therefore like to ask the editor for clarification / guidance.</p>
