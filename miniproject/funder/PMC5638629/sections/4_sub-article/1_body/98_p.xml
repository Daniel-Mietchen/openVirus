<p>We are unsure if this comment refers to a particular sentence or the general use of the term ‘herd-immunity’. We note that ‘herd-immunity’ is synonymous to 'population-level immunity' (and not a particular level of population-level immunity that offers protection). We have therefore applied no changes in regards to the term herd-immunity, but are happy to address this further if the editors/reviewers feel strongly about it.</p>
