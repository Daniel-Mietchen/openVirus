<p>We agree that the text relating to microcephaly (MC) and Zika infections may have been misleading and potentially incomplete, due to not having had access to the time scales in the MC dataset. To clarify, we did not intend to state that MC and Zika infections should coincide in time, and in fact our work from March 2016 was one of the first to report a lag of several months between the two (Faria et al. (2016) Science 352:aaf5036)). We have now obtained MC counts in time up to May 2017 and have added this data to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (unfortunately, as before, data on GBS was not available). By comparing the Zika and MC time series for Feira de Santana we can now detect a lag of about 5.5-6 months, which is slightly longer than our previous report. This, however, can be explained by the fact that the dates for MC cases are the actual dates of confirmation, which is usually done postpartum (30-60 days after delivery). Crucially, as shown in the revised 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we are now able to validate our original conclusion that most MC cases reported were a consequence of the high attack rate in 2015 and consequently the high number of pregnancies at risk during that year. We have changed the manuscript to include results and discussion on the new time scale of the MC epidemic in Feira de Santana.
