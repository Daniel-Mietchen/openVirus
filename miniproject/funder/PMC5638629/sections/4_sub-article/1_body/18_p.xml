<p>We agree that the observation rate is likely to have changed in time between 2015 and 2017. In fact, it has now become clear that the Brazilian authorities changed their surveillance system on the 1
 <sup>st</sup> January 2016. We therefore explored the effect of using a semi time-dependent observation rate: one for 2015 (zeta) and a different one (zetaâ€™) from 1
 <sup>st</sup> January 2016 onwards.
