<p>We fully agree that the discussion about the introduction of Zika was highly speculative. In the context of the revised manuscript with changes in the updated dataset and addition of informative priors it is clear that an introduction dating back to early autumn 2014 is not supported. We have therefore removed this point from our revised manuscript.</p>
