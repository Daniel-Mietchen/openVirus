<p>As part of the previous revision, we had submitted supplementary tables (csv files) with 500 samples of the posteriors and corresponding model solutions for R0 and Re (both deterministic and stochastic in a total of 4 files). These samples are representative of the posteriors presented in both 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 7. We apologize for not making it clear in the main text that this information had been made available, and have now changed the figure legends for 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 and Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1.</xref> to include reference to the supplementary files.
