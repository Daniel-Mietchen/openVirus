 <p>c) Issues around reproducibility</p>
 <p>- As is normally the rule with eLife modelling papers, the model code, input data and results (including MCMC samples from the converged joint posterior distribution) needed to reproduce the figure should be included as supplementary data files. Public data from cited online sources may be moved, edited or removed in future, so it is important to include everything required to reproduce the descriptive and modelling analysis with the paper itself.</p>
