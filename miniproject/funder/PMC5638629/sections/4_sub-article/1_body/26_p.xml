<p>We had no intention to mark Feira de Santana (FSA) as a special case of the Brazilian Zika epidemic. The purpose of the graph in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was simply to compare the epidemiological timeseries and to show that the epidemic in FSA peaked in 2015, in contrast to Brazil as a whole, where Zika peaked the following year; this does obviously not exclude other places where the epidemic could also have peaked in 2015. Furthermore, we believe that the behaviour described in this study is potentially ubiquitous to many major urban centres in Brazil and elsewhere. Hence, we do not agree that this is in any way misleading. In our revised version we have tried to clarify that this is not a comparison between FSA and other places in Brazil, which we agree would be very interesting to investigate in more detail, but which would require a different approach and more detailed data from different locations across the country.
