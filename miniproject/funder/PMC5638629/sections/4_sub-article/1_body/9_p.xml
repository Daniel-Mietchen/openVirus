<p>We agree that the blue area in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> was not the clearest way to present our results. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now revised the figure to illustrate the exact area that represents Feira de Santana in the background of the sensitivity output (using the 95% CI of the estimated observation rate, taken from the posterior).
