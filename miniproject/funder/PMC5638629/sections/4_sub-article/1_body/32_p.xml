<p>It is true that the studies we reference include some weather proxies or climate variables. However, in our manuscript we present an integrated, dynamic framework that explicitly models the life-cycle of the vector under climatic drivers, alongside viral transmission between mosquitoes and humans. Studies Bogoch et al., 2016, Perkins et al., 2016 and Messina et al., 2016 on the other hand, do not explore a dynamic transmission model and use instead climatic variables for geo-mapping and suitability indexation. The study Zhang et al., 2016 does include a dynamic model and climate-dependent parameters, and although the proposed framework offers a great opportunity to study the impact of climate on Zika transmission, this has not been explored. In order to not overstate the focus of our study we have changed the statement to: “Climate variables are critical for the epidemiological dynamics of Zika and other arboviral diseases, such as dengue [Gao et al., 2016; Bewick et al., 2016; Lourenço and Recker, 2014; Feldstein et al., 2015] and chikungunya [Kraemer et al., 2015; van Punhuis et al., 2011; Poletti et al., 2011]. Although these have also been previously addressed in mapping and / or modelling studies (e.g. [Bogoch et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Perkins et al., 2016; Messina et al., 2016]), their effects as ecological drivers for the emergence, transmission and endemic potential of the Zika virus, especially in the context of a well described outbreak, have not yet been addressed in detail.”</p>
