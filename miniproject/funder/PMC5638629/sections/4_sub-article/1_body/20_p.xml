<p>We have decided to keep the simpler model with one observation rate in the main results of the manuscript. We took this decision on the basis that the observation and attack rates for the year 2015 did not change and because these are the main drivers for the projected behaviour of Zika in the near future. We fully recognize the public health importance of increasing the observation rates due to changes in the surveillance system, but we believe that it should be mainly explored in the Discussion section and supported by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3â€”figure supplement 2</xref>. We are naturally open for guidance and comments on this decision by the Editors and reviewers, however.
