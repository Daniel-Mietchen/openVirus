<p>The inclusion of informative priors resulted in better-behaved posteriors and removed the semi-bimodal shapes from the posteriors for the human infectious and incubation periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is important to note, however, that the updated outputs resulting from the addition of the informative priors, as well as the addition of a further 9 months of notified data, are consistent with the ones presented in the original manuscript (see other responses below for comparison of new results under the revised changes to the methodology as proposed by the Editors and Reviewers).
