<p>We agree that these topics are of great interest and currently lacking in the literature. We have significantly changed 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and now present two subplots on the relationship between the climatic variables and the observed case counts and transmission potential. We have further added a paragraph discussing these findings in our revised manuscript. However, we believe that a more in-depth exploration would require well-curated arboviral data (as the one presented here) from more than one location, potentially both urban and rural, and that this topic goes beyond the scope of our manuscript. (It is indeed something that we are planning to do as a separate research study in the future).
