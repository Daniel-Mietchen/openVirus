<p>We fully agree that the apparent increases or decreases in risks in some of the age groups can potentially be due to reporting bias. We tried to extract as much information out of the data as possible but unfortunately it was too limited to go into further details about the apparent risk differences. In our manuscript we explicitly state that “With the lack of more detailed data it was not possible to ascertain whether these findings indicated age-related risks of disease, age-dependent exposure risks or simply notification biases”. Furthermore, and akin to the reviewer’s comment, in the original Discussion we mentioned that “… such signatures could emerge by both a rush of parents seeking medical services driven by a hyped media coverage during the ZIKV epidemic, and a very small proportion of the elderly seeking or having access to medical attention”. The wording of this paragraph has now been revised to reflect better the reviewer’s comment.</p>
