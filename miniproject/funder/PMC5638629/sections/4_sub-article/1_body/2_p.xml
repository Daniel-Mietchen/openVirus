<p>It is true that our ODE model is very complex, such that the fitting procedure is likely to suffer from a parameter identifiability issue, which may have led to the seemingly bi-modal posterior distribution. It is also true that there is a certain degree of covariance between the parameters, which again can cause non-normal posteriors. In the original manuscript we used uninformative priors for all of our parameters and relied on empirical observations as a validation of our dynamic model and fitting output – e.g. mean rates of latency and recovery, and R0 values close to reported ranges in the literature. In order to address the possible identifiability issue and shape of the posteriors we now used informed (Gaussian) priors for 4 out of 8 estimated parameters. This was based on relevant biological / epidemiological observations, including human infectious and latency periods and the eta and α factors that determine the vector life-span and incubation periods according to climatic variables.</p>
