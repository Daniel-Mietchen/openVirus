<p>We are totally committed for source code to be made public for transparency and research purposes (something the main author has already some background, in terms of publishing R-packages). Indeed, since submission of the last revision we have planned and offered a student project to develop an R-package with the goal of simulating the model described in this manuscript. We believe such project is a more useful way of making the model and methods described in this manuscript useful for the community and into the public domain. We would like to propose that a statement be added to the main text, on the grounds that the source code can be made available by the authors upon request.</p>
