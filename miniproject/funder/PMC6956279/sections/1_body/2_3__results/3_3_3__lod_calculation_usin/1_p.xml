<p>To assess more precisely the sensitivity of the in-house assays that provided the best results during the first stages of this study, we used dilutions of the quantified EBOV synthetic RNA. The aim was to estimate the limit of detection (LoD) for both Gibb et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] assays and to calculate the LoD of the Duo Gibb + Huang assay. Results presented in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00652-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00652-f005">Figure 5</xref> show that the LoD
 <sub>95</sub> of the Duo Gibb + Huang assay was lower (0.382 RNA copies/µL)) compared with those provided by Gibb et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (1.7 RNA copies/µL) and Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] assays (2.2 RNA copies/µL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00652-f006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, the linearity of the Duo Gibb + Huang assay was lower than that of the two other assays (
