<p>In the Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] assay, the occurrence of a mismatch close to the 3′ end of the sense primer (enp-F) that was not covered by a wobble in the primer sequence, led to the design of a second primer (enp-F2, GCAGAGCAAGGACTGATACA) to avoid mismatches with possible deleterious effects on the performances of the assay. A single mismatch was observed within the probe, but it was decided not to modify the original sequence because it was positioned on the 6th nucleotide from the 3′-end. No mismatch was observed in the reverse primer.
