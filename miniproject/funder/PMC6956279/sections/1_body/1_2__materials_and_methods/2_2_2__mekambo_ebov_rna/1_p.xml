<p>Genomic RNA from the Mekambo strain of EBOV (Medemba village, Gabon, 2001 [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) was prepared at Laboratory P4-Jean Mérieux, INSERM, Lyon, France. The virus was grown in Vero cells and viral RNA was extracted from 100 µL of cell culture supernatant and purified using the QIAcube HT Robot using the Cador Pathogen 96 kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) as recommended. Elution was performed in 80 µL of AVE buffer (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France), aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Mekambo EBOV RNA concentration (3.4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies per µL) was quantified by RT-qPCR performed with GoTaq Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR (Promega, Charbonnières-les-Bains, France).
