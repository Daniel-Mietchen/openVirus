<p>The Duo Gibb + Huang assay showed a sensitivity that was at least equal, and even better than that observed with the two parental assays. The LoD was better for the Duo Gibb + Huang assay than LoDs observed for both parental assays, independently. In addition, the Duo assay demonstrated higher RFU, as previously described with CHIKV Duo [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], that warrants an easier interpretation of the results for low-copy samples, which are notoriously the most difficult situation at the validation stage. This is of particular importance because molecular detection of EBOV RNA is the cornerstone for sorting patients suspect of EVD. The reason for increased RFU observed with Duo assays is not fully elucidated; our hypothesis is it could be linked to the superposition of two labeled probes accounting for a higher signal.
