<p>Although EBOV has been first isolated and identified more than 50 years ago, sorting suspect patients by using real-time RT-PCR-based diagnostics remains challenging in the region where outbreak are on-going. There are a growing number of molecular tests described in the literature. The tests that were selected in this study have been widely used not only in epidemic situations but also in external quality assessment studies [

Dual-target assays, also known as Duo assays (i) allow the detection of viral variants resulting in genomes with mutated regions which might affect hybridization of either primers or probe of the original assay; (ii) simplify the interpretation of the results due to the use of a unique fluorescent dye for different probes included in the assay, and (iii) frequently improves the sensitivity as previously shown with Chikungunya virus [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Here, we selected four assays that were targeting different regions of the genome (

 <italic>GP</italic> genes) and which provided the most interesting in silico results.
