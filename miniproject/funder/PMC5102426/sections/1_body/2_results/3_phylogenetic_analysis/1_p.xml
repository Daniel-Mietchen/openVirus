<p>Thirteen sequences from the three outbreaks were obtained and analyzed, including two from Outbreak A, six from Outbreak B, and five from Outbreak C. Phylogenetic analysis using a collection of reference sequences representing a variety of NoV genotypes showed that all thirteen of the sequences were classified into the genotype GII.4 and closely resembled the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant (Genbank accession No. JX459908; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165880.g002">Fig 2</xref>). To examine the potential recombination of the detected NoVs, the complete genome sequences of two isolates, JB031230054 (Outbreak A) and JB031230049 (Outbreak B) were amplified and sequenced. While both isolates clustered with the Sydney 2012 reference strain in three ORFs, their ORF1 clustered with the Osaka 2007 strain (GII.4 variant of 2007), while their ORFs 2&amp;3 were clustered with the variants of Apeldoorn 2008 (GII.4 variant of 2008) and New Orleans (GII.4 variant of 2009), thereby suggesting a recombination event occurred during the overlap of ORF1/ORF2 from both isolates (

To eliminate the possibility that the polymerase and capsid encoding genes were from two separate NoVs that co-infected the same patients, a fragment of ~1100 nucleotides in length, spanning both ORF1 and ORF2, was amplified from a stool sample. Simplot analyses of the junction regions between ORF1 and ORF2 confirmed the presence of recombinant strains and indicated a potential cross-over site where the recombination between ORF1 and ORF2 is likely to have occurred (
