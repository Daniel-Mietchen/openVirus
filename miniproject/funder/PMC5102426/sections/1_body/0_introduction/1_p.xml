 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], wherein they are responsible for &gt; 90% of non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the United States, NoVs are estimated to cause 21-million illnesses each year, which results in 71,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths [

 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In developing countries, NoVs are estimated to claim over 200, 000 deaths annually in children &lt; 5 years of age [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Norovirus outbreaks occur frequently in semi-closed institutions, such as hospitals, nursing homes for the elderly, schools, prisons, restaurants, hotels, and cruise ships [

 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. NoVs transmit via the consumption of contaminated food or water, through person-to-person contact, or by exposure to aerosols from vomitus [

 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. NoVs are highly contagious owing to their ability to infect at low doses, their high stability in the environment, and by the limited short-term immunity hosts amount [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, outbreaks of NoVs are extremely difficult to control.
