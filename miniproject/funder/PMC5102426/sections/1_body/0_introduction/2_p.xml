<p>NoVs are non-enveloped RNA viruses that contain a single-stranded, positive-sense, and polyadenylated RNA genome of ~ 7.5 kb in length [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The NoV genome consists of three open reading frames (ORFs 1–3). ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is processed post-translation into six non-structural proteins, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major (capsid protein, VP1) and minor (VP2) structural proteins, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The genomes of NoVs are highly diverse. Each belongs to one of six genogroups (GI–GVI) and each genogroup can be further stratified into one of more than thirty-six genotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While GI, GII, and GIV NoVs can infect humans, the GII.4 genotype is attributed to causing both outbreaks and many sporadic cases [
