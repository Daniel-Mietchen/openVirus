<p>The evolution of GII.4 NoV variants is potentially driven by several factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In a similar manner to the influenza A virus, a new GII.4 variant tends to emerge every 2â€“3 year through antigenic drift. Furthermore, recombination is likely to be an important factor for the emergence of the GII.4 variants in a resemblance to the reassortment of genetic material by the influenza virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Intra-genotype recombination has frequently been reported in some GII.4 variants [

 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this study, two genomes of the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant from two outbreaks were analyzed for recombination. We found that ORF1 was derived from an Osaka 2007 virus, while the ORFs 2&amp;3 were from the viruses responsible for Apeldoorn 2008 and New Orleans 2009 (
