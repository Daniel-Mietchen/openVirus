<p>In conclusion, the emerging GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant caused three gastroenteritis outbreaks in the winter season of 2012/13 in Shenzhen in China. These outbreaks occurred during the same time frame when the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant caused global epidemics. Two outbreaks occurred in social welfare centers for the elderly and were most likely due to an asymptomatic food handler. Our study highlights first the susceptibility and vulnerability of the elderly in the closed environment of a nursing home setting and secondly the need to improve sanitation practices by food handlers.</p>
