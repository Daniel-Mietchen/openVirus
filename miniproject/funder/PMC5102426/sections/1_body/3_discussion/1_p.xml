<p>The present study describes three outbreaks of NoV that occurred in Shenzhen, China, during the epidemic season of 2012/13 caused by the new GII.4 variant Sydney 2012. During the past decade, new GII.4 variants have emerged and replaced previously predominant GII.4 strain every 2–3 years. Several global epidemics caused by different GII.4 variants in the winter season have been reported, including those that arose during the winter season of 1995/96 (caused by the 95/96 US variant), 2002/03 (caused by the Farmington Hills variant), 2004/06 (caused by the Hunter variant), 2006/07 (caused by the 2006b variant), and 2008/09 (caused by the New Orleans variant) [
