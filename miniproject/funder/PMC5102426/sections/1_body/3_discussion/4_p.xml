<p>A NoV outbreak is declared in accordance with Kaplan’s criteria, wherein (1) &gt; 50% of affected persons must be afflicted with vomiting, (2) the mean or median incubation period is 24–48 hr, (3) that the mean or median illness duration is 12–60 hr, and (4) that no bacterial pathogens are isolated from stool cultures [

The epidemiological investigation in this study revealed that the vomiting rates of all three outbreaks were greater than 50% (60.7% for Outbreak A, 82.1% for Outbreak B, and 59.0% for Outbreak C). Asymptomatic infections are estimated to occur in about one-third of all studies investigating outbreaks involving volunteers. We detected 16% (13 out of 79) of asymptomatic persons who were NoV-positive in Outbreak C, including a food handler who could have been the source of this outbreak. Ozawa 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the prevalence of NoV detection in food handlers was 19% in different food-catering settings in Japan and that 73% of symptomatic and 7% of asymptomatic food handlers were positive for the NoV [
