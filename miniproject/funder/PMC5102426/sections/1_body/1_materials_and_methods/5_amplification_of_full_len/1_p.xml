<p>The complete genomes of two of the earliest NoVs—JB031230049 and JB031230054—were amplified. Initially, cDNA was reverse transcribed from viral RNA (9.5 μL) using a modified oligo(dT)
 <sub>20</sub> primer (V

 <sub>20</sub> in 
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and a SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The total, 50-μL reaction mixture contained 5 μL 5× Ex Taq Buffer, 1 μL of each primer (20 pmol), 1 μL dNTP mix (10 mM), 0.5 μL Ex Taq enzyme (Takara, Japan), 5 μL cDNA, and 36.5 μL RNase-free water.

 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] primers were used to amplify the fragment from the ORF2 to the 3’ Poly A. The cycling conditions were configured as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles (94°C for 15 s, 62°C for 3 min, and 72°C 30s) and a final extension step at 72°C for 15 min. The ORF1 was divided into five overlapping fragments, which were amplified using the P290 and G2-SKR primers and four pairs of newly designed primer sets (

The conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, then 35 cycles (94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 45 s, and 72°C 1 min), and a final extension at 72°C 10 min. The fragment covering the ORF1/ORF2 overlap and amplified by the P290 [

 <xref rid="pone.0165880.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] primers was also used to examine potential recombination.
