<p>A 10% stool suspension was prepared by mixing 0.1 g stool with 1.0 mL phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). Viral RNA was extracted from the stool suspensions using the QiaAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Viral RNA was examined for GI and GII NoVs in a duplex format using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on a 7500 Real-time PCR platform (Applied Biosystem). The final, 25-μL reaction mix consisted of 0.4 μM of each of the four primers (Cog1F, Cog1R, Cog2F, Cog2R)_and 0.2μM of each TaqMan Probe (Ring 1a, Ring1b, Ring 2) [

The cycling conditions were configured for a reverse transcription step at 50°C for 30 min, followed by a denaturation step at 95°C for 15 min and 40 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and a combination of annealing and extension at 60°C for 1 min).
