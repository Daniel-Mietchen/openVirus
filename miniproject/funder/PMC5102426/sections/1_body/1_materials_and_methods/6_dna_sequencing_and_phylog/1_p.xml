<p>All PCR products were excised from the gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All purified products were sequenced with the primers listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0165880.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> using the Big-Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The resulting NoV sequences were analyzed using CLUSTAL X (Version 1.83) followed by phylogenetic analysis using MEGA version 4.1. The statistical significance of the inferred phylogenies was estimated using a bootstrap analysis of 1,000 pseudoreplicate data sets. SimPlot software (Version 1.3) was used to align and compare sequences to identify potential recombination(s) among known genotypes of NoVs. The nucleotide sequences generated in this study were deposited in the GenBank (KJ995534–KJ995550 for short sequences within the capsid region and KJ955492–KJ955493 for complete genome sequences).
