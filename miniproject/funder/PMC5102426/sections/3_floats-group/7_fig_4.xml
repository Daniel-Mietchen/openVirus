  <title>Simplot analysis for of putative, recombinant JB031230054 strain.</title>
  <p>Comparisons of genetic similarity between the strain JB031230054 and possible parental strains was made using SimPlot. The Y-axis represents the percentage of the nucleotide sequence similarity between the strain JB031230054 and other strains used for comparison. The X axis shows the relative nucleotide position along the full-length genome. The breakpoint positions are marked with dashed lines. A window size of 200 nucleotides with an increment of 20 was used.</p>
