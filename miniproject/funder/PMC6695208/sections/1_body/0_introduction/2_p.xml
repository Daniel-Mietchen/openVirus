<p>This is the first EVD outbreak to occur in an armed conflict zone, and this new context has created challenges to the outbreak response [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Uptake of traditional control measures such as contact tracing and safe burials has varied with the community, even with the rapid deployment and widespread availability of experimental vaccines and therapeutics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Our understanding of the impact of scientific advances on EVD transmission has been evolving; there has been an underlying, untested assumption that vaccination may reduce epidemic transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mathematical modeling of simulated EVD epidemics suggested that vaccination coverage as low as 40% in the general population and 95% in healthcare workers (HCWs) may avert another epidemic similar to size of the West African one [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Studies have yet to estimate the levels of vaccination coverage associated with epidemic decline. An even greater potential problem in difficult-to-access outbreak areas is ascertainment of vaccination coverage among contacts and contacts of contacts. Mathematical models are needed that can produce relatively accurate forecasts in the setting of such unknown but important outbreak response metrics.
