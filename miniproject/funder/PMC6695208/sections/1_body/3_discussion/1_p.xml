<p>As of February 25, 2019, with 875 cases reported to date, most of our model projections were concentrated in a range up to about 300 additional cases overall, and even the Gottâ€™s rule forecast, whose prediction intervals are especially wide, placed low probability on outcomes on the scale of the West African outbreak. The current outbreak, however, has so far behaved unpredictably, possibly due to complex social circumstances, and could continue to be unpredictable and render our projections inaccurate. EVD has never before been introduced into a conflict zone with such political instability, potential disease mobility and community impenetrability [

At present, the most reliable data source of EBOV transmission has been the weekly case counts that can be found in the WHO situation reports. Despite such situations of data scarcity and new outbreak circumstances, our models generated relatively accurate short-term projections of outbreak size in the months of January and February 2019, suggesting that short-term projections made in real time can be useful in decision making and resource allocation.
