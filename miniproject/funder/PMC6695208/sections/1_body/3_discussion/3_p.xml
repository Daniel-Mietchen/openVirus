<p>The mathematical models we adopted for this project near the beginning of the outbreak were developed to predict the course of prior outbreaks, and did not consider circumstances unique to the current outbreak. To improve the accuracy of short-term projections, we used the short-term forecasting performance of the mathematical models during the current outbreak to calibrate them and improve their performance on this outbreak. This may be a useful pattern for short-term forecasting of ongoing disease outbreaks in real time.</p>
