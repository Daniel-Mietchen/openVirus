<p>We conducted a simple regression forecast based solely on outbreaks of size 10 or greater, based on prior outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nonparametric Theil-Sen regression (R package 
 <monospace>mblm</monospace> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]) was used to project the final outbreak size based on values of the outbreak size at a specific earlier time. All time series were aligned on the day they reached 10 cases. Finally, we reported the median and 95% central coverage intervals for the prediction distribution, conditional on the predicted value being no smaller than the observed value for each day.
