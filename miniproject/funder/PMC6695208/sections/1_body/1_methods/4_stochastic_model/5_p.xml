<p>We used the (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>initial</sub>, 
 <italic>τ</italic>) pairs estimated from prior outbreaks to provide 
 <italic>R</italic> values for simulation. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>initial</sub> values were sampled uniformly from the range of values estimated from past outbreaks. We applied a linear regression to the values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>initial</sub> and log(
 <italic>τ</italic>) estimated for prior outbreaks, and used the resulting regression line to assign a mean 
 <italic>τ</italic> to each 
 <italic>R</italic>, used with the residual variance of log(
 <italic>τ</italic>) as a distribution from which to sample 
 <italic>τ</italic> values for simulation given 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>initial</sub>. Note that the range of fast and slow quenching scenarios modeled in this way is not limited to the exact combinations estimated from past outbreaks, but extends over a continuous distribution that includes those values. The parameters 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>initial</sub> and 
 <italic>τ</italic> sampled in this way, together with three values of the dispersion parameter 
 <italic>k</italic>, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, consistent with transmission heterogeneity observed in past Ebola outbreaks, were used to generate simulated outbreaks.
