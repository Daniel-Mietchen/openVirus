<p>In order to produce model outbreak trajectories consistent with the case counts reported more recently in the outbreak, it was necessary to make the filtering step of the model more tolerant to variation in counts in order to accommodate the rapidly rising count. This was because higher transmission rates in late September and early October were necessary to generate case counts of that size than were consistent with the earlier counts.</p>
