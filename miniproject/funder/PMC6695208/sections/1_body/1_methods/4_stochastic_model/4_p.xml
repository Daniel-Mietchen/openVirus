<p>We simulated EBOV transmission using a stochastic branching process model, in which the number of secondary cases caused by any given primary case is drawn from a negative binomial distribution, whose mean is the reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic> as a function of day of the outbreak, and variance is controlled by a dispersion parameter 
 <italic>k</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. All transmission events were assumed to be independent. The interval between date of detection of each primary case and that of each of its secondary cases is assumed gamma distributed with mean 14.5 days and standard deviation 5 days, rounded to the nearest whole number of days, as above.
