<p>Thus, this model embodies a set of assumptions that transmission rates are overall gradually declining from the start of the outbreak to its end, though possibly with a high level of variability in transmission rate between cases and between simulations. When the tolerance of the filter on case counts is small, quenching of transmission through time must closely track case counts, while when tolerance is high, fluctuations in the rate of generation of new cases can reflect a pattern of ongoing quenching of transmission more loosely and on the long term, while being more insensitive to short-term up and down fluctuations in transmission rates reflected in the true case counts.</p>
