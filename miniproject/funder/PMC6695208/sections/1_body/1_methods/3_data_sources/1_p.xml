<p>Data on the current outbreak were collected from the WHO website in real time as updated information was published [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A cumulative case count of probable and confirmed cases was extracted to be consistent with the best knowledge at the time. Snapshots of the table of case counts were kept as of multiple dates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007512.s003">S1 Fig</xref>), to be used in retrospective scoring of model projections against subsequently known counts. Although the epidemic was officially reported on August 1 as a cluster of cases occurring in June and July, seven sporadic early cases from April and May were subsequently linked to the current outbreak and were added to later case totals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007512.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This additional knowledge was added retrospectively to the time series of cumulative case counts only for predictions made for days on or after September 15, when these cases were officially linked to the current outbreak.
