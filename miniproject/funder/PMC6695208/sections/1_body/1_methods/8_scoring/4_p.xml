<p>For each projection, we generated an assignment of probability to possible values of multiple quantities. As Ebola situation reports were released before February 25, we generated short-term projections in real time with the stochastic and negative binomial auto-regression models. We scored these projections and calibrated the models during the outbreak. We then used these calibrated models for our projections on February 25. The Theil-Sen and Gott’s rule models were not calibrated, because the outbreak’s final size is not yet known. Final outbreak size projections generated by the stochastic, Theil-Sen, and Gott’s rule models were recorded for future evaluation of their performance.</p>
