<p>The stochastic model estimated likelihoods of the three scenarios of zero, low, and high vaccination coverage, based on how often models using the different coverage assumptions were able to pass the particle filtering step. In the estimate based on data through February 25, zero vaccination coverage was estimated substantially more likely than low or high coverage, as was also true in most earlier estimates. The lower vaccination coverage scenario was estimated more likely than the higher one. Higher vaccination coverage scenarios were estimated more likely in estimates made before October, at which time the outbreak epicenter shifted into the conflict zone and situation reports described an increase in case counts (
