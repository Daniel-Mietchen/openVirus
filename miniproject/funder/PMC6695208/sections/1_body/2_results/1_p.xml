<p>When we started performing our short-term forecasts on August 20, 2018, there were 102 reported EVD cases in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, DRC. We used our stochastic and auto-regression models to project one-week, two-week, four-week, and eight-week forecasts of outbreak size. As time lapsed, we compared predicted and known outbreak sizes, and found a higher probability of accurate forecasts at one week than at eight weeks (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007512.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007512.g003">3</xref>). Log-likelihood scores typically declined as projection times extended further into the future. These lower-scoring longer-term projections tended to include wider prediction intervals, reflecting less certain outcomes in which less probability was assigned to any one value. The epidemic curve accelerated in early October, and stochastic model forecasts occurring just before that change were especially low scoring, as they failed to anticipate the coming rise in case counts. Subsequent projections took into account the reported acceleration and their performance recovered.
