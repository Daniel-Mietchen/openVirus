<p>After our model validation process was completed, we used the stochastic and auto-regression models to project one-week, two-week, four-week, and eight-week outcomes (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007512.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007512.g005">5</xref>). We used the Gottâ€™s rule and Theil-Sen regression models together with the stochastic model to project final outbreak sizes (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007512.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007512.g007">7</xref>).
