  <title>Reported case counts in current outbreak by date, in multiple snapshots of available data.</title>
  <p>We retained snapshots of the data set of case counts to date as of multiple dates of data collection, for use in scoring of retrospective model projections against known subsequent counts. In later data sets, due to the larger number of data points, a subset of the case counts was selected for use in the stochastic model’s particle filtering step, as noted in the figure. Where not otherwise noted, all case counts shown were used in the stochastic model’s particle filtering step.</p>
