  <title>Estimates of reproduction number 
   <italic>R</italic> by day in past Ebola outbreaks.
  </title>
  <p>Epidemic curves reported for past Ebola outbreaks were used to estimate time series of effective reproduction number (
   <italic>R</italic>) by day, which were then fit to an exponentially declining (“quenched”) curve. The quenching rate parameter 
   <italic>τ</italic> estimates the relative change in 
   <italic>R</italic> per day from 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>initial</sub> that results from outbreak control efforts, behavioral changes in response to the outbreak, and potential local depletion of susceptibles. Estimates of 
   <italic>R</italic> by day are drawn as heavy curves, and exponentially quenched curves 
   <italic>R</italic> = 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>initial</sub>
   <italic>e</italic>
   <sup>−
    <italic>τd</italic>
   </sup> fit to each series of 
   <italic>R</italic> estimates are drawn as lighter curves.
