  <title>Likelihood estimates of vaccine coverage scenarios consistent with model transmission rates, estimated by number of simulated outbreaks under the three scenarios accepted by the stochastic modelâ€™s filtering step.</title>
  <p>Note that each bar of this plot is an estimate based on the entire time series as of the date indicated, that is, they are cumulative estimates of the overall vaccine coverage, not successive estimates of short-term coverage.</p>
