  <title>Transmission rate parameters selected by the particle filtering process.</title>
  <p>The 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>initial</sub> and 
   <italic>τ</italic> parameters driving simulated outbreaks that were successful in passing the particle filtering step, which selects simulated outbreaks that match the reported case counts, tended to cluster in particular locations within the assumed distribution. In some cases, distinct ranges of 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>initial</sub> and/or 
   <italic>τ</italic> were selected in conjunction with the different vaccine coverage scenarios. Shown here is the distribution of parameter combinations (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>initial</sub>, 
   <italic>τ</italic>) selected by the filtering process, colored by vaccine coverage scenario, for successive snapshots of available case count data. As in previous figure, black dots represent 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>initial</sub>, 
   <italic>τ</italic> pairs estimated for past outbreaks (for comparison), and colors illustrate the density of 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>initial</sub>, 
   <italic>τ</italic> pairs selected by filtering simulated outbreaks, by level of vaccine coverage. In the Feb. 25 dataset, no simulated outbreaks with vaccine coverage at the 62% (high) level were selected.
