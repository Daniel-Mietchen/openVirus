  <p>I have read the journal's policy and the authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: BJC has received research funding from MedImmune Inc. and Sanofi Pasteur, and consults for Crucell NV. JS discloses consulting for JWT and Axon Advisors, as well as partial ownership of SK Analytics. The authors report no other potential conflicts of interest.
