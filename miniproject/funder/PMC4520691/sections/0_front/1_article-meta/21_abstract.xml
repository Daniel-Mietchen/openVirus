 <p>Influenza causes high levels of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Accurate forecasts of epidemic timing and magnitude would provide public health sectors valuable advance information in support of the planning and deployment of intervention measures. Such forecast systems have been developed for temperate regions with seasonal winter epidemics (e.g., U.S. cities). In subtropical and tropical regions, however, influenza epidemics can occur throughout the year with varying epidemic intensity; this irregularity makes the generation of accurate forecasts more challenging. For this study we develop alternative forecast systems that are more adept at handling erratic non-seasonal epidemics, using state-of-the-art Bayesian inference methods in conjunction with an epidemiological model. Here we present these forecast systems and apply them to Hong Kong. During 1998â€“2013, Hong Kong saw 44 influenza epidemics caused by either the A(H1N1), A(H3N2), or B strain, and 19 aggregate epidemics caused by one or more of these influenza strains. The forecast systems are able to forecast both the peak timing and peak magnitude of these epidemics, including the 2009 pandemic. The results suggest that routine forecast of influenza epidemics in other subtropical and tropical regions is possible, as well as forecast of other infectious diseases sharing similar irregular transmission dynamics.</p>
