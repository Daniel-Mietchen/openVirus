  <title>Comparison of forecast accuracy for Hong Kong (HK) and New York City (NYC) using the EAKF and PF filters, as well as random sampling from historical records for HK.</title>
  <p>Forecast accuracy was evaluated by grouping predictions based on (A) predicted lead time (i.e. how far in the future the peak is predicted) or (B) actual forecast week relative to the observed peak. Positive leads indicate that a peak is forecast in the future; negative leads indicate that a peak is forecast in the past; a 0 week lead indicates that a peak is forecast for the week of forecast initiation.</p>
