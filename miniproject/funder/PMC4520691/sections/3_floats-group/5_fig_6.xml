  <title>Forecast accuracy versus ensemble spread.</title>
  <p>The ensemble spread is presented as the percentage of ensemble members predicting the mode peak week (PEMPM). Red lines are generated using the EAKF and blue lines using the PF; solid lines show forecast accuracies for peak timing (within ±1 week of observation); dashed lines show forecast accuracies for peak magnitude (within ±20% of observation). The filled circle size associated with each PEMPM bin represents the fraction of forecasts within each lead category.</p>
