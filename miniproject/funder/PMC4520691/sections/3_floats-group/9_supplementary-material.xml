  <title>Simulation of the Hong Kong ILI+ time series using the SIR-PF 
   <italic>with</italic> space reprobing.
  </title>
  <p>Simulations were performed for (A) H1N1, including seasonal and pandemic H1N1, (B) H3N2, (C) influenza B, and (D) all strains. Weekly ILI+ observations are shown as ‘x’. One hundred simulations were run for each time series; mean ILI+ estimates are shown by the blue lines; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown by the grey dashed lines. Note that the 95% CIs are very close to the mean trajectories and are barely visible.</p>
