<p>Influenza causes a significant public health burden worldwide. Recent studies have shown that reliable forecasts of influenza epidemics can be generated in real time [

However, before operational forecasts can be routinely generated and expanded to other regions of the globe, these forecast systems need to be tested and optimized against epidemics observed in a variety of locales with diverse transmission dynamics.
