<p>In temperate regions, influenza transmits primarily during winter. This regularity allows the forecast systems to be initiated and optimized prior to the influenza season. For instance, our real-time forecast system for U.S. cities [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] is initialized at Week 40 each year, the first week that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) begin influenza activity surveillance. The forecast system is then continuously “trained” throughout the following weeks and months as additional observations are received and assimilated to inform the influenza transmission dynamics in that season. Model state variables, e.g., number of susceptible people and number of infected people, can be inferred through this recursive training process. These model state variables and parameters form the initial conditions of a forecast, which are critical for generating an accurate prediction.
