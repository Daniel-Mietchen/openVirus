<p>Indeed, our initial attempt to forecast the Hong Kong influenza epidemics using the same system for U.S. cities proved unfruitful (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). To overcome these challenges, we developed alternate forecast systems that are more adept at handling the seasonally erratic influenza transmission dynamics of the subtropics and tropics. Here we present these forecast systems and apply them to Hong Kong. The results are promising for forecasting influenza outbreaks in other subtropical and tropical regions, as well as other infectious diseases sharing similar irregular transmission dynamics.
