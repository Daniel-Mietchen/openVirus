<p>In subtropical and tropical regions, however, the seasonal characteristics of influenza are more diverse. Hong Kong is one such area that experiences highly irregular influenza epidemics from year to year [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hong Kong is located on the south coast of China, with a humid subtropical climate. It is one of the most densely populated cities, with a population of over seven million people and a population density of 6544 per km

 <sup>2</sup> in the U.S. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). In addition, Hong Kong is highly connected with mainland China and other regions around the world, attracting over 50 million visitors per year [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This large influx of visitors may increase the importation of influenza cases and further facilitate local transmission. Due to these unique climatic and socioeconomic features, influenza epidemics in Hong Kong can persist year-round in one year, whereas one or more distinct epidemics can occur in another year (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In addition, outbreak intensity, duration, and time from onset to the peak is more variable in Hong Kong than in temperate regions (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). This irregularity poses challenges for operational influenza prediction. For instance, initialization of the system at the beginning of the season, as done for temperate regions, would not be possible. As such, it is not clear whether the same forecast system, proven to be valuable for temperate regions with regular epidemics, could be applied to generate forecasts in real time for subtropical and tropical regions.
