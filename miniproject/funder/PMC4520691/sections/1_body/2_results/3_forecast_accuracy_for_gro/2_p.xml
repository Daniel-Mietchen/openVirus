 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> shows the sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate), specificity (i.e., true negativity rate), precision (i.e., positive predictive value), and negative predictive value for the two forecast systems. Both forecast systems can accurately detect/predict an ongoing epidemic (sensitivity&gt;~80%) and do not falsely predict epidemics during dormant periods (specificity &gt;~90%). Tallied over all weekly forecasts, the PF had slightly higher sensitivity (90% vs. 88%) and specificity (95% vs. 94%) than the EAKF. For both filters, the sensitivity and specificity vary by strain; forecasts for H1N1 and Type B in general had lower sensitivity and specificity (e.g., for the EAKF, sensitivity of 83% for H1N1 and 81% for influenza B vs. 93% for H3N2).
