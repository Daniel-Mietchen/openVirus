<p>The combined system of the SIR model and either of the two filter methods comprises a state-space, or hidden Markov, model that allows estimation of unobserved, or latent, state variables (e.g., population susceptibility 
 <italic>S</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Both filters adjust the SIR model variables (e.g., numbers of susceptible and infected people) and parameters (e.g., the basic reproductive number 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic> and infectious period 
 <italic>D</italic>) using observations through a recursive filtering process. For instance, at the beginning of an epidemic, a filter may adjust the susceptibility upwards in light of an increase in incidence. By doing so, it is able to accommodate the dynamics of the system, e.g., increased population susceptibility when a new strain begins to circulate, despite the fact that the SIR model does not include susceptible replenishment. In effect, the filters partially compensate for model misspecification.
