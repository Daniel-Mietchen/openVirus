 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> presents prediction accuracy for epidemic onset, duration, peak timing, and peak ILI+ magnitude for both forecast systems. These are tallied for all forecasts—individual strain and all strains—a total of 332,400 weekly forecasts (i.e., 831 weekly forecasts for each strain × 4 strains × 100 runs). Here we focus our analysis on 
 <italic>predicted</italic> lead weeks ranging from -10 to 10 weeks; a positive lead (e.g. 2 wk) indicates the event (e.g., the epidemic peak or onset) is predicted to occur 2 weeks in the future from the time of forecast initiation; a 0 wk lead indicates the event is predicted to occur at the time of forecast initiation; and a negative lead, say -3 wk, indicates the event is predicted to have occurred 3 weeks prior to the forecast initiation. Forecasts with negative lead times may appear counterintuitive; however, accurate prediction that an event has passed is an important capability of a forecast system. In regions experiencing year-round influenza transmission, such as Hong Kong, multimodal epidemics, i.e. epidemics with multiple crests, are common (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). A forecast initiated after a smaller crest but preceding the overall peak may mistakenly identify that smaller crest as the peak and predict that the peak has passed, i.e. an inaccurate forecast with negative lead. Conversely, an accurate forecast with negative lead indicates that no spurious future increase in incidence is predicted. Therefore, forecast accuracy at negative leads also represents the ability of the forecast system to predict future epidemic trajectories.
