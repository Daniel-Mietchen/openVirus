<p>We also compared with the ILI+ forecasts generated for New York City, a temperate city with population size and density comparable to Hong Kong (8.4 million vs 7.2 million; 10,725 people/km
 <sup>2</sup> vs 6,544 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>), to those of Hong Kong. Over the 2003â€“2013 period and using epidemic curves aggregated for all circulating strains [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], peak prediction accuracy for Hong Kong is lower (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). This is likely due to the more complex influenza transmission dynamics in Hong Kong, e.g., longer outbreak duration and multiple peaks in a year (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Indeed, this gap disappeared when forecast accuracy was evaluated by timing relative to the observed peak, as opposed to the predicted lead week (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). For those forecasts initiated 3 weeks prior to the observed local peak or thereafter, accuracies for Hong Kong were comparable to or higher than those for New York City (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Moreover, when compared with a simple analog method, both filter methods clearly were more accurate (
