<p>Overall, the SIR-PF predictions of peak timing and peak magnitude outperformed those of the SIR-EAKF forecast system (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The performance of the SIR-PF forecast system is promising. Summarized over all weekly forecasts: (1) for the peak timing predictions (within ±1 wk of observation), accuracy was 37% for peaks 1–3 wk in the future, 51% for a current peak (0 wk lead), and increased to 73% for peaks 1–2 wk in the past (1–2 wk lag); (2) for the peak magnitude predictions (within ±20% of the observed peak ILI+), accuracy was 37% for peaks 1–3 wk in the future, 50% for a current peak, and increased to 78% for peaks 1–2 wk in the past (1–2 wk lag).
