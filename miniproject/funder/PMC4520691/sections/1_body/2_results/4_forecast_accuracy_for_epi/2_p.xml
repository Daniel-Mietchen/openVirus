<p>Forecast accuracy differs by filter, timing of forecast initiation, and the metric as well as the time series being forecast. Tallied over all forecasts, the PF in general produces more accurate predictions of peak timing (within ±1 wk of observation), peak magnitude (within ±20% of observation), and epidemic duration (within ±2 wk of observation), while the EAKF is more accurate predicting onset timing (within ±1 wk of observation,

Given the great irregularity in epidemic timing in Hong Kong, this outcome is not surprising. Some epidemics last for over a year in Hong Kong (

Both filters were able to more accurately predict peak timing and peak magnitude by individual strain than for the aggregate time series combining all circulating strains (
