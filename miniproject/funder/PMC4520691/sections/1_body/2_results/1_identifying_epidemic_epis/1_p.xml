<p>With the prescribed baselines and definitions of onset and ending, we identified 14 epidemics of H1N1 (including 10 epidemics of seasonal H1N1 during 1998–2009 and 4 epidemics of the pandemic H1N1 since 2009), 16 epidemics of H3N2 and 14 epidemics of influenza B during 1998–2013. For the combined strain time series, for which multiple concurrent epidemics of co-circulating strains could overlap and be counted as one single epidemic, there were 19 influenza epidemics during 1998–2013. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> shows these time series along with the onset and ending of each epidemic.
