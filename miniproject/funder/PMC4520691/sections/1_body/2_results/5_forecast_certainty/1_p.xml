<p>Both filters used here adopt an ensemble approach (see 
 <xref rid="sec002" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). The ensemble, i.e., the collection of model replicas, provides an estimated distribution for each model variable and parameter, as well as forecast epidemic trajectories. Previous forecast studies for the U.S. indicate that forecast accuracy increases when the variation within the forecast ensemble decreases [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This relationship can be used to calibrate forecast certainty and thus segregate more and less accurate forecasts in real time. That is, an expected accuracy for a real-time forecast, similar to the chance of precipitation in a weather forecast, can be derived based on this relationship. In real-time operation, the accuracy of a forecast cannot be verified until the epidemic has concluded; therefore, the expected accuracy, if reliable, provides forecast users, such as public health officials, much richer information.
