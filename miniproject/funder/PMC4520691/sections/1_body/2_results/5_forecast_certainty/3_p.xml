<p>In addition, a similar relationship appears between the accuracy of the predicted peak magnitude and the PEMPM of predicted

 <sup>st</sup> row). These relationships indicate that the forecast systems are able to accurately predict both peak timing and peak magnitude at least 3 weeks in advance.
