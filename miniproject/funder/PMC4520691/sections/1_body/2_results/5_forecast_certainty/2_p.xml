<p>Here we determined whether such a relationship holds for the Hong Kong forecasts. As in our previous study [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we found that the ensemble spread can be represented by the percentage of ensemble members predicting the mode (PEMPM). As defined previously [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], PEMPM is the percentage of the most frequently predicted outcome (i.e. the mode) among all predicted outcomes. The PEMPM increases when the agreement among ensemble members increases; it thus provides a measure of the variation within a forecast ensemble. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> shows this relationship for forecasts of peak timing using the SIR-EAKF and SIR-PF. Forecast accuracy does tend to increase as the PEMPM increases (i.e., the ensemble members are more in agreement), particularly for forecasts with a predicted peak 1–3 weeks in the future (i.e., 1–3 wk lead) at the forecast initialization or in the past (i.e., 0–2 wk lag, 3–5 wk lag, or 6–9 wk lag). This relationship is more robust for H3N2, H1N1, or all strains combined than for influenza B for forecasts with positive leads (

 <sup>st</sup> and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> rows, solid lines). For the more virulent and dominant H3N2 strain, the forecast accuracy for peak timing at 1–3 wk lead increased steadily up to 93% as the PEMPM increased to 80–90% (
