<p>We defined the onset as the first of three consecutive weeks with ILI+ records exceeding a prescribed baseline. The ILI+ baselines were chosen as the 40% quantile of the non-zero ILI+ records for each influenza strain, or the first quartile of the non-zero ILI+ records for all influenza strains combined. Inclusion of only non-zero ILI+ records in this calculation focuses the definition of onset on periods when a strain is circulating; the 40% quantile or 25% quantile of the remaining non-zero records define epidemic periods. Results using alternate baselines, e.g. the 33% quantile, produced similar results; however, some epidemics were not well delineated using this lower threshold (e.g., two adjacent epidemics could be classified as one epidemic). We defined the ending of an epidemic as the first of two consecutive weeks with ILI+ below the baseline following an onset. The period between an onset and its respective ending was defined as an epidemic; however, only those events with an ILI+ record three times or more above baseline were considered, i.e. intermittent small spikes were excluded. Time periods other than epidemics were defined as dormant periods.</p>
