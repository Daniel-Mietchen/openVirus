<p>Two evaluation standards were adopted. For the stricter standard, predictions of the week of onset, peak timing, or duration were deemed accurate if they exactly matched observations, and predicted peak magnitude was deemed accurate if it fell within ±20% of the observed ILI+ value. For the looser standard, predictions of epidemic onset or peak within ±1 week of observation, duration within ±2 weeks of observation, and peak magnitude within ±50% of the observation were deemed accurate.</p>
