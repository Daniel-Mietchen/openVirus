<p>The first aforementioned evaluation (i.e. predicting the gross phase) was intended to test whether the forecast system can accurately predict upcoming epidemic events while not predicting spurious epidemics during a dormant phase. The forecast was assessed against the entire duration of an event (i.e., a dormant period or epidemic period as defined above). A phase prediction was deemed accurate if the predicted epidemic trajectory included an epidemic during the predicted period; similarly, it was deemed accurate if there was no predicted epidemic during a dormant period. For example, for a forecast made at Week 10, within a dormant period lasting from Week 5 to Week 30, a phase prediction is deemed accurate if the forecast time series over Weeks 5â€“30 does not include two consecutive weeks exceeding the baseline, but inaccurate if otherwise.</p>
