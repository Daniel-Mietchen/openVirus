<p>The second evaluation was used to assess whether a forecast system can accurately predict the timing of onset, the peak timing (i.e., the week with the maximum ILI+), the peak magnitude (i.e., the maximum ILI+), and the epidemic duration. All these specific metrics are of potential interest to public health officials for planning influenza-related intervention measures. The accuracy of these metric forecasts was evaluated by comparing the target and the predicted metric. If the week of forecast initiation was within a dormant period and an epidemic was predicted during the following 40 weeks, the predicted epidemic would be evaluated against the metrics of the next observed epidemic (i.e., timing of onset, peak, ending, and peak magnitude); if the week of forecast initiation was within an epidemic period, and a second epidemic was predicted during the 40-week forecast, the predicted epidemic would be evaluated against the current epidemic episode.</p>
