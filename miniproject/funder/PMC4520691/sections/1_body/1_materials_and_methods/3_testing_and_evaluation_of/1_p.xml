<p>Each forecast system setting was used to simulate and forecast the H1N1, H3N2, B, or all strains combined ILI+ time series; each start-to-end forecast run was repeated 100 times to account for random effects from system initialization. The forecast systems using the two filters were then evaluated based on (1) accuracy predicting the phase or gross activity (i.e., epidemic or dormant period) and (2) accuracy predicting specific metrics, namely the onset, peak timing, peak magnitude, and duration of individual epidemic.</p>
