<p>Weekly records of rates of influenza like illness (ILI) consultations in the community from the week ending 04 January 1998 to the week ending 15 December 2013, were reported by a sentinel surveillance network of approximately 50 outpatient clinics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The Public Health Laboratory Services Branch in the Centre for Health Protection conducts laboratory testing of specimens provided by the ILI network and local hospitals for surveillance and diagnostic purposes. We obtained data on the weekly number of influenza-positive specimens by type and subtype, and the weekly number of specimens tested [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From these data streams we calculated the weekly ILI+ rate, a metric more precisely representing influenza infections [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; specifically, ILI+ was calculated as the ILI rate multiplied by the viral detection rate for each strain individually or all strains combined (
