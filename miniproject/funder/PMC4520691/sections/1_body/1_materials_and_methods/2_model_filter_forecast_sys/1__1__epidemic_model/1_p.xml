<p>Unlike temperate regions where influenza epidemics recur regularly each winter, Hong Kong experiences epidemics throughout the year. The intrinsic factors contributing to this year-round transmission pattern, e.g., different transmission routes or cross-immunity between different A subtypes and/or Type B, as well as the extrinsic effects of humidity and other environmental conditions on influenza transmission in this subtropical region, are not well understood [
