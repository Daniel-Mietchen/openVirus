<p>Both model-filter forecast methods include a ‘training’ process and a forecast step. The ‘training’ process comprises iterative prediction-update cycles as described above; it allows the filter to assimilate all observations up to the week of forecast and recursively optimize the model to obtain more authentic initial conditions prior to the forecast. The forecast step integrates the SIR model forward tens of weeks using the variables and parameters estimated from the training process.</p>
