<p>Using the SIR model, we built two forecast systems to predict the Hong Kong ILI+ time series. The first system used the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for optimization; the second system used a particle filter with resampling and regularization (PF) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Both filters adopt an ensemble approach. That is, an ensemble of model replicas (termed ensemble members for the EAKF or particles for the PF) is generated at initialization, and recursively updated at each prediction-update, i.e. filtering, cycle. The prediction step propagates the system forward to the next time step (e.g., from the current week to the next) generating a prediction using the SIR model; when a new observation arrives, the system (including all model variables and parameters) is updated per the filter algorithm (for more details see [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). This updated ensemble provides a probability distribution for each model variable or parameter. The mean variable/parameter estimate can be computed based on the ensemble; the EAKF computes the mean as a weighted average between the prediction and the observation, while the PF computes the mean using the updated particle weights, which are derived from a likelihood function.
