<p>The priors for the state variables and parameters in the model-filter frameworks were drawn from uniform distributions: 
 <italic>S</italic>~U[20%
 <italic>N</italic>, 80%
 <italic>N</italic>], for the initial population susceptibility with 
 <italic>N</italic> = 1×10
 <sup>5</sup> as the population size in the SIR model (note that 
 <italic>N</italic> is scalable to the actual population size of interest), 
 <italic>R
  <sub>0</sub>
 </italic>~U[0.6, 2.2], for the basic reproductive number, and 
 <italic>D</italic>~U[0.5, 7] days, for the infectious period. The systems were seeded with 0–50 infected persons (i.e., 
 <italic>I</italic>). In our past studies [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the scaling factor γ was fixed based on trials from a range of values and values ranging from 2 to 15 had good predictive ability [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this study, we included the scaling factor as a parameter of the forecast system and allowed it to be inferred by the filter; we used a broad prior distribution of γ for both forecast systems, i.e., γ~U [1, 10]. This choice of prior distribution reflects 
 <italic>a priori</italic> belief that the probability a person seeks medical attention when infected with influenza (including asymptomatic and mild, symptomatic infections) is generally lower than that of a person seeking medical attention for any reason (e.g., cardiovascular diseases), which is consistent with previous studies suggesting low consultation rates for influenza [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Note, the model simulated states and parameters are free to go outside the prior range should the filters, particularly the EAKF, migrate to an expanded state space through filtering of the observations.
