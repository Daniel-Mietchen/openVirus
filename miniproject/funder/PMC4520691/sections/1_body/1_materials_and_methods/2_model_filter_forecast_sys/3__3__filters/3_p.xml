<p>Due to the irregular timing of influenza epidemics in Hong Kong, both forecast systems were run continuously from the first record (i.e., Week 1 of 1998) to the last record (i.e., Week 50 of 2013). (Previously, for seasonal influenza in temperate regions, we have reinitialized model training at the beginning of each season, e.g., Week 40 of the year in the U.S.). This long Hong Kong time series created challenges for both filters used here; during the later half of the time series, the PF suffered from particle impoverishment while the EAKF suffered from filter divergence [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Basically, the SR method randomly replaces the model variables/parameters (in this study,

 </italic>, 
 <italic>D</italic>, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>) within a small fraction of trajectories, i.e. particles, at each filtering cycle; in so doing, it expands the state space covered by the filter through the introduction of outlying trajectories. To prevent the EAKF from filter divergence, we reinitialized the SIR-EAKF system once filter divergence was detected (i.e., when the posterior diverged from an observation by over 20%); in addition, we applied adaptive covariance inflation to the EAKF [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using these techniques, the PF was run with 3,000 particles and the EAKF was run with 500 ensemble members. Each week, following assimilation of the latest observation, a forecast was generated for the following 40 weeks (i.e., weekly 40-week forecasts). The first forecast was made after assimilating records from the first 3 weeks (i.e., Weeks 1–3 of 1998).
