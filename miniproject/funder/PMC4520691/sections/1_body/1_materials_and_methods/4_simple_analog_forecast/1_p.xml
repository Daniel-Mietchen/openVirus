<p>To test whether the filter methods outperform a naïve method, we also performed a simple analog forecast predicting the peak timing for the four ILI+ time series. The times from the onset to the peak for each epidemic over the entire study period were compiled from each time series; these historical records formed a database of time-to-peak for each strain or all strains combined (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). For each time series, a weekly forecast was generated when ILI+ of the week exceeded the baseline (same as defined above), by randomly drawing a time-to-peak record from the corresponding database. A prediction was deemed accurate if the predicted peak was within ±1 week of observation. One hundred random forecasts were sampled for each week of each time series. Forecast accuracy was tallied over all samples and compared to the filter methods.
