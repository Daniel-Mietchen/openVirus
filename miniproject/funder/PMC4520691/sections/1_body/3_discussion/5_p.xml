<p>For this study we opted to use a simple SIR model. This model is a gross simplification of actual transmission dynamics in a population. When used in conjunction with the filter, however, the filtering process, through recursive optimization, partially compensates for model misspecification. As our understanding of influenza transmission dynamics in subtropical and tropical regions improves in the future, more mechanistic and detailed models could be used in conjunction with the filters. For instance, epidemic models that account for the cross-immunity due to prior infections from related strains, age-structured models that account for varying transmission dynamics among age groups, or network models that account for spatial connectivity among sub-regions, could be applied. These more complicated model-filter systems could further improve the forecast performance. Future study will also investigate methods to improve forecast accuracy for onset timing and epidemic duration, both of which are important for public health planning.</p>
