<p>In our previous work, we focused on forecasting peak timing, i.e., the week with maximum influenza incidence [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here we have expanded the forecast effort to include peak magnitude, onset, and duration. Neither forecast system was able to predict the onset or duration well in advance; however, accuracy predicting outbreak peak magnitude was comparable to that for peak timing. For instance, the SIR-PF system was able to forecast the peak magnitude within 20% of observation with an average accuracy of 37% at 1–3 wk lead and 50% at 0 lead. Further, forecast accuracy increased steadily as ensemble spread decreased: up to 45% for H1N1, 89% for H3N2, and 68% for Type B at 1–3 wk leads (

 <sup>st</sup> row). This finding suggests that the forecasts provide lead times adequate for the planning of intervention measures. In addition, the forecasts of peak magnitude can be used to inform the scale of response. For instance, the amounts of antivirals and vaccines needed could be assessed based on the predicted peak magnitude.
