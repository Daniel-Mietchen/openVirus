<p>In addition to forecast of aggregate incidence time series for all circulating strains, we have also generated forecasts for individual strains, i.e., H1N1 (including both seasonal H1N1 and the 2009 pandemic H1N1), H3N2, and Type B. Forecasts for the individual strains were in general more accurate than those generated for the aggregate epidemics (
