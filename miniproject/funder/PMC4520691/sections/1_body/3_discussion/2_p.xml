<p>Our findings suggest that to forecast such complex epidemics, the system needs to be sensitive all year round (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>, multiple epidemics within a year due to different circulating strains/subtypes) yet not generate false alarms for individual strains that are not circulating during some years (e.g., 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, H1N1 during 2002â€“2004). Although both the EAKF and PF have proven capable of forecasting influenza epidemics in U.S. cities, additional methods are needed to generate the forecasts for Hong Kong. Specifically, the space reprobing (SR) technique [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] is critical for the SIR-PF system, while adaptive covariance inflation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and re-initialization are critical for the SIR-EAKF system. Using these new algorithms, we are able to forecast non-seasonal epidemics with accuracy near that of U.S. forecasts, despite the more varied epidemic dynamics of Hong Kong.
