<p>In previous work, we developed forecast systems for influenza, which have demonstrated predictive skill when applied to U.S. cities [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These studies suggest operational forecasts can be achieved and have motivated the generation of real-time influenza forecasts [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, unlike the regular seasonal epidemics in temperate regions such as the U.S., epidemics in subtropical and tropical regions are highly irregular [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The Hong Kong influenza incidence time series, for instance, create challenges not seen in seasonal epidemics. Previous studies have developed systems capable of detecting aberrations of flu activity, e.g., the onset of flu season, in subtropical cities including Hong Kong and Shenzhen [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Forecasts of other milestones of influenza epidemics (e.g., peak timing) or intensity, however, have not been performed in subtropical and tropical regions, except for the 2009 pandemic [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004383.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Here we built and tested forecast systems designed to handle the irregular influenza epidemics of the subtropics and tropics. We applied these systems to forecast influenza epidemics in Hong Kong from January 1998 through December 2013, including the 2009 pandemic.
