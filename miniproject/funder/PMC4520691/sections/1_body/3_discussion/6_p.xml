<p>In conclusion, we have developed the first prediction systems able to forecast the course of both inter-pandemic and pandemic influenza epidemics in a subtropical locale. These systems can be applied to currently circulating influenza A subtypes and influenza B, as well as aggregate epidemics due to any combination of these influenza strains. The forecast systems are able to predict the peak timing and peak magnitude at least 3 weeks before the predicted peak, with increased accuracy as the ensemble spread decreases.</p>
