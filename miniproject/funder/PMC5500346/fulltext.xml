The laboratory and in-clinic performance of a BGM system before and after disinfection should be demonstrated to guarantee accurate readings and reliable control of blood glucose (BG) for patients. In this study, an effective disinfection procedure, conducting wiping 10 times to assure a one minute contact time of the disinfectant on contaminated surface, was first demonstrated using test samples of the meter housing materials, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polycarbonate (PC), in accordance with ISO 15197:2013. After bench studies comprising 10,000 disinfection cycles, the elemental compositions of the disinfected ABS, PMMA, and PC samples were almost the same as in the original samples, as indicated by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Subsequently, the validated disinfection procedure was then directly applied to disinfect 5 commercial BGM systems composed of ABS, PMMA, or PC to observe the effect of the validated disinfection procedure on meter accuracy. The results of HBsAg values after treatment with HBV sera and disinfectant wipes for each material were less than the LoD of each material of 0.020 IU/mL. Before and after the multiple disinfection cycles, 900 of 900 samples (100%) were within the system accuracy requirements of ISO 15197:2013. All of the systems showed high performance before and after the series of disinfection cycles and met the ISO 15197:2013 requirements. In addition, our results demonstrated multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles that represented normal use over the lifetime of a meter of 3&#x02013;5 years. Our validated cleaning and disinfection procedure can be directly applied to other registered disinfectants for cleaning commercial BGM products in the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSC 102-2221-E-005-005-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5169-0361</contrib-id><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Shu-Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 105-2221-E-005-009-</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5169-0361</contrib-id><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Shu-Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Biotest Medical Corp.</institution></funding-source><award-id>105DA198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5169-0361</contrib-id><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Shu-Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan under grant numbers NSC 102-2221-E-005-005-MY3 and MOST 105-2221-E-005-009-.

It is strongly recommended that a BGM should not be shared and the user should perform a self-measurement using a personal lancing device and BGM. If this is not possible, a BGM should be properly cleaned and disinfected after every use according to the manufacturer's instructions. To mitigate the risk of the transmission of blood-borne pathogens, the manufacturer should specify an effective procedure for multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles that accommodates normal use over the lifetime of the BGM, which is normally considered to be 3&#x02013;5 years [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, a risk that an inappropriate cleaning and disinfection procedure could lead to inaccurate readings by BGMs exists, which would make it difficult to decide upon a treatment for a patient. According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 15197:2013 [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], manufacturers that submit a new or amended medical device license application for a BGM and/or a lancing device must include evidence of the effectiveness of the cleaning and disinfection procedure, the robustness of the device to withstand disinfection over its anticipated life cycle, labeling information about its precision, linearity, hematocrit, and its performance at different temperatures, humidities and altitudes.</p><p>After the adequate performance of a BGM is certified by a regulatory agency, studies have found that the performance of a disinfected BGM did not match the level of performance required by the regulatory agencies for the initial clearance. BGMs are regulated for accuracy to minimize errors [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] because information from these devices is used to make treatment decisions. However, erroneous readings can lead to incorrect treatments, which in turn can lead to excessively low blood glucose values and hypoglycemic episodes or alternatively, to inadequate lowering of blood glucose levels. Such deterioration of BGM performance could be due to an inappropriate and inadequate cleaning and disinfection procedure and the adverse effects of disinfectants [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, most BGM systems are composed of medical thermoplastic materials including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), or polycarbonate (PC) [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because some common disinfectants have been demonstrated to damage the plastic components of some meters, leading to screen failure and the breakdown of rubber control keys [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a BGM should be designed to be robust and reliable to accommodate actual use conditions [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, point-of-care healthcare settings should implement an effective disinfection procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions for users to follow, thereby ensuring safety and efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A standard set of <italic>in vitro</italic> disinfecting approaches for evaluating the performance of commercialized BGMs under controlled conditions can facilitate clinical translation and ensure the adequate control of a patient&#x02019;s blood sugar level.</p><p>ISO 15197:2013 is one of the most widely accepted standards for the assessment of the accuracy of a BGM system [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In ISO 15197:2013, system accuracy is stringently defined as the closeness of agreement between a measurement result and an accepted reference value determined by the manufacturer&#x02019;s measurement procedure. According to this regulation, at least 95% of the system measurement results must fall within &#x000b1;15 mg/dL of the results of the manufacturer&#x02019;s measurement procedure at BG concentrations &#x0003c;100 mg/dL and within &#x000b1;15% at BG concentrations of &#x02265;100 mg/dL. Recently, the performance of newly approved BGM systems have been based on ISO 15197:2013 and verified by the device manufacturers. In addition, mandatory compliance is recommended after a 36-month transition period. Although the accuracy of a BGM system was strictly regulated in ISO 15197:2013, the physical or chemical deterioration of composed plastic components of BGM is lack of systematical and thorough investigation.</p><p>While the accuracy and reliability of subsequent generations of sensors have improved over the years, proper and clear instructions to clean BGMs can improve the reliability of readings so appropriate treatment decisions can be made [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Doctors and other healthcare providers must remind patients about how the disinfection effectiveness might affect the performance of commercially available BGM systems. In this study, the performance of 5 BGM systems was independently characterized in accordance with the accuracy criteria in ISO 15197:2013. The measurement quality of 5 BGM systems was compared in a standardized manner under controlled laboratory conditions and in practical use. A validation study with respect to HBV was systematically performed to evaluate the disinfection efficacy and system accuracy of 5 BGMs before and after disinfection according to the requirements in ISO 15197:2013.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The validation of the cleaning and disinfection procedure and the clinical study of the accuracy of 5 BGMs before and after disinfection were performed between March 2014 and April 2016. The cleaning and disinfection procedure and the study of meter accuracy after cleaning and disinfection procedure in clinic were approved by the Jen-Ai Hospital Ethics Committees (IRB No. 98&#x02013;02 and IRB NO. 102&#x02013;07), and the appropriate authorities were notified.

followed the virus disinfection test method published by the FDA [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The disinfection effectiveness was determined by the limit of detection (LoD) of HBV for testing according to the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) EP17-A2, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The LoD of the Abbott ARCHITECT system HBsAg assay was 0.020 IU/mL. The minimum HBV DNA in a serum sample must be approximately 10<sup>7</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>8</sup> IU/mL; otherwise, the serum sample containing HBV could not be used as an inoculum source in the tests. The clinical HBsAg positive sera were obtained from venous blood samples from a chronically HBV-infected individual and used in this test. The initial serum concentration of the virus was 7.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> IU/mL. After a 10<sup>4</sup> dilution, the HBsAg values were 80.0 &#x000b1; 1.23 IU/mL, and the stock concentration of HBV DNA in sera used in this study was (80.0 &#x000b1; 1.23) &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> IU/mL. The three principal materials of 5 BGMs, including ABS, PMMA, and PC, were tested in this study. The samples cut from test articles were placed firmly on the bench of the BSC to inoculate with 10 &#x003bc;L of control or HBsAg positive sera, and then wiped with disinfectant wipes. The positive control samples were inoculated with 10 &#x003bc;L HBV-serum with a viral activity of 80.0 &#x000b1; 1.23 IU/mL. The negative control samples were inoculated with 10 &#x003bc;L phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the other samples were inoculated with clinical sera containing various concentrations of HBV, e.g., 80.0 &#x000b1; 1.23, 8.1 &#x000b1; 0.15, 0.8 &#x000b1; 0.03, and 0.08 &#x000b1; 0.004 IU/mL, respectively. All samples were incubated until the serum was thoroughly dried. The samples were vortexed with 990 &#x003bc;L PBS and the eluent was collected for HBsAg detection by Abbott ARCHITECT HBsAg. The viral residue of HBV on the samples of test articles was evaluated by a chemiluminescence immunoassay after inoculation and disinfection.</p><p>A complete wiping treatment included conducting wiping 10 times to assure a one minute contact time of the disinfectant as stipulated on the label of the disinfectant wipes. The treated samples were exposed to air and immediately allowed to dry, then placed in a tube containing 990 &#x003bc;L PBS. The tubes were vortexed for 3 minutes and 990 &#x003bc;L of the eluent in each tube were collected for HBsAg detection. HBsAg detection of the eluent from each test group was performed in duplicate for each serum. The HBsAg level of the eluent from each test sample should be less than 0.020 IU/mL according to a study on determination of LoD of Abbott ARCHITECT HBsAg assay system. The HBV disinfection efficacy validation study was later used to develop and implement an effective disinfection procedure for cleaning the 5 BGMs used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Robustness of BGM after multiple disinfection cycles</title><p>The samples cut from the 5 BGM were also used to demonstrate that BGMs were robust to multiple disinfection cycles according to the effective disinfection procedure defined in this study. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) was applied to analyze the elemental composition in the untreated and disinfected samples. The ESCA spectra were acquired with a Microlab 310F (Thermo VG Scientific, East Grinstead, UK) and non-monochromatic magnesium anode X-ray at 400 W, 15 kV, and 10 mA (K&#x003b1; 1253.6 eV, a concentric hemispherical capacitor analyzer). In the quantitative determination of the elemental compositions, the C 1s and O 1s core level spectra were measured and calculated from the ESCA peak area with the use of correction algorithms and relative sensitivity factors [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Three meters of each BGM model were used to test the system accuracy before and after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles. The systems were stored, used, and maintained in compliance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s label. To ensure the proper function of each system, control measurements were performed daily according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s labeling prior to the test procedure. The test procedure was performed by clinical personnel well trained on the limitations of the tested systems, the manufacturer&#x02019;s label requirements, safety practices, and the test procedure. The test procedure was carried out in a laboratory setting at controlled room temperature (23 &#x000b1; 5&#x000b0;C) and humidity. Each participant washed their hands with soap and water and dried them before the finger puncture and the measurement procedure were performed. The hematocrit value of each blood sample was determined to be within 32% and 56% (based on the lowest value indicated on the manufacturer&#x02019;s label).

ISO 15197:2013 categorizes the blood samples into different BG concentration categories [<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The following distribution of concentration categories was used: 5% &#x02264;50 mg/dL; 15% between &#x0003e;50 and 80 mg/dL; 20% between &#x0003e;80 and 120 mg/dL; 30% between &#x0003e;120 and 200 mg/dL; 15% between &#x0003e;200 and 300 mg/dL; 10% between &#x0003e;300 and 400 mg/dL; and 5% &#x0003e;400 mg/dL. Ten blood donors were recruited for the accuracy test. Venous blood samples were taken from each donor in lithium heparin tubes. The blood samples were divided into at least ten portions, and then spiked or glycolyzed to adequately span of the measurement range (20&#x02013;600 mg/dL) to meet the requirements specified in ISO 15197:2013. Three hundred blood samples were then measured with a single test strip lot for each meter. A total of 900 samples were tested for the validation of system accuracy after multiple disinfection cycles. BG measurements were performed with five systems (three meters per system, respectively). The system accuracy of the test method was compared with the reference method, as determined by a Yellow Springs Instrument (Model YSI 2300, YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH). Both methods used for comparison provided BG values in mg/dL. Samples were assigned to a category according to the mean BG result. Residual blood was wiped off before a measurement was made and before sample collection for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Data analyses</title><p>The system accuracy was assessed by comparing the system measurement results with the respective mean determined by the comparison measurement, which was obtained immediately before and after the measurements made with the system.

The possible transmission of Ebola virus associated with the visible or invisible dried blood should be taken into account.

However, the contact time of effective disinfection on the BGM need to be further investigated.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0180617.t004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0180617.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Characteristics of blood-borne modern epidemics and their EPA-registered disinfectants.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0180617.t004g" xlink:href="pone.0180617.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Virus</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Classification</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Global infection/ annual death <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t004fn001"><sup>a</sup></xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transmission route <sup>a</sup></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survival in dried blood</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stability in dried blood</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EPA-registered disinfectants <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t004fn002"><sup>b</sup></xref></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ref.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBV</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DNA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>/ 6.9&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood, body fluids</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 d</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">List D, List E</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.7&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>/ 2.1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood, body fluids</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low quantities</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Several hours~ 14 d</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">List C, List D, List E</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HCV</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>/ 7&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 d</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">List F</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ebola</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.9&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>/ 1.1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Blood, body fluids</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 d</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">List L</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">[<xref rid="pone.0180617.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t004fn001"><p><sup>a</sup> Numbers are based on data published from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p></fn><fn id="t004fn002"><p><sup>b</sup> Information is based on data published from the EPA official website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants">https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/selected-epa-registered-disinfectants</ext-link>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedure could lead to accurate readings by BGMs exists and improve the safety of patients with diabetes. Despite measures to reduce disease transmission, a risk can occur when BGMs are used on multiple individuals or by caregivers assisting a patient. The laboratory and in-clinic performance of a BGM system before and after disinfection was demonstrated in this study to guarantee accurate readings and reliable control of BG for patients. We formulated a standard cleaning and disinfection procedure and evaluated system accuracy for the Solison/5131, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 systems. All samples as well as the BGM systems showed that the cleaning and disinfection procedure was effective against HBV and did not cause any physical and chemical deterioration in the appearance of those materials. After multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles, the analytical performance of the 5 BGMs was well within the system accuracy requirement as prescribed by ISO 15197:2013. Our thorough and complete investigation demonstrated that adequate cleaning and disinfection procedures can remove HBV and maintain the accuracy of BGMs. Therefore, our validated cleaning and disinfection procedure with other EPA-registered disinfectants can be directly applied to commercial BGM products in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec011"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 5131 before disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 5131 after disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 5149 before disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s003.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 5149 after disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s004.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s005"><label>S5 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 5228 before disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s005.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s006"><label>S6 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 5228 after disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s006.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s007"><label>S7 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 6228 before disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s007.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s008"><label>S8 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 6228 after disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s008.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s009"><label>S9 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 6277 before disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s009.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0180617.s010"><label>S10 File</label><caption><title>Raw data and statistic analyses of model 6277 after disinfection.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0180617.s010.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Biotest Medical Corp. for providing the research materials of 5 blood glucose meters, including Solison/5131, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0180617.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>ND</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Perz</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name>. <article-title>Eliminating the Blood: Ongoing Outbreaks of Hepatitis B Virus Infection and the Need for Innovative Glucose Monitoring Technologies</article-title>. <source>J Diabetes Sci Technol</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>3</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>283</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>288</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1177/193229680900300208">10.1177/193229680900300208</ext-link></comment>
