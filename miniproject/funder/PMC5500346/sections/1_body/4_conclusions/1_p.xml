<p>An appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedure could lead to accurate readings by BGMs exists and improve the safety of patients with diabetes. Despite measures to reduce disease transmission, a risk can occur when BGMs are used on multiple individuals or by caregivers assisting a patient. The laboratory and in-clinic performance of a BGM system before and after disinfection was demonstrated in this study to guarantee accurate readings and reliable control of BG for patients. We formulated a standard cleaning and disinfection procedure and evaluated system accuracy for the Solison/5131, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 systems. All samples as well as the BGM systems showed that the cleaning and disinfection procedure was effective against HBV and did not cause any physical and chemical deterioration in the appearance of those materials. After multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles, the analytical performance of the 5 BGMs was well within the system accuracy requirement as prescribed by ISO 15197:2013. Our thorough and complete investigation demonstrated that adequate cleaning and disinfection procedures can remove HBV and maintain the accuracy of BGMs. Therefore, our validated cleaning and disinfection procedure with other EPA-registered disinfectants can be directly applied to commercial BGM products in the future.</p>
