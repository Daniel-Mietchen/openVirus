<p>ISO 15197:2013 is one of the most widely accepted standards for the assessment of the accuracy of a BGM system [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In ISO 15197:2013, system accuracy is stringently defined as the closeness of agreement between a measurement result and an accepted reference value determined by the manufacturer’s measurement procedure. According to this regulation, at least 95% of the system measurement results must fall within ±15 mg/dL of the results of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at BG concentrations &lt;100 mg/dL and within ±15% at BG concentrations of ≥100 mg/dL. Recently, the performance of newly approved BGM systems have been based on ISO 15197:2013 and verified by the device manufacturers. In addition, mandatory compliance is recommended after a 36-month transition period. Although the accuracy of a BGM system was strictly regulated in ISO 15197:2013, the physical or chemical deterioration of composed plastic components of BGM is lack of systematical and thorough investigation.
