Doctors and other healthcare providers must remind patients about how the disinfection effectiveness might affect the performance of commercially available BGM systems. In this study, the performance of 5 BGM systems was independently characterized in accordance with the accuracy criteria in ISO 15197:2013. The measurement quality of 5 BGM systems was compared in a standardized manner under controlled laboratory conditions and in practical use. A validation study with respect to HBV was systematically performed to evaluate the disinfection efficacy and system accuracy of 5 BGMs before and after disinfection according to the requirements in ISO 15197:2013.
