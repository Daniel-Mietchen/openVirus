<p>After the adequate performance of a BGM is certified by a regulatory agency, studies have found that the performance of a disinfected BGM did not match the level of performance required by the regulatory agencies for the initial clearance. BGMs are regulated for accuracy to minimize errors [

 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] because information from these devices is used to make treatment decisions. However, erroneous readings can lead to incorrect treatments, which in turn can lead to excessively low blood glucose values and hypoglycemic episodes or alternatively, to inadequate lowering of blood glucose levels. Such deterioration of BGM performance could be due to an inappropriate and inadequate cleaning and disinfection procedure and the adverse effects of disinfectants [

 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, most BGM systems are composed of medical thermoplastic materials including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), or polycarbonate (PC) [

 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a BGM should be designed to be robust and reliable to accommodate actual use conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, point-of-care healthcare settings should implement an effective disinfection procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions for users to follow, thereby ensuring safety and efficacy [
