<p>Incidents of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission attributed to contaminated blood glucose meters (BGMs) have been reported [

 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is strongly recommended that a BGM should not be shared and the user should perform a self-measurement using a personal lancing device and BGM. If this is not possible, a BGM should be properly cleaned and disinfected after every use according to the manufacturer's instructions. To mitigate the risk of the transmission of blood-borne pathogens, the manufacturer should specify an effective procedure for multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles that accommodates normal use over the lifetime of the BGM, which is normally considered to be 3–5 years [

In addition, a risk that an inappropriate cleaning and disinfection procedure could lead to inaccurate readings by BGMs exists, which would make it difficult to decide upon a treatment for a patient. According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 15197:2013 [
