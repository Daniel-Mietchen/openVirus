<p>The virus disinfection test procedure recommended by the FDA [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the Abbott ARCHITECT system was successfully employed to evaluate the anti-viral residue of HBV on specific parts of the test articles in this study. The acceptance criteria for the cleaning and disinfection procedure include the infectious viral activity and deterioration of the BGMs [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. All of the detection results were less than the LoD of each material of 0.020 IU/mL in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180617.t002">Table 2</xref>. By the same token, the disinfection procedure was effective against HBV without causing physical and chemical deterioration in the appearance of the samples after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles in
