 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, there is a lack of studies that considered the effects of cleaning and disinfection procedures on the accuracy and performance of BGMs. Inappropriate viral disinfectants may efficiently remove a contaminating infectious virus but cause the deterioration of the accuracy and damage the appearance of a BGM [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our thorough and complete investigation indicates that adequate cleaning and disinfection procedures can remove infectious virus while maintaining the accuracy of a BGM. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180617.t003">Table 3</xref> shows that the statistical results for the 5 systems after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles were carried out are comparable to those before multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles. The accuracy results for the 5 BGMs before and after disinfection are well within the system accuracy requirement as prescribed by ISO 15197:2013 [

 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Based on our results within the required accuracy limits, the performance of 5 meters is not affected by multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles. The 5 evaluated systems before and after multiple cleaning disinfection cycles showed 100% of the measurement results were within the required accuracy limits. According to ISO 15197:2013 with a BG concentration threshold of 100 mg/dL (instead of 75 mg/dL as described in the ISO 15197:2003 standard [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), the accuracy limit of 100 mg/dL is more stringent. In this study, before and after disinfection, all 5 systems showed 100% of the system measurement results within ±15 mg/dL of the results of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at BG concentrations of &lt;100 mg/dL and within ±15% at BG concentrations of ≥100 mg/dL (
