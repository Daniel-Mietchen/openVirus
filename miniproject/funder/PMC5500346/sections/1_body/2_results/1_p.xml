<p>The cleaning and disinfection efficacy procedure in this study was used to verify the disinfection efficacy of the 5 BGM systems, the Solison/5131, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277. The cleaning and disinfection efficacy was determined by a LoD of HBV using the Abbott ARCHITECT HBsAg assay system. First, sera containing HBV were obtained from venous blood samples. The samples from the 5 BGM systems were then inoculated with the sera and cleaned using disinfectant wipes for 1 minute. The respective spectra of ESCA survey of ABS, PMMA, and PC in Figs

The C 1s were determined as approximately 92% before and after multiple disinfection cycles of the ABS samples. The principal peak areas of the C 1s and the O 1s in PMMA samples were approximately 75% and 25% before and after multiple disinfection cycles, respectively. On the other hand, the areas of the primary peaks of C 1s and O 1s in the PC samples were approximately 79% and 21% before and after multiple disinfection cycles, respectively. Briefly, the results of the quantitative elemental compositions of the tested samples were approximately the same before and after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles, as shown in
