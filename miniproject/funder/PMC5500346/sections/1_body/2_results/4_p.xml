<p>Before disinfection, all 5 systems evaluated fulfilled the accuracy requirements specified by ISO 15197:2013 with at least 95% of the system measurement results within ±15 mg/dL of the results of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at BG concentrations &lt;100 mg/dL and within ±15% at BG concentrations ≥100 mg/dL (in

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180617.t003">Table 3</xref>). The accuracy results for the Solison/5131 system showed 207 of 207 hypoglycemic samples were within ±15 mg/dL at a glucose concertation &lt;100 mg/dL and 693 of the 693 samples with a glucose concentration of ≥100 mg/dL were within ±15% of the reference values. In the same manner, the accuracy results for the Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 systems independently showed 216 of 216, 198 of 198, 225 of225, and 225 of 225 hypoglycemic samples, respectively, within ±15 mg/dL at a glucose concertation &lt;100 mg/dL. In addition, the Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 systems independently showed that 684 of 684, 702 of 702, 675 of 675, and 675 of 675 samples at glucose concentrations of ≥100 mg/dL were within ±15% of the reference values, respectively. Therefore, 900 of 900 samples (100%) were within the system accuracy requirements of ISO 15197:2013.
