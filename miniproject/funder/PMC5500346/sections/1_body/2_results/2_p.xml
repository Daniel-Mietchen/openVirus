<p>The results of cleaning and disinfection of HBV for ABS, PMMA and PC for the disinfection efficacy of the BGM systems are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180617.t002">Table 2</xref>. HBsAg detection of the eluent from each test sample had to be less than 0.020 IU/mL per the study results of the LoD determination by the Abbott ARCHITECT HBsAg assay system. HBsAg could be detected at approximately 80 IU/mL in direct virus control after inoculation with 10 Î¼L of donor serum, and no differences among the test articles were observed. Negative control (blank) data (PBS inoculation) did not show that any contamination occurred during our procedures. The HBsAg value after treatment with serum and disinfectant wipes for each material from one site were not greater than 0.018 IU/mL.
