<p>This study further determined the system accuracy and measurement reproducibility for 5 BGM systems after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles with a standardized procedure over a clinically relevant BG concentration range. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180617.t003">Table 3</xref> lists detailed results of 5 tested BGMs before and after disinfection, the assessment of system accuracy of 5 BGMs was assessed according to ISO 15197:2013. The raw data and detailed results of least squares linear regression of 5 BGMs for each meter system before and after disinfection were respectively shown in Supporting Information (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180617.s010">S10</xref> Files). The minimum system accuracy requirements of this standard were fulfilled with the three test strip lots that were evaluated. The system accuracy was assessed by comparing of the system measurement results with the mean results of a comparison measurement. All of the system accuracy results before and after disinfection were obtained from 3 replicate meters for each of the 5 BGM systems and compared with the values generated by reference YSI method.
