 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180617.t003">Table 3</xref> show the accuracy of system measurement results after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles within ±15 mg/dL of the results of the manufacturer’s measurement procedure at BG concentrations &lt;100 mg/dL and within ±15% at BG concentrations ≥100 mg/dL. The accuracy results for the Solison/5131 system, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 systems independently showed 216 of 216, 225 of 225, 252 of 252, 234 of 234, and 234 of 234 hypoglycemic samples were within ±15 mg/dL at a glucose concentration &lt;100 mg/dL, respectively. In addition, the Solison/5131 system, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 systems independently showed 684 of 684, 675 of 675, 648 of 648, 666 of 666, 666 of 666 samples at glucose concentrations of ≥100 mg/dL were within ±15% of the reference values, respectively. Therefore, 900 of 900 samples (100%) were within the system accuracy requirements of ISO 15197:2013.
