<p>Measurements were performed on three lots of test strips and three meters for each system. ISO 15197:2013 categorizes the blood samples into different BG concentration categories [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The following distribution of concentration categories was used: 5% ≤50 mg/dL; 15% between &gt;50 and 80 mg/dL; 20% between &gt;80 and 120 mg/dL; 30% between &gt;120 and 200 mg/dL; 15% between &gt;200 and 300 mg/dL; 10% between &gt;300 and 400 mg/dL; and 5% &gt;400 mg/dL. Ten blood donors were recruited for the accuracy test. Venous blood samples were taken from each donor in lithium heparin tubes. The blood samples were divided into at least ten portions, and then spiked or glycolyzed to adequately span of the measurement range (20–600 mg/dL) to meet the requirements specified in ISO 15197:2013. Three hundred blood samples were then measured with a single test strip lot for each meter. A total of 900 samples were tested for the validation of system accuracy after multiple disinfection cycles. BG measurements were performed with five systems (three meters per system, respectively). The system accuracy of the test method was compared with the reference method, as determined by a Yellow Springs Instrument (Model YSI 2300, YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH). Both methods used for comparison provided BG values in mg/dL. Samples were assigned to a category according to the mean BG result. Residual blood was wiped off before a measurement was made and before sample collection for comparison.
