<p>Five models of BGM systems were selected to assess the minimum accuracy performance of the system after a series of repeated disinfection processes defined in this study according to ISO 15197:2013, Section 6.3.3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Three meters of each BGM model were used to test the system accuracy before and after multiple cleaning and disinfection cycles. The systems were stored, used, and maintained in compliance with the manufacturer’s label. To ensure the proper function of each system, control measurements were performed daily according to the manufacturer’s labeling prior to the test procedure. The test procedure was performed by clinical personnel well trained on the limitations of the tested systems, the manufacturer’s label requirements, safety practices, and the test procedure. The test procedure was carried out in a laboratory setting at controlled room temperature (23 ± 5°C) and humidity. Each participant washed their hands with soap and water and dried them before the finger puncture and the measurement procedure were performed. The hematocrit value of each blood sample was determined to be within 32% and 56% (based on the lowest value indicated on the manufacturer’s label). Detailed information for the 5 systems evaluated in this study was listed in
