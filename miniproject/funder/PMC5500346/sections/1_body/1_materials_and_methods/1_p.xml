<p>The validation of the cleaning and disinfection procedure and the clinical study of the accuracy of 5 BGMs before and after disinfection were performed between March 2014 and April 2016. The cleaning and disinfection procedure and the study of meter accuracy after cleaning and disinfection procedure in clinic were approved by the Jen-Ai Hospital Ethics Committees (IRB No. 98–02 and IRB NO. 102–07), and the appropriate authorities were notified. Informed consent forms were signed by all participants prior to the implementation of the clinical study procedures. The BGM systems for self-testing in this study are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180617.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The Solison/5131, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 were provided by the Biotest Medical Corp., Taichung City, Taiwan. The Solison/5131, Super Check Plus/5149, Super Check Plus/5228, and Super Check 2/6277 were distributed by Apollo Medical Technologies Inc. and introduced to the UK market. The principal materials that composed the 5 BGMs were ABS, PMMA, and PC and were excised from 5 BGMs. The principal material samples and 5 BGMs were cleaned and disinfected using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered disinfectant wipes (Clorox® Germicidal Wipes manufactured by Clorox Co. (EPA registered No. 67619–12)). All the cleaning and disinfection procedures were carried out in a class II biosafety cabinet (BSC). The demonstrations of multiple cleaning and disinfection procedure for Solison/5131 and Super Check Plus/5149 were bench tested in the laboratory; whereas, the Super Check Plus/5228, Super Check/6228, and Super Check 2/6277 were demonstrated in clinic. All the components and ingredients of test strips used in this study were the same except different lots (listed in
