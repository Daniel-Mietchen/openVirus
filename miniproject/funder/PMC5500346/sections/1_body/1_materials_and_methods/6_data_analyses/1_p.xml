<p>The system accuracy was assessed by comparing the system measurement results with the respective mean determined by the comparison measurement, which was obtained immediately before and after the measurements made with the system. At BG concentrations &lt;100 mg/dL, the relative number of system results within ±15 mg/dL, ±10 mg/dL, and ±5 mg/dL of the comparison measurement were calculated. At BG concentrations ≥100 mg/dL, the relative number of system results within ±15%, ±10%, and ±5% of the comparison measurement were calculated. Acceptability of a system was determined by adding the number of system results within ±15 mg/dL at BG concentrations &lt;100 mg/dL to the number of system results within ±15% at BG concentrations ≥100 mg/dL. The agreement between each system and the mean comparison result was plotted as a difference-plot as recommended in ISO 15197:2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The difference-plot showed the deviation of a single BG system measurement from the respective mean comparison measurement.
