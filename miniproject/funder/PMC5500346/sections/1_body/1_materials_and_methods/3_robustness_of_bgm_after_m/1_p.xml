<p>The samples cut from the 5 BGM were also used to demonstrate that BGMs were robust to multiple disinfection cycles according to the effective disinfection procedure defined in this study. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) was applied to analyze the elemental composition in the untreated and disinfected samples. The ESCA spectra were acquired with a Microlab 310F (Thermo VG Scientific, East Grinstead, UK) and non-monochromatic magnesium anode X-ray at 400 W, 15 kV, and 10 mA (KÎ± 1253.6 eV, a concentric hemispherical capacitor analyzer). In the quantitative determination of the elemental compositions, the C 1s and O 1s core level spectra were measured and calculated from the ESCA peak area with the use of correction algorithms and relative sensitivity factors [
