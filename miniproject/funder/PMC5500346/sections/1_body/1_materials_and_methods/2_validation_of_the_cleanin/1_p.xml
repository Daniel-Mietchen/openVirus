<p>Experimental procedures followed the virus disinfection test method published by the FDA [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The disinfection effectiveness was determined by the limit of detection (LoD) of HBV for testing according to the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) EP17-A2, Protocols for Determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0180617.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The LoD of the Abbott ARCHITECT system HBsAg assay was 0.020 IU/mL. The minimum HBV DNA in a serum sample must be approximately 10
 <sup>7</sup>–10
 <sup>8</sup> IU/mL; otherwise, the serum sample containing HBV could not be used as an inoculum source in the tests. The clinical HBsAg positive sera were obtained from venous blood samples from a chronically HBV-infected individual and used in this test. The initial serum concentration of the virus was 7.5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> IU/mL. After a 10
 <sup>4</sup> dilution, the HBsAg values were 80.0 ± 1.23 IU/mL, and the stock concentration of HBV DNA in sera used in this study was (80.0 ± 1.23) × 10
 <sup>4</sup> IU/mL. The three principal materials of 5 BGMs, including ABS, PMMA, and PC, were tested in this study. The samples cut from test articles were placed firmly on the bench of the BSC to inoculate with 10 μL of control or HBsAg positive sera, and then wiped with disinfectant wipes. The positive control samples were inoculated with 10 μL HBV-serum with a viral activity of 80.0 ± 1.23 IU/mL. The negative control samples were inoculated with 10 μL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the other samples were inoculated with clinical sera containing various concentrations of HBV, e.g., 80.0 ± 1.23, 8.1 ± 0.15, 0.8 ± 0.03, and 0.08 ± 0.004 IU/mL, respectively. All samples were incubated until the serum was thoroughly dried. The samples were vortexed with 990 μL PBS and the eluent was collected for HBsAg detection by Abbott ARCHITECT HBsAg. The viral residue of HBV on the samples of test articles was evaluated by a chemiluminescence immunoassay after inoculation and disinfection.
