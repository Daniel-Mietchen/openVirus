<p>A complete wiping treatment included conducting wiping 10 times to assure a one minute contact time of the disinfectant as stipulated on the label of the disinfectant wipes. The treated samples were exposed to air and immediately allowed to dry, then placed in a tube containing 990 μL PBS. The tubes were vortexed for 3 minutes and 990 μL of the eluent in each tube were collected for HBsAg detection. HBsAg detection of the eluent from each test group was performed in duplicate for each serum. The HBsAg level of the eluent from each test sample should be less than 0.020 IU/mL according to a study on determination of LoD of Abbott ARCHITECT HBsAg assay system. The HBV disinfection efficacy validation study was later used to develop and implement an effective disinfection procedure for cleaning the 5 BGMs used in this study.</p>
