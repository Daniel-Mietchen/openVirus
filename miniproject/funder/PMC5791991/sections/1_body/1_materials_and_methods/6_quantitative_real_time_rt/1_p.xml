<p>A549 cells were treated as aforementioned in “Antioxidant assay”. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol® Plus RNA purification kit (Invitrogen). DNA contamination in the total RNA was deleted with the addition of DNase I (Invitrogen). Total RNA was eluted in nuclease-free water and quantified spectrophotometrically at 260nm and 280nm. The qRT-PCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction mixtures containing forward and reverse primers (50 nM each), 1× SYBR green master mix (Invitrogen) and various templates. The results were presented in 2
 <sup>-ΔΔCt</sup>. The experiment was repeated five times and each experimental condition was performed in triplicate (n = 5). Primers were listed in
