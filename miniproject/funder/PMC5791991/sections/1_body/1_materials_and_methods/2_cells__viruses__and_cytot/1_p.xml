<p>Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and A549 lung cancer cells were cultured in DMEM medium and incubated in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. Virus stocks of IAV subtypes A/ShanTou/169/06 (ST169, H1N1) and A/PuertoRico/8/34 (PR8, H1N1) were prepared in MDCK cells. Virus titer was determined by a plaque formation assay [

 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The concentration of rhein required to lower cell viability by 50% (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using Origin 8.0 software. The highest concentration that did not show significant cytotoxicity was used as the test concentration
