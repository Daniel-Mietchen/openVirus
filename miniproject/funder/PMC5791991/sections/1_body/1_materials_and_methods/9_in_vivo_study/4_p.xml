<p>DMSO (0.5%), oseltamivir and rhein were given twice a day (at a 12-hour interval) for 6 days, starting 24 h after randomly grouping and before virus exposure. The body weights and survivals of ten mice in each group (n = 10) were monitored daily for 14 days after virus exposure. For humane endpoint, animals were immediately euthanized when their weights reduced 30% and displayed with obvious ruffled fur and reduced mobility. At day 6 p.i., another six mice in each group (n = 6) were euthanized. The lung index was assessed by determining the percent of lung wet weight (g) to body weight (g) (lung index = lung wet weight (g) ÷ body weight (g) × 100%). The collected lungs were further separated into two sets, right lungs were fixed in 10% formalin and left lungs were frozen at -80°C. To determine the viral load and cytokines in lungs, left lungs were homogenized in 1 ml of cold DMEM medium and the total protein levels were measured. Viral load and cytokines was determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay and ELISA assay, respectively. The unit was corrected according to the amount of total protein. To examine pathological changes, right lungs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm for haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, and examined at 200× and 400× magnifications. Each slide was assessed by two separate investigators in a blinded manner.
