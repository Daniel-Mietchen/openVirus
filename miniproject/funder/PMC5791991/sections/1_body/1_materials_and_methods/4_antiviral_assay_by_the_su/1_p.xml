<p>The stock solution of IAV was diluted with VGM medium in 10-fold serial dilutions, after incubation with MDCK cells for 48 h, the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated following the method of Reed and Muench. Antiviral activity of rhein was also evaluated by the SRB method using CPE reduction as previously reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Briefly, MDCK cells were seeded in 96-well plate. 0.09 mL of virus suspension (50× TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) and 0.01 mL VGM medium containing rhein (100 μg/mL) with or without different agonists were added. At 48 h, after washing, 100 μL -20°C 70% acetone was added. After removing acetone, the plates were dried and added 100 μL 0.4% (w/v) SRB. After 1h, the plates were washed, dried and added 100 μL 10 mM Tris-base solution. OD was read at 562nm. Three wells were used each for the negative (virus-infected non-drug-treated) and mock (non-infected non-drug-treated) controls. 0.5% DMSO was used in each group. The percent protection of rhein, which is positively related to the finally remained cell viability, was calculated as the following:
