<p>When the concentration of test compound was zero, it was the negative control (virus-infected non-drug-treated), and the results of all drug-treated groups were statistically compared with that of the negative control. Concentration of 50% protection was defined as EC
 <sub>50</sub>. Antiviral index (AI) was defined as CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>. The experiment was repeated five times and each experimental condition was performed in triplicate (n = 5).
