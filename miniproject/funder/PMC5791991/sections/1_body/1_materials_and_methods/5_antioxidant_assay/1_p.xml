<p>The production of reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined using commercially available kits (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Briefly, A549 cells were infected with IAV (ST169, MOI = 0.001) and treated with ribavirin (25 μg/mL) and rhein (10 μg/mL), respectively. After incubation 48 h, the cell lysates were gathered, the protein levels were measured, and after centrifuged at 1000g for 10min at -4°C, the supernatants of cell lysates were used in the antioxidant assays following the manufacturer’s protocol. A549 cells that not infected, or infected but not-treated with any drugs were used as the blank control and negative control, respectively. The experiment was repeated five times and each experimental condition was performed in triplicate (n = 5).</p>
