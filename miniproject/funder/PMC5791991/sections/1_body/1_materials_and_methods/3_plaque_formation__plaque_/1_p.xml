<p>The viral titers of the supernatants were determined by plaque formation assay as our previous report [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Plaque inhibition assay was also performed as previously reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, A549 cells were incubated with virus growth medium (VGM, DMEM containing 2.5 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin and 3.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) that contained IAV (MOI = 0.001) and different concentrations of rhein for 1 h, after washing with PBS 3 times, VGM medium with or without rhein was added. After 48 h, the supernatant was collected and the viral titer was determined by a plaque formation assay. The time-of-addition assay was performed as our previous report [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which contained four tests: (a) direct inactivation assay: before infection, IAV virion was incubated with a VGM medium containing rhein (10 μg/mL), after 3 h, IAV virion was gathered by ultra-filtration and washed with PBS 3 times, then was used to infect MDCK cells and the cells were further cultured for 12 h; (b) influence-on-cell assay: before infection, MDCK cells were incubated with VGM medium containing rhein (10 μg/mL), after 3 h, the cells were washed with PBS 3 times, infected with normal IAV and further cultured for 12 h; (c) influence-on-viral adsorption assay: during viral adsorption, rhein (10 μg/mL) was added, after adsorption for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS 3 times and cultured with normal VGM medium for 12 h; and (d) different-time-points post infection (p.i.) assay: after IAV infection, rhein (10 μg/mL) was added at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h p.i., respectively, then the cells were further cultured to 12 h p.i.. MOI = 2.0. At 12 h p.i., the supernatants were gathered and the viral titer was determined by a plaque formation assay. The experiment was repeated five times and each experimental condition was performed in triplicate (n = 5).
