<p>Western blotting assay was carried out as previously reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Proteins were extracted by using RIPA lysis buffer (Biocolor BioScience and Technology, China) according to the manufacturer’s directions. To detect NF-κB p65, nucleic protein was extracted. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Approximately 40 μg of protein extracts was separated by 8–12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, USA). After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, p-Akt, Akt, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, JNK, p-p38, p38, p65, lamin B1, and β-actin antibodies. Subsequently, a secondary horseradish peroxidase- conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat IgG antibody was applied, and then specific bands were visualized using the ECL detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific™, Cleveland, OH, USA). β-actin was used as a control for total proteins and lamin B1 was used as the control for nuclear proteins. Protein bands intensities were analyzed by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, USA). The experiment was repeated five times (n = 5).
