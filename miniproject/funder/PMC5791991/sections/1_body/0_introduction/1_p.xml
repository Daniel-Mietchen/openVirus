<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly transmissible respiratory pathogen that can cause seasonal flu epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics. During the 2009 pandemic (H1N1) in the USA, about 43–89 million people became ill, and approximate 8,870–18,300 people died due to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection [

Though vaccination is the best strategy to fight IAV infection, IAV vaccine production is currently still not satisfied due to the continuous evolution of IAV major antigens. In addition, classical anti-IAV drugs, such as M2 channel blockers (e.g. amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir and zanamivir), are limited in use by their side effects and the continual emergence of resistant viral strains. So, the development of novel anti-IAV drugs continues to be urgent [
