<p>Pathogenesis of influenza in humans is actually caused by a combination of viral direct damage and host immune injury. Excessive host immune response is harmful and often results in severe immunologic injury. Infection of highly pathogenic IAV usually causes substantial immunopathology and leads to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with substantial morbidity and mortality. It has been reported that IAV infection can lead to the activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. Lasting activation of TLR3 is proved to be harmful for IAV-induced acute pneumonia [
