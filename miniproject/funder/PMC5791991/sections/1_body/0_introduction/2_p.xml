<p>Phytotherapy has a long history in China, Korea, Japan, and India. In the past hundreds of years, traditional medicine has played an important role in fighting IAV infection. Now, research of antiviral drugs from herbs and other natural resources with traditionally long-confirmed effects is believed to be an efficient approach, which is expected to result in finding new and effective drugs. In our previous researches, we have set up several high-throughput screening (HTS) method and screened hundreds of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM), and found that the crude extract of rhubarb (
 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic> L.) possesses anti-IAV activity

 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In fact, Lin TJ 
 <italic>et al</italic> have also found that the ethanolic extract of rhubarb can inhibit IAV (H1N1) infection [

The major active ingredient of the crude extract of rhubarb is anthraquinone that includes several compounds, such as rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, physcion, and aloe-emodin. Among them, rhein is also extensively found in several other TCMs, such as 
 <italic>Aloe barbadensis</italic> Miller, 
 <italic>Cassia angustifolia</italic> Vahl., and 
 <italic>Polygonum multiflorum</italic> Thunb. Rhein has two hydroxide radicals and one carboxyl with very strong chemical polarity and is thought to possess high electrochemical oxidoreduction activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Now, it is well known that rhein has antioxidant, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, anti-fibrosis, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective activities [
