<p>Additionally, our result also shows that rhein can inhibit IAV adsorption. As for the mechanism, we have not investigated in the present study, and we speculate that the inhibition of rhein on viral adsorption may be through ① interfering IAV hemagglutinin that is an important protein of IAV for viral adsorption, or ② interfering lipid raft, which functions as a platform for formation of viral membrane fusion.</p>
