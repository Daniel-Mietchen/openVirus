 <italic>et al</italic> have reported that the crude extract of rhubarb (
 <italic>Rheum tanguticum</italic>) can reduce IAV yields at -3 to 9 h, -3 to -1 h, -1 to 0 h, 0 to 9 h, 3 to 9 h, and 6 to 9 h p.i., and concluded that the crude extract of rhubarb can inhibit IAV via a variety of different mechanisms, including direct inactivation (-3 to -1 h p.i.), inhibition of viral adsorption (-1 to 0 h), and interferences of viral transcription/replication (3 to 9 h p.i.) and release (6 to 9 h p.i.) [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our present study, we further investigate the effect of rhein, a major ingredient of rhubarb, and find that rhein can significantly inhibit IAV adsorption and replication, but cannot significantly inactivate IAV and has no significant influence on cells before infection.
