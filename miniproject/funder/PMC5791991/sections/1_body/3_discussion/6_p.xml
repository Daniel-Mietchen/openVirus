<p>In the present study, we have also investigated the counteracting effects of different agonists using two methods. One is the SRB method utilizing CPE reduction to determine the finally remained cell viability after IAV infection and drug treatments. The other method is the qRT-PCR assay to determine the transcription of IAV genome. In fact, the degree of virus-induced CPE is not completely determined by virus replication or virus titer, and drugs that can inhibit virus-induced CPE are uncertain to be able to inhibit viral transcription. In our study, we find that oxidant H

 <sub>2</sub> and agonists of TLR2, TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK, and IKK/NF-ÎºB can significantly antagonize the inhibition of rhein on IAV-induced CPE, but the qRT-PCR assay shows that TLR2 agonist cannot antagonize the effect of rhein on IAV transcription.
