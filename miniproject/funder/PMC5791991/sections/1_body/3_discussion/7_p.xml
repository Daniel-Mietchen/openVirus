<p>Finally, our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> test shows that rhein can significantly improve the survival rate of mice and lung histopathological changes, suppress the lung index and the production of lung inflammatory cytokines, and at the high dose, rhein can reduce pulmonary viral load. Similar researches have showed that rhein can prevent LPS-induced acute kidney injury by inhibiting NF-κB activities [
