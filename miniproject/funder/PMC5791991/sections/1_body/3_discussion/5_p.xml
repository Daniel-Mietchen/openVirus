<p>Excessive production of inflammatory cytokines is an essential pathogenic factor that leads to ALI and ARDS. Our study has showed that rhein can significantly reduce the expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α after IAV infection. Moreover, excessive production of MMPs, which can degrade collagen and other components of extracellular matrix, is also an essential pathogenic factor of ALI and ARDS. IAV infection can increase the expressions or activities of MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 [

In addition, it has been reported that activation of TLRs plays an important role in linking oxidative stress to inflammation [

So, we speculate that the inhibition of rhein on the production of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs may be due to the inhibition of rhein on IAV-induced activations of TLRs, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-κB pathways. In fact, rhein can inhibit the expressions of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 by suppressing the phosphorylation of ERK, p38, JNK MAPK and the transcription activities of NF-κB and AP-1 [
