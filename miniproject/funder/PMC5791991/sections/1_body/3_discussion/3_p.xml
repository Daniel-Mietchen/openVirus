<p>IAV infection can cause severe oxidative stress, and inhibition of oxidative stress is now believed to be a novel target for pharmacologic treatment of IAV infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It has been reported that GSH can decrease viral titer in both lung and trachea homogenates in BALB/c mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Recombinant human CAT, SOD and GSH-PX can reduce IAV-induced lung inflammation and IAV titer in lungs of mice [

 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Rhein possesses anti-oxidative activity and can significantly increase the viability of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-injured human umbilical vein endothelial cells with decreased MDA and LDH production and increased SOD and GSH-PX activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Rhein can decrease the expressions of NADPH oxidase subunits p22
 <sup>phox</sup> and gp91
 <sup>phox</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0191793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, we find that rhein can significantly decrease the production of MDA, NO, and ROS, increase the level of GSH and the activities of T-SOD, GR, CAT, and GSH-PX after IAV infection.
