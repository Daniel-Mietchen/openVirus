Now, traditional medicine has been getting more and more public attention and the research of new drugs from traditional medicines with long-confirmed effects may be an efficient strategy. Armed with this idea, we have previously screened many traditional herbal medicines and many compounds from herbal medicines have been identified to possess anti-IAV activity, but their mechanisms of action are not very well understood. In the present study, we have investigated the effect and mechanism of action of rhein against IAV infection.
