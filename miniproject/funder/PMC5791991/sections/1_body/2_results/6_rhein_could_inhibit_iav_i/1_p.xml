 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191793.g005">Fig 5</xref>, IAV infection (NC group) could significantly up-regulate the expressions of MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP13, and TIMP-1, comparing with the BC group. Rhein could significantly inhibit the mRNA transcriptions of MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, and MMP13, but not for the transcription of TIMP-1. At the protein level, rhein could significantly inhibit the production of MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9, but not for the production of MMP13 and TIMP-1, comparing with the NC group.
