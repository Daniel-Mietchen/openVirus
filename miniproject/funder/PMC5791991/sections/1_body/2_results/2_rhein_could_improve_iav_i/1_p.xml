 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191793.t001">Table 1</xref>, IAV infection (NC group) could significantly increase the production of MDA, NO, and ROS, significantly decrease the level of GSH, and inhibit the activities of T-SOD, GR, CAT, and GSH-PX, comparing with the BC group. Rhein could significantly decrease the concentration of MDA, NO, and ROS, increase the level of GSH, and up-regulate the activities of T-SOD, GR, CAT, and GSH-PX, comparing with the NC group. Ribavirin (25 Î¼g/mL) almost had no significant effect on IAV-induced oxidative stress.
