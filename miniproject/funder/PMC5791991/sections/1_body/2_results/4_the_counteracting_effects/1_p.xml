<p>As aforementioned, rhein could significantly decrease IAV-induced activations of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-κB pathways, we further examined the counteracting effects of the agonists of these signal pathways on the antiviral activity of rhein. We first examined the counteracting effect by a SRB method. As showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191793.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, IAV infection could significantly decrease the cell viability, while ribvirin and rhein could significantly inhibit IAV-induced decrease of cell viability. As for the effects of the agonists, comparing with the IAV-infected rhein-treated group, TLR2 agonist (LAM-MS), TLR4 agonist (LPS-B5), oxidant (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), Akt agonist (IGF-1), p38/JNK agonist (anisomycin), and IKK/NF-κB agonist (PMA) could significantly counteract the action of rhein, but TLR3 agonist (Poly(I:C)) and ERK agonist (EGF) had not significant effect. In addition, we also determined the replication of IAV by a qRT-PCR assay. As showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191793.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, only TLR4 agonist, H

 <sub>2</sub>, Akt agonist, p38/JNK agonist, and IKK/NF-κB agonist could significantly antagonize the inhibition of rhein on IAV replication, while other agonists had no significant effect.
