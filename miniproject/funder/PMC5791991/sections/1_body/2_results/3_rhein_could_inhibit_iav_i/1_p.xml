<p>As showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191793.g002">Fig 2</xref>, IAV infection could up-regulate the expressions of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, phosphorylations of Akt, p38, JNK, ERK MAPK and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 protein. Rhein could significantly decrease IAV-induced expressions of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, significantly inhibit IAV-induced phosphorylations of Akt, p38, JNK MAPK and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, but not for the phosphorylation of ERK MAPK. Ribavirin, which is a purine nucleoside analogues, also could significantly reduce IAV-induced expressions of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, but not for the phosphorylations of Akt, JNK, and ERK MAPK.
