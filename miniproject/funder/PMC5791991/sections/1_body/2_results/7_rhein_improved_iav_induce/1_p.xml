<p>Finally, we also determined the influence of rhein on influenzal virus pneumonia in mice. As showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191793.g006">Fig 6</xref>, rhein could significantly improve the survival rate of mice infected with IAV (PR8), significantly reduce the lung index and lung cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α. Rhein also significantly reduced pulmonary viral load at a high dose (150 mg/kg/day) determined by a TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay at 6 days p.i.. Additionally, rhein also improved IAV-induced pulmonary histopathological changes, decreasing alveolar exudation, the destruction of alveolar wall, and alveolar hemorrhage caused by IAV infection (
