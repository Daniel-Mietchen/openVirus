<p>Through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests, we have found that rhein can inhibit IAV adsorption and replication, the mechanism of action of rhein to inhibit IAV replication may be related to its ability to inhibit IAV-mediated oxidative stress and IAV-induced activations of TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-ÎºB signal pathways. Inhibition of these signal pathways may simultaneously reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs, and finally leading to suppress IAV-induced ALI (
