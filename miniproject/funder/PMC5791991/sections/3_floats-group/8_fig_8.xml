  <title>Schematic diagram of rhein on inhibition of IAV infection and IAV-mediated ALI.</title>
  <p>Rhein can inhibit IAV adsorption and replication. Rhein suppresses IAV replication by inhibiting IAV-mediated oxidative stress and activations of TLR4, Akt, p38, JNK MAPK, and NF-ÎºB signal pathways. Meanwhile, inhibition of these signal pathways further reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines and MMPs and finally decreases IAV-induced ALI.</p>
