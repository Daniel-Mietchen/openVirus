  <title>Effects of rhein on TLRs, Akt, MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways after IAV infection.</title>
  <p>The treatment of the blank control (BC), negative control (NC), positive control (PC), and rhein-treated group (rhein) was same with that of the “antioxidant assay”. After 48 h p.i., the cells were harvested. The expressions of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, the phosphorylations of Akt, ERK, p38, JNK MAPK, and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 were determined by western blotting assay. The experiment was repeated five times (n = 5). All data shown were mean ± SD.
