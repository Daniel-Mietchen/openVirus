  <title>Counteracting effects of different agonists on the antiviral activity of rhein.</title>
  <p>A549 cells were infected with IAV (MOI = 0.001) and treated with or without ribavirin (Rib, 25 μg/mL), rhein (10 μg/mL), TLR2 agonist LAM-MS (10 μg/ml), TLR3 agonist Poly(I:C) (10 μg/ml), TLR4 agonist LPS-B5 (1 μg/ml), oxidant H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> (100 μM), Akt agonist IGF-1 (IGF-1 100 ng/ml), ERK agonist EGF (100 ng/ml), p38/JNK agonist anisomycin (10 μM), and NF-κB agonist PMA (1 μg/ml). Ater 48 h p.i., the antiviral activity was determined by a SRB method (A), IAV replication was determined by a qRT-PCR assay (B). The experiment was repeated five times and each experimental condition was performed in triplicate (n = 5). All data shown were mean ± SD.
