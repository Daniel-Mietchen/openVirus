  <title>Human SCARB2 is necessary for successful infection by EV71-VP1
   <sub>97R167G</sub>, EV71-VP1
   <sub>97L167E</sub> variants in mouse cells.
  </title>
  <p>Mouse L929 cells were transfected with a control plasmid (pCTL) or a plasmid expressing human SCARB2 (pSCARB2). 24h post transfection, cells were infected with EV71-VP1
   <sub>97R167G</sub> or EV71-VP1
   <sub>97L167E</sub> variants at a MOI = 0.2. 24 h later, cells were lysed and the expression of SCARB2 and of EV71 VP0 and VP2 proteins were quantified by western blot. Of note, the antibody used to detect SCARB2 is not specific for human SCARB2 and recognises endogenous mouse SCARB2.
