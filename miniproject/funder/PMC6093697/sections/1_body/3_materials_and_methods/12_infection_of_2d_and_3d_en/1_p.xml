<p>2D and 3D neural tissues were engineered from human induced pluripotent neural stem cells (GSC-4311, MTI-GlobalStem, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) and contained a mixed population of mature neurons and glial cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. 2D cultures were inoculated with 10
 <sup>7</sup> viral RNA copies (in 100 μl of culture medium). Residual inoculum was removed after 1 h and tissues were lysed 1 hpi and 5 dpi for RNA extraction. 3D cultures were inoculated with 4*10
 <sup>7</sup> viral RNA copies (in 40 μl of medium) and tissues were lysed 4 hpi or 5 dpi for RNA extraction.
