<p>The pClVP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and pClVP1
 <sub>97R167E</sub> infectious clones were ordered from Biomatik (Ontario, Canada) as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The VP1 E167G mutation was added by site directed mutagenesis as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] using 5’GCCAGATTCCAGAGGGTCTCTCGCATGGC3’ forward and 5’GCCATGCGAGAGACCCTCTGGAATCTGGC3’ reverse primers. Constructs were checked by sequencing, linearized with 
 <italic>Bam</italic>HI, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and transfected into Vero or Caco-2 cells, as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
