<p>Seven days after transfection, supernatants and cells were collected, subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles, clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 1000 rpm) and re-passaged 3 times in 80% confluent Vero cells. Alternatively, confluent Vero cells were inoculated with supernatant from infected Caco-2 cells. For the last passage, and when cytopathic effect (CPE) was strong enough, the infection medium was changed 24 h before collection to obtain only freshly produced viruses. Supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 1000 rpm) and concentrated by ultracentrifugation as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Ultracentrifuged viral stocks were aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C. VP1 was PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm the absence of unexpected mutations (see below).
