<p>Two viral stocks that contained equimolar amounts of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> were used in this study. The first stock was naturally generated by the emergence of spontaneous mutations during viral stock preparation. The presence of equimolar amounts of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> was assessed by Sanger sequencing and was confirmed by subcloning (pCR2.1-TOPO cloning kit, 45â€“0641, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) and sequencing of VP1 from individual clones. The second stock was created by mixing equimolar amounts of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub>. Again, equal representation of the two derivatives was assessed by sequencing with the same primers. Both stocks were used in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments (in MucilAir, SmallAir, EpiIntestinal and neural tissues) while the naturally generated stock was used for binding and infection assays 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.
