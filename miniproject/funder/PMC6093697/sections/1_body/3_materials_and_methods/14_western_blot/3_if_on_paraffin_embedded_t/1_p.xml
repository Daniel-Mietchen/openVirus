<p>Paraffin was removed from MucilAir, SmallAir and EpiIntestinal tissue sections by embedding the sections twice in UltraClear solution (3905.5000PE, Biosystems, Switzerland) for 3 min and twice in EtOH 96% (E/0600DF/15, Fisher Chemical, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) for 3 min. Sections were then air-dried for 5 min and quickly immersed in water. Tissues were rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 1% Triton (Fluka, Switzerland) for 15 min at RT and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. Intensive PBS washes were performed prior to incubation with the secondary antibody for 45 min at 37°C. Next, tissues were washed 3 times with PBS, stained with DAPI at RT for 7 min, and washed with PBS a final time. Coverslips were mounted in Fluoroprep mounting medium (BioMérieux, France). Alternatively, tissue sections were counterstained with Mayer’s Hematoxylin Solution (5 min), eosin (7 min) and mounted with Néo Mount medium (1.09016.0500, Merck, Switzerland). Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 700 Meta confocal microscope with the "Plan-Neofluar" 63x/1.4 oil objective and were processed with the ZEN Blue Advanced Processing and Analysis module.</p>
