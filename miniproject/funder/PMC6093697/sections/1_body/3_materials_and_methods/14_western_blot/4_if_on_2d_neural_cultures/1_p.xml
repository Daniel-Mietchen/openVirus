<p>2D neural cultures were fixed at RT in 4% PFA for 20 min, rinsed with PBS permeabilized with 0.1% Triton for 15 min at RT, and embedded in blocking buffer (PBS-BSA 10%) before being incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The cultures were washed with PBS prior to incubation with the secondary antibody for 1 hour at RT. Goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 were used as secondary Ab. After PBS washes, the nuclei were stained with DAPI at RT for 7 min and washed again with PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Fluoroprep mounting medium (BioMérieux, France). All IF Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 700 Meta confocal microscope and were processed with the ZEN Blue Advanced Processing and Analysis module.</p>
