<p>Cells plated on coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 20 min at room temperature (RT) in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Fixed cells were washed with PBS before incubation for 1 h at 37°C with the primary Ab. Intensive PBS washings were performed prior to incubation for 45 min at 37°C with the secondary Ab. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 7 min at RT and washed with PBS a final time. Coverslips were mounted in Fluoroprep mounting medium (BioMérieux, France)</p>
