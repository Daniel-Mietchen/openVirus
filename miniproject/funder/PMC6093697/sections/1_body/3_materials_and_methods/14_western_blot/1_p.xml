<p>Proteins were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred on a PVDF membrane (162–0177, BIO-RAD, Switzerland) that was hybridized with the primary Ab overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed twice with TTBS 0.05% [TBS buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) with 0.05% Tween] for 10 min and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with the secondary Ab. The membranes were washed twice with TTBS for 10 min and developed with the ECL system (34080, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Images were acquired with the Fujifilm LAS 4000 luminescence imager.</p>
