<p>RD (human rhabdomyosarcoma, ATCC CCL-136) and Vero (monkey kidney, ATCC CRL-1587) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and GlutaMAX (31966021, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (P40-37500, Pan Biotech, Chemie Brunschwig, Switzerland) and 100 μg/ ml of penicillin and streptomycin (15140–122, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland). Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma, ATCC HTB 37) and SH-SY5Y cells (human neuroblastoma, ATCC CRL- 2266) were grown in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM) (BE12-125F, Lonza, Switzerland) and DMEM/F12 medium (31331093, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland), respectively, supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (25030–024, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland), 1% non-essential amino acids (11140–035, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) and 10% (v/v) FBS. HEK 293T/17 (human kidney, ATC C#CRL-11268) cells were grown in DMEM (41965039, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ ml of penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (11360–039, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland), and 1% non-essential amino acids.</p>
