<p>Confluent Vero, Caco-2, RD or SH-SY5Y cells pre-plated in a 96 well plate, were washed twice with heparinase III digestion buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate pH 7.0, 1 mM calcium acetate and 0.2% BSA) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 3.5 mIU/ml of heparinase III (AMS.HEP_ENZ III_S, Amsbio, Switzerland) (50 μl/well). Control samples were incubated with digestion buffer alone. Heparinase III efficient cleavage was assessed by immunofluorescence with a mouse anti-Δ-heparan sulfate F69-3G10 antibody (370260-S, Amsbio, Switzerland, diluted 1:500) specific for a heparan sulfate neo-epitope generated after digestion.</p>
