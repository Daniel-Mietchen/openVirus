<p>Images were acquired as stacks in which four channels/wavelengths were present (blue: 440 nm; red: 645 nm; green: 510 nm; and transmission light) and four to six z positions were acquired. Red channel planes were first selected with the Select Plane function. Two regions of exactly the same size were manually drawn in the image that corresponded to apical and basal areas of the tissue and both areas were measured and stored. Next, we looped through z planes of the red channel and performed the following actions for each of the two regions: “Area of the intensity above level 3” was measured as Total Tissue Area; “Area of the intensity above level 15” was measured as High Intensity Tissue Area; and values of the “High Intensity Tissue Area” across all z planes were averaged, with values being obtained for the apical and basal areas.</p>
