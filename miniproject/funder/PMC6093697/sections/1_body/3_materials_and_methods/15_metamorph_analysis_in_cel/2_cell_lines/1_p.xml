<p>Blue (DAPI) and red (HS) or green (SCARB2) color channels were separated with the ColorSeparate function, and both images were converted to compatible files. A cell scoring step followed, in which the blue channel was used in “All nuclei” section and the red or green channel was used as a positive marker with the following respective parameters: “Approximate min width” (7 and 1 microns), “Approximate max width” (17 and 12 microns), “Parameter Intensity above local background” (8 and 40 levels). The “Algorithm” parameter was set to Standard. The cell scoring step reported the “Total Cells” number to ensure the statistical reliability of measurements, and the parameter “%Positive Cells” to reflect the expression of the receptor.</p>
