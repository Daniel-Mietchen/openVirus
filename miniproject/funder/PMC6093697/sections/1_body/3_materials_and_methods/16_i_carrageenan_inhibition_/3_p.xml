<p>For quantification by RT-qPCR, neural cultures were lysed in 200 μl of easyMAG lysis buffer. RNA was extracted, viral replication was quantified by RT-qPCR and VP1 was PCR amplified and sequenced. The percent of inhibition of virus infectivity was determined by comparing the viral load measured in neural cells in presence of increasing concentrations of ı-carrageenan relative to the viral load measured in absence of ı-carrageenan (set as reference at 100%).</p>
