<p>For ICC, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 1 min and permeabilised with PBS-Triton 0.1% for 5 min on ice. Cells were then incubated 1h at 37°C with mouse anti-EV71 VP2 monoclonal antibody (MAB979, Millipore, Merck, Switzerland; diluted 1:500 in PBS-BSA 1%). After 3 washes with PBS-Triton 0.1%, cells were incubated 1 h at 37°C with the anti-mouse HRP-labelled secondary antibody (7076, Cell Signaling Technology; diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BSA 1%). After extensive washing, DAB substrate solution (D4293-50SET, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Switzerland) was added for 15 min before final washing with PBS. More than 400 cells per well were scored under a light microscope. The percent of inhibition of virus infectivity was determined by comparing the percentage of infected cells in presence of increasing concentrations of ı-carrageenan relative to the percent of infected cells in absence of ı-carrageenan (set as reference at 100%). All data were generated from duplicate wells in three independent experiments.</p>
