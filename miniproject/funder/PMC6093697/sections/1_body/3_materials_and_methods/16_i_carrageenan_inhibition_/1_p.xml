<p>I-carrageenan (C1138, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Switzerland) was serially diluted and added for 1h at 37°C to EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub>, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> or EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167E/G</sub> (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 0.01 PFU/cell). The mixture was then added to confluent 2D neural cells or Vero cells grown in a 96-well plate at a density of 13 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/well. After 1 h at 37°C, monolayers were washed and overlaid with fresh medium. One dpi, viral replication was monitored by immunocytochemistry (ICC) in Vero cells and by RT-qPCR in neural cells.
