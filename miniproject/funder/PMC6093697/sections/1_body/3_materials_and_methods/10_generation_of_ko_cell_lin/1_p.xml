<p>Two SCARB2 targeting guide RNAs (sgRNA1 5’-CACCGCGATGCTGCTTCTACACGGC-3’ &amp; 3’-CGCTACGACGAAGATGTGCCGCAAA-5’, and sgRNA2 5’-CACCGCCGGCATTGTCTGACGTAT-3’ &amp; 3’-CGGCCGTAACAGACTGCATACAAA-5’ for the sgRNA2) were subcloned in the pLentiCRISPRV2 vector (Addgene # 52961). Recombinant lentiviruses (plentiCRISPRV2, pLentiCRISPRV2-SCARB2-sg1 or pLentiCRISPRV2-SCARB2-sg2) were produced by transient transfection of HEK 293T/17 cells as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Caco-2 and RD cells (70–80% confluency in 6-well plates) were transduced with 1 ml of viral supernatants. Five days post transduction the cells were trypsinised and subjected to puromycin selection (58-58-2, Invivogen, LABFORCE, Switzerland; 10 μg/ml for Caco-2 cells and 6 μg/ml for RD cells). Cells were maintained in the selection medium and the expression of SCARB2 was assessed by Western Blot.
