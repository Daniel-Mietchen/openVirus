<p>Aliquots of 200 μl heparin sepharose beads (ab193268, Abcam, UK) were immobilized to Pierce cellulose acetate filter spin cups (69702, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The beads were then equilibrated with 600 μl of binding buffer (0.02M Tris-HCl, 0.14M NaCl, pH 7.4) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm. Subsequently, 100, 200 or 600 μl of viral suspension of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> containing respectively 10
 <sup>9</sup>, 2*10
 <sup>9</sup> and 6*10
 <sup>9</sup> viral RNA copies were added and incubated with the heparin sepharose beads for 1h at 4°C with gentle mixing. The flow-through fraction was collected by centrifugation (5 min at 1500 rpm) and the heparin sepharose beads were washed 5 times with 200 μl of binding buffer. Bound viral particles were then eluted twice by sequential incubation of 5 min with 200 μl of elution buffer (0.02M Tri-HCl, 2M NaCl, pH 7.4). The collected fractions (input, flow-through and eluate) were analyzed by RT-qPCR and VP1 was PCR amplified and sequenced.
