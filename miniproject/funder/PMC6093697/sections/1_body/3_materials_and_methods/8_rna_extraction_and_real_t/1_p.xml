<p>RNA was extracted using the NucliSens easyMAG magnetic beads system (BioMérieux, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was performed using the quantitative Entero/Ge/08 assay as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] in a one-step format using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions in a StepOne Applied Biosystems thermocycler. As a quantitative reference standard for each run, 10-fold dilution series (from 2.5*10
 <sup>8</sup> to 2.5*10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/ml) of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed full-length pBMH-EV-D68 was used. The RNAse P housekeeping gene (4316831, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland) was quantified by qPCR in binding and replication experiments to confirm homogeneous cell number.
