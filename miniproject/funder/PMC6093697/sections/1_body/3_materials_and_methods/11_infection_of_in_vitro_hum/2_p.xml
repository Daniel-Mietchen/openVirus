<p>The tissues, cultured at an air-liquid interface (at 33°C for MucilAir and at 37°C for the other tissues), were infected apically or basally as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Briefly, for apical infection, 10
 <sup>8</sup> viral RNA copies (in 100 μl of culture medium) culture medium were applied at the tissue/air interface while for basal infection, 6*10
 <sup>8</sup> viral RNA copies (in 600 μl of culture medium) were applied at the tissue/liquid interface. After 4 hours, residual viruses were removed by extensive apical or basal washes and then, every day, 200 μl of culture medium was applied apically for 20 min to collect apically released viruses. Basal medium was also collected daily and replaced with 500 μl of fresh medium. RNA was extracted from apical samples collected 5 dpi.
