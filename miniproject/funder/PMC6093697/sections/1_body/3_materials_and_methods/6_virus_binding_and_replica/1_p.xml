<p>Confluent cells were first seeded in 96-well plates and binding and replication assays were performed 24h later as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, the medium was removed, cells were washed with cold binding buffer (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution [HBSS, 14175053, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland] containing 1% BSA [wt/vol] and 0.1% sodium azide [wt/vol]) and incubated for 1h on ice with 50 μl of viral suspension containing 5*10
 <sup>8</sup> viral RNA copies. After removal of unbound virus with 3 washes with 200 μl of cold binding buffer, cells were either lysed directly in 200 μl of easyMAG lysis buffer to quantify bound viruses by RT-qPCR or overlaid with fresh culture medium and left an additional day at 37°C before lysis and viral load quantification by RT-qPCR. To determine the dominant population in binding and replication experiment run with EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub>, the VP1 region was PCR-amplified and sequenced.
