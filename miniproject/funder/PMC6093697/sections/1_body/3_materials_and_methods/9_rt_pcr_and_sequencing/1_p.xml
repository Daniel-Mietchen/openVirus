<p>Retro-transcription was performed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and either random hexamer primers (Roche) or a specific primer (2A-3408-R: 5’CTGGGTTTTGAAAAGCTGACC3’) as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The VP1 region was amplified by PCR (Fwd 5’TGCTCGAGATGGAGTATTCG3’ and Rev 5’CTGGGTTTTGAAAAGCTGACC3’) and nested PCR (Fwd 5’CGACTACTACACTACAGGCTTGGTTAG3’ and Rev 5’CATTGGGCGAGGTATCCAC3’) with platinum Taq DNA polymerase (P/N 10966026, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland). PCR products were purified as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and sequenced (Fasteris-DNA sequencing service, Switzerland).
