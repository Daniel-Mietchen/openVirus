<p>Because of the acquired ability of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> to bind HS, its sensitivity to iota-carrageenan (ı-carrageenan), a highly sulfated polysaccharide, was investigated and compared to the sensitivity of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> in Vero and 2D neural cultures. As expected, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> infection was strongly inhibited by ı-carrageenan in Vero cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.8 μg/ml), whereas EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> infection was only slightly affected by the treatment (IC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;200 μg/ml) (

 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> was inhibited up to 90% in a dose-dependent manner. EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> infectivity was also inhibited but to a lesser extent (up to 50%). Treatment of the mixed viral population altered the dominant sequence from EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> at 1 dpi towards EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> (
