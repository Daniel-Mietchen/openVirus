<p>We previously showed that the VP1 L97R mutation conferred a binding advantage in RD and Vero cells. In addition, we showed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> that this mutation was associated with a second non-conservative mutation (E167G/A) in the VP1 EF loop [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To define the role of these mutations more precisely, we generated 4 infectious clones with distinct combinations of each of the mutations (
