<p>Viral stocks were prepared in monkey kidney cells (Vero) and titrated in Vero, colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2), rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). After 4 days of infection, viruses were sequenced from each cell line. EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167E</sub> viral stocks were unstable independent on the cell line (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and thus could not be amplified and purified in sufficient quantities to be used in functional assays. EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> (originally isolated from the lower respiratory tract sample of the patient with a disseminated infection) and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> (
 <italic>in vitro</italic> adapted from EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167E</sub>, which was originally isolated from the stool, cerebrospinal fluid and blood of the patient) were thus used for all further investigations. Titration showed that EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> exhibited differential cell tropism, with significantly enhanced replication being observed for EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> in RD and SH-SY5Y cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Notably, the RNA load measured in the stocks prepared in Vero cells was comparable for the two viruses (12.38 log RNA copies/ml for EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and 12.30 log RNA copies/ml for EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub>).
