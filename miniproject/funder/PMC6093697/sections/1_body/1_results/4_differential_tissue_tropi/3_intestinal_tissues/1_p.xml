<p>As a mixed population of viruses with VP1 97L and VP1 97R was highlighted in the patientâ€™s stool, the experimental approach used for respiratory tissues was applied to assess the replication abilities of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> in 3D reconstituted human small intestine tissues (EpiIntestinal, Mattek) cultured at the air-liquid interface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In this tissue culture model, that reproduces the cellular composition of the small intestine with enterocytes, paneth cells, M cells, tuft cells and intestinal stem cells, viral loads were more than 2 log higher than those measured in respiratory tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5A</xref> versus 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). For small intestine tissues as for respiratory tissues, there was no significant difference between the replication of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> 5 dpi for the apical inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), while for the basal inoculation, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> replicated significantly better than EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and systematically outcompeted the latter variant in competition. However, in contrast to observations made in respiratory tissues, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> did not outcompete EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> after the apical infection, and both populations were present 5 dpi in a mixed viral population. These data are in agreement with the expression of HS in the tissue, with the attachment receptor being expressed both at the apical and basal side of the tissue, although with higher concentration at the basal tissue side (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). Again, for these tissues as for respiratory tissues, SCARB2 expression is more abundant at the apical tissue side (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).
