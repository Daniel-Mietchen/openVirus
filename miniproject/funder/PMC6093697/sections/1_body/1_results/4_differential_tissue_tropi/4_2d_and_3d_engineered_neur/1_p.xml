<p>Since only EV71 with VP1 97R was sequenced from the patientâ€™s CSF, the replication of the different variants was also compared in engineered 2D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and 3D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) neural tissues containing a mixed population of mature, functional neurons and glial cells. Viral loads were measured in 2D culture lysates at 1 hpi and 5 dpi and in 3D tissue lysates at 4 hpi and 5 dpi. EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub>, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> replicated efficiently in both types of cultures and without significant difference 5 dpi. Notably, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> viral loads were significantly higher 4 hpi in 3D tissues. Upon infection with a mixed population, this variant was also dominant at 1 hpi and 4 hpi in 2D and 3D tissues, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), as well as at 1 dpi in 2D cultures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, the replication fitness of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> was greater in competition experiments at 5 dpi. HS expression is abundant in both models, supporting the selection of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> at early time points but not the dominance of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> 5 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Of note both HS (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007190.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) and SCARB2 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007190.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>) are highly expressed in neurons and glial cells.
