<p>These results correlate with high expression of HS at the basal tissue side and notably low HS expression at the apical side (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of SCARB2 showed the opposite pattern with high expression at the apical tissue side and low expression at the basal side (
