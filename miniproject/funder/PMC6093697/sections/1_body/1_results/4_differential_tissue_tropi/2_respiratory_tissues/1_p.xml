<p>As only viruses with VP1 97L were detected in the patient bronchoalveolar lavage, the replication of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub>, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> was compared in 3D reconstituted human upper (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4A</xref> MucilAir) and lower (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4B</xref> SmallAir) airway epithelia cultured at an air-liquid interface. These tissues faithfully reproduce the pseudostratified architecture of the upper and lower airway epithelia composed of ciliated cells, mucus secreting cells (as well as club cells in the lower airway) and basal cells (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Viral suspensions were applied apically (air exposed side) or basally (liquid exposed side) for 4 hours before removal of unbound viruses by extensive washing. Each day afterwards, apically released viruses were collected and basal medium was changed. Viruses released apically at day 5 pi were quantified by RT-qPCR (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], however the infectivity of viruses collected at day 5 pi was confirmed by productive infection in RD cells. No significant difference was observed in the level of replication of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> after apical inoculation of MucilAir (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) or SmallAir (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Nevertheless, sequencing of the viral population collected at 5 dpi highlighted that, when inoculated together, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> outcompeted EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In contrast, after basal infection, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> showed a net replication advantage in both individual and competition replication assays.
