<p>As SCARB2 plays a critical role for EV71 infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we investigated whether the differential cell tropism of the two variants is linked to a different dependence on this receptor. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout SCARB2 in Caco-2 and RD cells, two cell lines presenting different susceptibilities to the two variants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A striking reduction in viral titers was observed in SCARB2 knockout RD and Caco-2 cells for EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g002">Fig 2</xref>) suggesting that both variants depend on this receptor for effective infection regardless of the cell line. This was also shown by transfection of human SCARB2 in mouse L929 cells that are non-permissive for infection by EV71 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Exogenous expression of human SCARB2 conferred susceptibility to both EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> (
