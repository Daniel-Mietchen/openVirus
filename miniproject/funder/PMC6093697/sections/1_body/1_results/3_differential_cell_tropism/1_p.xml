<p>We then investigated the implication of another ubiquitously expressed receptor, the HS attachment receptor, in this observed differential cell tropism. We measured the amount of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> viruses bound to untreated cells or cells pretreated with heparinase III (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> exhibited a binding advantage over EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> in RD, Vero and SH-SY5Y cells but not in Caco-2 cells. This advantage was suppressed after cleavage of HS from the cell surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, left panel). In contrast, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> did not show a significant difference in any cell line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, right panel).
