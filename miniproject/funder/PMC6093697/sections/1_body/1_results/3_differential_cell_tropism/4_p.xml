<p>A recent publication showed that variants with VP1 E167G do not bind heparin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and the differential binding and replication of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> confirmed our previous observations with EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167E</sub> in SH-SY5Y and Vero cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], indicating that the acquired HS binding ability is due only to the L97R substitution.
