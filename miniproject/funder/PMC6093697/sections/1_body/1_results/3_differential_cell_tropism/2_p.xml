<p>To confirm this observation, competition experiments were performed with a viral stock (EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L-167G/E</sub>) containing equivalent amounts of each derivative. The competition was run under 3 conditions: using untreated cells, using cells having surface HS digested with heparinase, or using a viral population that was pretreated with heparin, a soluble HS analogue. Both binding (1 hour post-infection [hpi]) and replication (24 hpi) efficiencies were monitored by real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the dominant species was characterized by Sanger sequencing for each binding (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The overall binding was lower for the mixed population than for the EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> stock (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3B</xref> versus 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">3A</xref>). Accordingly, the pretreatment of cells with heparinase reduced viral binding less significantly, while viral replication was affected in SH-SY5Y, Vero and Caco-2 cells. Sanger sequencing of the entire VP1 region after binding showed that in Vero, SH-SY5Y and RD cells, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> (with R at position 97 encoded by CGC and G at position 167 encoded by GGG) was the dominant variant in non-treated conditions, which was not the case in Caco-2 cells, where EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> (with L at position 97 encoded by CTC and E at position 167 encoded by GAG) and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167G</sub> were dominant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Upon heparinase treatment, the dominant consensus sequence shifted towards EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub>, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167G/E</sub> or EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> in binding and replication assays. Notably, viral species with a positive charge at VP1 position 98 (K encoded by GAA instead of E encoded by AAA) emerged after treatment of SH-SY5Y, RD and Caco-2 cells with heparinase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Pre-incubation of viruses with heparin also resulted, although in a less stringent manner, in a shift of the dominant population from EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> to a mixed EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> population, except after replication in SH-SY5Y and RD cells.
