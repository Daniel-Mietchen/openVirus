<p>To determine if the improved binding and replication of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> in cells correlated with HS expression levels, quantification of HS expression was assessed by immunofluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). SH-SY5Y, RD and Vero cell lines strongly express HS, while Caco-2 showed low HS expression.
