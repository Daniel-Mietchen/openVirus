<p>Finally, we confirmed the different affinity of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> for HS using a heparin sepharose binding assay. After incubation of a mixed viral stock (EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L-167G/E</sub>) composed of 50% of each derivative with sepharose beads, we sequenced the viral populations present in the non-heparin-binding population (flow-through) or in the heparin-binding population (eluate) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). As expected, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> was highlighted in the non-heparin-binding population, while EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> was detected in the heparin-binding population.
