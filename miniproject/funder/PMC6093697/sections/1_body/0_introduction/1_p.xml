<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of a limited number of enterovirus genotypes that have the ability to infect the central nervous system (CNS) [

Although this virus is typically associated with mild hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) epidemics, EV71 has been increasingly associated with neurological disorders that range from aseptic meningitis with or without pulmonary edema to brain stem encephalitis and poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis, particularly among children less than 6 years old [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. EV71 transmission depends on hygiene, water quality, and the extent of crowding [
