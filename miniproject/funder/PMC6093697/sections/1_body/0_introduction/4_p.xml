<p>We previously isolated EV71 from an immunocompromised patient with disseminated disease. Genomic analysis revealed that this clinical strain clusters with EV71 in the human EV-A species and is related to the subgenogroup C1. Comparison of five full-length genomes sequenced directly from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system and blood specimens highlighted a critical non-synonymous single amino acid change within the EV71 VP1 BC loop (L97R) that could potentially lead to dissemination in natural infections. EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R</sub>, which was absent in the respiratory sample, was present as a dominant population in blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples and as a mixed population (EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R/L</sub>) in the stool sample [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which the mutant virus could disseminate are not clear. In this study, we investigated the capacity of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R</sub> to bind and mediate infection in different cell lines and in 3D reconstituted respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. We demonstrated that both derivatives are dependent on SCARB2 for effective infection, while their specific tropism is linked to a different ability to bind HS and further correlates with the expression level of this attachment receptor in the tested tissues. This study provides new insight regarding HS binding as a critical determinant of EV71 dissemination in humans and opens the door to antiviral strategies aimed at preventing EV71 in-host adaptation and dissemination.
