<p>EV71 tissue tropism may be modulated by its ability to bind to a variety of receptors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The human scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2), a major transmembrane lysosomal protein, is ubiquitously expressed and is the best studied receptor [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the human CNS, SCARB2 is expressed on neurons and glial cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and a transgenic mouse model expressing human SCARB2 has exhibited susceptibility to EV71 infection and the development of ataxia, paralysis and death [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The second EV71 entry receptor, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), is expressed exclusively on leukocytes and is only bound by certain EV71 strains [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Finally, attachment molecules, such as heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], sialic acids [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], nucleolin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], vimentin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and annexin II [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also enhance EV71 infectivity and may contribute to viral dissemination and neurotropism. Residues that are crucial for the binding of EV71 to certain of these receptors have been mapped on the VP1 viral capsid protein. For instance, 172Q and adjacent amino acids in the EF loop are required for binding to human SCARB2 and for efficient infection of cells expressing this receptor [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] while K98E, E145A and L169F substitutions confer binding ability to murine SCARB2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, EV71 strains with a glycine or a glutamine at position 145 of VP1 are able to bind PSGL-1, while strains with a glutamate at this position are not [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Binding of EV71 to annexin II has been mapped to the BC loop region of VP1 (residues 40–100) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Finally, positively charged residues at the 5-fold axis of EV71 capsids (VP1 162K, 242K, and 244K) appear to be essential for attachment to HS. When these residues are mutated, compensatory mutations (E98A, T100K and Q145R-T237N) can restore binding. Similarly, strains with 98E and 145E are poor HS binders, while E98K restores binding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These observations are based on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> adapted EV71 isolates and do not address the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of dissemination and neurotropism. In addition, the implication of immune escape mutations may add a level of complexity. VP1 residues 98 and 145 have been shown to be under positive selection and may be targeted by neutralizing antibodies [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Finally, EV71 virulence determinants that have been identified in animal models contradict epidemiological studies in humans. VP1 residue 145E was shown to be a virulence factor for both cynomolgus monkeys [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], while isolates with 145G/Q are also frequently associated with severe neurological disease in humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Mutations in other genomic regions may explain these apparent contradictions.
