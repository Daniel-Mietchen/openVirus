<p>Our findings in respiratory and intestinal tissues correlate with the viral populations isolated from the different specimens of the patient. We only observed an HS-independent variant in the bronchoalveolar lavage of the patient, a sample collected from the luminal side of the respiratory tissue. Importantly, sequencing of EV71 that was detected in bronchoalveolar lavages from two other immunosuppressed patients who presented neurological complications in Switzerland also identified viruses from the same genogroup and with the same VP1 sequence (GenBank accession numbers MH256663 and MH256664). Of note in these 2 cases as in our case, the infecting virus had a glutamate at position 145, a residue known to confer poor HS binding ability [
