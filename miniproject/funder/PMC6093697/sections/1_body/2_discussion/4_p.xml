<p>We observed a mixed viral population in the stool of the patient, a sample that reflects viral population isolated from the luminal side of the gastrointestinal tract. A mixed viral population was also obtained after apical inoculation of intestinal tissue cultures with a viral population composed of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub>. Since both 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> intestinal tissues are the favored site of EV71 replication, and since these tissues express HS at the basal and apical surface, it is very likely that the emergence of an HS-dependent virus arose at this site. Whether this site was reached after replication in the respiratory tract and propagation via shedding in oral secretions and swallowing or whether infection occurred simultaneously in the two sites remains an open question.
