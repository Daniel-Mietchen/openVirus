<p>Two explanations may account for the detection of HS-dependent virus only in the patient’s CSF and our experimental observations that the HS-independent virus outcompetes the HS-dependent virus in neural tissues 5 dpi (thought both variants replicate to high level in independent infections). First, the patient’s CSF may have been sampled shortly after neural invasion, at a time where the HS-dependent variant was also fitter in neural cultures. However, this would imply that both variants were present together in the CNS where the HS-dependent variants outcompeted the HS-independent variants. The fact that only HS-dependent variants were found in the patient’s blood does not support this hypothesis. More probably, the ability to bind HS promoted EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> replication in HS-enriched tissues (such as the basal layers of the gastrointestinal mucosa, muscle or endothelial cells), resulting in sustained viremia and subsequent dissemination to neural tissues. In this context, EV71 neurotropism may not rely on an improved growth in neural tissues but rather on an improved dissemination ability selected upstream of CNS contamination over the course of an infection.
