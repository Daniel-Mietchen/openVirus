<p>To assess EV71 replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and in the CNS, we analyzed the replication of HS-dependent (EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub>) and independent (EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub>) variants in relevant tissue culture models that mimicked the upper and lower respiratory airway epithelia, intestinal and neural tissues. To reproduce natural infection routes, we inoculated intestinal and respiratory tissue cultures that grow at an air-liquid interface from the apical (corresponding to the lumen) or basal (corresponding to the blood-borne) tissue sides. A comparison of viral growth of HS-dependent and HS-independent variants and competition experiments highlighted that HS-dependent variants had improved access to respiratory and intestinal tissues from the basal tissue side, where HS is highly expressed, while HS-independent variants show improved replication after infection from the air-exposed side of respiratory tissues, where HS is only slightly present, in line with previous publications [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Infection from the luminal side of intestinal tissues sustained efficient replication of both variants and correlated with intermediate expression of HS at this side. We also highlighted high expression of SCARB2 at the apical side of respiratory and intestinal tissues and low expression at the basal side. HS may thus be necessary in tissues with low SCARB2 expression to concentrate the virus at the cell surface and promote subsequent interaction with SCARB2. This would explain why HS-dependent variants infect the basal side of respiratory and intestinal tissues better than HS-independent variants.
