<p>The recent emergence of severe cases associated with EV71 genogroup C1 infections and the lack of an efficient vaccine or antiviral to fight EV71 infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated the key role of HS attachment receptor binding in EV71 dissemination in an immunocompromised host, and our preliminary results in cells and neural cultures highlighted the inhibition of HS-dependent variants by soluble HS mimetic compounds. Soluble heparan sulfate analogs may thus be a useful tool to limit enterovirus replication and dissemination. In conclusion, our data may help to unravel the key determinants of EV71 dissemination and neurotropism and bridge the gap between EV71 neurological diseases and the lack of a therapeutic approach.
