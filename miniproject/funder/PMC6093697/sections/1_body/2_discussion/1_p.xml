<p>In 2012, we reported an EV71 genogroup C1 disseminated infection in an immunocompromised patient treated with rituximab who was hospitalized with respiratory and neurological symptoms [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Although EV71 genogroup C1 infections have not been associated with severe diseases in the past, several complicated cases have been recently reported in Europe, underscoring the importance of defining EV71 virulence determinants [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. By sequencing the full genome of the virus from different samples, we identified the acquisition of a non-conservative mutation in VP1 (L97R), which was absent at the beginning of the infection in the respiratory tract but was present in a mixed population in the gastrointestinal tract and became dominant in the blood and CSF at later time points. We showed that this mutation conferred a binding advantage to the virus in certain cell lines. In this study, we extended these findings and showed that the VP1 L97R substitution, as well as an associated mutation (VP1 E167G) observed after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing, confers an ability of the virus to use HS as an attachment receptor while it does not alter the dependence of the virus on the ubiquitously expressed SCARB2 entry receptor. Tan and colleagues recently showed that variants with VP1 E167G do not bind heparin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In addition, in our previous publication, we observed the same binding advantage of the VP1
 <sub>97R</sub> mutant in neuroblastoma and Vero cells that was observed in this study with the VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> mutant [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This strongly suggests that the VP1 L97R mutation confers an HS binding ability, while the VP1 E167G mutation has a stabilizing function as proposed previously based on VP1 3D structure [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, after competition between EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> for binding and replication in cells pretreated with heparinase, EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R</sub> was excluded from the viral population, while a new variant (EV71-VP1
 <sub>98K</sub>) which is also known to promote HS binding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], emerged. Thus, it is very likely that after cleavage with heparinase at the 1â†’4 linkages between hexosamine and glucuronic acid residues, HS is still bound by EV71-VP1
 <sub>98K</sub> but not by EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R</sub>, suggesting that these two variants present different HS binding specificities.
