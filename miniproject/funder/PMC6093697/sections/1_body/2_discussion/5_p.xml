<p>Concerning neurotropism, the viral population sequenced from the CSF of the patient was HS-dependent while results obtained in 2D and 3D neural cultures were more intricate. In single infections, HS-dependent and HS-independent variants revealed similar neurotropic potential as both showed high replication levels in primary neural cells without significant difference 5 dpi. However, in competition experiments, HS-independent variants outcompeted HS-dependent variants 5 dpi while the opposite occurred at earlier time points (1 hpi and 1 dpi in 2D and 4 hpi in 3D cultures). The higher amount of cell-associated HS-dependent viruses shortly after inoculation is easily explicable by the high expression of HS in neural tissues. However, the fact that the improved binding is not reflected by an improved replicative fitness 5 dpi is less obvious. A similar situation was observed in Vero cells where the binding advantage of EV71-VP1
 <sub>97R167G</sub> did not result in improved replication relative to EV71-VP1
 <sub>97L167E</sub>. Whether another step of the viral life is affected by the VP1 L97R mutation in Vero, 2D and 3D neural cultures is currently under investigation. Of note in this study and in our previous publication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007190.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the HS-dependent variant was fitter in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at any time post infection. This difference between primary neural cultures and immortalized cells may rely on the nature of these culture models (cancer neuron precursors for neuroblastoma cells versus mature neurons and glial cells for both 2D and 3D neural cultures) and emphasizes the need to use relevant primary tissue culture models to study viral pathogenesis.
