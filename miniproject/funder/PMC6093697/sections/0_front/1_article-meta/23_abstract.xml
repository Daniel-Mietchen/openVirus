 <p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been the cause of major hand-foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the recent emergence of severe neurological cases associated with EV71 infection in Europe and the lack of an efficient vaccine or antiviral agent to fight EV71 infections highlight two critical needs: (A) the identification of ill-defined viral factors that contribute to viral dissemination and pathogenesis in humans and (B) the development of effective antiviral strategies. Herein, based on clinical observation in an immunocompromised host, we have demonstrated that heparan sulfate attachment receptor played a critical role in EV71 virulence and that “in host” EV71 adaptation to a heparan sulfate-dependent virus was likely responsible for its dissemination. To our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting the key determinants of EV71 dissemination based on a clinical case and proposing a new therapeutic approach against EV71 neurological diseases.</p>
