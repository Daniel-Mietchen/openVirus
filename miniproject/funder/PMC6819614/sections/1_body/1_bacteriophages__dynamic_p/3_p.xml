<p id="Par6">In contrast, a 
 <italic>lysogenic cycle</italic> refers to phage replication that does not directly result in virion production. A 
 <italic>temperate phage</italic> is a phage that has the ability to display lysogenic cycles. Under certain conditions, such as DNA damage and low nutrient conditions, these phages can spontaneously extract themselves from the host genome and enter the lytic cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This excision, called induction, may occur with the capture of specific parts of the bacterial genome. The ability of phages to transfer genes from one bacterium to another by means of lysogenic conversion or transduction (as reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) can lead to increased diversification of viral species and of their associated bacterial host species. These phenomena may cause the spread of toxins, virulence genes, and possibly antibiotic resistance genes through a bacterial population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A well-known example of temperate phage is the phage CTXÏ† of 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> that alters the virulence of its bacterial host by incorporating the genes that code for the toxin that induces diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Phages may thus serve as important reservoirs and transmitters of genetic diversity. The classification of phages based on their life cycle is a topic of much debate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and variations of life cycles like pseudolysogeny and carrier-states have been proposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
