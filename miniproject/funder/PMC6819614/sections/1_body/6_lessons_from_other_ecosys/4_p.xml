<p id="Par38">In addition to the advances in data generation from viral communities, approaches to overcoming the problem of dominance of unknown sequences in viral metagenomes have been suggested in several environmental studies. Brum et al. used full-length similarity clustering of the proteins predicted from viral genomic sequences to reveal the set of core viral genes shared by samples originating from seven oceans, the diversity patterns of marine viral populations, and the ecological drivers structuring these populations [

 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Major hallmarks of the human gut virome</xref>” section), it might be useful to use a similar approach to identify the core viral genes in the human gut.
