<p id="Par35">Fortunately, the majority of the technical challenges described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> have already been addressed in studies of viral communities in other human organs (such as skin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>] and lungs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]) and in environmental ecosystems (such as seawater [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>] and soil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]). Some of the solutions from environmental studies are now being applied to similar challenges in the human gut (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, we still need a systematic approach to studying the gut virome as a complex community. Environmental studies have a long history of taking the entire complex community into account: from the sequencing of the first viral metagenome of an ocean sample in 2002 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>] to the 2019 global ocean survey that revealed almost 200,000 viral populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. This is in striking contrast to human-oriented studies, which have often been limited to the identification of specific pathogens in order to combat them. Given this historical context, additional analytical approaches and hypotheses developed in cutting-edge viral ecogenomic studies of environmental samples might also be applicable to the human gut virome.
