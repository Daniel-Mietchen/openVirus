<p id="Par37">Next to these multi-omic approaches, viral metagenomic assembly can be complemented by single-virus genomics (SVG), which includes individual sequencing of the genome of the viruses once each viral particle has been isolated and amplified. Therefore, unlike de novo assembly of metagenomes, de novo assembly of SVG genomes can address viral genetic microdiversity and thereby enable the reconstruction of more complete viral genomes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. These newly identified viral species possess proteins homologous to the aforementioned abundant capsid proteins, confirming their widespread presence in oceans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Furthermore, another challenge of de novo assembly—the presence of low coverage regions—might be overcome through the use of long-read sequencing (&gt; 800 kbp), which was recently shown to recover some complete viral genomes from aquatic samples [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>].
