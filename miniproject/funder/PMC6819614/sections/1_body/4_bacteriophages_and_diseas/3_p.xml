<p id="Par17">It is known that both the gut virome and gut microbiome can be pathologically altered in patients with recurrent 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and FMT has rapidly become accepted as a viable and effective treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Ott et al. described the greater efficacy of bacteria-free fecal filtrate transfer compared to FMT in reduction of symptoms in patients with 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The filtrate recovered from normal stool contains a complex of bacteriophages, as shown by analysis of VLPs from the filtrate, which suggests that phages may mediate the beneficial effects of FMT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], although this could also be the effect of various metabolites.
