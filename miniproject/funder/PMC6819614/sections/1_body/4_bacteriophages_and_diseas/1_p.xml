<p id="Par15">The high inter-individual variability of the virome in healthy individuals presents a challenge for disease association studies, but even with this challenge, compelling evidence is emerging for bacteriophage involvement in several diseases (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For example, in a study comparing individuals with IBD to household controls, IBD patients had a significant expansion of the taxonomic richness of bacteriophages from the order 
 <italic>Caudovirales</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Cornault et al. found that prophages of 
 <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>, a bacterium usually depleted in individuals with IBD, are either more prevalent or more abundant in the fecal samples of IBD patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting that these phages might play a role in the disease pathophysiology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This supports the importance of studying the virome concurrently with the bacteriome in order to obtain a holistic picture of the gut ecosystem changes in a disease like IBD. Nor is this relationship between IBD and virome limited to human studies. Duerkop et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] reported that, in murine colitis, intestinal phage communities undergo compositional shifts similar to those observed by Norman et al. in human IBD patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Specifically, Duerkop et al. observed a decrease in phage community diversity and an expansion of subsets of phages in animals with colitis. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Clostridiales</italic> phages were decreased during colitis, and the authors suggested that members of the 
 <italic>Spounaviridae</italic> subfamily of phages could serve as informative markers for colitis [
