<p id="Par20">In recent years there have been some attempts to systematically study the effect of phages in trial settings. Yen et al. showed that prophylactic administration of a 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae-</italic>specific phage cocktail protects against cholera by reducing both colonization and cholera-like diarrhea in infant murine and rabbit models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In contrast, Sarker et al. showed that oral coliphages, though safe for use in children suffering from acute bacterial diarrhea, failed to achieve intestinal amplification and improve diarrhea outcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. This was possibly due to insufficient phage coverage and too low 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> pathogen titers, meaning that higher oral phage doses were probably required to achieve the desired effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. These studies demonstrate how bacteriophage therapy is still in its infancy despite its long use in the field of medical sciences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and emphasize the need for more systematic fundamental in vitro studies, translational animal studies, and large, properly controlled, randomized controlled trials.
