<p id="Par3">In recent years viruses have gained their own “-ome” and “-omics”: the virome and (meta)viromics. These terms encompass all viruses inhabiting an ecosystem along with their genomes and the study of them, respectively. These viruses can be classified in many ways including on the basis of their host (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In this review we focus on bacteriophages, mainly in the human gut ecosystem, and discuss their role in human health. We then lay out the challenges associated with the study of the gut virome, the existing solutions to these challenges, and the lessons that can be learned from other ecosystems.
