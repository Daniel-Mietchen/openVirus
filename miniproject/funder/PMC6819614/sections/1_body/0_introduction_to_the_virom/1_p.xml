 <sup>31</sup>, viruses are the most numerous biological entities on Earth, inhabiting diverse environments ranging from the oceans to hydrothermal vents to the human body [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The human body is inhabited by both prokaryotic (mostly bacterial) and eukaryotic (mostly human) viruses. Researchers have historically focused on eukaryotic viruses because of their well-known impact on human health, including the influenza virus that causes seasonal flu epidemics and the viruses that cause devastating health consequences like HIV and Ebola. However, increasing evidence suggests that prokaryotic viruses can also impact human health by affecting the structure and function of the bacterial communities that symbiotically interact with humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages, can play a key role in shaping community structure and function in ecosystems with high bacterial abundance [
