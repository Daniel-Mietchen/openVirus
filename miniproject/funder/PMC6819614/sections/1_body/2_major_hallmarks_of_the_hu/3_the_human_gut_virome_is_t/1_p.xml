<p id="Par10">A study by Minot et al. showed that approximately 80% of the phages in a healthy adult male were maintained over a period of 2.5 years (the entire duration of their study) [

 <italic>,</italic> who found that assemblies of the same or very closely related viral strains persist for as long as 26 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This compositional stability was further reflected in stable levels of alpha-diversity and total viral counts, suggesting that viral populations are not subject to periodic fluctuations [
