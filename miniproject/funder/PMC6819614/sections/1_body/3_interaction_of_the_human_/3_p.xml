<p id="Par14">An attractive model to study bacteriaâ€“phage interactions is through the use of gnotobiotic mice, which are colonized with a limited collection of bacteria that are well characterized yet still complex [

Fecal metabolomics in these mice revealed that phage predation in the mouse gut microbiota can potentially impact the mammalian host by changing the levels of key metabolites involved in important functions such as gastric mobility and ileal contraction [
