<p id="Par42">Given the fascinating and challenging nature of viruses, emerging evidence for the role of gut bacteriophages in health and disease and on-going paradigm shifts in our understanding of the role of certain viruses in other ecosystems, the further development of viromics is much warranted. Once we have overcome the current challenges of gut virome research, for example, through optimization of virome isolation protocols and expansion of the current databases of (un)cultivated viruses, future directions for development in the study of the human gut virome will be: (i) to establish a core gut virome and/or core set of viral genes through the use of large longitudinal cohort studies; (ii) to study the long-term evolution of bacteriomeâ€“virome interactions under the influence of external factors; and (iii) to establish the causality of the correlations with host-related phenotypes through the use of model systems, multi-omics approaches, and novel bioinformatic techniques, possibly including those inherited from environmental studies.</p>
