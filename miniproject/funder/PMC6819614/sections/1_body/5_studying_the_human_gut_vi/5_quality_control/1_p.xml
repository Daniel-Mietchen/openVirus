<p id="Par29">After overcoming the barriers faced in isolation and sequencing of virome communities, new challenges need to be overcome in the data analysis. Initially, it is necessary to discard human-host and bacterial-host reads that may introduce biases into the virome community profiling. While there are now many tools that remove nearly all human-related reads, filtering of bacterial reads may be challenging due to the presence of prophages within bacterial genomes. As inducible and cryptic prophages are important players in the gut ecosystem [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], it is necessary to filter bacterial reads carefully since they may contain prophage genome sequences that should be taken into consideration during the virome analysis. There are now several tools that can identify prophage sequences in MGS data (TableÂ
