<p id="Par28">At the sequencing step, the selection of a coverage cut-off poses an additional challenge (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In general, as a very complex and diverse community, the virome requires ultra-deep sequencing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], even though such sequencing might also complicate downstream analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Generally, the increase of coverage leads to an increase in the number of duplicated reads with sequencing errors. These duplicated reads might align to each other and create spurious contigs that prevent assembly of longer contigs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>].
