<p id="Par27">At the step of preparation of genomic libraries, low viral biomass poses a new challenge since many existing genomic library preparation kits require inputs of up to micrograms of DNA, amounts that are rarely available for virome samples. Taking into account the perceived predominance of bacteriophages in human stool (see “
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Major hallmarks of the human gut virome</xref>” section), the typical input amount of DNA after the extraction step can be estimated as follows: the number of bacteriophages in 1 g of human feces is 10
 <sup>9</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] and the average genome size of a bacteriophage is 40 kbp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), so the total amount of bacteriophage DNA in 1 g of human feces is 40 ∙ 10
 <sup>9</sup> kbp with the weight of 43.6 ng. Thus, depending on the elution volume (usually 50–200 μl), any VLP isolation protocol for stool will result in a minuscule concentration of bacteriophage DNA: [0.22–0.87] ng/μl. This is also the range observed in the benchmarking of VLP extraction protocols, although with variations that can reach an order of magnitude in some cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Therefore, the application of more sensitive kits that enable the handling of nano- and picograms of DNA input [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] or whole-(meta)genome amplification (WGA) is needed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although WGA has been shown to be a powerful tool for studying the human gut virome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], some WGA techniques, even non-PCR-based methods such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA), unevenly amplify linear genome fragments and might introduce biases into the representation of ssDNA circular viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Therefore, in the presence of MDA, the downstream analysis of viral community composition might be limited to presence-absence statistics because relative abundances might be biased towards specific viruses. Another type of WGA, adaptase-linker amplification (A-LA), is preferable for studying differentially abundant viruses since it keeps them quantifiable and allows unbiased representation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Moreover, A-LA allows the study of both ssDNA and dsDNA viruses compared to other quantitative WGA methods such as alternative linker amplification (LA) and tagmentation (TAG), which are mostly focused on dsDNA viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].
