<p id="Par31">Rapid evolution, an innate feature of viruses that allow them to inhabit almost every ecological niche, leads to substantial intraspecies divergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>]. Although the human gut virome has been shown to be stable over time, partly due to the temperate character of the majority of human gut viruses, some members of the human gut virome can evolve quickly. For example, it has been shown for lytic ssDNA bacteriophages from
