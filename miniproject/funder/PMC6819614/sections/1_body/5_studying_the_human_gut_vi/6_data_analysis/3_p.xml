<p id="Par32">The de novo assembly of metagenomes that was successfully used for the discovery of CrAssphage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] does not rely on the reference databases. Therefore, de novo assembly-based approaches give a more comprehensive estimation of the complexity of viral communities and viral dark matter (uncharacterized metagenomic sequences originating from viruses) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. However, metagenome assembly outcome is highly dependent on the read coverage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] since the default assembly workflow assumes an even coverage distribution for each genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Some biases introduced during sample processing might affect the coverage distribution and therefore hamper de novo assembly in terms of completeness of genomes and assembly fragmentation. The sources of such bias include low DNA input for genomic library preparation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], use of A-LA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], and shifted GC content associated with MDA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. In addition, it has been shown that the choice of sequencing technology has a minimal effect on the de novo assembly outcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], while the choice of assembly software crucially affects results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>] (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
