<p id="Par30">Sequencing reads passing quality control are thereafter subjected to virome profiling. Currently, there are two general strategies for virome profiling based on MGS data: (i) reference-based read mapping and (ii) de novo assembly-based profiling (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Both strategies face challenges in the characterization of viral community (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The reference-based read mapping approach, which is the one broadly used in microbiome studies, is limited by a scarcity of annotated viral genomes [
