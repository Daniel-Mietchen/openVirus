<p id="Par25">The main hurdle in studying the virome, however, is the parasitic nature of bacteriophages. Their ability to be incorporated into the host bacterial genome causes the nominal division of the virome into active (lytic phages) and silent (prophages) fractions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Depending on the targeted fraction of the virome, DNA extraction protocols may differ substantially. For instance, the active virome is primarily studied through the extraction of DNA from VLPs obtained by filtration, various chemical precipitations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and/or (ultra)centrifugation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. In contrast to studying the active virome, the concurrent targeting of both the silent and active virome (so-called “virome potential”) requires total nucleic acid isolation (TNAI) from all the bacteria and viruses in the sample [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. While both approaches have their pros and cons (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), a combination of both is desirable, albeit expensive, because this will give the complete picture of the microbiome communities.
