<p>As for any pathogen, an integrated map of ZIKV genomewide diversity and genetic processes that drive the tempo and mode of evolution advances the design of diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other control strategies. However, an adequate framework for ensuring standardized genome analysis methods and curation of (meta-)data is lacking for ZIKV. The NCBI Reference Sequence Database is widely used as the primary reference for genomics. While multiple sources in the public domain make the efforts to annotate and curate viral genomes adequately, these sources are not yet widely and routinely used. Clinicians and researchers can be misinformed by information submitted to Genbank, and the erroneous translation of study findings can challenge the advance of ZIKV knowledge. Therefore, it is pivotal that a single reference Genbank entry for ZIKV is created with a CDS length of 3,423 aa, complete UTR regions, and a correctly curated genome annotation. Despite its careful selection criteria, we do not support the human WHO candidate reference strain KX369547 as preferred reference sequence for comparative genomics purposes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Instead, we propose the use of the ZIKV genome sequence GAN KJ776791 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This sequence matches well with temporal, geographical, and epidemiological characteristics of the WHO reference strain, but in addition, KJ776791 has complete UTRs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006528.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The CDSs of KX369547 and KJ776791 are genetically similar, differing only at 8 nucleotide positions and 2 amino acid positions. The widespread distribution of the amino acid substitutions (L42F in the M protein and E146K in the NS1 protein) in the recent epidemic further support the use of KJ776791 over KX369547 (

To this end, the protein annotation of KJ776791 (and of KX369547) needs to be corrected using predicted consensus protease cleavage sites found in the ZIKV open reading frame or, ideally, supported by experimental data [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006528.g001">Fig 1</xref> gives a visual representation of our proposed annotation of KJ776791 and of the current WHO reference strain. Detailed information on this corrected annotation can be found at

Furthermore, the selection of additional reliable and curated reference sequences is warranted to overcome current inconsistencies and to establish a set representative for worldwide ZIKV genetic diversity. The scientific community should support such efforts, for example, by using data from the European Virus Archive (
