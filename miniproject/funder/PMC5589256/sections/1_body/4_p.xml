<p>As time passes, errors propagate in literature and become increasingly difficult to correct. Also, ZIKV genomic data, regardless of any reference potential, should be well curated and given sufficient metadata when made publicly available. Complete ZIKV genomes must cover UTRs and should be indicated accordingly when, in fact, limited to the complete CDS (with partial UTRs) or containing large regions of undetermined nucleotides. In fact, this lack of curation and standardized annotation impairs the accurate use of public data. In conclusion, electronic records can be adapted quickly, but tools for automated curation and verification of sequence data need to be implemented routinely and in a widespread manner. Researchers should also be more vigilant regarding annotation discrepancies.</p>
