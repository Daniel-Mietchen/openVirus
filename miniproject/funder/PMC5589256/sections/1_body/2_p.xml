<p>More importantly, the reference genome of choice needs to be well annotated to allow consistent identification of genomic regions when comparing viral strains. NCBI staff has manually curated the ZIKV genome sequence reported by Kuno and Chang [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] using the predicted protease cleavage site information from the original study. The value of this validation effort is significant because it corrected the protein lengths reported by Kuno and Chang (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006528.t001">Table 1</xref>). However, a similar curation by NCBI of ZIKV genomes that contain the 4-aa motif is lacking, and this results in considerable heterogeneity in reported annotation of ZIKV peptides that can be observed in recent literature and public databases. Firstly, MR-766 genomes with a CDS length of 3,423 aa have been submitted to Genbank without a complete and correct annotation, reducing their value as a reference sequence. For example, the nonhuman GAN KX377335 strain has served as guiding sequence in recent molecular epidemiology studies, but genomic sequences originating from these studies (e.g., GAN KU940224) were submitted to Genbank with a protein annotation that differs significantly from the curated NCBI reference genome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006528.t001">Table 1</xref>). Secondly, the WHO candidate reference strain KX369547 has a complete protein annotation in Genbank, but protein lengths differ markedly from the NCBI reference genome (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006528.t001">Table 1</xref>), which affects its current use as reference. Strikingly, protein annotations of ZIKV genomes submitted by studies using KX377335 as the reference sequence propagate the incorrect protein annotations of the human candidate WHO strain (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006528.t001">Table 1</xref>). Thirdly, studies have reported ZIKV protein lengths of human strains (GAN KJ776791) that are inconsistent with any of the annotations discussed above, causing more confusion with respect to the genome structure of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Fourthly, ambiguous UTR lengths are found in ZIKV genomes available in Genbank, without being labeled as partial UTR.
