<p>Reference genomes are used as templates for a wide range of sequence-based applications and should be carefully selected to represent pathogen diversity from a temporal, geographical, and epidemiological perspective. Kuno and Chang (2007) reported the first ZIKV genome with a detailed description and annotation of the coding sequence (CDS) (Genbank accession number [GAN] AY632535). This sequence was based on the MR-766 strain that was isolated in 1947 from a sentinel rhesus monkey at the Zika forest in Uganda [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) released their reference sequence for ZIKV in 2016, using the AY632535 sequence to guide the annotation of the ZIKV reference genome (GAN NC_012532) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With a CDS length of 3,419 amino acids (aa), AY632535 and NC_012532 lack a 4-aa N-glycosylation motif (VNDT) in the envelope region that is present in all human ZIKV genomes sampled during the recent global epidemic, including the candidate reference strain (GAN KX369547) proposed in 2016 for quantification of ZIKV RNA on behalf of the WHO [

This loss has been attributed to an artifact of repeated serial passages or adaptation to a mosquito vector, while in vivo restoration was observed upon replication in macaques, and the motif seems to play a role for viral particle structure and transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The origin and biological role of the deletion is not yet resolved, and site alterations can be seen in both historical and contemporary ZIKV genomes, with 4-aa or 6-aa deletions and a T-to-I substitution, even between different MR-766-derived sequences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A direct implication of this discrepancy in genome lengths is that the motif is ignored in downstream analyses and that comparative studies report discordant genomic coordinates for a similar observation. The ZIKV reference genome must include the 4-aa motif and be representative for the virus population circulating in the human population. As such, past and future genomic analyses should be updated to harmonize findings. While the WHO reference genome meets these criteria, its sequence (10,769 nt in length) does not cover the full-length ZIKV genome (10,807 nt in length) due to partial 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) (
