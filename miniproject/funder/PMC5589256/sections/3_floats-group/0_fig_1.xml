  <title>Visual representation of the correct genome annotation for the proposed ZIKV reference sequence KJ776791 [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

  <p>The figure shows the corrected nucleotide positions for the Genbank annotation of KJ776791. This correction was guided by the curated annotation of NC_012532 [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The upper axis indicates nucleotide positions of proteins in the full-length genome (10,807 nt), including the 5’UTR (length of 107 nt) and 3’UTR (length of 428 nt). The lower axis indicates nucleotide positions of encoded proteins in the CDS (amino acids: 1–3,423; nucleotides: 1–10,269). These positions also apply as the correct annotation of the WHO candidate reference genome KX369547. While the reference sequence we propose encompasses the complete UTR, we note that the lengths of the 5’UTR and 3’UTR of the WHO candidate reference sequence KX369547 are limited to 90 nt and 406 nt, respectively.
