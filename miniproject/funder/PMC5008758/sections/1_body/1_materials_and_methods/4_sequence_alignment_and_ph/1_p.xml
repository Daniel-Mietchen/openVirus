<p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method in MEGA 7.0.14 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], in which the reliability of the phylogeny groupings was evaluated using bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. The general time-reversible model incorporating invariant sites and a GTR+I+c4 model was favored for all datasets. The percentage identities and similarity scores of the viral protein sequences were calculated using DNAstar Lasergene software. (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, USA). Reference sequences (
