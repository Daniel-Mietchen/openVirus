<p>In endemic countries, the duration of immunity resulting from vaccination should be determined in the target animals and, according to the OIE recommendation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], vaccines should confer protective immunity for at least 1 year. The cut-off value of rabies RVNA titer, 0.50 IU/mL, has been used to estimate the protective level after vaccination in this study; however, protection against RABV 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is complex, in which RVNA is only a partial contributor. It remains a challenge to determine how accurately the FAVN test, which utilizes 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization for assaying RVNA, measures the protective level 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, there is a basic requirement to establish a new 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> method for absolute proof of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protection.
