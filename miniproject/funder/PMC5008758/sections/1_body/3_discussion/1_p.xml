<p>The ‘One health’ concept has been proposed as an effective way to successfully eliminate human rabies cases worldwide by 2030 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In China, human rabies is a notifiable zoonosis through a comprehensive surveillance network; however, real-time surveillance of animal cases is still officially lacking. Up-to-date information about animal rabies, especially in wildlife, is generally difficult to obtain except in some cases involving human exposures. In light of the history of rabies epidemics, we should clearly recognise the serious situation of animal rabies control as requiring hard and long-term work in China and not mask the truth simply because of the current decrease in human rabies cases.
