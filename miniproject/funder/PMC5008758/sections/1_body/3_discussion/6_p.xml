<p>Camel rabies outbreaks have occurred mainly in the Middle East in the past few decades [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, rabies vaccination in camels has hardly been reported. There are three subclasses of functional immunoglobulins (lgGs) present in the serum of Camelidae: lgG1 is a conventional heterotetrameric antibody, while lgG2 and lgG3 consist only of heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the influence and effect of HCAbs on rabies vaccination 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and surveillance 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> remain so far unknown, our data show that the current vaccine can confer protective immunity in camels for at least 1 year.
