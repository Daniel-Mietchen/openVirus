<p>The cut-off value of rabies RVNA titer, 0.50 IU/mL, is defined as the minimum antibody level affording complete protection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. No detectable RVNA was detected in any unvaccinated animal. In contrast, all animals in the random testing had RVNA titers after receiving a single vaccination. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004890.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, there are significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in RVNA titers between the one-dose groups and multi-dose groups by one-way ANOVA, and no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) between two-dose groups and three-dose groups. Levels of RVNA indicative of protection in all tested animals vaccinated with two or three doses lasted more than one year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004890.g002">Fig 2</xref>); however, the RVNA levels in cattle were high relative to those in camels (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), possibly due to genetic differences in the two animals. According to the local veterinary clinical records, no overt clinical reactions, such as allergic reactions, mortality, anorexia, pyrexia, rumination, changes in behaviour, weight gain, milk production, male and female fertility, occurred during the three-month period following immunization.
