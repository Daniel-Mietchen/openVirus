<p>Interestingly, we observed that LysoTracker-positive compartments clustered in IFN-treated A549-WT cells, whereas they failed to do so in IFN-treated IFITM3KO cells. However, the IFITM3KO cells did not display a general defect in endosomal repositioning, as the clustered filipin-positive endosomes were seen upon treatment with 2 µg/ml of the hydrophobic polyamine U18666A, a cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitor of the endosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which is widely used as a pharmacological model to induce the NPC1 loss-of-function phenotype of LE/L cholesterol accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2C</xref>). Because this observation indicated that the endosomal clustering seen upon IFN treatment was dependent on the IFITM3-mediated increase in the LE/L cholesterol load, we next overexpressed NPC1. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>, NPC1 overexpression in resting A549-WT cells did not alter the intracellular distribution of acidic endosomes. However, the IFN-induced LE/L clustering was clearly affected; IFN-treated A549-WT cells transfected with NPC1 displayed a LE/L distribution that resembled that in untreated cells, while the IFN-induced clustering was clearly recognizable in the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected control cells. To check whether the LE/L of IFITM3KO cells, which do not show IFN-induced clustering, can be repositioned by forced LE/L cholesterol loading, we treated IFITM3KO cells with U18666A. In line with the notion that IFN-induced LE/L cholesterol accumulation was the reason for LE/L clustering, these cells showed similar redistributions of LysoTracker-positive endosomes after U18666A treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). To further substantiate the importance of endosomal cholesterol levels in the LE/L positioning, we studied the distribution of the acidic endosomes more systematically. Therefore, we used software-assisted image analysis to quantify the number of neighbors (within a 30-px radius) of each LysoTracker-positive endosome in the individual cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>, the endosomes of the IFN-treated A549-WT cells tended to have a greater number of neighbors, i.e., they were more densely crowded than acid endosomes in the untreated cells. Similarly, in the U18666A-treated IFITM3KO cells, the number of neighbors per acidic endosome was increasing. In summary, these results clearly show the dependency of LE/L positioning on LE/L cholesterol content.
