<p>Overexpression of the IFN-inducible antiviral protein IFITM3 has been linked to LE/L cholesterol accumulation (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and yet the functional relevance of this link, especially in the context of IFN-driven viral restriction, is not fully understood (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). To functionally dissect the impact of LE/L cholesterol and IFITM3, we assessed whether the IFN-driven increase in LE/L cholesterol pools was still present in A549 IFITM3 knockout cells (A549-IFITM3KO), generated through the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Notably, these cells were able to respond to IFN, as assessed by IFN-mediated STAT1 induction, and yet were completely devoid of IFITM3 even under IFN stimulation conditions (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and also colocalizes with lysosomes (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), was still upregulated in IFN-stimulated A549-IFITM3KO cells and yet the level of upregulation was very moderate (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2B</xref>). Although IFITM2 was also reported to induce cholesterol accumulation in endosomes (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), very weak IFN-stimulated IFITM2 induction, which was previously observed in the A549 cell line (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), did not compensate for the loss of IFITM3, as the IFITM3KO cells did not accumulate LE/L cholesterol upon IFN treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Consistently, colocalization of filipin with the LysoTracker signals was significantly decreased in the IFITM3KO cells after IFN treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). To further substantiate these observations biochemically, we quantified and compared cholesterol levels in cell fractions enriched for either early endosomes or LE/L through sucrose gradient flotation separation of untreated or IFN-exposed cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>, in both IFN-treated A549-WT and IFITM3KO cells, the cholesterol amounts in the postnuclear supernatants and in the early endosomal fractions were not significantly altered upon IFN treatment. However, IFN-treated A549-WT cells had significantly more cholesterol in the LE/L-enriched fractions than were seen with the untreated cells, whereas in IFITM3KO cells, no such increase was observed in this fraction, in line with the results obtained from the quantitative colocalization analysis. Together, these results show that IFN induces retention of cholesterol within LE/L and underscore the importance of IFN-driven upregulation of IFITM3 in this process, thereby confirming previous reports (
