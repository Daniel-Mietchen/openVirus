<p>In the second experimental approach, we treated A549-WT cells with the NPC1 inhibitor U18666A. To exclude the possibility that any U18666A effect was due to an induction of IFITM3-mediated cholesterol imbalance, the A549-IFITM3KO cells were investigated in parallel. Because the proportion of infected cells was increased in these cells, a lower virus titer was used in order to maintain a dynamic assay window also in the A549-IFITM3KO cells. A drastically reduced number of NP-positive nuclei were detected in U18666A-treated A549-WT cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2C</xref>), indicating that LE/L cholesterol accumulation exerts a host-protective function independently of IFITM3 induction. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3A</xref>, the U18666A concentration that was used to induce LE/L cholesterol accumulation (2 µg/ml) did not affect the endosomal low pH, a key factor for IAV cell entry. Similarly, overexpression of IFITM3 (
