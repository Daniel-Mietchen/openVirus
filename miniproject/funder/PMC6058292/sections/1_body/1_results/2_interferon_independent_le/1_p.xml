<p>To assess whether the IFN-induced increase in LE/L cholesterol levels was a side effect or a vital part of the IFN antiviral protection, we investigated LE/L cholesterol imbalance independently of IFN. For analysis of its physiological functions during the early stages of the infection, we aimed at impairing the egress of cholesterol from LE/L. To focus on early infection, we determined the proportion of infected cells within the first replication cycle. Therefore, nuclei of infected cells were analyzed 4 h postinfection (p.i.) for the appearance of the viral nucleoprotein (NP), which is predominantly nuclear at this stage of the infection cycle. Because NPC1 is a key element in the cholesterol transport from this compartment to other cellular destinations, increased cholesterol levels were first induced via overexpression of AnxA6, a negative regulator of NPC1 (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). As expected, a high proportion (76.0% ± 1.15%) of the GFP-positive control cells was infected, as revealed by the nuclear appearance of NP. In contrast to that, a much lower number of cells ectopically overexpressing AnxA6-GFP were NP positive (32.67% ± 4.37%). In line with the notion that enhanced LE/L cholesterol negatively affects IAV early infection, the proportion of infected cells strongly increased (62.0% ± 4.62%) when NPC1 was transiently coexpressed together with AnxA6 in these cells (

To validate this finding, we next employed an established cell model consisting of the parental A431-WT cell line naturally lacking endogenous AnxA6 and of the A431-AnxA6 cell line engineered to stably express AnxA6 and thus showing an excess of LE/L cholesterol (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Both cell lines were infected with PR8 and monitored for NP staining 4 h p.i. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, the number of cells with NP-positive nuclei was decreased by approximately 50% in A431-AnxA6 cells compared to A431-WT cells. Strikingly, ectopic NPC1 expression in WT cells did not change the percentage of infected cells, whereas, in the A431-AnxA6 cells, NPC1 expression almost completely rescued the reduced proportion of infected cells in the single cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This suggests that an optimal concentration of cholesterol in LE/L membranes is required for efficient early infection. Next, we compared the numbers of NP-positive cells in IFN-β-primed A431-WT cells ectopically expressing the tagged cholesterol transporter NPC1 or empty vector (GFP). As expected, infection of nontreated A431-WT cells expressing GFP yielded a high number of infected cells, whereas IFN-β pretreatment drastically reduced the numbers of NP-positive nuclei (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Of note, NPC1 overexpression significantly increased the amounts of NP-positive nuclei in IFN-β-primed A431-WT cells. Thus, NPC1 overexpression counteracted the host-protective role of IFN, supporting the idea that the IFN/IFITM3-induced increase in LE/L cholesterol is a part of the innate immune response against IAV.
