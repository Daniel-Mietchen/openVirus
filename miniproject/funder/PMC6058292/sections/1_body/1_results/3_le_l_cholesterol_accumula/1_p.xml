<p>To unravel the details of the actual step that was negatively affected by increased LE/L cholesterol levels, we first performed acid-bypass infection assays. This technique forces the fusion of IAV particles with the host cell plasma membrane (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and leads to a direct transfer of the viral genome into the cytosol, thus circumventing the endocytic pathway. Strikingly, there was no difference in the numbers of infected A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting that LE/L cholesterol accumulation acted on the endosomal uptake of IAV. We next performed a comprehensive analysis of the sequential events during host-cell entry. In line with our previous work (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the levels of efficiency of IAV endosomal uptake, as judged by the levels of the virion-associated matrix protein M1 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), were similar in A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Because the acidic environment encountered in the LE/L induced conformational changes in HA that critically affect the fusogenic capacity, we next used an antibody specific for the fusion-active conformation (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As expected from the findings indicating that LE/L pH was not affected, no significant differences in the amount of signal were detected in A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, hardly any signal could be detected in cells treated with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase required for endosomal acidification, which therefore served as a positive control.
