<p>In order to investigate the influence of the pharmacologically increased LE/L cholesterol level in more detail, we followed the progress of the fusion over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). U18666A-treated cells showed lower values at all times measured during the 6 h after infection. However, the analysis of the dequenching rates revealed that the increases in signal intensity were approximately parallel in both cases. This most likely reflects the well-known fact that the bulk of the fusion occurs within the first hour after infection (
