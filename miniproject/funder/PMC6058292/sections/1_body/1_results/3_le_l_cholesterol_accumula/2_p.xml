<p>Transfer of the viral genome into the cytosol occurs during passage through the late endosomal compartment. Hence we speculated that LE/L cholesterol imbalance might interfere with viral uncoating and/or membrane fusion. Therefore, a viral envelope/endosomal membrane fusion assay utilizing IAV particles labeled with the two lipophilic dyes 3,3′-dioctadecyl-5,5′-di(4-sulfophenyl)oxacarbocyanine (SP-DiOC18) and octadecyl rhodamine b chloride (R18), initially described by Sakai et al. (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), was employed to identify potential fusion defects. Upon fusion, the dyes diffuse out of the viral envelope and into the endosomal membrane, leading to dequenching and a subsequent increase in SP-DiOC18 fluorescence. This elevated SP-DiOC18 signal was decreased in infected A549-WT cells transiently overexpressing IFITM3 compared to nontransfected control cells, verifying that the assay was suited for detection of antiviral restriction through host cell factors (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Remarkably, the IFN treatment resulted in a decrease in dequenching in the A549-WT cells, whereas in the A549-IFITM3KO cells the opposite effect, i.e., an increase in dequenching, was found. Importantly, in both cell lines, U18666A treatment significantly caused a pronounced decrease in SP-DiOC18 dequenching, indicating that IAV membrane fusion within cholesterol-laden endosomes was impaired. Similar results were observed when A431-WT cells and A431-AnxA6 cells were compared for IAV-endosome fusion, and the impaired virus fusion with cholesterol-laden endosomal membranes was still observed in A431-AnxA6 cells that were subjected to small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment to silence IFITM3 expression (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), we applied the respective single-dye dequenching approaches used in the study by Desai et al. Notably, in this assay, neither use of SP-DiOC18 nor use of 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine,4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (DiD) yielded significant differences in the efficiencies of IAV/endosomal membrane fusion between A431-AnxA6 cells and A431-WT cells, although robust bafilomycin A1-mediated inhibition could be detected (
