<p>A solid body of evidence supports the idea of the importance of cholesterol in host cell membranes as a factor that influences propagation of many viruses (

In line with previous reports, we show that antiviral IFN leads to IFITM3 upregulation and concomitant IFITM3-dependent LE/L cholesterol accumulation. Importantly, elevating LE/L cholesterol pools independently of IFN and IFITM3 via AnxA6 overexpression or pharmacological inhibition of NPC1 had the same antiviral consequences, even when IFITM3 expression was abolished through targeted genome editing.
