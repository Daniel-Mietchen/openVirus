<p>Taken together, our data establish the LE/L cholesterol balance as a functionally relevant effector that acts as an early antiviral barrier. The LE/L cholesterol-mediated restriction is embedded in the antiviral response mounted upon IFN-Î² exposure of host cells, with IFITM3 functioning as the IFN-controlled switch. A precise modulation of cholesterol at the step of incoming IAV might combine reduced primary infection and fewer side effects and therefore could open up novel antiviral approaches targeting host factor components, and LE/L cholesterol levels might serve as a likely host target.</p>
