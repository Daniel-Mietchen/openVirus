<p>Most of the IFN-induced antiviral effectors control viral replication, i.e., act at a stage when the virus genome is already found in the cytoplasm. Importantly, the cholesterol axis identified here efficiently interferes with the cytosolic entry of incoming viral particles, a very early step in the infection cycle. Impaired transfer of the viral genome into the cytoplasm might provide the host cell with more time to mount the antiviral response.</p>
