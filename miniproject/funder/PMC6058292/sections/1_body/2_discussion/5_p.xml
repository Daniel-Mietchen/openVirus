<p>Like most enveloped viruses (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), IAV exploits the drop in pH encountered in the LE/L as a trigger for viral envelope-endosomal membrane fusions (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), in turn leading to the cytosolic release of the viral genome. Low pH induces insertion of the HA fusion peptide into the endosomal membrane, pulling the two membranes together (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The two bilayers merge partially (hemifusion) and eventually fuse completely, thereby creating and expanding a fusion pore. For IAV, low pH is sufficient to trigger this fusion process. Although impaired endosomal acidification has been linked to LE/L cholesterol imbalance (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), we did not observe significant alterations in the LE/L pH and in the amount of HA that underwent the fusion-active conformational change in cells with impaired NPC1 functionality, indicating that changes in the lipid composition of the target membrane and not compromised endosomal acidification most likely caused the impaired fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. LE/L are typically pleiomorphic and contain intraluminal vesicles within their limiting membrane (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Endosomal cholesterol overload has been reported to impair intraendosomal membrane trafficking, i.e., the back-fusion of intraluminal vesicles with the limiting membrane (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Accordingly, infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a virus that first fuses with the intraluminal vesicles to then release the viral genome via back-fusion of the nucleocapsid-containing internal vesicles (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), is impaired when cells are forced to accumulate late endosomal cholesterol (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). We observed a strikingly negative impact of increased LE/L cholesterol levels on virus/endosome lipid mixing. Thus (hemi)fusion between the viral envelope and endosomal membranes was impaired. Notably, acidic bypass-induced IAV fusion at the plasma membrane, which circumvents passage through LE/L compartments (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), was not affected, underscoring the fact that defective endosomal escape is the cause of IAV entry inhibition in AnxA6-expressing cells displaying elevated LE/L cholesterol levels. Interestingly, inhibition of IAV HA-mediated hemifusion (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) was reported upon IFITM3 overexpression, although it was attributed to a higher lipid order of the host membranes, and a potential involvement of IFITM3-induced elevation of cholesterol content was not investigated. However, since a cell-cell fusion assay using HA-expressing cells was used in this study, there is a possibility that the actual HA-mediated viral envelope/endosomal membrane fusion was not fully reproduced.
