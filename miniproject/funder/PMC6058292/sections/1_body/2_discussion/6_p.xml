<p>HA-mediated membrane fusion has been addressed in many studies employing biophysical approaches, and special attention has been paid to the role of cholesterol in this process (see reference 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> for an overview). Membrane fusion is dynamic and is influenced by the lipid composition of both the host cell target membrane and the viral envelope (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> liposome studies reflect neither the membrane curvature nor the exact lipid (and protein) composition in endosomes. Here, we focused on the impact of increased LE/L cholesterol levels observed only under certain physiological conditions, i.e., during the IFN-mediated antiviral response. Free cholesterol within LE/L is thought to diffuse preferentially into membranes of the intraluminal vesicles (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and endocytosed IAV particles might also incorporate the excess cholesterol into the viral envelope, which might in turn disturb proper HA mobility and/or function. In support of this idea, a moderate level of removal of cholesterol from the IAV envelope has been shown to enhance fusion (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The IAV fusion peptide is an Î±-helical hairpin structure (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and changes in the lipid composition of the target membranes might interfere with the proper insertion. It is also highly likely that LE/L cholesterol enrichment affects the curvature and/or rigidity of the endosomal membranes, causing restricted fusion capacity.
