<p>H1N1 IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8M) was obtained from the virus strain collection of the Institute of Virology, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany, and H3N2 IAV strain X31 was provided by Thorsten Wolff, Robert Koch Institut, Berlin, Germany. Both IAV strains were propagated in MDCKII cells. For infection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and exposed to the indicated multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of virus diluted in PBS with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma catalog no. A7979), 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.9 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (PBS-BSA) at 37°C or on ice. If not otherwise indicated, the inoculum was aspirated after 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in DMEM with 0.2% BSA, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (DMEM-BA) for the respective periods of time.
