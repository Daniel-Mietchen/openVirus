<p>Ratiometric fluorescence microscopy and calculation of endosomal pH were done as described by Johnson et al. (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Briefly, cells were pulsed for 25 min with Oregon green 488 (OG488)-labeled and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled dextran (Invitrogen) (10 kDa), followed by a 25-min chase. Cells were washed and kept in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) at 37°C during image acquisition. Epifluorescence signal was acquired for each of the dyes individually and at intervals of 60 s. To generate a calibration curve based on the mean OG488/TMR fluorescence ratio at the respective pH, standard solutions ranging from pH 4.5 to 6.0 were applied after basal measurement, and endosomal pH was calculated from the calibration curve.
