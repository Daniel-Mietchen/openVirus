<p>For protein sample preparation, cells were washed in PBS, harvested in 8 M urea, and subjected to sonication. The protein concentration in the lysates was determined by the Bradford method. The primary antibodies used for detection of the respective proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were anti-annexin VI antibody (N-19; Santa Cruz catalog no. sc-1931), anti-GAPDH antibody (FL-335; Santa Cruz catalog no. sc-25778), anti-IFITM3 antibody (Proteintech; 11714-1-AP), anti-IFITM2/3 antibody (Proteintech; 66081-1-Ig), anti-influenza M1 antibody (clone GA2B; AbD Serotec [MCA401]), and anti-α-tubulin antibody (clone B-5-1-2; Sigma catalog no. T5168). IRDye secondary antibodies (Li-COR) labeled with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes were used for direct, nonenzymatic detection of primary antibodies coupled with IRDye 680CW and IRDye 800CW for donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L), donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), and donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L). An Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR) was used for NIR fluorescence detection. Western blots were quantified using Odyssey infrared imaging system software version 3.0.25.</p>
