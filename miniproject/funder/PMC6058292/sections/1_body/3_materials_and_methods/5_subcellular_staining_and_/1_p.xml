<p>Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)–PBS
 <sup>++</sup> (PBS with Ca

 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptomyces filipinensis</named-content>; Sigma catalog no. F9765) (stock, 2.5 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] and 1:2 in 2% BSA) for 2 h. For visualization of endosomal/lysosomal compartments, cells were incubated either with 200 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes) for 1 h prior to fixation or with an anti-CD63 antibody (MX-49.129.5; Santa Cruz catalog no. sc-5275) (tetramethylrhodamine [TMR] isocyanate [TRITC]; 1:100 in 2% BSA) for 1 h after filipin staining. Confocal microscopy was performed using an LSM 780 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective. z-stacks of individual cells were subjected to threshold processing, and Manders’ colocalization coefficients of the respective endosomal/lysosomal marker with filipin signal were analyzed using the ImageJ plugin Jacop (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Additionally, the numbers of voxels that were positive for both filipin and LysoTracker (or for filipin and CD63) were related to the total number of LysoTracker-positive (or CD63-positive) voxels, regardless of the intensity of the filipin or LysoTracker/CD63 signal strength. To generate the heat map presentations of filipin stainings, the different filipin pixel intensities were color-coded according to the gradient presented in a color look-up table (LUT), with the gradient of colors ranging from blue (lowest intensity) to white (highest intensity).
