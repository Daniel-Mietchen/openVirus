<p>To analyze the clustering of acidic endosomes, the grayscale images were processed in a binary manner by replacing LysoTracker intensity values above the globally determined threshold with a value of 1 and setting all other values to 0. With the help of the ImageJ plugin collection “BioVoxxel Toolbox,” the resulting binary images were then used to determine the number of neighbors of each endosome in the individual cells, and the data were expressed as frequency distributions of at least 5 cells per condition.</p>
