<p>IFITM3 was knocked out in A549 cells through the use of gene editing plasmids from Santa Cruz. The IFITM3-specific CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid was cotransfected with the IFTM3-specific HDR plasmid, and KO cells were positively selected in puromycin-containing (2 µg/ml) selection medium. Basal IFITM3 expression and IFN-induced IFITM3 expression in WT and IFTM3KO cells were compared by Western blotting using an anti-IFITM3 antibody (Proteintech catalog no. 11714-1-AP). To verify that IFN signaling was not affected in the IFITM3 KO cells, IFN-mediated STAT1 induction (

Detection of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (Santa Cruz catalog no. sc-25778) served as a control to confirm equal levels of protein loading. siRNA against human IFITM3 (SMART pool siGENOME, human IFITM3 siRNA M-014116-01; GE Dharmacon) was used for knockdown of IFITM3 protein expression in A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells, and nontargeting siRNA (ON-Target plus siControl; GE Dharmacon) served as a negative control.
