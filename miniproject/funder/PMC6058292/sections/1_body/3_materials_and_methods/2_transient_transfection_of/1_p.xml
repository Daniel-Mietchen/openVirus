<p>A549 and A431 cell lines were transfected with plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. pCMV-myc-hIFITM3 was kindly provided by Jacob Yount (Addgene plasmid number 58461). Human AnxA6 was expressed from the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and murine NPC1 was expressed from the plasmid pEYFP-N2 (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). pEGFP-N3 served as a control.
