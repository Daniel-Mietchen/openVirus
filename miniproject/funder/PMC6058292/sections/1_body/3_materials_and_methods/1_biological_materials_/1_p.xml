<p>The A431 human epithelial carcinoma cell line stably expressing AnxA6 (A431-AnxA6; provided by T. Grewal, Sydney) has been described previously (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The A431 wild-type cells (A431-WT; provided by T. Grewal, Sydney), the A431-AnxA6 cells, and the A549 human alveolar epithelial cell line (provided by S. Ludwig, Muenster) were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells (provided by S. Ludwig, Muenster) were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM). Cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Merck catalog no. S0615), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. For IFN pretreatment, cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml IFN-β (recombinant human interferon beta; ImmunoTools catalog no. 11343524) for 16 h.
