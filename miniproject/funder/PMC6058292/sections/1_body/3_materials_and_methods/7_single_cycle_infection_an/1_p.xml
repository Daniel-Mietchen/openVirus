<p>Cells were pretreated as indicated in the respective figure legends, seeded on covers slips 1 day prior to infection, and infected with PR8M by a standard procedure as described above. At 4 h p.i., cells were fixed (4% PFA–PBS
 <sup>++</sup> for 10 min), permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100–PBS
 <sup>++</sup> for 30 min), and blocked (2% BSA–PBS
 <sup>++</sup>, overnight, 4°C). Staining with anti-NP antibody (mouse anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein, clone AA5H; AbD Serotec [MCA400]) for 2 h and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 (donkey anti-mouse IgG [H+L] secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen catalog no. A21203) for 1 h with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma) was done using 2% BSA. Transfected cells were identified by confocal microscopy using an LSM 800 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective and were categorized for the presence or absence of distinct IAV NP signal.
