<p>Virus lipid labeling using 3,3′-dioctadecyl-5,5′-di(4-sulfophenyl)oxacarbocyanine (SP-DiOC18; Molecular Probes catalog no. D7778) and octadecyl rhodamine b chloride (R18; Molecular Probes catalog no. O246) was described previously (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and was adapted to the single use of SP-DiOC18 or 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine,4-chlorobenzenesulfonate (DiD; Molecular Probes catalog no. D7757). In brief, IAV (PR8M) was labeled with SP-DiOC18 and R18 at final concentrations of 0.2 µM and 0.4 µM, respectively, or with SP-DiOC18 or DiD alone at 0.2 µM for 1 h at room temperature and was subsequently filtered through a 0.22-µm-pore-size filter (Millipore). Cells were infected with the labeled virus for 30 min on ice, washed twice with PBS, and subsequently incubated for the indicated periods of time at 37°C. Cells were harvested by Accutase (Millipore catalog no. SCR005) treatment and were fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 20 min. Lipid mixing was quantified by FACS analysis, with 10,000 cells analyzed per sample. Linear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism) was used to determine the best-fit linear regression and to calculate the slopes.
