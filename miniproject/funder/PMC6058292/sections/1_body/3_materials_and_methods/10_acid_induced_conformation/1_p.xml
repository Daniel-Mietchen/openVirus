<p>The detection of HA after the acid-induced conformational change was performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). An antibody which specifically recognizes HA that has undergone an acid-induced conformational change (HAac) was kindly provided by Yohei Yamauchi (ETH ZÃ¼rich).
