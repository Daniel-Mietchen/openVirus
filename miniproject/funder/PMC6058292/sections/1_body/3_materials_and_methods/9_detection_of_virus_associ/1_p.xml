<p>Early detection of virus-associated M1 protein to monitor IAV internalization was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Briefly, cells were infected with PR8M at an MOI of 5 for 30 min at 37°C as described above. After the standard infection procedure, cells were washed with acidic PBS (PBS/HCl; pH 1.3, 4°C) to remove noninternalized virions from outside the cell. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS (4°C) and incubated with DMEM-BA at 37°C. At the indicated time, cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting against IAV M1 protein and α-tubulin as a loading control.
