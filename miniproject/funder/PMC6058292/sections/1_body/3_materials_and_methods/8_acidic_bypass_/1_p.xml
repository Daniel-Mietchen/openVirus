<p>The applied assay was established previously by Stauffer et al. (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Prior to infection, cells were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 (Cayman catalog no. cay-11038) (250 nM). Virus (PR8M) was primed for 1 h at 37°C with DMEM adjusted to pH 5.8 with MES (morpholineethanesulfonic acid) (30 mM). Cells were infected at an MOI of 50 with primed virus for 1 h on ice and subsequently washed twice with cold DMEM-BA. An acidic bypass was achieved by incubation with low-pH DMEM (50 mM citrate, pH 5.0) for 2 min, followed by two washing steps with cold DMEM-BA. DMEM-BA containing bafilomycin A1 (250 nM) was added, and cells were incubated for 8 h at 37°C. For fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, the cells were harvested by Accutase treatment (Millipore catalog no. SCR005), fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized by the use of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Blocking as well as staining with an anti-NP antibody (mouse anti-influenza A virus nucleoprotein, clone AA5H; AbD Serotec [MCA400]) for 2 h and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody) (Alexa Fluor 488; Invitrogen catalog no. R37114) for 1 h was done using 2% BSA–PBS
 <sup>++</sup>. Cells were washed three times between blocking and antibody incubations. A total of 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample. Uninfected cells or cells without bypass served as a control.
