<p>Detection of viral components in infected cells via the host innate immune system elicits rapid induction and secretion of the antiviral interferon (IFN) cytokine family, leading to subsequent upregulation of a plethora of genes that help restrict IAV infection and spread. IFN-induced elevation of levels of the antiviral protein IFITM3 (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) has been demonstrated to interfere with the fusion of the viral envelope with the LE/L membrane (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Interestingly, cells ectopically expressing IFITM3 also show aberrant late endosomal accumulation of cholesterol, a lipid known to control membrane sorting and dynamics in this compartment (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It has thus been suggested that LE/L cholesterol accumulation links the antiviral IFITM3 activity to LE/L membrane properties (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the relevance of altered endosomal cholesterol levels in IFITM3-mediated viral restriction is heavily disputed (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and the issue of whether treatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) induces changes in subcellular cholesterol pools has not been addressed so far (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
