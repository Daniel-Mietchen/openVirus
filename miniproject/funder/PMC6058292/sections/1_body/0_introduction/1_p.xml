<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is responsible for annual epidemics that cause major challenges, in terms of both morbidity and mortality, and IAV pandemics claimed millions of deaths worldwide in the past (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Thus, IAV is a major public health threat. Identifying host cell factors and components that are exploited by the virus to promote replication might offer targets to develop novel strategies of treatment. Comprehensive knowledge about the underlying mechanisms of pathogen-host interaction and the induction of the antiviral host innate immune response is crucial.
