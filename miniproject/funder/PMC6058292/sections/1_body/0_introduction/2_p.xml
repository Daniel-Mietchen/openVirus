<p>Upon initial cell attachment via binding of the IAV glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to sialic acid residues on host cell surface proteins, viral particles utilize the cellular endocytic machinery to enter the target cell. Viruses are subsequently trafficked through early endosomes (EE) to late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/L), where endosomal escape is thought to occur (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). A prerequisite for the efficient release of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm is the fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes, triggered by acidic conditions within the LE/L. The lower pH leads to a conformational change in HA, and subsequent hydrophobic interactions of HA with the endosomal membrane cause the formation of a fusion pore, allowing cytosolic entry and transport of the viral ribonucleoproteins to the nucleus (
