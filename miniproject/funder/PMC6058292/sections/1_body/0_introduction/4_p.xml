<p>Because our previous results indicate a strong impact of balanced endosomal cholesterol on the release and infectivity of IAV progeny (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), we therefore systematically evaluated the impact of enhanced LE/L cholesterol contents in the context of the host cell antiviral response. We report that LE/L cholesterol accumulation already interferes with IAV infection at the early step of endosomal escape, thus contributing to the IFN-induced host cell defense against incoming IAV, and that the protective function is promoted via IFITM3. To address the issue of whether blocked LE/L cholesterol egress acts as a cellular restriction factor for IAV replication independently of the IFN/IFITM3 axis, we induced LE/L cholesterol accumulation either through pharmacological inhibition of the LE/L cholesterol transporter NPC1, the protein affected in Niemann-Pick disease, or via overexpression of the LE/L cholesterol balancing protein annexin A6 (AnxA6), which results in a phenotype reminiscent of NPC1 deficiency (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We show that this IFN-independent LE/L cholesterol accumulation did not affect IAV endosomal trafficking but did impair IAV cytosolic entry, most likely at the step of IAV/endosome membrane hemifusion, i.e., when lipid mixing prior to the release of the actual viral content occurs. Thus, our data support a model of LE/L cholesterol accumulation as a novel antiviral barrier and as a putative druggable host cell factor in IAV infection.
