 <p>Characterization of impaired IAV endosomal escape. (A) A549-WT cells transfected with myc-IFITM3 or empty vector as a control were infected with IAV particles labeled with SP-DiOC and R18 (PR8M; MOI of 10). To monitor lipid mixing of virus envelope and endosomal membranes, dequenching of SP-DiOC was measured by FACS analysis at 1 h p.i. (10,000 cells per condition). Data are expressed as percentages of the mean numbers of SP-DiOC-positive cells in the empty vector control and represent mean values ± SEM of results from three independent experiments. *,

SP-DiOC-positive cells or DiD-positive cells were identified by FACS analysis at 1 h p.i. (10,000 cells per condition). Data are expressed as percentages of the mean number of SP-DiOC-positive cells or DiD-positive cells in the untreated A431-WT cell sample and represent mean values ± SEM. (C) A549-WT cells were either left untreated or exposed to U18666A (U18) (2 µg/ml, 16 h) and/or bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and were infected with dually labeled IAV (PR8M; MOI of 10). SP-DiOC-positive cells were identified by FACS analysis at the indicated times p.i. (10,000 cells per condition). Data were expressed as geomeans of SP-DiOC signals in the respective samples, and the slopes of linear regression were calculated. Histograms of the original FACS results are depicted at the bottom of the panel. Histogram marker M1 defines the SP-DiOC-positive cell subpopulation. Download
