  <p>LE/L cholesterol accumulation inhibits IAV/host membrane fusion. (A) A549-WT and A549-IFITM3KO cells were either left untreated or exposed to IFN-β (10 ng/ml, 16 h), U18666A (U18) (2 µg/ml, 16 h), or bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and were infected with dually labeled IAV (PR8M; MOI of 10). SP-DiOC-positive cells were identified by FACS analysis at 1 h p.i. (10,000 cells per condition). Data are expressed as percentages of the mean number of SP-DiOC-positive cells in the untreated A549-WT cell sample and represent mean values ± SEM. **, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01; ****, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test). (B) A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells transfected with control (siC) or IFITM3-specific (siIFITM3) siRNA were either left untreated or incubated with bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and were infected with dually labeled IAV (PR8M; MOI of 10). SP-DiOC-positive cells were identified by FACS analysis at 1 h p.i. (10,000 cells per condition). Data are expressed as percentages of the mean number of SP-DiOC-positive cells in the untreated A431-WT cell sample and represent mean values ± SEM. *, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05 (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test).
