  <p>LE/L positioning is linked to LE/L cholesterol. (A) A549-WT cells transfected with GFP or YFP-NPC1 were left untreated or exposed to IFN-β (10 ng/ml, 16 h). A549-IFITM3KO cells were left untreated or exposed to U18666A (U18) (2 µg/ml, 16 h). All cells were then loaded with LysoTracker Red DND-99 to label acidic endosomes. Bar, 5 µm. (B) From each LysoTracker-positive object, the number of neighbors in a 30-px radius was determined with the help of the ImageJ plugin collection “BioVoxxel Toolbox.” Data are expressed as the frequencies of distribution determined for at least 5 cells per condition.</p>
