  <p>Impact of LE/L cholesterol accumulation on the sequential steps of IAV host cell entry. (A) A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells were infected with IAV (PR8M; MOI of 50) at 4°C for 1 h. An acidic bypass was applied to induce fusion at the plasma membrane, and infection through endosomal uptake was blocked by bafilomycin A1 (Baf) treatment. Cells were further incubated for 8 h, stained for NP, and analyzed by FACS for NP-positive cells. Data are expressed as the mean percentages ± SEM of NP-positive cells from three independent experiments. (B) A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells were infected with IAV (PR8M; MOI of 10). M1 protein levels were monitored by Western blotting, and blots were probed for tubulin to verify equal levels of loading. Mean M1 signal intensities ± SEM of results from three independent experiments were calculated relative to the mean M1 intensity detected in A431-WT cells 30 min p.i. (C) A431-WT and A431-AnxA6 cells were infected with IAV (×31; MOI of 20). Cells were fixed and stained 1 h p.i. with the A1 antibody to detect the acid-induced conformation of HA (HAac). The signal intensity per cell was quantified by ImageJ analysis. Mean values ± SEM were calculated from 55 individual cells per condition from at least two independent experiments. ns, not significant (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test).</p>
