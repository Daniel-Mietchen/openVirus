  <p>IFN-β induces cholesterol accumulation in acidic endosomes in A549 cells. (A) A549-WT cells or (B) A549-IFITM3KO cells were left untreated or exposed to IFN-β (10 ng/ml, 16 h) and loaded with LysoTracker Red DND-99 to label acidic endosomes. Unesterified cellular cholesterol was stained using filipin (blue). Filipin pixel intensities were pseudocolored according to the LUT and are shown as a heat map, with the gradient of colors ranging from blue (lowest intensity) to white (highest intensity). Bar, 20 µm. Colocalization coefficients of LysoTracker with filipin were quantitated from z-stacks. Mean values ± SEM were calculated from 35 individual cells per condition from at least two independent experiments. **, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01; ****, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001 (unpaired Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test). (C) A549-WT and A549-IFITM3KO cells were exposed to IFN-β (10 ng/ml, 16 h). The fractions of early endosomes (EE) and late endosomes/lysosomes (LE) were enriched from postnuclear supernatants (PNS) through sucrose gradient separation and analyzed for their cholesterol levels. Data are expressed as mean cholesterol concentrations (in micrograms per milliliter) ± SEM from at least three independent gradients. **, 
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01; ns, not significant (two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple-comparison test).
