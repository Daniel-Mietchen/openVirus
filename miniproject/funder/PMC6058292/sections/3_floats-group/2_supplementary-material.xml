 <p>A549 IFITM3 knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 editing. (A) IFITM3 protein levels in lysates of A549-WT and A549-IFITM3KO cells either left untreated or exposed to IFN-β (10 ng/ml, 16 h) were analyzed by immunoblotting. Equal levels of protein loading were verified using GAPDH antibody. STAT1 served as a positive control for IFN-induced gene expression. (B) An antibody recognizing both IFITM2 and IFITM3 was used to analyze IFITM2 protein levels in the A549-IFITM3KO cells. GAPDH served as a loading control. (C) A549-IFITM3KO cells exposed to U18666A (U18) (2 µg/ml, 16 h) were stained for cellular cholesterol using filipin and were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Filipin pixel intensities were pseudocolored according to the LUT and are shown as a heat map, with the gradient of colors ranging from blue (lowest intensity) to white (highest intensity). Bar, 20 µm. Download
