 <p>IFN-β induces endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. (A) A549-WT cells left untreated or exposed to IFN-β (10 ng/ml, 16 h) were stained for LE/L marker protein CD63. Unesterified cellular cholesterol was visualized using filipin (blue). Filipin pixel intensities were pseudocolored according to the LUT and are shown as a heat map, with the gradient of colors ranging from blue (lowest intensity) to white (highest intensity). Bar, 20 µm. Colocalization coefficients of CD63 with filipin were quantitated from z-stacks. Mean values ± SEM were calculated from 35 individual cells per condition from at least two independent experiments. ****, 
  <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001 (unpaired Student’s 
  <italic>t</italic> test). (B) Numbers of voxels positive for both filipin and LysoTracker or for filipin or CD63 individually were related to the total number of LysoTracker-positive (or CD63-positive) voxels. Mean values ± SEM were calculated from 35 individual cells per condition from at least two independent experiments. **,
