<p>Hypoalbuminemia has been proven to be a risk factor for the development of AKI. Yet, patients with AKI did not show statistically significant median differences in albumin levels compared with those without AKI in the current study. Severe transaminitis was observed in 40.3% (27/67) of the patients, whereas 30.5% (18/59) of those in the AKI group had hyperbilirubinemia. Dengue patients with elevated transaminases &gt;1,000 U/L, particularly if coexisting with hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and prolonged PT and aPTT, are more likely to develop AKI. The binding of the dengue virus onto hepatocytes will initiate hepatocellular apoptosis and later trigger the enhancement of a hostâ€™s immune reaction, causing a cytokine storm that results in elevated transaminase levels [

The increase in AST levels was more prominent than that in ALT levels, which suggests that cellular injury by dengue virus from extrahepatic sources contributes to AST elevation. Bilirubin may act as a direct nephrotoxin and may promote renal susceptibility to ischemia [
