<p>In contrast to all patients in the non-AKI group who had completely recovered at the time of discharge, death occurred in 9 (12.7%) patients in AKI group. All death cases in our study had multi-organ failure, and they were categorized as DHF grade IV, severe dengue, and AKI stage 3. Similar to our findings, a previous study showed that all death cases had occurred in the AKI group [
