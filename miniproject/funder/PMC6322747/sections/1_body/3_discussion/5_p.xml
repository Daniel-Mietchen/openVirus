<p>We observed statistically significant median differences in WBC count, along with its differential counts, for patients in the AKI group. In this context, neutrophils generate reactive oxygen species, leading to tubular cell damage, whereas lymphocytes play a role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which lead to the inflammatory process of AKI [

Despite being very rare, dengue patients have been known to present with AKI due to thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by severe thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. As for direct nephrotoxic drug use, only four patients had received tenofovir and four had taken NSAIDs during their illness, and none of them belonged to the AKI group. Therefore, we could not put this data into our statistical analysis.
