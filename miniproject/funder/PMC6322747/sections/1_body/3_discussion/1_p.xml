<p>This large-scale, single-center retrospective study assessed the association of AKI with DVI. Studies performed in Taiwan in 2008 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and in Malaysia in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported an AKI prevalence of approximately 4.0%, which is slightly lower than that reported in our study (4.8%). Both studies were conducted using almost similar age groups, were performed in all DVI spectrums, and used the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria as the basic diagnostic criteria for AKI. In contrast, a study published in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and another in 2018 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] using the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria found much different AKI prevalence of 20.7% and 13.7%, respectively. A majority of patients included in these studies had severe dengue. An even higher AKI prevalence in adult dengue patients was reported in India in 2016 using the KDIGO criteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]: 69.4%, which may have been very high owing to a small sample size. However, that particular study did not mention the severity of DVI in the included patients. Several studies conducted among critically ill, non-dengue patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) demonstrated that the KDIGO criteria were more sensitive than their RIFLE criteria and were either better or equal to AKIN criteria in detecting the presence of AKI in those populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Another study also reported that the KDIGO criteria were more sensitive than the RIFLE and AKIN criteria in detecting AKI in non-ICU patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, the current study used admission SCr as baseline SCr that may have underestimated severity and prognosis of patients.
