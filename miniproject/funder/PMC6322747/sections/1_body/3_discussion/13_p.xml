<p>The present study has some limitations. First, we relied only on the serum creatinine level to stratify AKI. Second, we used serum creatinine levels on admission as baseline, which were difficult to determine in some patients. Third, because this was a retrospective study, all of the investigations depended on cliniciansâ€™ decision. Fourth, we studied hospitalized adult DVI patients; hence the results cannot be generalized to the whole population of DVI cases. However, our study is strengthened by a large patient population and the comprehensive description of AKI among dengue patients.</p>
