<p>High-grade fever was notable in 17 (23.6%) patients from the AKI group. The presence of a high-grade fever may further contribute to dehydration in dengue patients, in parallel with hypovolemia due to plasma leakage and bleeding. Almost all patients who developed altered levels of consciousness belonged to the AKI group (0.1% and 15.3% in non-AKI and AKI groups, respectively). Such altered consciousness in patients might have resulted from shock, electrolyte disturbances, or uremic encephalopathy. During the period of hospitalization, 14 (19.4%) patients in the AKI group developed dyspnea, among which 11 (78.6%) progressed into respiratory failure in need of mechanical ventilation. Dyspnea with concurrent metabolic acidosis, along with the presence of shock, are the most common conditions associated with AKI in dengue [
