<p>The pathogenesis of AKI in DVI is complex, and therefore, it is difficult to determine the exact mechanism involved. Nevertheless, it is assumed that dengue-associated AKI results from either direct injury [

 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], or hypotensive mechanisms resulting from shock [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Histopathological analyses were not performed for our patients, and therefore, we could not demonstrate the evidence of direct injury or immune-mediated mechanisms. Direct invasion of the dengue virus and the production of cytotoxic cytokines may result in rhabdomyolysis, causing AKI [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our study, less than 50% of the patients in the AKI group were investigated for CPK levels, the results of which may not represent an actual association despite being statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.018). A total of 16 (22.2%) patients in the AKI group had a MAP of &lt;65 mmHg that is associated with shock. Shock-induced AKI may cause a reduced or even total loss of the renal autoregulation function and a low MAP. In our study, however, only 11 (15.3%) patients advanced into shock. Although the mechanism of AKI in dengue is unclear, the most commonly assumed cause includes hypotensive mechanisms resulting from shock [
