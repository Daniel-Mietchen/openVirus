<p>Dengue patients with a history of hepatitis B infection are more likely to develop AKI. Hepatitis B may lead to glomerulonephritis due to the deposition of HBsAg and HBeAg, which in turn result in hematuria, proteinuria, and reduced GFR. However, history of hepatitis B infection was not associated with AKI in current study. Conversely, obesity was found to be an associated factor for the development of AKI in our study. An earlier investigation has reported that obesity is a risk factor for AKI, as explained by alterations of renal hemodynamics, which increase the susceptibility to AKI [

Additionally, increased production of inflammatory cytokines from adipose tissue in response to acute illness plays a role in the development of AKI. Furthermore, we established that patients with severe dengue are more likely to develop AKI, and this finding is consistent with those in previous studies [
