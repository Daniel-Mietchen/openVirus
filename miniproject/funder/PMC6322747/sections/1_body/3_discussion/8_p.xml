<p>Our study demonstrated that male sex is associated with an increased risk of developing AKI. This finding supports previous studies, which also show that males are more likely to develop AKI [

Furthermore, testosterone has fibrotic and apoptotic properties that can increase the production of TNF-Î±, in turn triggering the inflammatory process leading to AKI. In our study, a history of diabetes mellitus was also shown to increase the risk of developing AKI. A previous report has also demonstrated similar findings [
