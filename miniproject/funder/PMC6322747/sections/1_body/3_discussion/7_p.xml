<p>A decrease in GFR will result in retention of waste products, which in turn will lead to electrolyte disturbances, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Our study showed statistically significant median differences in serum sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels between the AKI and non-AKI groups. Metabolic acidosis is commonly found in dengue-associated AKI. In the current study, patients in the AKI group showed a higher proportion of metabolic acidosis in comparison to those in the non-AKI group. However, complications of patients in current study may not be solely due to DVI itself, because pre-morbid diseases or other viral or bacterial co-infections may play roles in the occurrence of complications in this group of patients.</p>
