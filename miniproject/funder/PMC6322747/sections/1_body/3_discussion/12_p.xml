<p>Recovery of renal function, defined as either the absence of AKI criteria or discontinuation of RRT following dialysis-requiring AKI [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], was reported in several studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], although persistent renal insufficiency has been previously shown to occur in 45.3â€“48.4% of patients with dengue-associated AKI [

 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, dengue patients who have been diagnosed with an episode of AKI are more likely to develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD). After multiple episodes of AKI, nephron loss triggers glomerular hypertrophy in the remaining nephrons, which is worsened by intrarenal hypertension and hyperfiltration [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In our study, patients with AKI also showed a longer duration of hospitalization, similar to that reported in other studies [
