<p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a disorder that affects people worldwide and has high morbidity and mortality. There is a large burden of AKI cases in Asian countries, many of which have been identified in the more tropical regions. The reported incidence of AKI in a hospital setting was 19.4% in Eastern Asia, 7.5% in Southern Asia, 9.0% in Central Asia, 16.7% in Western Asia, and 31.0% in Southeastern Asia [

In contrast to AKI in non-tropical regions, AKI in the tropics predominantly occurs in younger population and is mainly caused by infections. The incidence of AKI in tropical acute febrile illnesses is 41.1%; among 7.6% of patients with dengue, more than a third had AKI [
