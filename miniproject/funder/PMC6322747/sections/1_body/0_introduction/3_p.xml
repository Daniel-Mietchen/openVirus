<p>Although the exact mechanism of dengue virus infection (DVI) in AKI is unclear, several theories have been proposed, including direct injury [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], an indirect mechanism via the immune system [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], hemolysis or rhabdomyolysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and hypotensive mechanisms resulting from shock [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The development of AKI continues to be associated with poor DVI outcomes. Additionally, AKI in DVI doubles the length of a typical hospital stay [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Dengue patients with AKI were reported to have case-fatality of 0.9%â€“60% [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, a lack of multi-center studies and the under-reporting of AKI in the tropics are obstacles in understanding its true epidemiology. The high prevalence of dengue-associated AKI previously reported in Malaysia [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] encourages more studies to be conducted, particularly in the developing countries of Southeast Asia. Until recently, there has been only one similar study conducted in children in Thailand [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Owing to the increasing number of severe dengue cases reported in Thailand over the past decade, further vigorous investigations should be undertaken to help clinicians make accurate early diagnoses to help prevent AKI. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and associated factors of AKI among adult dengue patients.
