<p>The prevalence of AKI among hospitalized dengue-infected adults in our study was 4.8%. We found that older age, male sex, a history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, severe dengue, and the presence of coexisting bacterial infections were associated factors for developing AKI. Patients with dengue-associated AKI also had a higher mortality compared with that of patients without AKI. Our findings highlight the need for cliniciansâ€™ awareness of AKI in DVI, particularly regarding patients with factors associated with a greater risk of developing AKI. The evaluation of clinical and laboratory characteristics of dengue patients will help clinicians initiate timely and appropriate therapy for dengue-associated AKI.</p>
