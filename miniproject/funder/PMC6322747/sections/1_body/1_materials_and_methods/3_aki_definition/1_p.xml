<p>AKI was determined using the KDIGO criteria as per this protocol: stage 1: SCr increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or SCr increase 1.5–1.9 times from baseline; stage 2: SCr increase 2–2.9 times from baseline; stage 3: SCr increase three times from baseline, or initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). The SCr data on admission were chosen as the baseline value for the determination of AKI. For patients with only a single SCr result, the baseline SCr was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation by assuming a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 75 ml/min/1.73 m
