<p>The sample size was calculated using a formula according to primary objective for prevalence estimation [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] based on previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] for an error of 1%, at 95% confidence interval (CI). Sample size calculation was also adjusted to include secondary objective, which was to determine associated factors for AKI by using a formula for two independent proportions (two-tailed) [
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with alpha of 0.05% and power of 80%. Finally, a minimum sample size of 1,476 was sufficient for this study. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, IL, USA). Qualitative variables were expressed as frequencies along with percentages. Quantitative variables were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) due to a skewed data distribution resulting even after transforming the data using logarithmic functions. The chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, and Mann–Whitney tests were performed, wherever appropriate. Selected variables with a 
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.10 in univariate analysis were further analyzed using a stepwise multivariate logistic regression model to obtain independent associated factors of AKI [adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI]. Forward stepwise method was used with entry at 0.05 and removal at 0.10. All variables were classified to be statistically significant if their two-tailed 
 <italic>P</italic>-value was &lt;0.05.
