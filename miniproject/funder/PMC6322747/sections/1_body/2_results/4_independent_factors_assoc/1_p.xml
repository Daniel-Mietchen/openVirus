<p>Based on univariate analyses and a thorough literature review, the following independent variables were placed into the full model: age (adjusted by 10 years), male sex, history of diabetes mellitus, history of hepatitis B infection, obesity, hypoalbuminemia on admission, severe transaminitis on admission, severe dengue, and coexisting bacterial infection. Categorical variables were placed into the model with entry at 0.05 and removal at 0.10 and were scored using ‘no’ as the reference category. After placing these numerous variables into the model, two confounding variables were eliminated: hypoalbuminemia and severe transaminitis. Finally, the following variables were established to be significantly associated with AKI in our present study: age (adjusted by 10 years), male sex, diabetes mellitus, obesity, severe dengue, and coexisting bacterial infection.</p>
