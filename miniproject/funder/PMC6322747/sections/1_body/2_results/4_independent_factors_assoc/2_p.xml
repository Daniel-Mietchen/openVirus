<p>From our analyses, the following variables were statistically likely to promote the development of AKI: an increase in 10 years of age (AOR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03–1.64), male sex (AOR 3.49; 95% CI, 1.75–6.95), a history of diabetes mellitus (AOR 2.89; 95% CI, 1.05–7.93), obesity (AOR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.00–3.77), severe dengue (AOR 5.45; 95% CI, 2.47–12.04), and coexisting bacterial infection (AOR 6.15; 95% CI, 2.57–14.74). The current multivariate regression model demonstrated a sensitivity of 81.8% (95% CI, 48.2%–97.7%), specificity of 95.2% (95% CI, 93.6%–96.5%), positive predictive value of 16.9% (95% CI, 12.0%–23.4%), and negative predictive value of 99.8% (95% CI, 99.2%–99.9%). The results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in
