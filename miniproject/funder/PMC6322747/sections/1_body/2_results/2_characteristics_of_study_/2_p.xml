<p>Laboratory parameters of patients recorded on admission are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0210360.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Statistically significant differences were observed in the medians of serum sodium, serum potassium, serum bicarbonate, serum total bilirubin, AST, ALT, urine specific gravity, WBC count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, atypical lymphocytes, PT, INR, aPTT, CPK, and serum lactate levels (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the AKI group, 10 patients presented with serum creatinine levels of &gt;3.0 mg/dL on admission. In addition, in the AKI group, 30.5% (18/59) of patients had hyperbilirubinemia during hospitalization, with a very high serum total bilirubin level of 27.6 mg/dL reported for one patient. Approximately 73.1% (49/67) of the AKI cases were categorized as having moderate to severe transaminitis, along with very high AST (&gt;48,000 U/L) and ALT (&gt;26,000 U/L) values observed during the hospitalization period, each found in different patients. The median urine specific gravity in the AKI group was 1.020 (1.013â€“1.025;
