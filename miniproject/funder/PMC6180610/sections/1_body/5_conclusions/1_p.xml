<p id="Par32">In this paper, we have systematically analysed the relationship between geographical spread of influenza A (H7N9) epidemics and spatiotemporal distribution of bird species in China. Specifically, we have identified key bird species and geographical hotspots that are relevant to the introduction of H7N9 epidemics in six major epidemic areas in China (i.e., Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong). First, we have conducted phylogenetic analysis on both HA and NA segments of influenza A (H7N9) virus isolated in chicken in China from 2013 to 2017. The reconstructed phylogenetic tree reveals three major epidemic waves in chicken in Eastern China along the East Asian-Australasian flyway of migratory birds. Second, with the help of a citizen science project, we have collected more than 157â€‰272 bird observation records of 1145 bird species all over China using a crowd-sourcing data collection platform. By implementing cross correlation analysis, we have identified the key species from 150 common migratory bird species for each municipality/province, whose temporal distribution are strongly relevant to time series of H7N9 cases within five weeks. Accordingly, we have finally identified potential hotspots of H7N9 epidemics based on the spatial distribution of identified migratory bird species in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. The findings in this paper would help public health authorities to implement active surveillance and control during the epidemic season of AIVs.</p>
