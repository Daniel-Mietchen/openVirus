<p id="Par24">With respect to geographical spread of influenza A (H7N9) virus, the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (and the date-calibrated tree in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>) reveals that there exist three major epidemic waves in chicken in Southeast China. The first wave happened mainly in Zhejiang and Jiangsu (marked in green and blue at the top-right corner in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) in the spring of 2013. After that, the virus gradually spread to Southern China (i.e., Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong), and broke out in Guangdong in 2014. While the third wave happened in almost all provinces in Eastern China from 2014 to 2017 (see subtree at the top-left corner in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and potentially new strain of H7N9 virus emerged. These observations are consistent with Liu et al.â€˜s findings about human infections of influenza A (H7N9) virus [
