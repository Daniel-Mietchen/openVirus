<p id="Par27">Geographic distribution and kernel density of the identified bird species with positive lags (
 <italic>Lag</italic> ≤ 5) are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The size of nodes in blue represents the number of birds, while the coloured surface represents the density magnitude of bird species after smoothing. In this paper, we focus mainly on the geographical spread of influenza A (H7N9) virus in Eastern China along the East Asian-Australasian flyway. Based on the locality of observation, the geographical hotspots of bird species that are relevant to the introduction of H7N9 virus are further investigated within each municipality/province. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> illustrates the potential hotspots of H7N9 epidemics based on the geographical distribution of identified migratory bird species in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. It can be observed that most hotspots are located either along the coastal areas or around large lakes. For example, there are hotspots in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong that are along the east coast of China. In Jiangsu Province, there is another hotspot that is around Taihu Lake and close to Wuxi City and Suzhou City. In Jiangxi Province, the major hotspot is located around Poyang Lake.
