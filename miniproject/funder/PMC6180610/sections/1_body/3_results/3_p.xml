<p id="Par25">During the three epidemic waves, the sequences of H7N9 virus have evolved and spread across Southeast China, where migratory birds may play an important role. Accordingly, the CCF analysis is conducted based on 150 common migratory bird species, which are selected with the help of bird experts, to explore their correlations and corresponding lags with respect to the identified H7N9 cases in chicken in China. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the results of CCF analysis for each bird species in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. Time series of bird observation records with different positive lag values are analysed, where the lags are measured by weeks. The values of correlation coefficients greater than or equal to 0.27 are shown in different colours, while corresponding bird species with positive lags (i.e., 
 <italic>Lag</italic> ≤ 10) are demonstrated in x-axis. In doing so, a list of migratory bird species can be identified for each municipality/province (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>), which may be responsible for the introduction of influenza A (H7N9) epidemics in these areas. It can also be observed from Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> that the CCF results and temporal distribution of identified bird species in Jiangxi Province are different from other municipality/provinces. The reason is that besides bird migration, poultry trading is also one of the most important reasons for geographical spread of influenza A (H7N9) virus. The result suggests that deeper investigation should be implemented to explain such differences in the future.
