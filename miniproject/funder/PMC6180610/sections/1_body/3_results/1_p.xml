 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> demonstrates the phylogenetic tree constructed using the NJ approach based on 184 intercepted HA and NA segments of influenza A (H7N9) virus in China during January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. Each leaf is labelled with the name abbreviation of a sequence, where the first two letters stand for the isolated municipality/province, and the last two numbers stand for the year of isolation. The sequences isolated from the same municipality/provinces are marked with the same colour. Bootstrap values greater than 0.5 are shown at the branches. It can be observed that most sequences isolated at the same municipality/province and in the same year are clustered together (e.g., sequences isolated in Guangdong with brown colour in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Note that in this paper, we only use the NJ tree for illustration, similar results can be obtained using MP and ML approaches (see Additional files
