<p id="Par26">The observation records of identified bird species with positive lags (
 <italic>Lag</italic> ≤ 5) are integrated by weeks with respect to the date of observation in Shanghai and other five provinces. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> demonstrates both time series of H7N9 cases and observation records of identified bird species, which are mapped into one year starting from week 40. It can be observed that there is a strong correlation between influenza A (H7N9) cases and the amount of identified bird species within five weeks. Further, the CCF analysis is conducted to evaluate the cross correlation between time series of H7N9 cases and identified bird species in each municipality/province. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the analysis results, where the dotted blue line indicates that the threshold value of correlation coefficient is 0.27. It can be observed that in each municipality/province, there is at least one lag within five weeks with a correlation coefficient greater than the threshold.
