<p id="Par31">It is important to point out that due to the data availability at this moment, there still have several limitations in this paper. First, we only explored the relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of migratory birds and the spread of influenza A (H7N9) cases in chicken in China. In the future, it would be more meaningful to further explore the relationship between bird migration and the spread of other AIVs (e.g., H5N1). Second, the bird observation data is imbalanced in China. It can be observed from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> that there are more observation records along the East Asianâ€“Australasian flyway (i.e., the Eastern China), but relatively fewer observations along the Central Asian flyway (i.e., the Western China). However, it does not indicate that the number of bird species in Eastern China is larger than that in Western China. One possible reason is that peoples in Eastern China have relatively higher income such that they are more likely to be bird-watching enthusiasts. With the help of the citizen science project, it is expected that more bird observation data will be collected in the future. In doing so, the impact of the data imbalance problem should be negligible. Third, in this paper, we only identified geographical hotspots in six municipality/provinces, which account for 91.2% of the total number of isolated H7N9 cases in chicken in GISAID. By unifying both molecular evolution of AIVs and spatial ecology of migratory birds, it would be possible to carry out a systematic analysis on different types of AIVs in China to investigate the risk of newly emerging AIVs through recombination and/or reassortment. To achieve this goal, we make an appeal to colleagues in the study of AIVs that it is better to annotate gene sequences of avian isolates with detailed information (e.g., specific bird names and GPS locations) when uploading to the GISAID database. Finally, it is important to note that although we have identified key bird species and geographical hotspots based on CCF analysis, it does not mean that the H7N9 cases in corresponding locations are introduced by migratory birds. The reason is that poultry trading is also one of the most important reasons for the geographical spread of influenza A (H7N9) virus. In this case, it would be necessary to involve poultry trading data into future analysis.
