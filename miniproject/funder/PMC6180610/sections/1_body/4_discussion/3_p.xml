<p id="Par30">During breeding or winter seasons, many bird species aggregate at favourable stopovers or habitats with high population density, which are critical for transmission of AIVs among different migratory bird species, and between migratory and domestic fowls [

In view of this, such gathering locations of bird species are more likely to be the ancestral locations, where reassortment or recombination of different AIVs takes place. In this case, the crowd-sourcing data collection platform for bird species all over China provide a new viewpoint to predict and monitor the spread, recombination, and reemergence of AIVs among migratory birds. Specifically, based on the collected 157â€‰272 observation records of 1145 bird species in China, we have conducted an in-depth investigation on the relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of migratory birds and historical epidemics of influenza A (H7N9). A list of key bird species as well as their geographical hotspots have been identified for the implementation of active surveillance about influenza A (H7N9) at high epidemic areas. In the future, it is expected to integrate bird observation data in China with more comprehensive records from eBird. With the joint efforts of ornithologists, epidemiologists and molecular biologists, a thorough investigation about AIVs in birds all over the world can be conducted to assess the potential intercontinental movement of influenza A (H7N9) virus, as well as the possible introduction pathway of novel AIVs across continents [
