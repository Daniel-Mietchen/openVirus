<p id="Par28">In order to achieve active surveillance of AIVs in China, it would be critical to systematically identify relevant bird species and their geographical hotspots at a finer-grained scale. In this case, one of the most important issues is to investigate the migratory patterns of various bird species. Traditionally, the bird banding method is widely used by ornithologists to help in keeping track of the movements of bird species and their life history. However, it is very costly and time-consuming to recycle bird rings. Usually, only about 0.3% rings can be recycled. With the development of GPS technologies, the satellite tracking method has been widely used in tracing bird migration pathways [

In recent years, based on the concept of citizen science, it is possible to collect huge amounts of bird observation data from a large-scale area with the help of thousands of bird-watching enthusiasts through crowd-sourcing data collection platforms [

Similarly, in China, thousands of bird-watching enthusiasts have spontaneously set up a China Bird Watching Network and shared their observations through the Bird Record Center of China (

Since 2003, the China Ornithological Society has published several annual reports, namely China Bird Report, to share complied and vetted bird records based on birdwatchers’ observations [
