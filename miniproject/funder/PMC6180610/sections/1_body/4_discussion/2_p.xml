<p id="Par29">Recently, with the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, it is becoming easier to isolate gene sequences of AIVs. The GISAID provides a global platform for sharing avian influenza gene sequences, which are annotated with some additional information, such as the provincial location and the date of isolation. Along this line, many phylogeographic studies have focused on investigating global footprint of influenza A virus (e.g., H5N1) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, because most annotations of AIVs in GISAID do not provide either precise latitude and longitude coordinates of isolation sites or species-specific information (e.g., bird names) associated with avian isolates, phylogeographic analysis can only be implemented at a coarse-grained scale. It has been argued that to promote more through phylogeographic study, it would be better to provide as precise information about avian influenza isolates as possible for GISAID. To make up for such limitations, in this paper, we have identified key migratory birds from 1145 bird species in China. Specifically, the spatiotemporal distribution of identified key bird species can perform as a
