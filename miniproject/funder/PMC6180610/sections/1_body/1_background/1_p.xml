<p id="Par15">The geographical spread of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) has been and will continue to be a serious public health concern in China. Since February 2013, the influenza A (H7N9) with a high mortality rate in humans has been spreading in the Yangtze River Delta and is still prevalent in Eastern China till now [

As one of the three major flyways for bird migration that pass by China (i.e., the Central Asian, East Asian-Australasian and West Pacific migratory bird flyways), the risk of avian influenza spreading in Eastern China, including the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, is especially high. Although great efforts have been made to investigate the global spread of AIVs based on intercontinental flyways of migratory birds [
