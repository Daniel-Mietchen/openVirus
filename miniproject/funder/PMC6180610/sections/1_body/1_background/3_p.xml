<p id="Par17">In 2005, a global network for AIVs among wild birds nationally and internationally was appealed to the United States Congress to promote the worldwide surveillance. Since then, many genetic sequence databases, such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.gisaid.org</ext-link>/), have been designed to encourage the sharing of all influenza type viral sequences. In doing so, phylogenetic analysis can be implemented to uncover genomic characterization and molecular evolution of the circulating AIVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Based on the coalescent theory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the demographic history of a host population, such as the effective population size, can further be reconstructed from a phylogenetic tree by assuming different parametric models on the population dynamics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. More importantly, with the high throughput sequencing technology, it would also be possible to integrate genetic variability and evolution of AIVs with virus-host ecology (e.g., migratory birds). Along this line, many phylogeographic studies have been conducted to analyse the relationship between global spread of AIVs and migration flyways of migratory birds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, because most of the isolated viral sequences in GISAID are annotated without precise geographical location and specific virus-host information, such studies can only be implemented at a coarse-grained scale.
