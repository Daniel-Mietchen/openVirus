<p id="Par16">As a natural reservoir of AIVs, birds in wetlands and aquatic environments, such as Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, harbour the major avian influenza viruses [

To combat the growing threat of bird flu, many studies have been conducted to estimate the prevalence of various AIVs in different bird species and localities. For example, Olsen et al. have reviewed the global prevalence of influenza A viruses in wild birds, such as ducks, gulls, terns, and waders [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Bi et al. have collected and isolated influenza H5N1 viruses from sick or dead birds in the Sanmenxia Reservoir Area of China in 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the influenza A (H7N9) virus with respect to all bird species across the country.
