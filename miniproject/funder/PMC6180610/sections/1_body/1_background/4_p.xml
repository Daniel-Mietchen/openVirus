<p id="Par18">In this paper, we aim to identify the possible bird species and geographical hotspots that are relevant to the spread of influenza A (H7N9) at a finer-grained scale in China. First, we collect all gene sequences of H7N9 from GISAID, which are isolated in chicken in China from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. Accordingly, phylogenetic trees are constructed using the MEGA software to explore their evolutionary relationship in terms of geographical locations. Then, based on 157â€‰272 observation data of 1145 bird species in China, we adopt the cross correlation function (CCF) to investigate the relationship between the identified influenza A (H7N9) cases in chicken and the spatiotemporal distribution of migratory bird species. In doing so, we identify a list of possible bird species that are relevant to the isolated influenza A (H7N9) cases in six municipality/provinces with high incidences. Finally, we explore and visualize geographical hotspots of those identified bird species. Both the identified bird species and their geographical distribution would provide sentinel signal and evidence for the implementation of active surveillance in bird flu intervention and control.</p>
