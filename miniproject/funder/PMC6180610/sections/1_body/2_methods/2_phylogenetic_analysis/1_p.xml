<p id="Par21">The HA and NA segments of selected influenza A (H7N9) virus were first aligned by CLUSTAL W algorithm implemented in Clustal v.2.1 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Then, the HA and NA fragments were intercepted to be the same length in BioEdit v.7.0.5 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees of the spliced HA and NA sequences were constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML) approaches. The nucleotide substitution model was determined using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) in jModelTest v.2.1.10 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. With respect to our dataset, the General Time Reversible model assuming a rate variation across sites according to a gamma-shaped distribution with invariant sites was selected. For the NJ approach, the composite maximum likelihood algorithms were used to estimate the transversion/transition bias and the nucleotide substitution patterns. For the ML approach, the heuristic searching strategy for the best topology was started via five random BioNJ trees, and those trees were moved by nearest-neighbour interchange. Tree reliabilities were tested with 1000 bootstrap replicates to yield a majority consensus tree. To clearly demonstrate the reconstructed phylogenetic tree in this paper, branches with bootstrap values less than 0.6 were filtered out. Then, the remaining 184 gene sequences (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> for detail) were reconstructed using the NJ, MP, and ML approaches, respectively. Moreover, a date-calibrated tree is also generated to reveal the epidemic waves of influenza A (H7N9). Finally, the NJ tree was visualized, edited and coloured in FigTree v.1.4.3 (
