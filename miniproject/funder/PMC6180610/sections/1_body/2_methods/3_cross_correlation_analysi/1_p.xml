<p id="Par22">In statistics, cross correlation was used for measuring of the similarity between two series as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other. In this paper, the sample cross correlation function (CCF) was adopted to identify lags of observed migratory birds that might be useful predictors of influenza A (H7N9) incidences. A positive 
 <italic>Lag</italic> value represented the correlation between the amount of observed bird species at time 
 <italic>t</italic> and the number of influenza A (H7N9) cases at time 
 <italic>t</italic> + 
 <italic>Lag</italic>. The CCF command in R software (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>/) was 
 <italic>ccf</italic>(
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, 
 <italic>Lag</italic>), where 
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> represent time series of H7N9 cases and migratory birds, respectively. Specifically, the CCF analysis was implemented to analyse bird observation data collected from Shanghai and five provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong) with high H7N9 infections. One reason to select these six municipality/provinces was that they are geographically close to each other in Eastern China, and the number of identified H7N9 cases in these areas accounted for 91.2% of the total number of isolated cases in chicken in China based on the collected data from GISAID. Therefore, it would be helpful to investigate the possible bird species and hotspots in a finer-grained scale in these areas for the implementation of active surveillance on the potential epidemics of influenza A (H7N9). The identified hotspots in specific municipality/province were illustrated using the kernel method in ArcGIS v10.5 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., RedLands, California, USA).
