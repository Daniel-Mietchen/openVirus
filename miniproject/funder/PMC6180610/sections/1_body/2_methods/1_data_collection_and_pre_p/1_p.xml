<p id="Par19">Full- or partial- length hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences of influenza A (H7N9) virus isolated in chicken in China were collected from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. Each sequence was associated with an isolated ID, and annotated with a location (i.e., municipality or province) and the date of isolation. In this paper, we adopted HA and NA subtypes with lengths greater than or equal to 1683 and 1398, respectively, to construct the phylogenetic trees. After removing duplicated sequences, 495 sequences remained for further analysis. All the 495 aligned sequences were included in Additional file
