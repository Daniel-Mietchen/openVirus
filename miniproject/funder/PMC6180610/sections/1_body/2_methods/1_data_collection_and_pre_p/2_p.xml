<p id="Par20">The bird observation data was collected from a citizen science project, where thousands of bird-watching enthusiasts and experts share their observations through an online forum. Totally, there are 1145 bird species observed in China. Each record is about one bird species, which includes the scientific name, the locality (i.e., the longitude and latitude), the date of observation, the number of observed birds and the observer’s name. All observation records were checked by bird experts based on the biological nature of each bird species, and then published in China Bird Report annually. Since many observers may watch birds at the same location and date, in this case, only one record with the largest number of observed birds was retained, and all other reduplicated records are filtered out from the dataset. After removing duplications, there remained 157 272 observation records during the year 2008 and 2009. Further, with the help of bird experts, we selected 150 common migratory birds from the totally 1145 bird species for CCF analysis (see Additional file
