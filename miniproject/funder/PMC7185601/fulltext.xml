Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most predominant cause of HCC. Concerns arise for the presence of additional risk factors, as there is still a large proportion of patients without HBV or HCV infection. Previous studies have reported that higher intake of fruits and vegetables and reduced consumption of red/processed meat might play a protective role in HCC etiology, though the nationwide proof is limited. Hence, we studied multiple risk factors including food habit, lifestyle, and clinical implications of HCC patients in Bangladeshi. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data, as well as data on food habits, were collected in this study. Our results indicated that a high intake of rice (AOR 4.28, 95% CI 1.48 to 14.07, p = 0.011), low intake of fruits (AOR = 4.41 95% CI 1.48&#x02013;15.46; p = 0.012), leafy vegetables (AOR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.32&#x02013;6.08; p = 0.008), and fish (AOR = 4.64 95% CI 2.18&#x02013;10.23; p&#x0003c;0.001) increased the HCC risk. Moreover, a high intake of eggs (AOR = 2.07 95% CI 0.98&#x02013;4.43; p = 0.058) also showed an increased risk. Roti, non-leafy vegetables, red meat, and tea were found to have no association with HCC risk. This study revealed that food habit patterns and lifestyle may have a profound effect on HCC development among Bangladeshi patients in addition to well established risk factors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>University Grant Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh</institution></funding-source><award-id>Grant no. 4308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5440-0315</contrib-id><name><surname>Karim</surname><given-names>M.

The international agency for research on cancer estimated approximately 0.84 million incidences and 0.78 million mortalities worldwide in 2018, which will rise to 1.36 million incidences and 1.28 million deaths by the year 2040. Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer, and it was the third cause of mortality worldwide in 2018 among all sexes. Rates of both incidence and mortality are 2 to 3 times higher among men in most of regions worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Dynamic temporal trends, marked variations among geographic regions, racial and ethnic groups, and between men and women, and the presence of several well-documented environmental potentially preventable risk factors are several exciting epidemiologic features of HCC [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown that HCC occurs worldwide, mostly due to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The other recognized risk factors for HCC include chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, exposure to dietary aflatoxin, smoking, fatty liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes, etc. [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent evidence found a positive correlation between obesity and increased risk of liver cancer through chronic inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Another risk factor is diabetes, which may also increase the risk of liver cancer [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The major risk factors vary from region to region [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In China and Africa, which are the most high-risk HCC areas, the major risk factors are chronic HBV infection and aflatoxin. On the other hand, in Japan and Egypt, the primary risk factor is attributed to HCV infection [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. People from low-risk HCC areas are also prone to obesity and diabetes as a risk factor [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Bangladesh is one of the countries facing a considerable burden of HCC. HCC is the third most common cancer in the country, and it is just behind lung cancer and stomach cancer [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HBV infection is the leading cause of HCC in Bangladesh, which is estimated at 46.9% to 61% [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there is not much information on the definite risk factors of HCC and no appropriate and reliable data showing the etiological and epidemiological perspectives yet.</p><p>Furthermore, there is no available data regarding the Bangladeshi population to understand the cause of developing HCC in those patients who do not have any HBV or HCV infection. Apart from the most common and defined etiological factors, the association of diet with the development of HCC is unclear [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previously, few studies were investigating the role of food habits in the development of HCC worldwide. It is evident from those studies that food habits may play an important role in HCC development. Different studies claimed an inverse relation of milk [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], fiber and whole-grains [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], white meat [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], fruits and vegetables [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and fish [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with HCC. In contrast, a high intake of red meat [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] has been associated with increased risk of HCC; however, there is no sufficient evidence on the association between HCC and egg consumption [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, intense investigations are required to develop insights about clinical features, etiological factors, and epidemiology of HCC in Bangladesh. In this study, we took an elaborate history of HCC patients, details of food habit patterns, smoking and drinking habits, and also checked clinical profiles and etiological agents of HCC patients. Our study sheds light on the association of HBV and HCV infection for the development of HCC, as well as some other risk factors like food habit patterns, and smoking and drinking habits for the development of HCC in Bangladeshi patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study population</title><p>In the present hospital-based case-control study, we observed 80 patients with HCC who attended a tertiary care facility from November 2018 to July 2019. This facility is the largest postgraduate public medical university in Bangladesh, located in the capital city, Dhaka, and acts as a reference center for patients having unmanageable diseases. After matching the demographic characteristics of HCC patients, such as age, sex, income, and sociodemographic status, 101 control subjects were chosen. Among the patients visiting public hospitals in Bangladesh, most are the poor and lower-middle-income groups. Hence, we assumed that only this group of people represented the study population in this particular research study. This study was approved by the ethical committee of that particular tertiary hospital and was conducted according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) clinical practice guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Patients having a BMI of &#x0003e;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were marked as obese, and patients with a BMI of &#x0003c;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were considered as non-obese. Patients&#x02019; blood samples were drawn under fasting conditions, and the accompanying tests, for example, complete blood count (CBC), albumin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), international normalized ratio (INR), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were performed for diagnosis purpose. Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging and Child-Pugh scores were determined from laboratory tests, and clinical features obtained from diagnostic reports. Patients were categorized into four BCLC stages, for example, Early-stage, A; Intermediate stage, B; Advanced stage, C; and Terminal stage, D. BCLC staging was determined by physician, and patients&#x02019; performance status, tumor size and number, Child-Pugh score and portal vein involvement [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] were documented according to EASL guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Data collection</title><p>We collected patients&#x02019; demographic, clinical, and biochemical information through an interview with a structured questionnaire. Demographic information, such as age, sex, education, earnings, food habits, HCC etiologies, and first presenting symptoms were collected. Diverse clinical and biochemical information such as serum levels of total bilirubin, albumin, INR, AFP, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, presence of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, was collected from patient&#x02019;s diagnostics reports. A liver radiologist deliberately looked into patients' computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography report and the size, area, number of tumor lesions, portal vein thrombosis were noted. Child-Pugh classification and BCLC staging of the patients were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Assessment of dietary habit</title><p>The data on food consumption per capita were obtained by an interview-based, structured questionnaire. The survey incorporated the food habit pattern from both cases (n = 80) and controls (n = 101). Through a case-control statistical analysis, we explored the link between food habit patterns and HCC development. In the case of fruits and vegetables, seasonal consumption and the corresponding duration are subject to variation. The dietary items included 82 foods or food groups and were divided into 9 sections: i) rice (primary course); ii) bread, and roti (secondary course); iii) leafy vegetables (water spinach, pumpkin leaves, taro stem, Indian spinach, spinach, red amaranth, cauliflower, cabbage); iv) non-leafy vegetables (okra, tomato, balsam apple, eggplant, carrot, pumpkin, potatoes, sweet potatoes); v) meat and meat-based food items such as burger, sandwich; vi) fish (both river and ocean); vii) milk, tea, coffee, sugar, tea with condensed milk; viii) fruit (litchis, mangoes, jackfruits, blackberries, dates, guavas, pineapple, papayas, bananas, watermelon, coconuts, apples, grapes, oranges, tropical fruits, etc.); ix) sweets, rice-based desserts, and soft drinks. The selection of food items was based on foods regularly consumed by the Bangladeshi people. The standard serving size was obtained from the dietary guidelines from BIRDEM (Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine, and Metabolic Disorders) [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We focused on the above-mentioned food items to explore the relationship between these food groups and the advancement of HCC in the Bangladeshi population. The consumption rate among our case-control population of targeted food groups was transformed into g/day or ml/day. In the case of tea it was considered as cup/day. Consumption of specific food items of more than the suggested value is defined as &#x0201c;high intake.&#x0201d;</p><p>In contrast, the consumption of specific food items of lower than the suggested value is defined as &#x0201c;low intake.&#x0201d; A recent report suggested an inverse association of tea intake with primary liver cancer; however, the preparation of tea in Bangladesh or South Asia is different compared to Western countries. In Bangladesh, condensed milk with sugar is commonly used to prepare the tea. Moreover, the tea leaves are usually continuously boiled for a long time. Hence, we investigated the primary or combined effect of tea drinking on the risk of HCC with or without the presence of other risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data management and statistical analysis were performed using R statistical software [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Continuous variables were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages or frequencies. The Chi-square (&#x003c7;2) test with continuity correction was employed to find significant differences between groups. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using the multiple logistic regression model. For the regression strategy, we first performed bivariate analysis of the potential factors with the outcome variable of interest. If the bivariate results were significant at 20% level, we considered them in the regression model. In addition, certain variables were included in the model for their importance from demographic and clinical perspectives regardless of the results of the bivariate analysis. These included age, sex, diabetes status, and weight status (overweight or normal). The analysis was performed to assess the effect of risk factors on the likelihood of developing HCC. A <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Demographic characteristics of the study sample</title><p>In the present study, patients of both sexes, with different age groups, social, marital, educational, and professional backgrounds have been selected (<xref rid="pone.0232121.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our sample consisted of 80 study patients and 101 healthy controls. Of the study subjects, 64 were male, and 16 were female with a calculated sex ratio of 4:1. The mean age of the study population was 48.7&#x000b1;14.8 years and 47.1&#x000b1;14.2 years for the controls. The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as 23.8&#x000b1;2.6 for the study group and 23.7&#x000b1;2.7 for the controls. For both study and control groups, there were more patients with no education, followed by patients with the primary education level completed. These two categories comprised two- thirds of the total study population. A large subset of patients (20 cases and 23 controls) was employed by the government or in non-government services. Regarding the employment, the highest category (21 patients) was found for people involved in different kinds of businesses, and 15 patients were farmers. Among 16 women in the study population, 14 were housewives. While we shed light on economic solvency based on income level, roughly 58% of the patients had an income between 20,000&#x02013;50,000 BDT per month. More than 90% of the patients were married, and about 73% lived in rural areas.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0232121.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

etiological variables of our study sample. As it is already recognized that the most common etiology for HCC is cirrhosis of the liver, 78% (62) of our HCC patients also reported cirrhosis leading to HCC. Next, we found smoking (50% reporting) as a risk factor followed by HBV infection, which accounted for 39 (49%) of our patients. We found only 6 (8%) patients having HCV infection. There were no patients diagnosed jointly infected with both hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses. Surprisingly, 35 (44%) patients were found to be negative for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. 23 (29%) of the patients were diabetic while 17 (21%) had both diabetes and positive HBV/HCV infection. While smoking together with hepatitis B was the sole etiology for 22 (28%) patients, only 3 (4%) patients had the etiological history of smoking along with hepatitis C. Consumption of alcohol alone as etiology accounted for only 3 patients (4%). Alcohol consumption, however, is not very common in Bangladesh due to religious restriction and strict state law. Only 2 (2%) patients with alcohol intake along with hepatitis B were registered. However, there were no patients with hepatitis C reporting alcohol consumption. Given a large proportion of cirrhosis positive HCC patients with smoking behavior, we compared the smoking behavior and development of cirrhosis (<xref rid="pone.0232121.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

Many patients were unable to bear the costs of all biochemical and radiological diagnosis due to poor financial conditions. Some patients were not willing to provide their medical records. As a consequence, every patients&#x02019; diagnosis report was not accessible. Therefore, we mention the actual numbers of each parameter, which is the total number of HCC. In our cohort of study, the majority of patients 43 (66.2%) had a single nodule. Many of them 26 (45.6%) had a nodule size of 5&#x02013;10 cm. Different clinical features were depicted by patients, with 50 patients with hepatomegaly (72.5%), followed by 31 patients (44.9%) with splenomegaly. In addition, mild ascites was observed in 27 patients (38.6%), and 39 patients (55.7%) showed no ascites. Portal vein thrombosis was noted distinctly for 17 patients (24.6%) and 14 patients (19.4%) showed mild encephalopathy. The Child-Pugh score is a system determined by scoring five clinical measures such as total bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy for evaluating the prognosis of liver disease. It serves as a liver function marker and helps to determine appropriate treatment. Child-Pugh class A, B, and C are classified based on severity, with C being the most severe. As indicated by our study, most patients had Child-Pugh class A, 35 (47.9%), and B, 31 (42.5%).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0232121.t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0232121.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Clinical characteristics of HCC patients.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0232121.t003g" xlink:href="pone.0232121.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameter</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patients, N (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tumor size (cm)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.4 (3.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tumor size (binned)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;5 cm</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (22.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02013;10 cm</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (45.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;10 cm</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (31.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of tumors</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43 (66.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiple</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (33.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Portal vein thrombosis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52 (75.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (24.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hepatomegaly</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (27.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 (72.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Splenomegaly</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38 (55.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (44.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ascites</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39 (55.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (38.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (5.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Encephalopathy</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58 (80.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (19.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Child-Pugh score</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35 (47.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">B</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (42.5)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (9.6)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging and treatment</title><p>The magnitude of the tumor has been staged according to the BCLC classification (<xref rid="pone.0232121.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

35 (44%) patients negative for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. Hence, it is important to investigate whether any particular food group is primarily responsible for potential HCC risk. However, we did not observe any statistically significant difference in food habits, when comparing the patients who were hepatitis B or C positive with the rest of the patients (categorized as &#x02018;Other&#x02019;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232121.s001">S1 Table</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we characterized HCC patients in Bangladesh according to HBV and HCV infection, as well as some other risk factors like food habit patterns, smoking, and drinking habits for the first time regarding the Bangladeshi perspective. We represented unique profiles in terms of demographic factors, etiologies, disease-specific clinical representation, staging and treatment options, biomarker profiles, and an association of food habit patterns with the development of HCC for those patients. This represents the first-ever elaborated study accompanying factors other than HBV and HCV infection as a predominant cause of HCC in Bangladesh.</p><p>Among the 80 patients we studied, the male predominance was found, which is not surprising as it is evident that males are more susceptible to HCC than females [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In almost all populations, male to female ratios usually average between 2:1 and 4:1 [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our study, the male to female ratio was found to be 4:1. This is due to the sex-specific differences in exposure to the risk factors, because they are more likely to be infected with HBV and HCV, as well as alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and food habits. The liver is a hormone-sensitive organ, that&#x02019;s why sex hormones, such as androgen and estrogen, maybe an acting factor. It is assumed that androgen promotes HCC development, whereas estrogen plays a protective role [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The typical age group affected by HCC was 50&#x02013;59 and 60&#x02013;69, as we have found most patients corresponded to this age group. In a study performed in Bangladesh, a group found 41 to 50 years as the most common age group to develop HCC [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the United States, from the year 1992 to 2013 the age-specific incidence rate was highest in the age group of 50&#x02013;69. However, a significant number of patients were also found above the age of 70 [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The mean age of our study population was 48.71&#x000b1;14.8 years. The study conducted by Gani et al. (2013) comprised 57 HCC patients where the mean age was 45.81 &#x000b1; 15.31 years. The educational background represents the lack of awareness and knowledge, as a large proportion of patients had no education. According to the income level, most of the patients were of lower or lower-middle-income group and most of the patients were of rural origin. These represent the economic constraints to accessing necessary tests and treatments as well as the lack of suitable medical care in rural areas. HCC has always been a very much neglected disease in Bangladesh as most of the patients lack the economic capability and they also do not have proper knowledge about HCC. Other risk factors are a lack of medical facilities and delay of diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Chronic HBV and HCV infection is considered as one of the leading causes of the appearance of HCC in Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite the introduction of vaccination during 2003&#x02013;2005 into the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in Bangladesh, HBV infection remains abundant in the middle and older age adult population. Our data showed that chronic HBV was the significant risk factor contributing to the development of HCC, which is similar to the previous report [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and also similar with our neighboring country India [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although HCV is considered one of the leading causes of the appearance of liver cancer in many countries [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], in our study, HCV infection was found in only 8% of patients. Alcohol consumption is another risk factor of HCC in Western countries [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our study, only 4% of patients, including one patient with HBV infection, were found consuming alcohol as alcohol consumption is strictly restricted in Bangladesh by state law. Alcohol consumption is also very much restricted due to socioeconomic conditions and religious restrictions. According to our study, we found no significant value for alcohol as an individual risk factor. Donato et al. [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] examined the association between alcohol intake and HCC and found that for each level of alcohol intake, the highest risks were observed among subjects with HCV infection, followed by those with HBV infection, and finally by those without hepatitis virus infection. So, alcohol consumption is not an independent important risk factor in Bangladesh. In our study, we found 50% of patients were chain smokers and most of them had no HBV and HCV infection. The relationship between cigarette smoking and HCC has been examined in many studies. In almost all studies, both positive-association [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and lack-of-association [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] have been reported.</p><p>According to our study, smoking persisted as an independent risk factor in our country. The effect of smoking was also found to be an independent risk factor for HCC in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, smoking has been reported to increase the risk of development of HCC in people with HCV, HBV [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A synergistic combined effect of HBV/HCV and smoking might act mostly through increased risk of HCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232121.g001">Fig 1</xref>). So, there could be a synergistic interaction between tobacco smoking and HBV/HCV for the development of HCC in Bangladeshi patients. In our study we found 29% of patients were diabetic. The association between diabetes mellitus type II was found as an individual risk factor in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Though diabetes did not emerge as a strong individual risk factor in our study, we found a synergistic combined effect of HBV/HCV and diabetes for the development of HCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232121.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we did not observe any impact of obesity on the odds of HCC in our multivariate logistic regression model (<xref rid="pone.0232121.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we collected the first clinical symptoms that have been observed while the patients were admitted to the hospitals. It was evident that every patient came with multiple clinical symptoms which were representative symptoms of HCC. The habit of Bangladeshi patients avoiding clinical checkups and regular screening of disease has become a significant influence on the development of devastating diseases, including HCC. The major factors behind this are poverty and lack of education and awareness, which we have already mentioned. After being admitted to hospital, different imaging reports such as CT scan, ultra-sonographies, biochemical tests, and tumor markers were used for the detection of presence or severity of HCC. In Bangladesh, as mentioned before the diagnosis of the disease is usually delayed. As a result, the patients developed in BCLC stage B (intermediate stage) and C (advanced stage). Most of the patients of our study were in stage B and stage C. The BCLC staging was determined according to the patients' albumin, bilirubin, ascites, encephalopathy, imaging reports, tumor size, portal vein invasion, tumor site, Child-Pugh score, and prothrombin activity.</p><p>The BCLC staging helps in the decision of treatment options available for the patients by the clinicians. It narrows down the treatment options to provide particular treatments to the patients. Due to resource constraints and lack of treatment facilities, in addition to the limitation mentioned above, the treatment options were optimized to the most affordable options. Commonly, the patients of stage A were given ablation therapy, stage B patients were given chemoembolization, and stage C patients were given chemotherapy. Liver transplantation is not a popular treatment option in Bangladesh due to its high cost and other difficulties. Clinicians also try to avoid providing these treatment options to the patients. If any patients needed surgery, they were transferred to the surgery department. But in most of the cases, the hepatology department provides the ablation, chemoembolization, and chemotherapy without referring the patients to the surgery. In addition to the BCLC staging, AFP level which is a tumor marker helps in the diagnosis of HCC as well as provide insights into the treatment pattern.</p><p>Although the role of diet in the etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma is unclear, evidence suggests that dietary intake of particular food groups may have a favorable or adverse association with the risk of HCC [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For example, consumption of vegetables and fruits may have an inverse connection, while consumption of red meat can increase the risk of HCC. Not many studies have been evaluated to explore the link between food intake and liver cancer, either in our country or globally. In our study, analysis of dietary habits of HCC patients and controls indicated that diet has a relevant role in HCC risk. Rice is the staple food of the Bangladeshi population. Our study found a significant association of high rice intake with increased HCC risk. Previously, there was no evidence of association of rice intake with HCC risk; however, one study found null association between total carbohydrate intake and HCC risk [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As Bangladeshi people are more likely to eat rice frequently, it is relevant that rice may play a role as a dietary risk factor for HCC. Red meat has long been recognized as a dietary risk factor for HCC and significantly it has been proven that it has a positive relation with increased HCC risk. Huang et al. (2003) suggested that red meat intake may increase the risk of HCC. The polymorphism of the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene plays a role increasing the susceptibility of the effect of red meat in HCC development [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Cross et al. (2007) found that, red meat intake was associated with an elevated risk for liver cancer [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Red meat is the main source of heme iron and may increase HCC risk via the possible effect of iron such as hepatocyte injury and death and DNA damage in tissues by catalyzing lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the current scenario, the red meat consumption in Bangladesh is limited due to its very high price and most poor people&#x02019;s intake of red meat is in moderate or low amounts. The amount of consumption and also the frequency of consumption may play an important role for being a significant dietary factor for HCC development. In the perspective of our study, red meat has no association with increased risk of HCC. In our study, higher egg consumption was found to have significance for increased risk of HCC. However, two Italian studies suggested an inverse association between higher egg consumption and increased HCC risk [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The study by Bamia et al. (2014) found an inverse association of tea intake with HCC risk, which was attributed to the presence of polyphenols as an antioxidant, especially in green tea [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Our study was unable to retrieve any significant association between tea intake and HCC risk. Roti is also consumed in Bangladesh as a primary source of carbohydrates. The present study found no significant association of roti intake and risk of HCC. Leafy vegetables are group of crop plants that are grown for their edible leaves. Examples of leafy vegetables are various types of spinach, cabbage, parsley, and lettuce. However, the distinction between leafy and non-leafy vegetables is not always clear. Non leafy vegetables are potato, cucumber, tomato, eggplant, cauliflower, etc. While investigating the association of vegetables, we classified them as the above mentioned two groups. Surprisingly, we found significant association of lower intake of leafy vegetables with higher HCC risk. In other words, an increased intake of leafy vegetables might decrease the risk of HCC. We found no significant association between non-leafy vegetables and HCC risk. A prospective cohort study in Japan showed inverse associations between the consumption of vegetables, green&#x02013;yellow and green leafy vegetables and HCC risk [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. An association of overall vegetable consumption with reduced HCC risk was also found in studies conducted in China [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], Serbia [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], Japan [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and Italy [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is also noteworthy that another study conducted in Greece found no association of vegetable intake with risk of HCC [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our study found that higher consumption of fruits is significantly associated with decreased HCC risk. The role of fruit consumption in HCC risk is not properly established as there is substantial evidence of both association and no association. Talamini et al. (2006) and Vecchia et al. (1988) suggested a positive association of higher fruit intake with lower HCC risk [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In contrast, Yang et al. (2014) and Bamia et al. (2015) found no significant association [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The major fact is that vegetables and fruits are major sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and many bioactive compounds which are major effectors against cancer [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. That&#x02019;s why vegetable and fruit intakes are more likely to contribute to the prevention of cancer. Vegetables and fruits are also a major source of dietary fiber. The association of dietary fiber with decreased risk of HCC was found in a study conducted by Fedirko et al. (2012) [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In the case of fish and milk, we found that, increased consumption of these food items may reduce the risk of HCC. In other words, lower consumption of fish and milk have positive association with HCC risk. Higher consumption of white meat is evident in several studies to have a positive impact on reduced HCC risk [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and no other studies have reported results dissimilar to these studies. Fish intake is also proven to have an inverse association with increased HCC risk in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The supporting factor is that a diet rich in linoleic acid in foods such as white meats and fish, was inversely related to HCC risk [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. White meat and fish have less saturated fat and are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. HCC prevention is attributed to the function of n-3 PUFA, which possesses anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Milk consumption is not widely studied. However, there is also supporting evidence of higher milk consumption with reduced HCC risk in a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0232121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>From our study, it is evident that diet and food habits may play an essential role in the increased risk of HCC in the Bangladeshi population. Given cirrhosis is the major cause of HCC, the role of nutrition in the development of cirrhosis vs HCC warrants further research. In the perspective of our study, comparing the food habit pattern between cirrhosis positive and negative HCC patients did not give any significance due to the small number of valid responses (n = 80), and low number of responses per category per risk factor.

</p><p>PONE-D-19-34553</p><p>Epidemiology, clinical features, and impact of food habits on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: A case-control study in Bangladesh</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Associate Professor Karim,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. Please accept our apologise if the revision process has taken longer than expected.</p><p>This editor and the reviewers have found this study intriguing and the results of value. However, both the reviewers have raised substantial concerns (that I share) regarding some of the conclusions and have suggested additional analyses and clarification before the manuscript can be considered for publication. Therefore we all recommended a mayor revision and we invite the authors to resubmit the manuscript if the authors are able to address the comments.</p><p>In specific, the reviewer 1 (expert of nutrition/epidemiology) has raised concerns regarding the methodology of the nutritional analysis (the food intake can be better dissected according to FFQ; coffee to be stratified according to intake), the criteria for recruitment (this is also raised by reviewer 2); the logistic regression strategy and the exposure categories should also better clarified; he also suggested re-writing some of the sentences in light of state of the art literature.</p><p>The reviewer 2 (expert of hepatology/HCC) has provided the authors with important suggestions regarding the methodology to carry the analyses keeping in consideration the progression of chronic liver disease (thich is the major determinant of HCC risk!): HCC is rarely observed in a normal liver and dissecting the mutual relationship between nutrition/chronic liver disease/HCC is crucial for a sound interpretation of the results. It needs to be clarified 1) the nature of the control group (real controls? Chronic hepatitis without HCC? the latter group would be extremely precious ...); 2) how the authors dissect the interaction between the smoking/drinking behaviour and the underlying chronic liver disease in their analyses (this might require some re-thinking on the strategy to analyse the data as suggested); 3) Analysing independently those patients with viral hepatitis with those with other etiologies: especially in patients with ASH/NASH, nutritional factors will be per se a driver of chronic liver disease progression (and not only a contributing risk factor); 4) dissect in a multivariate fashion the role of nutrition on the development of cirrhosis vs. HCC and, as a consequence, how nutritional habits influence the development of HCC in patients that do not have cirrhosis yet.</p><p>I also think that, since some metabolic information is available (BMI, T2D), these factors should be considered (together with chronic liver disease) in the multivariate approaches suggested: considering the growing concern of the impact that the obesity epidemics will have on HCC risk (not only because of NASH, but also as obesity is a worsening factor of chronic liver disease from different etiologies), and given obesity is pretty much associated to nutritional habits, these analyses will help to better dissect the relationship between nutrition/obesity/chronic liver disease thus leading to HCC.</p><p>My opinion is that these are all reasonable suggestions that will greatly improve the impact of this manuscript; the outcome of these analyses will also provide suggestions to the scientific community for further studies to address the role of nutrition on HCC development thus not limiting the importance to the study to the impact for Bangladeshi community.</p><p>English should be revised by a native English; there are also multiple spelling errors and typos.</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Apr 09 2020 11:59PM.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p><p>Reviewer #1: Authors explored the association between food group intake in Bangladesh and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a hospital-based case-control study.</p><p>Introduction is quite long, more attention should be payed rather to nutritional part.</p><p>Part from line 78-95 should be shortened.</p><p>Authors should provide an explanation why they did not consider the following food groups in their analysis: whole-grains and cereals, coffee, nuts and legumes. Authors should consider that moderate coffee intake has been associated with decreased risk of HCC (PMID:&#x000a0;28846640). I suggest that authors add analysis for this food groups as they were included in FFQ.</p><p>Introduction line 101-105 authors should rephrase the sentence and improve the cited bibliography as references 19-25 correspond motel to individual case-control studies (published 20 years ago!) rather than comprehensive studies. Authors should refer to recent umbrella reviews summarising knowledge regarding HCC from prospective cohort and case-control studies and providing the level of evidence, as well as the most recent meta-analysis. It should be:</p><p>&#x0201c;Different studies claimed inverse relation of milk (PMID:&#x000a0;31199182), fiber and whole-grains (PMID:&#x000a0;31964201), white meat (PMID:&#x000a0;24588342), fruits and vegetables (PMID:&#x000a0;30764679), and fish (PMID:&#x000a0;25534918) with HCC. On the contrary, high intake of red meat (PMID:&#x000a0;24588342) has been associated with increased risk of HCC, however, there is no sufficient evidence on the association between HCC and egg consumption (PMID:&#x000a0;31379223).&#x0201d;</p><p>Study population. It is necessary to specify city and country in which were enrolled the individuals. Design of the study should be clearly specified: hospital-based case-control study.</p><p>Table 5 present data from multiple logistic regression, please add all the variables used in the adjustment in the table&#x02019;s footnote. Please present also unadjusted model of analysis. Adjustment covariates should be also listed in &#x0201c;statistical analysis section&#x0201d;.</p><p>I suggest authors revise English, as there are several misspellings along the manuscript.</p><p>It would be worth to provide exposure categories for example as g/day ml/day or serving/day.</p><p>Figures are fine.</p><p>Discussion seems fine.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The study is aimed to understand the present status of HCC in Bangladesh and more in detail to describe the role of different etiological factors in the development of HCC (viral agents, alcohol, smoking diabetes, food habits).</p><p>Main original elements are: the deep and appropriate analysis of food habits; the fact that it represents the first large study on this topic in Bangladeshi patients.</p><p>The collection of data is well carried out and the presentation of data ic clear and understandable.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study has some limitations and the authors should give further information:</p><p>1. Control subjects: it is not clear by which kind of people the control population is represented: are they normal subjects? are people affected by other tumors or other disease? are they represented by cirrhotic patients without HCC? This point is absolutely crucial in order to understand the results ot the table 1 of the work</p><p>2. Since smoking is considered a risk cofactor for tumors at all and for HCC (EASL, 2019), the author cannot state that the most common etiology for HCC was smoking (50% reporting) followed by the HBV infection. They need to better explain this concept, even because the so-called control group has a rather high percentage of smoking subjects (30%). Any consideration on the smoking as an etiological factor has to take into account the data that main etiological factor for HCC is the cirrhosis and the relationship between cirrhosis and smoking is not that clear.</p><p>3. What the authors mean for &#x0201c;alcohol consumption&#x0201d;? They have to better explain: is it intented as a general consideration on the possible role of alcohol consumption in the pathology of the patient or do they relate to a specific level of consumption?</p><p>Since the authors have carried out a very beautiful and detailed study on the food consumption, I would have expected some more details on this relevat etiological factor.</p><p>4. Surprisingly, 35 (44%) patients were discovered negative for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections: this is a very interesting data, but maybe the authors could analyse the data on food habits in this group of patients in comparison with the groups of patients with other established etiology (e.g. HBV and/or HCV). Their conclusions on the possible association between food habit and risk of HCC could be reinforced.</p><p>5. Are the authors able to distinguish between the role of food habits in the development of the underlying cirrhosis and the role in the comparison of HCC? This is not a peregrine observation, since cirrhosis is the most worldwide risk factor for HCC.</p><p>6. Actuallly, the authors need to clearly say how many HCC enclosed in this interesting work are to be considered primary or secondary to cirrhosis.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Dear Dr. Michele Vacca, M.D., Ph.D. </p><p>We thank you and the reviewers for the generous comments on our manuscript and have edited the manuscript to address the proposed concerns. We include with this submission a Point by Point letter explaining the reviewers&#x02019; comments carefully. We note that both referees particularly commented on the high standard and thoroughness of our work. In this revised submission we have significantly extended and revised our work and have addressed both the general and specific comments of the referees. Therefore, we believe the manuscript is suitable for publication in Plos One.</p><p>Response to Editor&#x02019;s Points:</p><p>It needs to be clarified </p><p>1) The nature of the control group (real controls? Chronic hepatitis without HCC? The latter group would be extremely precious ...); </p><p>Our response: The control group of this study is normal, healthy subjects (real control). </p><p>2) How the authors dissect the interaction between the smoking/drinking behaviour and the underlying chronic liver disease in their analyses (this might require some re-thinking on the strategy to analyse the data as suggested); </p><p>Our response: In our multivariate analysis, we found crude odds ratio for smoking to be significant (p=0.006) but the significance went away when adjusted for the rest of the predictors. This may suggest potential interaction between smoking behavior and one or more predictors in the model. This warrants further exploration.</p><p>Thus, we evaluated the effect of interactions between smoking and all the food intake variables. None of the interactions was significant when adjusted for the other predictors. None but one crude odds ratio was somewhat significant, which was leafyvegLow:smokingYes compared to leafyvegMedium:smokingNo.</p><p>Based on the findings, the interactions between smoking and food habit does not warrant to be included in the model.</p><p>We could not evaluate the interaction between sex and smoking because there was not a single female who smoke and have HCC. See the table below.</p><p>label levels Control HCC</p><p>sex F 20 (19.8) 16 (20.0)</p><p> M 81 (80.2) 64 (80.0)</p><p>smoking No 71 (70.3) 40 (50.0)</p><p> Yes 30 (29.7) 40 (50.0)</p><p>sex:smoking F|No 14 (13.9) 16 (20.0)</p><p> F|Yes 6 (5.9) </p><p> M|No 57 (56.4) 24 (30.0)</p><p> M|Yes 24 (23.8) 40 (50.0)</p><p>Since alcohol use is not as common in the study population, and also due to only a few responses who reported alcohol consumption, we did not investigate it&#x02019;s interaction with food habit.</p><p>3) Analysing independently those patients with viral hepatitis with those with other etiologies: especially in patients with ASH/NASH, nutritional factors will be per se a driver of chronic liver disease progression (and not only a contributing risk factor); </p><p>Our response: This is a great suggestion. However, our study only focused on analyzing HCC patients and we plan to analyze the suggested issues in the future studies. Thank you very much for your fruitful suggestion. </p><p>4) Dissect in a multivariate fashion the role of nutrition on the development of cirrhosis vs. HCC and, as a consequence, how nutritional habits influence the development of HCC in patients that do not have cirrhosis yet.</p><p>Our response: We thank the editor for this insightful feedback. Based on our understanding of the feedback, we believe, this is a topic that warrants further research.</p><p>Yet, using the current data, we fitted a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the cirrhosis using the same set of risk factors used for modeling the HCC. We did not find anything significant. This is perhaps due to small valid responses (n=80), and low number of responses per category per risk factor. A future study with a larger sample size would be necessary to answer this question.

However, they both do not appear to be significantly impacting the odds of HCC. The AIC=196.9 for the new model is slightly larger than the model without diabetes and weight status included in the model (AIC = 193.1) suggesting a slightly poorer fit. However, both models passed the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test. (N.B. added in the discussion, 491-493)</p><p>Reviewers&#x02019; comments and our Point by Point response: </p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Authors explored the association between food group intake in Bangladesh and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a hospital-based case-control study.</p><p>-Introduction is quite long, more attention should be payed rather to nutritional part. Part from line 78-95 should be shortened.</p><p>Our response: We shortened the section, according to the reviewer. </p><p>-Authors should provide an explanation why they did not consider the following food groups in their analysis: whole-grains and cereals, coffee, nuts and legumes. Authors should consider that moderate coffee intake has been associated with decreased risk of HCC (PMID: 28846640). I suggest that authors add analysis for this food groups as they were included in FFQ.</p><p>Our response: Whole-grains and cereals, coffee, and nuts are not very common in Bangladesh as a daily food habit. Legumes are consumed in Bangladesh as a vegetable, which we have included in our non-leafy vegetable group. </p><p>While coffee intake is associated with lower risk of HCC, we found no correlation in the Bangladeshi community because of lack of coffee drinking. However, most people in Bangladesh drink tea, and we include the impact of tea in this study. </p><p>-Introduction line 101-105 authors should rephrase the sentence and improve the cited bibliography as references 19-25 correspond motel to individual case-control studies (published 20 years ago!) rather than comprehensive studies. Authors should refer to recent umbrella reviews summarizing knowledge regarding HCC from prospective cohort and case-control studies and providing the level of evidence, as well as the most recent meta-analysis. It should be:</p><p>&#x0201c;Different studies claimed inverse relation of milk (PMID: 31199182), fiber and whole-grains (PMID: 31964201), white meat (PMID: 24588342), fruits and vegetables (PMID: 30764679), and fish (PMID: 25534918) with HCC. On the contrary, high intake of red meat (PMID: 24588342) has been associated with increased risk of HCC, however, there is no sufficient evidence on the association between HCC and egg consumption (PMID: 31379223).&#x0201d;</p><p>Our response: We are very grateful to the reviewer for the updated information and we also thank him for having been so helpful in editing the sentences. We changed the sentences as indicated by the reviewer.</p><p>-Study population. It is necessary to specify city and country in which were enrolled the individuals. Design of the study should be clearly specified: hospital-based case-control study.</p><p>Our response: We have added the following information in Material and methods, line 106 and 109. </p><p>-Table 5 present data from multiple logistic regression, please add all the variables used in the adjustment in the table&#x02019;s footnote. Please present also unadjusted model of analysis. Adjustment covariates should be also listed in &#x0201c;statistical analysis section&#x0201d;.</p><p>Our response: Table 5 (now Table 6, in the revised manuscript) only considered a subset of the original variables. We've now added a sentence to the Statistical Analysis section about our modeling strategies. There, we've mentioned that we first performed a bivariate analysis of all potential risk factors with the outcome of interest. Variables showing statistically significant at the 20% level, were considered for inclusion in the regression model. There were some exceptions to this rule. We've included age and sex regardless. Also, we've included diabetes and weight status (per the recommendation of one of the reviewers).</p><p>Since Table 5 (now Table 6) only lists the variables included in the model, there is no need to list them separately in the footnote. The table also lists crude odds ratio (univariate) as well as the adjusted odds ratio (multivariate setup adjusted for the remaining variables in the model).</p><p>We believe the approach we've taken is common in this type of study.</p><p>-I suggest authors revise English, as there are several misspellings along the manuscript.</p><p>Our response: We proofread the manuscript with the professional. </p><p>-It would be worth to provide exposure categories for example as g/day ml/day or serving/day.</p><p>Our response: The measuring unit for solid food was g/day and for liquid was ml/day. We mentioned it in the materials and methods section, line 146-147.</p><p>Figures are fine.</p><p>Discussion seems fine.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>The study is aimed to understand the present status of HCC in Bangladesh and more in detail to describe the role of different etiological factors in the development of HCC (viral agents, alcohol, smoking diabetes, food habits).</p><p>Main original elements are: the deep and appropriate analysis of food habits; the fact that it represents the first large study on this topic in Bangladeshi patients.</p><p>The collection of data is well carried out and the presentation of data ic clear and understandable.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study has some limitations and the authors should give further information:</p><p>-Control subjects: it is not clear by which kind of people the control population is represented: are they normal subjects? are people affected by other tumors or other disease? are they represented by cirrhotic patients without HCC? This point is absolutely crucial in order to understand the results of the table 1 of the work</p><p>Our response: The control population are healthy, normal subjects. And they are not affected by any tumor or other diseases. However, to avoid the artifact, during control selection we tried to match the age, sex, and socio-economic status of control subjects with the patient subjects. No control were cirrhotic patients. </p><p>- Since smoking is considered a risk cofactor for tumors at all and for HCC (EASL, 2019), the author cannot state that the most common etiology for HCC was smoking (50% reporting) followed by the HBV infection. They need to better explain this concept, even because the so-called control group has a rather high percentage of smoking subjects (30%). Any consideration on the smoking as an etiological factor has to take into account the data that main etiological factor for HCC is the cirrhosis and the relationship between cirrhosis and smoking is not that clear. </p><p>Our response: I agree with the reviewer that the main etiological factor for HCC is the cirrhosis. After analyzing our samples, we have found 62 out of 80 subjects were cirrhosis leading to HCC. Next we performed Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for association between cirrhosis positive HCC patients and non-cirrhosis HCC patients. We find an odds ratio of 4.75 with 95% CI (1.3 to 22.1) and two-sided p=0.015. This suggests a four-fold odds of developing cirrhosis among the smokers than among the non-smokers.</p><p>- What the authors mean for &#x0201c;alcohol consumption&#x0201d;? They have to better explain: is it intended as a general consideration on the possible role of alcohol consumption in the pathology of the patient or do they relate to a specific level of consumption? Since the authors have carried out a very beautiful and detailed study on the food consumption, I would have expected some more details on this relevant etiological factor.</p><p>Our response: Only three subjects in this study have consumed alcohol. And they seldom drink alcohol, one or two times in a month. So we cannot conclude an association between alcohol and Bangladeshi HCC cases. </p><p>- Surprisingly, 35 (44%) patients were discovered negative for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections: this is a very interesting data, but maybe the authors could analyse the data on food habits in this group of patients in comparison with the groups of patients with other established etiology (e.g. HBV and/or HCV). Their conclusions on the possible association between food habit and risk of HCC could be reinforced.</p><p>Our response: We compared patients with hepatitis B or C positive with the rest of the patients (categorized as &#x02018;Other&#x02019;) on food habits. We did not observe any statistically significant difference between the two groups on their food habits (Table S1).</p><p>- Are the authors able to distinguish between the role of food habits in the development of the underlying cirrhosis and the role in the comparison of HCC? This is not a peregrine observation, since cirrhosis is the most worldwide risk factor for HCC.</p><p>Our response: For this particular case-control study, we did not consider the cirrhosis positive control, hence we cannot conclude that food habits had a direct role in the development of the underlying cirrhosis.</p><p>- Actually, the authors need to clearly say how many HCC enclosed in this interesting work are to be considered primary or secondary to cirrhosis.</p><p>Our response: There were 80 HCC patients enclosed in this study. 62 out of 80 HCC patients were cirrhosis leading to HCC, while the rest, 18 HCC patients had no cirrhosis.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232121.s004"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0232121.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0232121.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0232121.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vacca</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Michele Vacca</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Michele Vacca</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0232121" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
