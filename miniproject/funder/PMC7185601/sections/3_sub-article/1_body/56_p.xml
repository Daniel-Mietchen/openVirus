<p>Authors should provide an explanation why they did not consider the following food groups in their analysis: whole-grains and cereals, coffee, nuts and legumes. Authors should consider that moderate coffee intake has been associated with decreased risk of HCC (PMID:Â 28846640). I suggest that authors add analysis for this food groups as they were included in FFQ.</p>
