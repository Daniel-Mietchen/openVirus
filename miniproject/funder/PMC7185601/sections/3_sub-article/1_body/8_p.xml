<p>The reviewer 2 (expert of hepatology/HCC) has provided the authors with important suggestions regarding the methodology to carry the analyses keeping in consideration the progression of chronic liver disease (thich is the major determinant of HCC risk!): HCC is rarely observed in a normal liver and dissecting the mutual relationship between nutrition/chronic liver disease/HCC is crucial for a sound interpretation of the results. It needs to be clarified 1) the nature of the control group (real controls? Chronic hepatitis without HCC? the latter group would be extremely precious ...); 2) how the authors dissect the interaction between the smoking/drinking behaviour and the underlying chronic liver disease in their analyses (this might require some re-thinking on the strategy to analyse the data as suggested); 3) Analysing independently those patients with viral hepatitis with those with other etiologies: especially in patients with ASH/NASH, nutritional factors will be per se a driver of chronic liver disease progression (and not only a contributing risk factor); 4) dissect in a multivariate fashion the role of nutrition on the development of cirrhosis vs. HCC and, as a consequence, how nutritional habits influence the development of HCC in patients that do not have cirrhosis yet.</p>
