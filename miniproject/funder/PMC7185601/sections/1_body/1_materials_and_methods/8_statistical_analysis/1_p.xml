<p>Data management and statistical analysis were performed using R statistical software [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages or frequencies. The Chi-square (χ2) test with continuity correction was employed to find significant differences between groups. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using the multiple logistic regression model. For the regression strategy, we first performed bivariate analysis of the potential factors with the outcome variable of interest. If the bivariate results were significant at 20% level, we considered them in the regression model. In addition, certain variables were included in the model for their importance from demographic and clinical perspectives regardless of the results of the bivariate analysis. These included age, sex, diabetes status, and weight status (overweight or normal). The analysis was performed to assess the effect of risk factors on the likelihood of developing HCC. A
