<p>The data on food consumption per capita were obtained by an interview-based, structured questionnaire. The survey incorporated the food habit pattern from both cases (n = 80) and controls (n = 101). Through a case-control statistical analysis, we explored the link between food habit patterns and HCC development. In the case of fruits and vegetables, seasonal consumption and the corresponding duration are subject to variation. The dietary items included 82 foods or food groups and were divided into 9 sections: i) rice (primary course); ii) bread, and roti (secondary course); iii) leafy vegetables (water spinach, pumpkin leaves, taro stem, Indian spinach, spinach, red amaranth, cauliflower, cabbage); iv) non-leafy vegetables (okra, tomato, balsam apple, eggplant, carrot, pumpkin, potatoes, sweet potatoes); v) meat and meat-based food items such as burger, sandwich; vi) fish (both river and ocean); vii) milk, tea, coffee, sugar, tea with condensed milk; viii) fruit (litchis, mangoes, jackfruits, blackberries, dates, guavas, pineapple, papayas, bananas, watermelon, coconuts, apples, grapes, oranges, tropical fruits, etc.); ix) sweets, rice-based desserts, and soft drinks. The selection of food items was based on foods regularly consumed by the Bangladeshi people. The standard serving size was obtained from the dietary guidelines from BIRDEM (Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine, and Metabolic Disorders) [

We focused on the above-mentioned food items to explore the relationship between these food groups and the advancement of HCC in the Bangladeshi population. The consumption rate among our case-control population of targeted food groups was transformed into g/day or ml/day. In the case of tea it was considered as cup/day. Consumption of specific food items of more than the suggested value is defined as “high intake.”
