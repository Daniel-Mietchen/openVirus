<p>According to our study, smoking persisted as an independent risk factor in our country. The effect of smoking was also found to be an independent risk factor for HCC in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, smoking has been reported to increase the risk of development of HCC in people with HCV, HBV [

In our study we found 29% of patients were diabetic. The association between diabetes mellitus type II was found as an individual risk factor in other studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Though diabetes did not emerge as a strong individual risk factor in our study, we found a synergistic combined effect of HBV/HCV and diabetes for the development of HCC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232121.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we did not observe any impact of obesity on the odds of HCC in our multivariate logistic regression model (
