<p>Among the 80 patients we studied, the male predominance was found, which is not surprising as it is evident that males are more susceptible to HCC than females [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In our study, the male to female ratio was found to be 4:1. This is due to the sex-specific differences in exposure to the risk factors, because they are more likely to be infected with HBV and HCV, as well as alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and food habits. The liver is a hormone-sensitive organ, that’s why sex hormones, such as androgen and estrogen, maybe an acting factor. It is assumed that androgen promotes HCC development, whereas estrogen plays a protective role [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The typical age group affected by HCC was 50–59 and 60–69, as we have found most patients corresponded to this age group. In a study performed in Bangladesh, a group found 41 to 50 years as the most common age group to develop HCC [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The mean age of our study population was 48.71±14.8 years. The study conducted by Gani et al. (2013) comprised 57 HCC patients where the mean age was 45.81 ± 15.31 years. The educational background represents the lack of awareness and knowledge, as a large proportion of patients had no education. According to the income level, most of the patients were of lower or lower-middle-income group and most of the patients were of rural origin. These represent the economic constraints to accessing necessary tests and treatments as well as the lack of suitable medical care in rural areas. HCC has always been a very much neglected disease in Bangladesh as most of the patients lack the economic capability and they also do not have proper knowledge about HCC. Other risk factors are a lack of medical facilities and delay of diagnosis [
