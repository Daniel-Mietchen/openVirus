<p>Chronic HBV and HCV infection is considered as one of the leading causes of the appearance of HCC in Bangladesh [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite the introduction of vaccination during 2003–2005 into the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in Bangladesh, HBV infection remains abundant in the middle and older age adult population. Our data showed that chronic HBV was the significant risk factor contributing to the development of HCC, which is similar to the previous report [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and also similar with our neighboring country India [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although HCV is considered one of the leading causes of the appearance of liver cancer in many countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], in our study, HCV infection was found in only 8% of patients. Alcohol consumption is another risk factor of HCC in Western countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In our study, only 4% of patients, including one patient with HBV infection, were found consuming alcohol as alcohol consumption is strictly restricted in Bangladesh by state law. Alcohol consumption is also very much restricted due to socioeconomic conditions and religious restrictions. According to our study, we found no significant value for alcohol as an individual risk factor. Donato et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] examined the association between alcohol intake and HCC and found that for each level of alcohol intake, the highest risks were observed among subjects with HCV infection, followed by those with HBV infection, and finally by those without hepatitis virus infection. So, alcohol consumption is not an independent important risk factor in Bangladesh. In our study, we found 50% of patients were chain smokers and most of them had no HBV and HCV infection. The relationship between cigarette smoking and HCC has been examined in many studies. In almost all studies, both positive-association [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and lack-of-association [
