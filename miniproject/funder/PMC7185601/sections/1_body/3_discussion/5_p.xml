<p>In our study, we collected the first clinical symptoms that have been observed while the patients were admitted to the hospitals. It was evident that every patient came with multiple clinical symptoms which were representative symptoms of HCC. The habit of Bangladeshi patients avoiding clinical checkups and regular screening of disease has become a significant influence on the development of devastating diseases, including HCC. The major factors behind this are poverty and lack of education and awareness, which we have already mentioned. After being admitted to hospital, different imaging reports such as CT scan, ultra-sonographies, biochemical tests, and tumor markers were used for the detection of presence or severity of HCC. In Bangladesh, as mentioned before the diagnosis of the disease is usually delayed. As a result, the patients developed in BCLC stage B (intermediate stage) and C (advanced stage). Most of the patients of our study were in stage B and stage C. The BCLC staging was determined according to the patients' albumin, bilirubin, ascites, encephalopathy, imaging reports, tumor size, portal vein invasion, tumor site, Child-Pugh score, and prothrombin activity.</p>
