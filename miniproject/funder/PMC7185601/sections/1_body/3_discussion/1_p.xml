<p>In the present study, we characterized HCC patients in Bangladesh according to HBV and HCV infection, as well as some other risk factors like food habit patterns, smoking, and drinking habits for the first time regarding the Bangladeshi perspective. We represented unique profiles in terms of demographic factors, etiologies, disease-specific clinical representation, staging and treatment options, biomarker profiles, and an association of food habit patterns with the development of HCC for those patients. This represents the first-ever elaborated study accompanying factors other than HBV and HCV infection as a predominant cause of HCC in Bangladesh.</p>
