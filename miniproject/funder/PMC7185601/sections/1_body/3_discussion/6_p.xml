<p>The BCLC staging helps in the decision of treatment options available for the patients by the clinicians. It narrows down the treatment options to provide particular treatments to the patients. Due to resource constraints and lack of treatment facilities, in addition to the limitation mentioned above, the treatment options were optimized to the most affordable options. Commonly, the patients of stage A were given ablation therapy, stage B patients were given chemoembolization, and stage C patients were given chemotherapy. Liver transplantation is not a popular treatment option in Bangladesh due to its high cost and other difficulties. Clinicians also try to avoid providing these treatment options to the patients. If any patients needed surgery, they were transferred to the surgery department. But in most of the cases, the hepatology department provides the ablation, chemoembolization, and chemotherapy without referring the patients to the surgery. In addition to the BCLC staging, AFP level which is a tumor marker helps in the diagnosis of HCC as well as provide insights into the treatment pattern.</p>
