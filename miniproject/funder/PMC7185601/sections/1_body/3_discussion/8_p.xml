<p>From our study, it is evident that diet and food habits may play an essential role in the increased risk of HCC in the Bangladeshi population. Given cirrhosis is the major cause of HCC, the role of nutrition in the development of cirrhosis vs HCC warrants further research. In the perspective of our study, comparing the food habit pattern between cirrhosis positive and negative HCC patients did not give any significance due to the small number of valid responses (n = 80), and low number of responses per category per risk factor. We believe, more intense research is required to find out the exact mechanism for the association of food habits with the risk of HCC as an additional risk factor other than already established risk factors.</p>
