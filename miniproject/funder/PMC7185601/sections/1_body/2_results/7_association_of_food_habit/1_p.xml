<p>In the present study, we intended to focus on the association between food habits and the risk of HCC in Bangladesh. An approved food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to evaluate the habitual diet of the study subjects and healthy controls. To select the variables for the regression model, we used predictors that were found to be significant at the alpha = 10% level in the bivariate analysis. However, to further control demographic confounders, we kept age and sex in the model, although they are not significantly different between the two groups.</p>
