 <xref rid="pone.0232121.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> represents the ordered distribution of the total number of individuals consuming low, moderate, or high amounts of particular food items, and the crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for HCC. Adjusted for other factors, the odds of developing HCC was 4.34 times for those with high rice intake compared to moderate intake (95% CI: 1.49–14.42, p = 0.010). Similarly, low intake of leafy vegetables (AOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 6.03, p = 0.009), low fruit intake compared to moderate (AOR 4.40, 95% CI: 1.47–15.51, p = 0.012), and low fish intake compared to moderate (AOR 4.64, 95% CI: 2.18–10.26, p&lt;0.001) increase the odds of HCC significantly. On the other hand, no significant association was found in the case of white meat, milk intake, having diabetes, and weight status (obese or normal). Age and sex were matched for the study, and as a result, they demonstrated no significance on the risk of HCC.
