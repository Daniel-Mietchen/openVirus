 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232121.g001">Fig 1</xref> outlines the etiological variables of our study sample. As it is already recognized that the most common etiology for HCC is cirrhosis of the liver, 78% (62) of our HCC patients also reported cirrhosis leading to HCC. Next, we found smoking (50% reporting) as a risk factor followed by HBV infection, which accounted for 39 (49%) of our patients. We found only 6 (8%) patients having HCV infection. There were no patients diagnosed jointly infected with both hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses. Surprisingly, 35 (44%) patients were found to be negative for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. 23 (29%) of the patients were diabetic while 17 (21%) had both diabetes and positive HBV/HCV infection. While smoking together with hepatitis B was the sole etiology for 22 (28%) patients, only 3 (4%) patients had the etiological history of smoking along with hepatitis C. Consumption of alcohol alone as etiology accounted for only 3 patients (4%). Alcohol consumption, however, is not very common in Bangladesh due to religious restriction and strict state law. Only 2 (2%) patients with alcohol intake along with hepatitis B were registered. However, there were no patients with hepatitis C reporting alcohol consumption. Given a large proportion of cirrhosis positive HCC patients with smoking behavior, we compared the smoking behavior and development of cirrhosis (
