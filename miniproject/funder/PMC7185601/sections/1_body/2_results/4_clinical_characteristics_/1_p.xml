<p>The medical records of 73 patients were reviewed and illustrated in 
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Many patients were unable to bear the costs of all biochemical and radiological diagnosis due to poor financial conditions. Some patients were not willing to provide their medical records. As a consequence, every patients’ diagnosis report was not accessible. Therefore, we mention the actual numbers of each parameter, which is the total number of HCC. In our cohort of study, the majority of patients 43 (66.2%) had a single nodule. Many of them 26 (45.6%) had a nodule size of 5–10 cm. Different clinical features were depicted by patients, with 50 patients with hepatomegaly (72.5%), followed by 31 patients (44.9%) with splenomegaly. In addition, mild ascites was observed in 27 patients (38.6%), and 39 patients (55.7%) showed no ascites. Portal vein thrombosis was noted distinctly for 17 patients (24.6%) and 14 patients (19.4%) showed mild encephalopathy. The Child-Pugh score is a system determined by scoring five clinical measures such as total bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy for evaluating the prognosis of liver disease. It serves as a liver function marker and helps to determine appropriate treatment. Child-Pugh class A, B, and C are classified based on severity, with C being the most severe. As indicated by our study, most patients had Child-Pugh class A, 35 (47.9%), and B, 31 (42.5%).
