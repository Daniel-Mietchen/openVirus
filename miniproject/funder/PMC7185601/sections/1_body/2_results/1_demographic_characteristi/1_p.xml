<p>In the present study, patients of both sexes, with different age groups, social, marital, educational, and professional backgrounds have been selected (
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our sample consisted of 80 study patients and 101 healthy controls. Of the study subjects, 64 were male, and 16 were female with a calculated sex ratio of 4:1. The mean age of the study population was 48.7±14.8 years and 47.1±14.2 years for the controls. The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as 23.8±2.6 for the study group and 23.7±2.7 for the controls. For both study and control groups, there were more patients with no education, followed by patients with the primary education level completed. These two categories comprised two- thirds of the total study population. A large subset of patients (20 cases and 23 controls) was employed by the government or in non-government services. Regarding the employment, the highest category (21 patients) was found for people involved in different kinds of businesses, and 15 patients were farmers. Among 16 women in the study population, 14 were housewives. While we shed light on economic solvency based on income level, roughly 58% of the patients had an income between 20,000–50,000 BDT per month. More than 90% of the patients were married, and about 73% lived in rural areas.
