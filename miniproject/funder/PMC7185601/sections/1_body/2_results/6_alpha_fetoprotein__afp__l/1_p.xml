<p>AFP is a tumor marker protein that can increase significantly in case of liver damage and certain other cancers. In our study we have documented the AFP levels of 73 patients, which have been shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. As indicated by our study, 4 (100%) patients with BCLC stage A had AFP levels greater than 1000 ng/ml. In the case of stages B and C, AFP levels were found to be higher than 1000 ng/ml for 20 (50%) and 18 (66.6%) patients, respectively, whereas for 19 (47.5%) and 7 (26.0%) patients, levels lower than 200 ng/ml were observed. Two out of 73 patients had BCLC stage D with AFP levels greater than 1000 ng/ml.
