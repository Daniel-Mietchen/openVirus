<p>Furthermore, there is no available data regarding the Bangladeshi population to understand the cause of developing HCC in those patients who do not have any HBV or HCV infection. Apart from the most common and defined etiological factors, the association of diet with the development of HCC is unclear [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previously, few studies were investigating the role of food habits in the development of HCC worldwide. It is evident from those studies that food habits may play an important role in HCC development. Different studies claimed an inverse relation of milk [

 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], white meat [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], fruits and vegetables [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and fish [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with HCC. In contrast, a high intake of red meat [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] has been associated with increased risk of HCC; however, there is no sufficient evidence on the association between HCC and egg consumption [
 <xref rid="pone.0232121.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, intense investigations are required to develop insights about clinical features, etiological factors, and epidemiology of HCC in Bangladesh. In this study, we took an elaborate history of HCC patients, details of food habit patterns, smoking and drinking habits, and also checked clinical profiles and etiological agents of HCC patients. Our study sheds light on the association of HBV and HCV infection for the development of HCC, as well as some other risk factors like food habit patterns, and smoking and drinking habits for the development of HCC in Bangladeshi patients.
