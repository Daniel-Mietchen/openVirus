<p>- What the authors mean for “alcohol consumption”? They have to better explain: is it intended as a general consideration on the possible role of alcohol consumption in the pathology of the patient or do they relate to a specific level of consumption? Since the authors have carried out a very beautiful and detailed study on the food consumption, I would have expected some more details on this relevant etiological factor.</p>
