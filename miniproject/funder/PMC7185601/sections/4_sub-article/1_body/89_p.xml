<p>- Since smoking is considered a risk cofactor for tumors at all and for HCC (EASL, 2019), the author cannot state that the most common etiology for HCC was smoking (50% reporting) followed by the HBV infection. They need to better explain this concept, even because the so-called control group has a rather high percentage of smoking subjects (30%). Any consideration on the smoking as an etiological factor has to take into account the data that main etiological factor for HCC is the cirrhosis and the relationship between cirrhosis and smoking is not that clear. </p>
