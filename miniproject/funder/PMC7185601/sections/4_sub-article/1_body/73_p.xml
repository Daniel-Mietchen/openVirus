<p>Our response: Table 5 (now Table 6, in the revised manuscript) only considered a subset of the original variables. We've now added a sentence to the Statistical Analysis section about our modeling strategies. There, we've mentioned that we first performed a bivariate analysis of all potential risk factors with the outcome of interest. Variables showing statistically significant at the 20% level, were considered for inclusion in the regression model. There were some exceptions to this rule. We've included age and sex regardless. Also, we've included diabetes and weight status (per the recommendation of one of the reviewers).</p>
