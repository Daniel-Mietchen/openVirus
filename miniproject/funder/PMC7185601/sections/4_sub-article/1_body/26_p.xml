<p>Yet, using the current data, we fitted a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the cirrhosis using the same set of risk factors used for modeling the HCC. We did not find anything significant. This is perhaps due to small valid responses (n=80), and low number of responses per category per risk factor. A future study with a larger sample size would be necessary to answer this question. (N.B. we have added few sentences, 587-591, in the discussion)</p>
