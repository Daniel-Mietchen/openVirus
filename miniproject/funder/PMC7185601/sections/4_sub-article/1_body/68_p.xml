<p>“Different studies claimed inverse relation of milk (PMID: 31199182), fiber and whole-grains (PMID: 31964201), white meat (PMID: 24588342), fruits and vegetables (PMID: 30764679), and fish (PMID: 25534918) with HCC. On the contrary, high intake of red meat (PMID: 24588342) has been associated with increased risk of HCC, however, there is no sufficient evidence on the association between HCC and egg consumption (PMID: 31379223).”</p>
