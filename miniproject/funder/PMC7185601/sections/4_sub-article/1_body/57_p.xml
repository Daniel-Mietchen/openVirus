<p>I also think that, since some metabolic information is available (BMI, T2D), these factors should be considered (together with chronic liver disease) in the multivariate approaches suggested: considering the growing concern of the impact that the obesity epidemics will have on HCC risk(not only because of NASH, but also as obesity is a worsening factor of chronic liver disease from different etiologies), and given obesity is pretty much associated to nutritional habits, these analyses will help to better dissect the relationship between nutrition/obesity/chronic liver disease thus leading to HCC.</p>
