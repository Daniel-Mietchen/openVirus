<p>Our response: I agree with the reviewer that the main etiological factor for HCC is the cirrhosis. After analyzing our samples, we have found 62 out of 80 subjects were cirrhosis leading to HCC. Next we performed Fisherâ€™s exact test for association between cirrhosis positive HCC patients and non-cirrhosis HCC patients. We find an odds ratio of 4.75 with 95% CI (1.3 to 22.1) and two-sided p=0.015. This suggests a four-fold odds of developing cirrhosis among the smokers than among the non-smokers.</p>
