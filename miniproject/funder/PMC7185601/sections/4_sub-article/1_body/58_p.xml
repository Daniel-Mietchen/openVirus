<p>Our response: We have included Type-2 diabetes and obesity status in the multivariable logistic regression model. However, they both do not appear to be significantly impacting the odds of HCC. The AIC=196.9 for the new model is slightly larger than the model without diabetes and weight status included in the model (AIC = 193.1) suggesting a slightly poorer fit. However, both models passed the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test. (N.B. added in the discussion, 491-493)</p>
