<p>Our response: In our multivariate analysis, we found crude odds ratio for smoking to be significant (p=0.006) but the significance went away when adjusted for the rest of the predictors. This may suggest potential interaction between smoking behavior and one or more predictors in the model. This warrants further exploration.</p>
