<p>As explained previously, antibodies are crucial for the serotype shifts and co-circulation. The E-coding region, a major target of neutralizing and enhancing antibodies, plays a significant role in antibody induction [

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree of the E gene showed that, before 2005, all DENV-1 strains were clustered in genotype IV, except for the strain isolated in 2001, which belongs to genotype I. After 2005, most of the strains were shown to be clustered in genotype I. However, since 2014, most of the isolated strains were shown to be genotype V. Every genotype shift led to an outbreak of DF. Genotype changes, from I to IV in 2002, from IV to I in 2005, and from I to V in 2014, were followed by large DF outbreaks in 2002, 2006, and 2014.
