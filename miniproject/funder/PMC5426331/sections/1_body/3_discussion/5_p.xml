<p>Phylogenetic tree analyses show that, before 2011, the strains isolated in the same year belonged to the same genotype, except for 2007. After 2011, the strains isolated in the same year belonged to different genotypes. In 2011, 2013, and 2014, genotypes I and V were detected, showing that different genotypes co-circulated at the same time. Higher genotype diversity leads to a higher rate of mutations, allowing the selection of more infective viruses. This may lead to the development of strains with an expanded range of pathogenic properties [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Even within the same genotype, the isolated strains were clustered in different clades, and the clade replacement was observed in many cases. Although the precise mechanisms underlying this diversity are unclear, DENV diversity may be shaped by complex interactions between the selective and stochastic forces. The selection pressure originating from different serotypes co-circulating in the population, density and biting activity of vector mosquitoes, and the stochastic genetic mutations, may play a role in the diversity of the clades.
