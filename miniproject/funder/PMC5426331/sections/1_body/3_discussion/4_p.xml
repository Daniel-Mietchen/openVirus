<p>Similar to other RNA viruses, the degree of genetic diversity of DENV is high, not only between different serotypes, but also between the genotypes. This may be caused by mutations, recombination, or migration, and it can be intensified by the increase in the size and density of the human host population [

The nucleotide and amino acid differences found in the E region between the strains isolated in Guangzhou were shown to be 0–9·9% and 0–3·7%, respectively. It remains unclear if the 3·7% amino acid difference can lead to the genotype shift and co-circulation, but a study investigating neutralizing antibodies against DENV-1 demonstrated that only two of 79 human monoclonal antibodies stimulated by genotype II showed strong binding and neutralizing activity against all five DENV-1 genotypes [
