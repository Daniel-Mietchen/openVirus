<p>Here, we report the prevalence of DENV in Guangzhou. Some studies suggest that DENV was imported from neighbouring countries to Guangzhou [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and ever since, all four DENV serotypes have circulated in all of these countries with equal frequency [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Four serotypes of DENV have been detected in Guangzhou, with at least three of them isolated from the imported patient cases [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, DENV-1 serotype was shown to be the most frequent. It is known that the antibody against one virus serotype can protect against secondary infection with the same serotype. Therefore, after a certain period, it is difficult for the first predominantly circulating serotype to transmit efficiently in the population. However, the neutralizing antibody is unable to provide protection against the infections with heteroserotypes of DENV. This may explain the serotype shift, which occurs when the first predominantly circulating serotype is replaced by a different serotype [
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, from 2001 to 2014, for more than 10 years, DENV-1 has been the dominate serotype. Additional investigations are necessary in order to determine why serotype shift has not occurred, whether the Guangzhou population is more sensitive to DENV-1 compared to other serotypes, or whether this serotype has a shorter multiplication time.
