<p>BEAST v. 1.8.2 analyses show that the mean substitution rate in Guangzhou was 7·77 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> per site per year. Compared to the mean substitution rates of DENV-1 in New Delhi, India (6·28 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and Colombia (8·58 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the substitution rate was shown to be average in Guangzhou for the period 2001–2014. The DENV-1 MCMC tree showed that the strains isolated in Guangzhou have different ancestors, which may lead to the elucidation of the origin and transmission pathways of DENV-1 strains in Guangzhou.
