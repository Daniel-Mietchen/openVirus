<p>The rate of nucleotide substitution per site per year and time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were determined using Bayesian inferences implemented in BEAST v. 1.8.2 [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The data were analysed using the year of isolation as calibration points for the estimation of divergence time in years. A General Time-Reversible model combined with the Gamma + Invariant Site model was used as the nucleotide substitution model. A log-normal relaxed (uncorrelated) molecular clock was used for the analysis. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain was run for 10 000 000 steps. The parameter was sampled every 1000 steps and the first 1000 steps of each run were discarded. Tracer v. 1.6 (
