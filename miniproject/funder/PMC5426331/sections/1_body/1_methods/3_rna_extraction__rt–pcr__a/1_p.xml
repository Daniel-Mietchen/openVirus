<p>RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, RT–PCR was conducted using the SuperScript III One-Step RT–PCR System with Platinum 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, USA). DEN750 (5′-CAAGAACCGAAACGTGGATG-3′) and DEN2639 (5′-TGTGGAAGCAAATATCACCTG-3′) primers were designed for the amplification of the full-length DENV-1 E gene. RT–PCR was performed using 1 μl of each primer at a concentration of 20 µ
 <sc>m</sc>. The reaction was initiated at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by a denaturation step at 94 °C for 2 min, and 40 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), primer annealing (52 °C for 30 s), and primer extension (72 °C for 2 min). The process ended with an extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. Amplified products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and sequenced using an ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Sequences were submitted to GenBank (
