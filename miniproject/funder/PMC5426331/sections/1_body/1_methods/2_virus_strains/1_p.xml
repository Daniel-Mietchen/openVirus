<p>DENV strains used in this study were isolated from the sera of the patients collected by the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangzhou CDC) between 2001 and 2014 in Guangzhou, China. Serum samples were diluted 50-fold with RPMI-1640 (Gibco, USA) and used to inoculate a C6/36 cell monolayer, which was incubated at 28 °C for 7–10 days. DENV-positive cell cultures, showing typical cytopathic effects (CPE), were verified by the indirect immunofluorescence test. Negative cell cultures were inoculated into a new C6/36 cell monolayer. The cells inoculated with serum samples that showed no CPE after three generations were considered negative. The supernatants of the positive cultures were stored at −80 °C.</p>
