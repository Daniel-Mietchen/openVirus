<p>A total of 123 strains of DENV-1 were isolated in the outbreaks occurring from 2001 to 2014, and their sequences were compared. One representative sequence from each year was used for analysis, if the sequences were identical. Sixty-seven sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses and molecular clock analysis (one strain in 2001, five strains in 2002, one strain in 2003, one strain in 2004, one strain in 2005, six strains in 2006, three strains in 2007, one strain in 2008, two strains in 2009, three strains in 2010, four strains in 2011, six strains in 2012, 11 strains in 2013, 22 strains in 2014). The sequences were submitted to the NCBI, and their respective accession numbers are shown in the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. S1). Fifty-eight reference sequences were downloaded from GenBank and analysed together with the isolated sequences.</p>
