<p>The maximum clade credibility tree is shown in Supplementary Figure S2. Under the log-normal relaxed clock (uncorrelated), the mean nucleotide substitution rate was shown to be 7·77 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% highest probability density (HPD); 6·61 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 9·00 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). The results obtained using BEAST v. 1.8.2 showed that the tMRCA is about 92 years (95% HPD 82–102 years).
