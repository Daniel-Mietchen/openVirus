<p>The phylogenetic tree of the 67 isolated strains and 58 reference sequences are presented in Supplementary Figure S1. The isolated DENV-1 strains were segregated into three genotypes: genotype I (38 strains), genotype IV (10 strains), and genotype V (19 strains). Genotype I can be further divided into four clades, while genotype IV can be divided into two clades.</p>
