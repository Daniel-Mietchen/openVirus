<p>Dengue fever (DF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease, which is caused by dengue virus (DENV) belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus,</italic> family Flaviviridae. In the last few decades, DF has expanded throughout the world, and it is estimated that there are tens of millions of DF cases globally. Currently, the highest incidence of this disease is in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific [

The genome encodes a single open reading frame and can be translated into three structural proteins, core (C), premembrane/membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E), and seven non-structural proteins, NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5. DENVs are separated into four serotypes and several genotypes, according to the sequence of the E gene. The most recently identified serotype, serotype 5, was reported in October 2013, and was isolated from the serum sample of a 37-year-old farmer in Malaysia, collected in 2007. Although it remains unclear why serotype 5 emerged, it represents the first new serotype identified in the last half century [
