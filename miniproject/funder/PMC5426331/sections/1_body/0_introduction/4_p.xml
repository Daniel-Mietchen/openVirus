<p>Although four serotypes of DENV have been obtained during the Guangzhou epidemics from 2001 to 2014, serotype 1 has been shown to be the dominant serotype [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Unlike other serotypes, DENV-1 was detected almost every year and isolated most frequently in DF epidemics. Therefore, investigating the phylogenetic history of DENV-1 and the molecular clock dating, using the isolation time as the calibration point for the establishment of the date of virus introduction may be useful for understanding how different genotypes were established in Guangzhou and how they dispersed.
