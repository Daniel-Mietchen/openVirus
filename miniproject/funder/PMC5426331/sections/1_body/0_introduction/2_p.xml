<p>In China, DF was recorded for the first time in Xiamen, in 1873. No DENV strain had been isolated from a patient's sera before 1978, when a serotype 4 strain was isolated in an outbreak in Fuoshan, Guangdong. Since then, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hainan provinces, along the southeast coast of China, have been affected by DF outbreaks [
