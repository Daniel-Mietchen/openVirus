The first part of the investigation included 327 patients, who sought healthcare consultation at local GPs or hospitals due to clinical symptoms, and were tested for <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> antibodies (Patient cohort). The second part of the investigation, conducted approximately 4&#x000a0;weeks after the peak of the outbreak, consisted of school screening of pupils (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;239) in three different school buildings by PCR on respiratory specimens and questionnaires (Screening cohort). PCR positive respiratory specimens were subsequently utilized for molecular typing. The outbreak peaked in late October 2017. Of the Patient cohort, 9/106 (8.5%) respiratory specimens were PCR positive. In contrast, 3/182 (1.6%) of the Screening cohort were PCR positive. Asymptomatic carriage was observed. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) identified two distinct MLVA types. All typed <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> strains belonged to P1 type 1. No mutations leading to macrolide resistance were observed. In total, 61/327 (19%) of the Patient cohort had a serological indication of recent infection.

When the Mpn1 locus was excluded, MLVA type 4-5-7-2 was the most common, and in agreement with studies from other regions of the world. Two MLVA types were identified suggesting the presence of different MLVA types during the same outbreak. All strains were of P1 type 1. Although our earlier study showed that 9.5% of Finnish <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> strains had mutations conferring resistance to macrolides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], no such mutations were observed among these strains.</p><p id="Par19">One of the PCR positive school pupils reported no symptoms in the questionnaire, reflecting an asymptomatic carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The low PCR positivity rate (1.6%) in the respiratory specimens observed in the school screening may be due to the late timing of specimen collection (week 48) in relation to the peak of the outbreak (weeks 43&#x02212;45) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) or due to prior use of antibiotics.

The very variable IgM test values with a simultaneous negative PCR test result in a respiratory specimen (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as well as IgM persistence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>); both showcase the difficulty in the clinical interpretation of an IgM reactive test result in a single specimen. The relatively low rate of serodiagnoses (19%) in the Patient cohort may be due to suboptimal timing of specimen collection and lack of paired serum specimens.</p><p id="Par21">Combination of serology and PCR has been suggested to increase diagnostic precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], but such an approach may not be feasible in clinical practice. The use of <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> laboratory diagnostics should be primarily limited for cases with the intention to treat with antimicrobials, or for surveillance purposes. In such settings, laboratory data combined with clinical and/or epidemiological data will provide the necessary information for decision making.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Open access funding provided by University of Helsinki including Helsinki University Central Hospital.
