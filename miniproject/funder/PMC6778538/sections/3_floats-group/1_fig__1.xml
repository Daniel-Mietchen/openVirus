  <p>Epidemic curve. Only those cases (
   <italic>N</italic> = 261) of whom the onset of illness was known are depicted in the curve (calendar weeks 28–52 of 2017 and 1–4 of 2018). Black cases showed laboratory evidence of acute or recent 
   <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection (a PCR positive test result in the respiratory specimen, or a seroconversion or more than a twofold rise in IgG EIU between paired serum samples, or a serology with IgM &gt; 3.0 S/CO and IgG &gt; 45 EIU). Light grey cases were symptomatic without definitive laboratory evidence of 
   <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infection
