 <p id="Par1">This study characterizes a large 
  <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> outbreak observed in Kymenlaakso in Southeastern Finland during August 2017–January 2018. The first part of the investigation included 327 patients, who sought healthcare consultation at local GPs or hospitals due to clinical symptoms, and were tested for 
  <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> antibodies (Patient cohort). The second part of the investigation, conducted approximately 4 weeks after the peak of the outbreak, consisted of school screening of pupils (
  <italic>N</italic> = 239) in three different school buildings by PCR on respiratory specimens and questionnaires (Screening cohort). PCR positive respiratory specimens were subsequently utilized for molecular typing. The outbreak peaked in late October 2017. Of the Patient cohort, 9/106 (8.5%) respiratory specimens were PCR positive. In contrast, 3/182 (1.6%) of the Screening cohort were PCR positive. Asymptomatic carriage was observed. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) identified two distinct MLVA types. All typed 
  <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> strains belonged to P1 type 1. No mutations leading to macrolide resistance were observed. In total, 61/327 (19%) of the Patient cohort had a serological indication of recent infection. The IgM test reactivity at the time of a negative PCR test result varied from a completely non-reactive value up to very strong reactivity, highlighting the difficulty in a single specimen serodiagnosis.
