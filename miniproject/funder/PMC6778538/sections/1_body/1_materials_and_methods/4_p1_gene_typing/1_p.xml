<p id="Par10">The type of P1 adhesin protein gene was determined as described earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] using a multiplex real-time PCR assay for detection of defined P1 types, based on the presence of short type-specific indels in the 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> genomic sequence. DNA from a reference strain M129 (ZeptoMetrics Corporation, Franklin, MA) and from an earlier clinical isolate were used as controls (type 1 and type 2, respectively).
