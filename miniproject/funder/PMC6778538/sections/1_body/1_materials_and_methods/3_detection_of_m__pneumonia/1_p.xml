<p id="Par9">DNA was extracted using MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit or MagNA Pure DNA/Viral NA SV 2.0 Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). In detail, 300 μl of the specimen was lysed with 300 μl of MagNA Pure Lysis/Binding Buffer. Five hundred microliters or 450 μl of the lysate was extracted with the MagNA Pure LC or the MagNA Pure 96-instrument, respectively. A multiplex real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>, and mutations most commonly associated with macrolide resistance in 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> developed by us [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] was used. This assay amplifies part of the 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> hypothetical protein C985_0367 gene. The macrolide resistance-associated mutations in 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> strains were identified by amplification of the 23S rRNA gene followed by a dissociation curve analysis, which detects mutations at sequence positions 2063G/C and 2064G/C.
