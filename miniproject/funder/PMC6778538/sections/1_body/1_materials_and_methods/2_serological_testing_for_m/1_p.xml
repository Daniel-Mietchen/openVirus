<p id="Par8">Serology was conducted as routine testing at the Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory with Labsystems 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> IgM and IgG EIA by following the manufacturer’s instructions (Labsystems Diagnostics, Vantaa, Finland). The dynamic range of the IgG EIA was set between 45 and 400 EIU, and test results below 45 EIU were considered as negative. To increase specificity, the cut-off for positive IgM reaction was considerably hightened from the manufacturer’s 1.2 S/CO to 3.0 S/CO for this investigation.
