 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> DNA was amplified in 12 specimens. Eleven of these were typed according to the 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> P1 protein, and all were of type 1. Altogether, 10 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> strains were classified into 5-locus MLVA types (Mpn1, Mpn13-16). When the most discriminatory, but unstable Mpn1 locus was excluded, nine strains were of type 4-5-7-2 and one of type 3-5-7-2. The most common macrolide resistance-associated mutations (in positions 2063G/C and 2064G/C of the 23S rRNA sequence) were not detected in the specimens.
