<p id="Par20">The best IgM antibody tests for 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> have an approximately 70â€“80% sensitivity and 90% specificity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The very variable IgM test values with a simultaneous negative PCR test result in a respiratory specimen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as well as IgM persistence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>); both showcase the difficulty in the clinical interpretation of an IgM reactive test result in a single specimen. The relatively low rate of serodiagnoses (19%) in the Patient cohort may be due to suboptimal timing of specimen collection and lack of paired serum specimens.
