<p id="Par18">In line with earlier reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the most variable locus of M. pneumoniae was Mpn1 (repeat numbers ranging from three to six) in the Kymenlaakso 2017 outbreak. When the Mpn1 locus was excluded, MLVA type 4-5-7-2 was the most common, and in agreement with studies from other regions of the world. Two MLVA types were identified suggesting the presence of different MLVA types during the same outbreak. All strains were of P1 type 1. Although our earlier study showed that 9.5% of Finnish

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], no such mutations were observed among these strains.
