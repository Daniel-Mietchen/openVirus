<p id="Par19">One of the PCR positive school pupils reported no symptoms in the questionnaire, reflecting an asymptomatic carriage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The low PCR positivity rate (1.6%) in the respiratory specimens observed in the school screening may be due to the late timing of specimen collection (week 48) in relation to the peak of the outbreak (weeks 43âˆ’45) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) or due to prior use of antibiotics. While in some cases 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> can be detected several months after infection, the carriage typically clears within the first month post infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and our study is in line with this observation.
