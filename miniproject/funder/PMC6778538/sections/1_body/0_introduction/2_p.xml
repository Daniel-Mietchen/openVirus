<p id="Par3">For 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> laboratory diagnostics, both antibody detection and nucleic acid amplification (typically PCR) are used. They both have their advantages and limitations in terms of clinical context and time elapsed from disease onset. While their analytical performance can be optimized, the interpretation can be challenging due to e.g. long-term IgM persistence after infection, sometimes reduced IgM reaction in reinfections, and asymptomatic carriage of 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> in the respiratory tract [
