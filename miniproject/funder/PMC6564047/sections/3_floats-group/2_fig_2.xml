  <title>Phylogenetic tree of sequences from LAMP-Nanopore analysis.</title>
  <p>NJ tree based on 117 bp sequences determined by CHIKV-CZC-LAMP-MinION sequencing (bold) analysis, and 29 sequences from the GenBank were constructed. The nucleotides at the 27 SNPs within the amplified region were also indicated.</p>
