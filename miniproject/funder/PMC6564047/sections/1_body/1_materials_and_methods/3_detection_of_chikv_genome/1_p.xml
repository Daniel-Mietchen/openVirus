<p>The reaction tubes with the dried mixture solutions were stored for at least 2 months at ambient temperatures and were emplaced in the RT-LAMP reaction for CHIKV genome detection. Prior to the reaction, reaction buffer (23 μl), consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.8), 50 mM KCl, 6 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, and 10 mM (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> in 0.1% TritonX-100, and 2 μl template was added. For the templates, 1 μl of extracted RNA with or without 1 μl of whole blood from healthy human volunteer were used. RNAs were extracted from CHIKV when titers were determined by plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml). Thereafter, the tubes were turned upside down for 2 minutes to mix and reconstitute the dried enzyme reagents. The RT-LAMP reaction was achieved at 63 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 45 minutes. Because CHIKV-CZC-LAMP contains gelgreen which emits green fluorescent, the reaction could be monitored by the FAM channel with real-time PCR detection system (CFX96; Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, PA). One cycle of the amplification was set as 1 min, and reaction speed (min) was estimated to be equal to the threshold cycle (Ct) value. The specificity was judged by Tm (melting temperature) value.
