<p>Our assay was also validated using clinical samples. Serum samples were obtained from clinically suspected patients collected in 2016 and 2018, and which had been stored at the Flavivirus Laboratory, Oswaldo Cruz Institute/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro which is a Brazilian Ministry of Health Regional Reference Laboratory for arboviruses (LABFLA).Viral RNAs from those sera were extracted by the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Detection of the genome of CHIKV by the CHIKV-CZC-LAMP was performed using directly the serum or RNA from sera samples (2 μl) with 23 μl of the reaction buffer in each tube. For incubation of the samples, the portable incubator (BSR-miniT100H, Bio Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan) was used, and detection of the fluorescent signal from reactive samples was confirmed using the hand-made blue-green LAMP reaction detector as described in our previous report [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To compare the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP system, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] was conducted with the Express One-step SuperScript qRT-PCR system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the StepOnePlus Realtime-PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The reaction cycle was set as 50 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 15 minutes for reverse transcription, 95°C for 2 minutes for initial denaturation, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, and 60°C for 60seconds. The sequences of primer sets for the qRT-PCR were as follows; Forward primer 6856F: 5’-TCACTCCCTGTTGGACTTGATAGA-3’, reverse primer 6981R: F: 5’-TTGACGAACAGAGTTAGGAACATACC -3’, and 6919 FAM-MGB probe: 5’-FAM-AGGTACGCGCTTCAAGTTCGGCG -MGV-3’ [
