<p>Recently, a portable-type next generation sequencer, the MinION has been developed. The sample preparation from DNA or cDNA can be completed within 10 min in the simplest protocol. The library preparation for sequencing can be performed with a magnet separator and simple isothermal incubator, and thus only minimal equipment is required. Notably as most of the newly emerging infectious disease outbreaks have been reported in the remote areas with resource-poor settings, portable, affordable and disposable MinION provides a promising tool for rapid identification and epidemiological analysis on site.</p>
