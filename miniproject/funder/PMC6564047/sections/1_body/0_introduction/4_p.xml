<p>Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a very sensitive,“user-friendly”, and time-efficient nucleic acid amplification method [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The method can be applied to detect genomes of RNA viruses if reverse transcriptase is included in the reaction (reverse transcription LAMP; RT-LAMP). Using the LAMP and RT-LAMP methods, amplification reaction of nucleic acids can be performed under isothermal conditions without expensive or sophisticated equipment. The 
 <italic>Bst</italic> polymerase, a necessary enzyme for the LAMP reaction, is known to be highly tolerant to inhibitory molecules in clinical samples [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and therefore it is applicable for the samples without the requirement of the purification steps of nucleic acids. We have already found that all the reagents for the LAMP can be dried and kept in reaction tubes, and that patient blood can be used directly in the LAMP reaction without purification of nucleic acids. This simplified protocol has been applied for diagnosis of Human African Trypanosomiasis and Malaria [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007480.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This dried-LAMP (named CZC-LAMP) can be stored at the ambient temperature for prolonged periods, which is useful in the remote areas where cold-chains are not available.
