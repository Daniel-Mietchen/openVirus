<p>In this study, we combined our field-friendly RT-LAMP system and the MinION technology, to successfully achieve viral sequencing in a simple and rapid way. Specifically, the genomes of CHIKV in a drop of human blood would be amplified with the dried RT-LAMP method, and the products sequenced by the MinION. This simple sequencing work-flow is likely to be applicable to investigate outbreaks of various infectious diseases in remote areas.</p>
