<p>Mortality rates were calculated by region for the intervals 0–3, 3–6, 6–12, 12–24 and 24–48 months after ART initiation. Mortality rate ratios, compared with Europe, were estimated at each interval using a piecewise exponential parametric survival model fit through Poisson regression. The use of a piecewise exponential parametric survival model fit through Poisson regression simplified the prediction of mortality rate ratios for each duration interval on ART, whereas the implicit assumption of constant hazards within each interval produced almost identical inter-regional comparative mortality rate ratio estimates when compared with a piecewise spline-based flexible parametric survival model [
