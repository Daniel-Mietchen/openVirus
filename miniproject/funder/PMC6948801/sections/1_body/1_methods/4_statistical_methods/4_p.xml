<p>Multivariable models were adjusted for baseline age (&lt;30, 30–44, 45–59, ≥60 years), CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts within 6 months prior to ART initiation (0–24, 25–49, 50–99, 100–199, 200–349, ≥350 cells/μl, unknown) and period of ART initiation (2000–2003, 2004–2007, 2008–2011, 2012–2014). As the HIV epidemics in East, West and South Africa, the Caribbean, South and Central America are predominantly heterosexual epidemics, no adjustment for transmission category could be applied for comparisons between these regions and Europe or North America. Neither adjustment for HIV-RNA nor AIDS prior to ART initiation were included because of the high percentage of missing values in these regions. For comparisons between North America and Europe, multivariable models were additionally adjusted for transmission category, HIV-RNA, AIDS at ART initiation, and race/ethnicity in the subset of participants with available information for these variables.
