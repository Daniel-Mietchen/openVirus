<p>Globally, WLWH differ in their age distribution, HIV transmission routes, socioeconomic status and viral and tuberculosis co-infection rates, and risk factors for non-HIV mortality [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Wide variations exist between countries and regions of the world in terms of access to HIV testing, ART regimens, and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts at ART initiation, along with HIV testing policies and guidelines for treatment. Many of these factors may be because of healthcare systems and resource availability for healthcare within the individual country. In turn, this may impact mortality rates for WLWH [

 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Finally, background mortality rates in different regions have striking variations that, together with the previously mentioned aspects, shape the mortality rates of WLWH [
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Collaboration between large multiregional cohorts from different regions of the world provides an opportunity to describe geographic disparities in mortality. In this work, we estimate all-cause mortality after ART initiation, overall and by duration of ART use, among WLWH in Europe, the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa up to 48 months after ART initiation, in order to help to understand key underlying drivers of mortality in women from different settings.
