<p>Access to healthcare and life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART) varies greatly across regions and depends on structural and individual factors [

 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Access to HIV testing is a prerequisite to ART initiation, but delayed HIV diagnosis and linkage to care are major barriers to timely access to ART, and thus, its clinical benefits [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Largely a consequence of increases in the uptake of universal HIV screening during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission over the last decade, women from most geographical regions are diagnosed with HIV earlier and have higher CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts at diagnosis than heterosexually infected men [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These factors underlie some of the reported mortality differences between women and men favoring women [
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, no study has so far specifically compared early and late mortality differences among women living with HIV (WLWH) across different geographical regions worldwide.
