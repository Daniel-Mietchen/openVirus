<p>Our findings need to be placed in the context of background mortality rates of women from the general population living in geographical regions with generalized HIV epidemics, together with mortality patterns of racial and ethnic minorities in North America and Europe, with concentrated HIV epidemics [

 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Globally, all-cause mortality in women living in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and South America is also higher than among the women from Europe and North America [

 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and from HIV-infection [
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but patterns have been described to be complex and evolve over time [
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Conversely, migrant women in Europe have lower all-cause mortality relative to general population women, consistent with healthy migrant selection bias [
