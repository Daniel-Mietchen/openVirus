<p>Most of the European countries included in this study have universal healthcare systems, which grant free access to HIV testing, HIV care and ART medications, and this may account for some of the better HIV-related outcomes observed among women in European cohorts. However, not all countries in Europe provide free access to ART for undocumented migrants, a nonnegligible proportion of WLWH in Europe [

 <sup>+</sup> cell counts at ART initiation, which likely account for the exceedingly high early and overall mortality observed in the women in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America and the Caribbean.
