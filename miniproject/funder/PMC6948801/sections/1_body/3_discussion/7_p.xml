<p>Sensitivity analyses to account for potential selection biases derived from lack of cross-checks with mortality registries in some of the European cohorts, and of differential data availability to characterize losses to follow-up were also performed. Unfortunately, having missing data was inevitable in such an ambitious data collection and harmonization exercise. For example, information on CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell count and HIV-RNA viral load was missing for a large proportion of the women from lower income settings and reveals the lack of availability of clinical monitoring tools in those regions. Type of ART regimen was not available from all sites, and given that the study period started in 2000, we assumed all the women to be on at least three antiretroviral drugs. Although mortality of women living with HIV in Europe may be under-ascertained, this was assessed through sensitivity analyses that excluded cohorts that did not perform cross-checks with mortality registries and/or reported incomplete or poor death ascertainment, and the main findings did not significantly change. A recent publication highlights that European cohort participants were generally representative of the national HIV-diagnosed population reported by surveillance systems, but that PWID, migrants, persons with low CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts and those over 55 years of age are generally under-represented in European cohorts [
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Finally, as of today, national ART guidelines have expanded in most settings to ’Treat All’ patients with HIV, regardless of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell count or clinical stage, as recommended by WHO in 2015. Although we have controlled for baseline AIDS status and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell count, it is possible that differences in ART guidelines between regions, which in part determine who initiates ART, could explain some of the differences observed.
