<p>This large collaborative study found that there was significant variability in all-cause mortality among WLWH in Europe, the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa up to 48 months after ART initiation, with distinct geographical patterns for short-term, midterm and long-term mortality. The highest mortality was observed in WLWH in Central America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa, who also had the lowest CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts at ART initiation. The lowest mortality was reported in women living in Europe, who had, together with women from North America, the highest CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts; women living in South America had intermediate mortality. These differences were apparent after correcting for under-ascertainment in mortality in most of the African sites. Mortality was highest in the first 3 months after ART initiation in all evaluable regions, and decreased from then onwards to reach stable rates from the first until the fourth year following ART, when inter-regional differences were attenuated.
