<p>The baseline differences of WLWH explained some of the relative differences encountered but did not fully explain the higher mortality observed in women from sub-Saharan African and American regions compared with the women on ART living in Europe. Indeed, women from sub-Saharan Africa and from Central America and the Caribbean had the lowest CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts at ART initiation, a strong predictor of subsequent HIV-related, mortality [

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Median CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell counts at ART initiation were close to 250 cells/μl in women living in North America and Europe, but mortality rates differed substantially. The lower mortality of WLWH in Europe compared with women in North America has been previously reported [

 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and attributed to the accessibility and equity of health services, to background mortality rates, to causes of death of populations affected by HIV in the different settings, and to near complete death ascertainment in North America [
