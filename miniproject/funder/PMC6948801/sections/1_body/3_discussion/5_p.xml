<p>For all regions analyzed, and with different magnitudes, mortality was highest in the initial 3 months following ART. The exception to this pattern was North America given NA-ACCORD's inclusion criteria, as anyone who died very soon after enrollment (including those who initiated ART) was excluded, thereby artificially reducing early mortality in North America. Higher mortality soon after ART has been well described and attributed to late ART initiation and is largely caused by AIDS-defining conditions preventable with ART [

Unfortunately, cause of death was not available in our dataset for most settings, but studies that have analyzed causes of death patterns report that, for both AIDS and non-AIDS defining causes of death, rates are lower in WLWH in Europe than in North America [
