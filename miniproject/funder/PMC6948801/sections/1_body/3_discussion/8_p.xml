<p>The global health inequalities highlighted in this study pertain to women who have accessed health services and have started ART, so they are likely to underestimate overall gaps for women living with HIV, particularly those not yet diagnosed or linked to care. Voluntary antenatal HIV testing, widely implemented in most countries included in these analyses, has been a major step forward in increasing access to health services, but requires expansion and improvement. The data presented can support the development of context-specific interventions to help countries reach their 2020 targets and improve the life expectancies of HIV-positive women at the global level.</p>
