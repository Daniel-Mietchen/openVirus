<p>In all regions except for North America, because of cohort inclusion criteria in that region, the highest death rates occurred during the first 3 months after starting ART and declined thereafter (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Women from Europe had the lowest death rates across the study period, whereas the highest were observed among women from Central America and the Caribbean between 0 and 3 months, in East Africa between 3 and 6 months and West Africa between 6 and 48 months from ART initiation.
