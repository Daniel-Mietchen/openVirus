<p>Mortality rates in women from Europe were significantly lower than rates in women from all other regions during the first 48 months after starting ART, except for North American women, whose rates were similar for the first 6 months and significantly higher thereafter (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The greatest differences were observed in the first 3 months and attenuated thereafter. Taking into account differences in baseline age, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cell count and period of ART initiation, differences in mortality were attenuated although still of large magnitude and statistically significant. After additional adjustments for transmission category, HIV-RNA and AIDS prior to ART initiation for comparisons between North America and Europe, differences in mortality were reduced, but still present. Further adjustment for race/ethnicity in the subset of patients with available information for this variable contributed to reduction of differences between 6 and 48 months on ART.
