  <p>Mid-point rooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the variation (SNPs) in the core genome of 18 strains of 
   <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium and 14 representative strain of diverse

   <italic>enterica</italic> serotypes, with reference to 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain SL1344 genome sequence. 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strains (red lineages and text) are present in two clusters, composed of 15 strains with isolates that are ST19, ST34, ST313, ST98 and ST568 and three more divergent isolates of ST36. The phylogeny is rooted with respect to 
   <italic>S</italic>. Heidelberg and was calculated using SL1344 as a reference to create a core-genome variant-site alignment and the GTRCAT model in RAxML.
