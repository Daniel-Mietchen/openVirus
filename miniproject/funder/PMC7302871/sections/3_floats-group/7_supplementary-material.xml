  <title>Distribution of 131 non ST36 isolates in this study in UK clinical isolates and non-UK isolates from enterobase.</title>
  <p>Grapetree visualization based on EnteroBase cgMLST allele profiles, including of (A) 1,693 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium isolates from clinical infections in the UK in 2014 and 2015, and (B) 14,760 genomes selected as the global diversity of 
   <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium outside of the United Kingdom in Enterobase database. Nodes are colour coded by EnteroBase HierCC HC100 cluster groups. HierCC groups containing non ST36 isolates in this study yellow circles. Scale indicates number of cgMLST alleles.
