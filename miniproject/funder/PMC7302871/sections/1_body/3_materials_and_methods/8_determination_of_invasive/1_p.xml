<p>The invasiveness index [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] for each strain was calculated to scan for patterns of mutation accumulation common to 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> lineages adapted to an invasive lifestyle. To calculate the invasiveness index, Illumina reads were mapped to a core-genome reference using the snippy pipeline above, and annotated using PROKKA. Protein sequences were then screened using phmmer from the HMMER3.0 package [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] to identify the closest homologs to the 196 predictive genes used by the invasiveness index model. Missing gene sequences were set to NA, to account for the possibilities of being missed during sequencing or misannotated. These genes were then scored against profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) for these protein families from the Eggnog database [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] using hmmsearch [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], to test for uncharacteristic patterns of sequence variation. Bitscores produced in the comparison of each protein sequence to its respective protein family HMM were then used as input to the model.
