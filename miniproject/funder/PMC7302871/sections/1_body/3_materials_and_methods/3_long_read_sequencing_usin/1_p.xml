<p>DNA for long-read sequencing on the Pacbio platform was extracted from 10 ml of cultured bacteria as previously described [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Data were assembled using version 2.3 of the Pacbio SMRT analysis pipeline (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://smrt-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SMRT-Pipe-Reference-Guide-v2.2.0/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://smrt-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SMRT-Pipe-Reference-Guide-v2.2.0/</ext-link>). The structure of the initial assembly was checked against a parallel assembly using Miniasm [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] which showed general agreement. The Pacbio best practice for circularizing contigs was followed using Minimus [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and the chromosomal contiguous sequence in each assembly was re-orientated to begin at the 
 <italic>thrA</italic> gene. Illumina short read sequence data were used to correct for SNPs and indels using iCORN2 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icorn.sourceforge.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://icorn.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). The finished sequences were then annotated using Prokka [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].
