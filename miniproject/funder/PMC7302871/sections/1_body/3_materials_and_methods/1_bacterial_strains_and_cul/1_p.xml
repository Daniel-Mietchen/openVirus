Typhimurium or monophasic variant isolates was composed of 2 to 6 randomly selected strains from the top ten most frequent phage types from PHE and the top 20 most frequent phage types from APHA surveillance, from 1990–2010 (2–5 strains of each) were used in this analysis. In addition, commonly used lab strain SL1344 [

 <sup>o</sup>c and recovered by culture on Luria Bertani agar plates, and single colonies were selected to inoculate LB broth that was incubated at 37 
 <sup>o</sup>c for 18 hours with shaking.
