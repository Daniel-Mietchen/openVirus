<p>Genes were assigned a score based on their presence in strains within a specific clade. The clade gene score was compared to the score determined for strains outside of the clade to determine whether the gene was more prevalent within the clade than without. Genes were classed as associated with the clade if their score was greater than the mean plus two standard deviations of the non-cladal score (corresponding to the top 95% in a normal distribution).</p>
