<p>Recombination was inferred by identifying regions of high SNP density from whole genome alignments of short-read data to SL1344, using Gubbins [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The results were visualised using Phandango [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] and related to the predicted prophage locations in the SL1344 genome. Similar results were obtained using maximum likelihood inference using clonal frame [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>].
