<p>Illumina generated fastq files were assembled using an in-house pipeline adapted from that previously described [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. For each paired end reads, Velvet [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] (1.2.08) was used to generate multiple assemblies varying the k-mer size between 31 and 61 using Velvet Optimiser [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and selecting the assembly with the longest N50. Assemblies were then improved using Improve_Assembly software [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] that uses SSPACE (version 3.0) [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] and GapFiller (version 1.0) [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] to scaffold and gap-fill. Ragout was used to order contigs [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] based on comparison to the long-read sequences. The finished genomes were then annotated using Prokka (version 1.11) [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].
