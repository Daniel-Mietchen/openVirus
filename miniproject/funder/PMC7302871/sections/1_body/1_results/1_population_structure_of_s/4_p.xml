<p>To estimate the coverage of clinical isolates from the UK and global 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium by our dataset, we compared the 131 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium genomes with 1697 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium genomes isolated from human clinical infection in the UK in 2014 and 2015 described previously [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and 14,478 genomes from non-UK isolates, excluding ST36, in the EnteroBase database [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008850.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). With both datasets, we grouped these genomes according to their cgMLST Hierarchical Clusters at the level of 100 alleles difference (HierCC HC100) as defined in EnteroBase [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This provided an estimation of the genomic diversity within 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. We then determined the proportion of HierCC groups that contained a genome from our dataset, and the number of genomes in shared clusters. In the first comparison, 38.5% of hierarchical clusters were represented in our dataset and UK clinical isolates. Shared HC’s contained 95.1% of genomes from clinical infections because most of the unrepresented HC’s contained few genomes. In regard to the rest of the world, 17% of HC’s were represented in our dataset, but shared HierCCs accounted for 71.5% of the EnteroBase genomes. Therefore, although our dataset represents less than half of the known hierarchical clusters, it does cover the majority of genomes in available databases.
