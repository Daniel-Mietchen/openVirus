<p>Despite relatively few SNPs distinguishing clade α and β, these clades exhibited distinct epidemiology characterised by association predominantly with livestock, including cattle, pigs and poultry (clade α) or avian species, including wild species (clade β). Strikingly all pig isolates from our sampling were located in clade α. Cattle isolates were in both first order clades (11 in clade α 7 in clade β), but in clade β they had a relatively limited distribution with five of the isolates from a subclade containing the DT204/49 complex of strains associated with a cattle associated epidemic in the 1970’s [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], two clades associated with recent pandemic clonal groups associated with pigs, cattle and poultry (α17, monophasic Typhimurium ST34 and α15, DT104) [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and potentially epidemic clades not previously described in the literature, consisting of isolates from pigs, cattle and poultry (α8 and α11). Clade-β was characterised by many long internal branches, indicative of a relatively high level of root to tip sequence divergence, relative to those in Clade-α. In contrast, clade-β contained several third-level clades previously described as host-adapted, particularly for avian species such as passerine birds (β5, DT56), duck (β2, DT8) and pigeon (β3 DT2) [
