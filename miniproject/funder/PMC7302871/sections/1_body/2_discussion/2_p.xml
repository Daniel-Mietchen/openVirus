<p>The nested phylogenetic structure, rooted with the 
 <italic>S</italic>. Heidelberg outgroup, was characterised by two high order clades (α and β), in which clade α was basal to clade β. Several deeply rooted lineages of clade α contained isolates almost entirely from livestock. A single lineage originating from the common ancestor of the main 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium phylogroup gave rise to the common ancestor of clade β and diversification into multiple lineages was accompanied by apparent host adaptation to diverse host species, but notably many more avian species, compared with clade α. The β subclades included those associated with the DT56, DT2 and DT8 complexes that are well characterized host adapted clonal groups [

 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium genome sequences at the time of writing, with additional additional α and β subclades not present in our dataset, presumably because they are not present in the UK. A lack of isolates from wild avian hosts and incomplete metadata limited our ability to test many of our key findings with this larger dataset.
