<p>The molecular basis of the barrier to circulation of some clade β isolates in livestock is not known, but likely the result of genotypic changes affecting functional diversification of the proteome. The proteome delta bitscore (DBS) of clade β isolates exhibited elevated divergence from profile HMMs of protein families in gamma proteobacteria, compared to clade α isolates, potentially resulting in loss or altered protein function [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. β subclades also exhibited an elevated invasiveness index, the fraction of decision trees using random forests that vote for the invasive (extraintestinal) disease outcome, a predictive score of host adaptation to an extraintestinal lifestyle. Consistent with this finding, increased invasiveness of strains from clade-β lineages has been reported previously, including

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Signatures of invasiveness of ST313 strains was also consistent with changes in interaction with mice and cattle in experimental models of infection [
