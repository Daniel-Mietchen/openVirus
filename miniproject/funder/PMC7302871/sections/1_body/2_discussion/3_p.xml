<p>Isolates in α subclades and some β subclades were under distinct anthropogenic selection pressure for the acquisition and maintenance of AMR, that correlated with their distribution in livestock or wild avian species [

Clade α isolates that were predominantly from livestock contained several lineages with multiple AMR genes, while most clade β isolates contained few or no AMR genes. Differential selection pressure for acquisition and maintenance of AMR genes is consistent with the idea that some

Antimicrobials have been used widely to control infection or as growth promoters in livestock, but wild animals are unlikely to encounter therapeutic levels of these drugs [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We might therefore also expect to find AMR genes in DT56 and DT40 strains. One possibility is that DT56 and DT40 strains from clade β may transiently colonise the cattle host but are unable to circulate in this population and do not transmit back to the avian population with high frequency. Host adaptation to avian species therefore appears to create an effective barrier to circulation in livestock. Two clade β lineages did contain strains with multiple AMR genes, but in each case their epidemiology was atypical for clade β in that they were associated with an epidemic in cattle (DT204/49 complex) or invasive NTS in people in sub-Saharan Africa (ST313) [
