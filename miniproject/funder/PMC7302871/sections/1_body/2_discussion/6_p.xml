<p>Host adaptation of bacteria is commonly associated with the accumulation of HDCS, potential pseudogenes that contribute to genome degradation [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A total of 24 genes previously implicated in virulence, adhesion or multicellular behaviour were HDCS in one or more clade β isolates. Notably, 15 of these genes (63%) were also HDCS in highly host adapted

 <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A, serotypes that are restricted to humans and cause a disseminated disease[
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. HDCS were especially common in strains of DT56/DT40 complex (clade β5), that are reported to be highly host adapted to passerine birds, in which eleven HDCS were observed. In 
 <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A, many mutations and gene flux that occurred was reported to be neutral, indicated by their sporadic distribution within clades, and frequent loss from the population by purifying selection [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, we also observed some examples of potential neutral mutations, but in many cases HDCS in virulence genes were present in multiple related strains from the same subclade, indicating that they were likely under selection, and stably maintained in the population (

 <italic>tsr</italic> and 
 <italic>sadA</italic>, in α10, α11 and α12. Subclade α12 (U288 complex) was the only clade to contain all of these HDCS, consistent with the U288 complex exhibiting apparent host-adaption to pigs [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of HDCS in virulence associated genes was almost exclusively associated with subclades containing strains with strong epidemiological evidence of host adaptation [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite the 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium DT104 complex strain NCTC13348 (clade α15) exhibiting a high level of genome degradation that was uncharacteristic for α subclades and the broad host range epidemiology of the clonal group [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], no virulence or multicellular behaviour genes were HDCS [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Furthermore, the mean DBS for the proteome of strains from clade α15 was similar to that of other α subclades, suggesting that functional divergence as a whole was not atypical from that of other clade α isolates.
