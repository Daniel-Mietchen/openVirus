<p>The only virulence-related HDCS that segregated clades α and β resulted from a 10 bp insertion in the

 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium preferentially colonises Peyer’s patches (PPs) [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], due to long-polar fimbriae 
 <italic>Lpf</italic> binding to M-cells [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>lpf</italic> genes in

 <italic>coli</italic> pathotypes are required for interaction with Peyer’s patches and intestinal colonisation [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Despite the disruption of 
 <italic>lpfD</italic> in the clade β isolate SL1344, deletion of

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], suggesting that long polar fimbriae retain function. Differences in intestinal architecture of avian species that have the lymphoid organ the bursa of Fabricius containing numerous M cells compared with mammalian species that have Peyer’s patches with relatively scarce M cells [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008850.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] may explain the pattern of 
 <italic>lpfD</italic> HDCS in S. Typhimurium. The function of long polar fimbriae expressing full length LpfD in clade α isolates has not been investigated, but its distribution in isolates from livestock and human infections mark it as of potential importance to human health. Other virulence genes including 
 <italic>gtgE</italic>, 
 <italic>avrA</italic> and 
 <italic>sseK3</italic>, exhibited sporadic distribution or HDCS within third level clades, consistent with observations in models of infection suggesting that they may play a role in adaptation to an invasive lifestyle [
