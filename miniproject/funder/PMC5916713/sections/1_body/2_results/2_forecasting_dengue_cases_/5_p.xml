<p id="Par51">The distribution of residuals of the developed models was also analyzed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Significant seasonality and trend could not be observed in the distribution of dengue cases. A realistically straight line can be observed in the residual normal probability plot, and the residual sequence plot illustrates a consistent distribution of errors around zero within Â± 1. Furthermore, a symmetrical pattern can be observed in the residual histogram (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S1). These observations indicate a normal distribution of residuals. There were no dengue epidemics observed in the district during the training period of the models, and nine outbreaks occurred during the forecasting period. The proposed model captured five outbreaks and rejected 14 of them correctly within the testing period of 24 months. The Pierce skill score of the model was 0.49, with a receiver operating characteristic of 86%, and 92% sensitivity.
