<p id="Par47">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates the distribution of dengue cases from each studied model with fitted cases and forecast dengue cases. The results of each model were summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. No significant lines were observed in the ACF and PACF plots in all three models and therefore, it was concluded that the residuals were distributed normally (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
