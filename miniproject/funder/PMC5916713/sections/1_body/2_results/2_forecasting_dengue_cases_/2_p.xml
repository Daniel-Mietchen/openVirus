 <sup>2</sup> were achieved by Model 2. Therefore Model 2 was selected as the better model for the forecasting of dengue incidences in the District of Gampaha. According to Halide &amp; Ridd [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a moderate epidemic is defined when the number of dengue cases in a given month exceeds the 75th percentile. When the number of dengue cases exceeds the 90th percentile, it is defined as a severe epidemic. Based on the Gampaha district monthly data, the 75th and 90th percentiles were 977 and 1588, respectively. Therefore, in line with frequently used guidelines, 1200 was considered as the cutoff value for an outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The PSS was computed taking 1200 dengue cases as the cutoff for an epidemic. The PSS for the forecasts from Model 2 was 0.49, which indicates a moderate prediction ability of the model [
