<p id="Par45">There were 56,834 dengue incidences reported to the Epidemiology Unit, Sri Lanka, from all MOH areas in the District of Gampaha from January, 2001 to December, 2016. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the population density and average number of dengue incidences in each MOH area reported from 2005 to 2014 in the district. The highest population density was observed from the Kelaniya MOH area along with more than 300 dengue incidences annually. Furthermore, high population densities were observed from Negombo, Wattala, Biyagama, and Ragama MOH areas. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, more than half of the dengue incidences were reported recently during the period 2012–2016 even though there was a greater fluctuation. Also, the number of dengue incidences has increased significantly after 2012 compared to the period 2001–2011 (95% CI, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 14, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and the study was, therefore, based on the dengue incidences during the period 2012–2016.
