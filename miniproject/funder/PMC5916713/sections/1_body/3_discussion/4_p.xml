<p id="Par55">The district of Gampaha is located in the wet zone of the country with annual rainfall of 1400–2500 mm. The district experiences virtually the same precipitation throughout the year from the south-west and north-east monsoons, with a constant average temperature of 27.7 °C. The eastern part of the district is a hilly area with an elevation of about 150 m, while to the west, the elevation decreases steadily with lagoons, marsh lands to coastal areas. The district consists of five agro-ecological regions, wet zone low country WL1, WL2, WL3, WL4 and Intermediate zone low country IL1 [

Because of this, even though the number of dengue cases was reported by MOH areas, separate models need to be developed with significant variables particular to each MOH area to forecast impending dengue outbreaks in such areas.
