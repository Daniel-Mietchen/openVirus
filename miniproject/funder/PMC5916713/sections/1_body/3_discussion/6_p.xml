<p id="Par57">In this study, the effects of climatic factors and retrospective dengue incidences were modelled to forecast impending dengue outbreaks. However, dengue is a result of complex interactions of vectors, pathogens and humans. This includes introduction of new dengue viral genotypes, adaptations of dengue vector mosquitoes, commutes of population, herd immunity of population, urbanization, vegetation cover, land use patterns, efficiency of preventive and awareness programmes, socioeconomic factors and the attitude of people. The contribution of these factors to the magnitude of the dengue spread in the district still needs to be addressed. Moreover, there is insufficient time series data available to analyze the effects of these factors. Therefore, further investigations need to be conducted regarding these factors in a time series manner in the District of Gampaha.</p>
