<p id="Par52">Dengue incidences have been reported from every MOH area in the district. Adjacent MOH areas demonstrates similar disease transmission patterns analogous to their spatial and climatic similarity. Higher dengue incidence rates can be detected from highly congested MOH areas with the exception of the Ragama MOH area, which urbanized recently and has well-equipped health care facilities. The district experienced ample rainfall, fewer variations in temperature, and high humidity throughout the year, as it is located in the wet zone of a tropical country, which enhances the survival rates of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Therefore, meteorological variables were incorporated into the model as predictive variables. During the analysis of correlations between dengue incidences and climatic variables, monthly rainfall, number of rainy days, minimum and maximum RH, and minimum temperature show positive correlations while maximum temperature and wind speed show negative correlations.
