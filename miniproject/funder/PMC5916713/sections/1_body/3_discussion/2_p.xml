<p id="Par53">The forecasting model developed in this study was based on retrospective monthly rainfall, rainy days, minimum temperature, minimum RH and dengue incidences. Even though monthly rainfall and rainy days are positively associated with the dengue cases, excessive and continuous rainfall may rinse out dengue vector mosquito breeding places and may delay the buildup of mosquito population until later in the rainy season, leading to a decrease in dengue incidences. A higher number of rainy days increased the accessible breeding places for vector mosquitoes leading to greater transmission of the disease [

Furthermore, a three-month lag time can increase the dengue vector mosquito populations as it allows sufficient time to complete the mosquito life-cycle, and acquire and proliferate the DENV in vector mosquitoes. These higher lag periods can partly be explained by survival of

In Pearson’s correlation analysis, a significant negative correlation was observed between dengue incidences with one month lagged maximum temperature. This also agreed with previous studies in Sri Lanka and Taiwan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The average maximum temperature in the district during the study period was 31.4 °C with a maximum of 34.3 °C. The negative correlation may be due to alteration of mosquito development, blood-feeding behavior, and availability of breeding containers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, a non-significant positive correlation was observed between dengue cases and minimum temperature. During the study period, the average minimum temperature was 24.5 °C which is favorable for mosquito survival and reproduction. The district experienced only minor fluctuations in temperature throughout the year. Additionally, a previous study in Sri Lanka reported that there was no correlation between small scale immediate temperature changes and impending dengue outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, the minimum temperature was significant at three months lag time in the selected model. This suggests the importance of carrying out a time series regression analysis considering serial correlations rather than shortsighted individual correlations obtained by a Pearson’s correlation analysis. Relative humidity is often associated with temperature and higher relative humidity increases mosquito population while lower relative humidity (e.g. 60%), will decrease the oviposition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Both minimum and maximum relative humidity are higher in the district due to its close proximity to the Indian Ocean. Therefore, relative humidity is positively correlated with the transmission of dengue in the district as it increases the survival and oviposition rates in dengue vector mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Gampaha district frequently experiences light or gentle breezes, with wind speed two or three on the Beaufort wind scale. Wind speed is negatively correlated with dengue transmission as wind restricts flying activities of dengue vector mosquitoes, which affects human-mosquito contact and oviposition [
