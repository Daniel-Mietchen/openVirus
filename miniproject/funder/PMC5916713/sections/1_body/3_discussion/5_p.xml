<p id="Par56">Previous studies mentioned the importance of dengue incidences lagged one month to forecast current month dengue incidences [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Our model also illustrated that, depending upon climatic factors, the current month’s dengue cases were significantly affected by the previous month’s dengue cases in the district. Furthermore, there was a quadratic influence of the previous month’s dengue incidences on the current month’s dengue incidences in the District of Gampaha. This could also be a limitation of the selected model (Model 2). A further investigation was conducted to identify the effects of the previous month’s dengue incidences alone in forecasting the current month’s dengue incidences. In this model, the

 <sup>2</sup> for the training period was only 40.8% and the AIC and BIC values were higher compared to Model 2. Also, the forecast skill measured using PSS was 0.5. The model considering only the significant climatic variables (without lagged cases) resulted in an
