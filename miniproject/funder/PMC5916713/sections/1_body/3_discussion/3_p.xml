<p id="Par54">The current study has a few limitations. The District of Gampaha is located next to the District of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka, where the highest number of dengue cases is reported every year. Previous studies mentioned that during the daily commute of residents in the District of Gampaha to the District of Colombo for work and other commercial purposes, they can be infected by dengue. However, these patients are reported under the District of Gampaha [
