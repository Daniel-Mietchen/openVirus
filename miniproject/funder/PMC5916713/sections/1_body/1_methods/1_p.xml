<p id="Par30">Risk maps and predictive models are not available yet for the District of Gampaha to assess the disease transmission and there is an urgent requirement for an early warning system to predict imminent dengue epidemics in the district. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze spatial and seasonal distribution of dengue incidence, and to propose a simple and precise dengue early warning system based on local meteorological factors in the district, using the time series regression method. The outcome of the study will probably improve the effectiveness of dengue surveillance programmes, ultimately controlling impending dengue epidemics in the district.</p>
