<p id="Par35">Multiple time series regression approaches were used to develop a dengue forecasting model. The data collected from January 2012 to November 2015 were used for the model construction and the observed data from December 2015 to May 2017 were used for validation of the models. Previous studies have mentioned relationships between monthly meteorological data and dengue incidence, from zero to three months lag periods considering the influence on mosquito survival and vertical disease transmission [

Therefore, several time series approaches were tried based on climatic variables with a lag of zero to three months and only three time series regression models are listed here. Time series regression models were fitted using R statistical software. The best model was selected based on lowest Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), R-squared (
