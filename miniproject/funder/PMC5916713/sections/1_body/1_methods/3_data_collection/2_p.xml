<p id="Par33">Weather records on rainfall, number of rainy days, minimum and maximum temperature, minimum and maximum Relative Humidity (RH), and wind speed were obtained from January 2012 to May 2017 from the Department of Meteorology, Colombo, Sri Lanka (where the climatic data are recorded centrally) on a monthly basis. These meteorological variables were collected by the weather stations at the Bandaranayake International Airport, Katunayake. In addition to that, rainfall and the number of rainy days were also collected from the Pasyala weather station. Rainfall data were highly correlated (
