<p id="Par43">The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was performed to identify the stationarity of and the presence of unit root of the residuals of the time series model. Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots were analyzed for the residuals for each model. The good fit of the model was further examined by plotting the fitted values with reported dengue cases in the district.</p>
