<p id="Par28">In Sri Lanka, dengue is the most important vector-borne disease. The first serologically confirmed dengue case was reported in 1962, and the largest dengue epidemic was reported in 2009, with 35,008 reported cases and 346 deaths, with an incidence rate of 170 per 100,000 population [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to the Epidemiological Unit of Sri Lanka, more than 30,000 cases were reported every year since 2012, and approximately half of these cases were reported from the Western Province, including the Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts. The second highest number of dengue cases was reported from the District of Gampaha, Sri Lanka since 2010. Currently, all four DENV serotypes are circulating in the district. An intervention study conducted previously demonstrated the importance of community mobilization and waste management in controlling dengue in the District of Gampaha [

Despite much effort put into disease prevention and control measures, more than 5000 dengue cases on average were reported annually in the district, and more than 31,000 cases were reported in the year 2017 alone. In the absence of an effective drug or vaccine specific to the dengue virus, controlling of vectors at the adult and immature stages through eliminating breeding sources is the best method to control the transmission of dengue in the district.
