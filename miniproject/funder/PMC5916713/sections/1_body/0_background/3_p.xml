<p id="Par29">Recently, many health authorities directed their attention toward an early warning system to reduce the incidence rates of dengue and to allocate scarce public health resources for effective intervention programmes. Predictive risk maps and mathematical models provide an alternative way of assessing and quantifying the distribution of risk factors and assessing interventions to predict impending dengue epidemics. These maps are predominantly beneficial in settings which lack sufficient data on disease surveillance [

Further, climatic variables, which can affect life-cycles, survival rates and biting rates of mosquitoes, as well as the incubation period of DENV, are extensively studied as potential predictors and early warning tools of dengue distribution [

Previous studies have indicated that rainfall, temperature, and humidity play a greater role in dengue transmission, but a more precise weather-based forecasting tool will be required to assist national health authorities to perform effective vector control programmes and disease management [
