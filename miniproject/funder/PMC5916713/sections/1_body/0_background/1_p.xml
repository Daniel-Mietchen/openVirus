<p id="Par27">Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral infection in the world causing more than 390 million dengue infections annually of which 96 million clinically manifest. The disease mainly appears in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and approximately 3.9 billion people are living in these dengue endemic countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The causative agent of the disease is one of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and these viruses are transmitted to humans mainly 
 <italic>via</italic> bites of female 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes, predominantly by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Linnaeus), while the subsidiary vector is 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (Skuse). The disease has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, from undifferentiated dengue fever (DF), to dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), to life threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS), creating significant health, economic and social burdens in endemic areas. Large-scale unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization, together with a rapid increase in the human population, leads to higher transmission of the disease in endemic areas [
