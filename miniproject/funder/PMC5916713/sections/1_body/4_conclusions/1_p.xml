<p id="Par58">The model provides a one month time period for local vector surveillance and control agents, sufficient time to prepare for an impending dengue epidemic in the district in many ways. These early warning systems increase the efforts of dengue control during outbreaks reducing the impact of outbreak, disease transmission, healthcare burdens and possible mortalities. These simple, precise, and low-cost models can be utilized by end users, with more confidence in the early warning tool and minimum decision making time, allowing vector control units to utilize scarce public health resources for effective interventions. The higher precision of the model minimizes the use of health units on false dengue alarms, avoiding costly and unnecessary vector control operations. Dengue distribution patterns depend on many factors, such as ecological, environmental, epidemiological and social factors, and when a new vector control strategy and policies are implemented, these distribution patterns and epidemic cycles change over time. Therefore, appropriate modifications need to be made with re-calibration of the model according to the changes of risk factors and related fields, for long-term forecasting in future. Further studies need to be focused on the long-term sustainability of forecast precision and incorporation of the dengue early warning tool into the national dengue control system.</p>
