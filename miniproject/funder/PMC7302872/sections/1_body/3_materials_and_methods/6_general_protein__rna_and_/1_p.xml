<p>Total protein sample was extracted as follows. Cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM EDTA and 1× EDTA-free-protease inhibitor) for 30 min on ice. After addition of 5× protein sample buffer (0.25 M Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% SDS and 1% saturated bromophenol blue), the lysate was boiled for 10 min. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,500 g for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were then performed as previously described [
