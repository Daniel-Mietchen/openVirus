<p>Co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For immunoprecipitation assay of detecting ubiquitin chains, RIPA lysis buffer was used to lyse target cells. After capturing target proteins onto antibody-beads complex, high salt wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 2 mM EDTA) was used to remove unwanted proteins bound. Proteins were eluted from beads with 2× protein sample buffer at 98°C for 10 min.
