<p>Sendai virus (VR-907) was purchased from ATCC. For recombinant influenza A viruses H7-2 WT and H7-2 ΔF, 8-plasmid reverse genetic rescue protocol was used. Briefly, HEK293T cells in 6-well plates with OPTI-MEM (ThermoFisher Scientific) were transfected with pHW2000 (500 ng) expressing PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS genomic segments of H7N9 and HA and NA segments of WSN [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4A</xref> to disrupt PB1-F2 expression. After 24 hours, media of the transfected cells were changed to MEM with 1 μg /mL TPCK-treated trypsin. After another 48 hours, the conditioned media of HEK293T cells was diluted by serum-free MEM with 1 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin and incubated with confluent MDCK cells. After 48 hours, MDCK media containing recombinant viruses were collected, cleared by centrifugation at 3,000×g for 10 min and purified by centrifugal filter (100 kDa; Millipore) with MEM. The virus-containing media were either frozen at -80°C or used immediately for further analysis. For production of WSN WT and WSN ΔF, the 12-plasmid reverse genetic rescue protocol was used as previously described [

Briefly, 200 μl of seed virus-containing medium from HEK293T cells transfected with 12 plasmids for 72 hours was injected into 10-day-old embryonic eggs for virus propagation at 37°C humidified incubator. After 48 hours, allantoic fluid was collected from inoculated eggs. Both WSN WT and WSN ΔF were then further propagated twice in Vero-E6 cells to achieve sufficient viral titer for infection.
