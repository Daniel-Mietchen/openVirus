<p>Cells on coverslips were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X100 for 5 min or with 1:1 methanol:acetone solution for 20 min at 20°C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and blocked with 3% BSA. After that, the cells were probed with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. On the next day, cells were washed three times with PBS followed by probing with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI and secondary antibodies with appropriate origin and fluorophore. After three washes with PBS, the cells on coverslips were mounted and visualized with Carl Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope (Zeiss, Germany).</p>
