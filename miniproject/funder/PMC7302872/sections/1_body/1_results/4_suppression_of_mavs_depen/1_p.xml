<p>Mitochondrial adaptor protein FAF1 has recently been found to form aggregates that suppress RIG-I signaling [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As demonstrated above, PB1-F2 proteins of H5N1 and H7N9 did not decrease ΔΨm but formed protein aggregates on mitochondria. This prompted us to ask whether they might share RIG-I-suppressing activity similar to that of FAF1. WSN PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 have also been shown to suppress type I IFN production [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To shed light on the IFN antagonism of H7N9 PB1-F2, luciferase reporter assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. HEK293T cells expressing PB1-F2 of WSN, H5N1 or H7N9 and IFNβ-Luc reporter were either infected with Sendai virus or transfected with poly(I:C). Whereas expression of WSN PB1-F2 minimally affected Sendai virus- or poly(I:C)-induced activation of IFNβ promoter activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, bar 3 vs 2), this activity was dampened by 50% when H5N1 PB1-F2 or H7N9 PB1-F2 was expressed (bars 4 and 5 vs 2). Likewise, in contrast to a mild suppressive effect of WSN PB1-F2 on the IFNβ-inducing activity of RIG-IN, a dominant active version of RIG-I [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the suppression of RIG-IN activity by H5N1 PB1-F2 and H7N9 PB1-F2 was more pronounced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, bars 4 and 5 vs 2). The specificity of this suppression on RIG-I signaling was verified since PB1-F2 from any of the three viruses had no effect on MyD88-induced activation of IFNβ promoter activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, bars 3–5). To shed light on the mechanism of action of PB1-F2, IFNβ promoter was activated by three downstream effector proteins of RIG-I signaling, namely MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), TBK1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) and a constitutively active form of IRF3 known as IRF3-5D [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). All three PB1-F2 proteins suppressed the activity of MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, bars 3–5) but had no influence on TBK1 or IRF3-5D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>), consistent with an action point upstream of TBK1. The suppressive activity of H7N9 PB1-F2 on MAVS was most prominent followed by that of H5N1 PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, bars 4 and 5 vs 2). The effect of WSN PB1-F2 was milder (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, bar 3 vs 2). A similar suppressive pattern on MAVS activity was also observed when luciferase reporter expression was driven by other three types of enhancer elements, namely κB elements (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), IRF3 elements (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3I</xref>) and IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3J</xref>). These results indicated that H7N9 PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 had a potent suppressive effect on MAVS. To verify the expression of PB1-F2s and other proteins of interest in the luciferase assay, Western blot analysis was performed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). As also shown in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">2</xref>, H5N1 PB1-F2 and H7N9 PB1-F2 were more abundant than WSN PB1-F2, although the same dose of plasmid was used in the transfection (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s003">S3G Fig</xref>) were comparable in the presence and absence of PB1-F2s. However, MAVS expression was diminished when PB1-F2 was present. Notably, the diminishing effect of H5N1 PB1-F2 and H7N9 PB1-F2 was most prominent (
