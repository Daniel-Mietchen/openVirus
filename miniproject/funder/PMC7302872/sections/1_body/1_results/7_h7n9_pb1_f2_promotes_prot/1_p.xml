<p>H7N9 PB1-F2 destabilized MAVS protein to its basal level when cells were infected with Sendai virus or transfected with poly(I:C) or MAVS expression vector (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5</xref>). It was noteworthy that under all these immune-stimulatory conditions, self-aggregation of MAVS protein is also promoted through its CARD domain to form giant protein filament on mitochondria, which is required for propagation of type I IFN response [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. To explore how H7N9 PB1-F2 destabilized MAVS protein, cells in which MAVS and H7N9 PB1-F2 are overexpressed were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1. The administration of MG132 or bafilomycin A1 alone for 6 and 16 hours could not fully rescue the suppression of MAVS protein expression by H7N9 PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, lane 3 vs 1, and lane 6 vs 4). However, in the presence of both MG132 and bafilomycin A1 for 16 hours, the level of MAVS protein was gradually restored (

This result suggested that both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation might contribute to H7N9 PB1-F2-induced destabilization of MAVS. The destabilizing effect of WSN PB1-F2 on MAVS was not evident at the early time point of 6 hours and less prominent than that of H7N9 PB1-F2 when cells were treated for 16 hours, but the same trend in response to MG132, bafilomycin A1 and their combination was also seen (
