<p>WSN PB1-F2 has been shown to adopt β-sheet conformation for amyloid aggregation in a membranous environment [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Particularly, antiparallel cross-β-sheet pairing is necessary for the formation of prefibrillar oligomer that seeds amyloid fibrils [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To explore whether H7N9 PB1-F2 might form similar conformation seen in WSN PB1-F2, the PASTA 2.0 program was used to predict cross-β sheet structure of PB1-F2 sequences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A threshold energy was set at -2.8 PEU, below which candidate pairs represent highly confident cross-β interaction with 90% specificity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While PB1-F2 proteins from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses might adopt parallel pairing at residues 55–58 with an energy of lower than -5.31 PEU, multiple highly probable anti-parallel pairings were also predicted to form in PB1-F2 of H5N1 and H7N9 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). For H7N9 PB1-F2, 12 putative anti-parallel pairings with a low energy ranging from -3.26 to -3.97 PEU were predicted to span the entire C terminus (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Likewise, H5N1 PB1-F2 might form 12 anti-parallel pairings with an energy ranging from -2.98 to -3.53 PEU at its C-terminal region. In contrast, WSN PB1-F2 had only 6 putative anti-parallel pairings with the highest energy ranging from -2.88 to -3.21 PEU in the same region.
