<p>To derive further mechanistic insight on how H7N9 PB1-F2 suppresses MAVS, co-immuno-precipitation was performed to check for the interaction of MAVS with downstream effectors TRAF3, TRAF6, TBK1 and IKKε. TRAF3 was found to bind with multimerized MAVS through TRAF3IP3 independently of CARD domain-dependent aggregation [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Instead, TRAF6-MAVS interaction requires complete MAVS aggregation through CARD-CARD interaction [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. MAVS interaction with TBK1 and IKKε is essential for formation of mature MAVS signalosome formation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Half transfection dose of PB1-F2 was used in this experiment to achieve constant steady-state expression level of MAVS. Indeed, we found that H7N9 PB1-F2 did not affect the interaction of MAVS with TRAF3 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, lane 4 vs 2). Moreover, expression of H7N9 PB1-F2 potently suppressed MAVS-TBK1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, lane 4 vs 2) and MAVS-IKKε interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, lane 4 vs 2). Compared to H7N9 PB1-F2, WSN PB1-F2 was much weaker in the suppression of MAVS-TRAF6, MAVS-TBK1 and MAVS-IKKε interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8A–8D</xref>). These results suggested that MAVS failed to recruit downstream effectors TRAF6, TBK1 and IKKε but was still capable of interacting with TRAF3 when H7N9 PB1-F2 was expressed.
