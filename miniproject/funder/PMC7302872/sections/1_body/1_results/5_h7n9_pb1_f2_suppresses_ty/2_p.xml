<p>As mentioned above, H7N9 PB1-F2 was found to be a more potent suppressor of MAVS-mediated IFN response than WSN PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g003">Fig 3A to 3J</xref>). To verify this in the context of viral infection, WSN virus (WSN WT) and its PB1-F2 defective mutant (WSN ΔF) were also constructed. THP-1 cells were then infected with WSN WT and WSN ΔF. Levels of IFNβ mRNA, TNFα mRNA and viral RNA segments were compared (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Unlike H7-2 WT and H7-2 ΔF, WSN WT and WSN ΔF did not show remarkable difference in either replication kinetic or induction of IFNβ and TNFα transcripts in THP-1 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Hence, WSN PB1-F2 had no influence on type I IFN induction during viral infection in THP-1 cells, whereas H7N9 PB1-F2 exerted a significant IFN suppressive effect.
