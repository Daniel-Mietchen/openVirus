<p>To clarify exactly how H7N9 PB1-F2 might affect MAVS aggregation, we performed SDD-AGE analysis as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Since expression of H7N9 PB1-F2 led to reduction of the total level of MAVS protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5</xref>), HEK293T cells were overexpressed with MAVS and H7N9 PB1-F2 in the ratio of 1 μg to 0.2 μg so that steady-state level of overexpressed MAVS became stable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). WSN PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 were included for comparison. H7N9 PB1-F2 showed the most prominent suppressive effect on MAVS aggregation, followed by H5N1 PB1-F2 and then WSN PB1-F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, lane 4 vs 2 and 3). To check for PB1-F2-MAVS interaction, co-immunoprecipitation was performed in cells in which MAVS was overexpressed from a stronger mammalian expression vector pCAGEN, which produced 7-fold more induction of IFN reporter activity than pEF-Bos (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Steady-state level of MAVS remained constant when cells were transfected with 1 μg pCAGEN-MAVS and 0.5 μg PB1-F2 plasmid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, H7N9 PB1-F2 did not interact with MAVS protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, lane 8 vs 6). In contrast, MAVS was weakly detected in the H5N1 PB1-F2 precipitate and the association between WSN PB1-F2 and MAVS was much more pronounced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, lanes 6 and 7).
