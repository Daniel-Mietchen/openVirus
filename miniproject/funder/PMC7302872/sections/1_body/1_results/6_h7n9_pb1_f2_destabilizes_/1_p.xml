<p>Upon activation of RIG-I signaling, MAVS protein is strictly regulated by both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation to prevent uncontrolled signal activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We monitored MAVS expression levels in H7-2 WT- and H7-2 ΔF-infected THP-1 cells over a time course. Decrease in the protein level of MAVS was seen in H7-2 WT-infected cells at as early as 6 hpi, but the drop was noticeable in H7-2 ΔF-infected cells only at 12 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, lane 2 vs 1 and 3, and lane 6 vs 3). This difference could not be accounted for by the difference in MAVS mRNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Viral protein expression as represented by the level of PA protein did not differ between cells infected with H7-2 WT and H7-2 ΔF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). H7N9 PB1-F2 was found to express early at 6 and 12 hpi, and it was not detectable at 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The same infection experiment was performed in THP-1 cells with WSN WT and WSN ΔF to verify whether the diminishing effect of PB1-F2 on MAVS protein might be virus type-specific (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We noted that the levels of MAVS protein were similar between cells infected with WSN WT and WSN ΔF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). A drop in MAVS mRNA level was seen in infected cells at as early as 6 hpi, but no difference was noticeable between cells infected by the two viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This indicated a PB1-F2-mediated decrease in the level of MAVS protein in the early phase of infection with H7N9 but not WSN. This finding was compatible with destabilization of MAVS protein by H7N9 PB1-F2. To test this possibility, HEK293T cells overexpressing MAVS and PB1-F2 through co-transfection were treated with cycloheximide to terminate protein translation so that MAVS protein level was only affected by degradation. H7N9 PB1-F2 but not WSN PB1-F2 reduced the half-life of MAVS protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, lanes 9–12 vs 5–8). Consistent with this, expression of H7N9 PB1-F2 diminished the levels of MAVS protein in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, lanes 7–11). This effect was not observed for WSN PB1-F2 even at the highest expression level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, lane 6).
