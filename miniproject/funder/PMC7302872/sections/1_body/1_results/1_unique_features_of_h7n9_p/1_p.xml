<p>H7N9 and H5N1 viruses are known to be more virulent than human influenza viruses including the WSN laboratory strain [

Consistent with their closer evolutionary relationship, PB1-F2 proteins of H5N1 and H7N9 shared 82.2% identical residues. Notably, although H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were highly virulent in humans, their PB1-F2 proteins carried N66 (
