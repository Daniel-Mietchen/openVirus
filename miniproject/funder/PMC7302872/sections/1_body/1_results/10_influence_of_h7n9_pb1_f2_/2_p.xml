<p>TRIM31 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting K63-polyubiquitination, aggregation and activation of MAVS [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Aggregation-prone mitochondrial protein FAF1 suppresses RIG-I signaling by blocking TRIM31-MAVS interaction and in turn K63-polyubiquitination of MAVS [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As aggregation-prone H7N9 PB1-F2 was found to suppress K63-polyubiquitination of MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>), we asked whether H7N9 PB1-F2 might also affect TRIM31-MAVS interaction. Indeed, by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, we found that H7N9 PB1-F2 blocked TRIM31-MAVS interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9D and 9E</xref>). Compared to H7N9 PB1-F2, WSN PB1-F2 could minimally affect TRIM31-MAVS interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9F</xref>). Thus, like FAF1, H7N9 PB1-F2 perturbed TRIM31-MAVS interaction required for K63-polyubiquitination and aggregation of MAVS.
