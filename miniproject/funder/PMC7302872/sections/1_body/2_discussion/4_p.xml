<p>It is still an open question as to how H7N9 PB1-F2 abolishes MAVS-TRIM31 interaction. TRIM31 is not a mitochondrial membrane protein but attached to mitochondria through an unknown factor [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Sendai virus infection enhances MAVS-TRIM31 complex formation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], suggesting that MAVS aggregation favors TRIM31 mitochondrial localization and MAVS-TRIM31 interaction. However, H7N9 PB1-F2 formed amyloid aggregates on mitochondria leading to alteration of mitochondrial morphology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which might pose steric hindrance to aggregation of MAVS, which did not interact with H7N9 PB1-F2 directly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Plausibly, MAVS aggregation was hindered but its multimeric structure remained intact, enabling it to interact with TRAF3 only (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) but not TRAF6, TBK1, IKKε or TRIM31 (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">9D and 9E</xref>). Like a negative feedback loop, weakening of TRIM31-MAVS interaction by H7N9 PB1-F2 suppressed K63-polyubiquitintion, aggregation and activation of MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>). It will be of great interest to determine whether H7N9 PB1-F2 might directly target TRIM31 or other essential components that mediate MAVS-TRIM31 complex formation, including YOD1, SIRT5 and SNX8. Particularly, whether and how H7N9 PB1-F2 might affect phospholipids in mitochondrial membrane merit further investigations. Since the ubiquitination of H7N9 PB1-F2 is known to be required for its biological function [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the role of TRIM31 in this process might also be worthy of experimental validation.
