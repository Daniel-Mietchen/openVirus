<p>Recombinant influenza A viruses deficient of another IFN antagonist NS1 have been evaluated for use as the backbone for construction of candidate attenuated vaccines due to its potent type I IFN-inducing property [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, severely attenuated replication of the NS1-deleted viruses poses a challenge to the preparation of seed virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. A DelNS1 system with adaptive mutations to support virus replication in eggs and MDCK cells has recently been reported for making optimal live attenuated influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Although the elevation of the type I IFN-inducing activity of the recombinant H7N9 PB1-F2-deficient virus was mild (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), its replication was not affected in THP-1 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and modestly attenuated in A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). It will be of great interest to test whether PB1-F2 knockout could serve as another strategy for construction of attenuated vaccines. Particularly, whether double knockout of NS1 and PB1-F2 might have any advantages in boosting innate immunity warrants experimental validation.
