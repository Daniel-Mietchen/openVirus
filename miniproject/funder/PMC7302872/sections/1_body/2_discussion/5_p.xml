<p>The suppressive effect of PB1-F2 on MAVS aggregation and stability is virus subtype-specific. H7N9 PB1-F2 but not WSN PB1-F2 was capable of destabilizing MAVS and preventing its aggregation. Although the activity profiles of H7N9 PB1-F2 and H5N1 PB1-F2 were distinct, both proteins were competent to form aggregates on mitochondria (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">2</xref>) and to destabilize MAVS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5G and 5I</xref>). Thus, the two pathogenic avian influenza viruses share a similar MAVS-destabilizing property. It will be of interest to determine the residues and regions in PB1-F2 proteins of H7N9 and H5N1 viruses required for aggregation. As predicted by PASTA 2.0 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008611.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), however, anti-parallel pairing that promotes protein aggregation spans over a wide C-terminal region of both proteins, probably involving multiple residues. Structural analysis of PB1-F2 is required to clarify their exact roles. Other subtype-specific properties of PB1-F2 have been well documented [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Although originally thought to be properties of all PB1-F2 proteins [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], abilities to sequester MAVS and to decrease ΔΨm are obligatory to PR8 or WSN virus (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g007">7</xref>). PB1-F2 of the 1918 pandemic strain is known to co-degrade with DDX3X, leading to inhibition of TBK1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Whereas PB1-F2 of the 1918 strain is a fast-turnover protein similar to WSN PB1-F2, H7N9 PB1-F2 is much stabilized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Whether PB1-F2 of the 1918 strain might also be aggregation-prone and whether H7N9 PB1-F2 could also target DDX3X for degradation merit further comparison and analysis. Under a strong selection pressure [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], PB1-F2 proteins of different subtypes might have been evolved to target MAVS and other adaptor proteins in the RIG-I signaling pathway using different strategies. Instead of binding with and sequestering MAVS, H7N9 PB1-F2 suppressed its aggregation and destabilized it. Notably, the suppressive effect of H7N9 PB1-F2 was only seen when MAVS was activated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In other words, H7N9 PB1-F2 had no influence on basal activity of MAVS in the absence of immune stimulation. Plausibly, H7N9 PB1-F2 functions to prevent excessive activation of MAVS signaling.
