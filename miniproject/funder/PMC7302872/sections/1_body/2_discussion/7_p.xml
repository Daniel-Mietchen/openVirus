 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Here we found that H7N9 PB1-F2 potently suppressed type I IFN expression but might not affect production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008611.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). This suggests that suppression of MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling by H7N9 PB1-F2 might exert a specific effect on type I IFN production but minimally affect the overall proinflammatory response. This is compatible with the pattern of IFN and cytokine expression during pathologic cytokine storm of H7N9 infection, with profound proinflammatory cytokine production but attenuated type I IFN production and signaling [

This is also in keeping with our recent finding that WSN PB1-F2 is capable of suppressing inflammasome activation induced by various stimuli, whereas H7N9 PB1-F2 exerts a more restricted inhibitory effect on RNA-induced interleukin 1β maturation and secretion [
