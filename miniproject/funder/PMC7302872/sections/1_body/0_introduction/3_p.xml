<p>In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of H7N9 PB1-F2 on innate IFN production. H7N9 PB1-F2 was found to form extensive protein aggregates on mitochondria to perturb innate immune signal propagation through MAVS. Generally consistent with previous reports [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], H5N1 PB1-F2, but not WSN PB1-F2, had similar aggregation propensity. H7N9 PB1-F2 exerted an inhibitory effect on MAVS aggregation by preventing TRIM31 ubiquitin ligase from interacting with MAVS and thus reducing K63-polyubiquitination of MAVS. This accelerated proteasomal and lysosomal degradation of MAVS leading to inhibition of host antiviral response against H7N9 virus. This virus subtype-specific suppression of MAVS aggregation and type I IFN production by H7N9 PB1-F2 has implications in H7N9 pathogenesis and disease intervention.
