<p>Avian influenza A (H5N1) and (H7N9) viruses occasionally cross species barrier to infect humans, causing severe respiratory disease and posing pandemic threats. In 1997, human infection with H5N1 virus in Hong Kong caused 6 deaths out of 18 infected individuals presented with viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since then, H5N1 has become a global epidemic with a case mortality of 55%, although the transmission route is restricted to avian-to-human contact [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At least four later H7N9 epidemics following the first wave in 2013 were recorded in mainland China from 2014 to 2017 with expanded geographical distribution and genetic diversity [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], studies using ferret model suggested H7N9 transmissibility between ferrets through respiratory droplets [

It remains elusive as to why H5N1 and H7N9 viruses are highly pathogenic in humans, but a robust innate immune response including a cytokine storm [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in which proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) Î± are induced to very high levels for a long period of time [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008611.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], is thought to play an important role. Understanding the virulence factors of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses and how they dysregulate innate immunity might hold the key to the development of specific and effective therapeutics.
