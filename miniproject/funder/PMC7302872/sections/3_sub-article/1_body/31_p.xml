<p>Reviewer #1: The accessory protein PB1-F2 of influenza A virus was previously shown to interfere with type I interferon induction at the level of MAVS through direct interaction with this central signaling hub. The authors provide experimental evidence to show a strain specific inhibition of MAVS function in H5 and H7 strain derived PB1-F2s. Mechanistically, the authors propose that especially H7 PB1-F2s support degradation of MAVS and disturb additionally the interaction with important downstream signaling molecules such as TRAF6. The hypothesis that PB1-F2 elicits a more potent phenotype in highly pathogenic influenza viruses is generally tempting and from a mechanistic point of view novel. It would fall in line with previous observations that pandemic viruses and highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses require PB1-F2 as a pathogenicity factor.</p>
