<p>The quality of western blots needs to be improved (some blots are clearly to faint (Fig 6g aMAVS, 7a GAPDH and numerous are plain overexposed 7a flag, 6a GAPDH, 6c flag, 9BC and D V5) . Often it is unclear if the signal is within the linear range. Additionally it remains elusive if the absolute amounts of PB1-F2 and MAVS are comparable to infection/cellular expression conditions.</p>
