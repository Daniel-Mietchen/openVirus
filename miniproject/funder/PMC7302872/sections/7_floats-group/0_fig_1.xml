  <title>High aggregation potential of H7N9 PB1-F2.</title>
  <p>(A) Sequence alignment of PB1-F2 proteins from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. Amino acid sequences of PB1-F2 proteins from human WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were aligned by the Clustal Omega program (

   <bold>B</bold>) Protein expression. HEK293T and DF-1 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with expression construct (1 μg) for PB1-F2-Flag from WSN (W), H5N1 (H5) and H7N9 (H7) viruses. After 42 hours, cells were either mock treated with DMSO or treated with 10 μM MG132 for 6 more hours and then subjected to total protein extraction and Western blot analysis with anti-Flag. α-tubulin served as an internal control for protein loading. Slight differences in the actual molecular masses of PB1-F2 proteins from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses on the 12% polyacrylamide gel might be explained at least partially by the differences in their calculated molecular masses. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Bioinformatic prediction of cross-β sheet structure. Amino acid sequences of PB1-F2 from WSN, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were analyzed for putative cross-β sheet structure by PASTA 2.0 (

The top panels were the free-energy profile plotting free energy of cross β sheet pairing against residue number k. The bottom panels represented probability matrix that showed probability of pairing of residues m and k of two self-aligned PB1-F2 amino acid sequences. Probability calculation was as described [

   <bold>D and E</bold>) Aggregation and solubility assays. HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected with PB1-F2-Flag expression construct (1 μg). After 42 hours, cells were either mock treated with DMSO or treated with 10 μM MG132 for 6 more hours and subjected to SDD-AGE and SDS-PAGE analysis (D) as well as protein solubility assay with RIPA lysis buffer (E). GAPDH or β-actin served as internal control for protein loading. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments.
