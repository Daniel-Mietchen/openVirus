  <title>Suppression of RIG-I-MAVS antiviral signaling by H7N9 PB1-F2.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A and B</bold>) HEK293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 400 ng PB1-F2 expression constructs, 200 ng p125-Luc and 10 ng pRL-TK. After 24 hours, cells were treated with 100 hemagglutinating units/ml of Sendai virus (A) or 1 μg/mL of poly (I:C) (B) for a further 16 hours. Then, cells were harvested for dual-luciferase reporter assay. (
   <bold>C-G</bold>) HEK293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 200 ng PB1-F2 expression constructs, 100ng p125-Luc, 10ng pRL-TK and 50ng expression constructs for type I IFN stimulants including RIG-IN (C), MyD88 (D), MAVS in pEF-Bos vector (E), TBK1 (F) or IRF3-5D (G). After 48 hours, cells were harvested for dual-luciferase reporter assay. (
   <bold>H and I</bold>) HEK293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 200 ng PB1-F2 expression constructs, 100 ng kB-FLuc (H) or IRF3-FLuc (I), 10 ng pRL-TK with or without 50 ng MAVS expression construct for 48 hours before harvested for dual-luciferase reporter assay. (
   <bold>J</bold>) HEK293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 200 ng PB1-F2 expression constructs, 50 ng MAVS expression construct, 10 ng pRL-TK plus 100ng ISRE-FLuc. After 24 hours, cells were mock-treated or treated with 1000 U/mL human recombinant IFNβ protein for 24 hours before harvested for dual-luciferase reporter assay. (
   <bold>K</bold>) Same as in (A), except the inclusion of a group for H7N9 PB1-F2 S66 (S). (
   <bold>L</bold>) Same as in (E), except that 50 ng H7N9 PB1-F2 N66 (N) or S66 (S) was used. (
   <bold>M</bold>) HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg expression construct for H7N9 PB1-F2 with N66 (N) or S66 (S) for 48 hours before SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Anti-Flag recognized PB1-F2 protein. GAPDH served as internal loading control. All bars denote means ± SD of triplicate experiments. Unpaired Student’s t-test was performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the difference between vector control (vec) and the indicated sample. ***: P &lt; 0.001. **: P &lt; 0.01. *: P &lt; 0.05. n.s.: P &gt; 0.05.
