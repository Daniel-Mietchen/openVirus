  <title>Suppression of MAVS aggregation by H7N9 PB1-F2.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) SDD-AGE analysis of MAVS aggregation. HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with 1 μg pEF-Bos-Flag-MAVS and 0.2 μg expression construct for PB1-F2 of WSN, H5N1 or H7N9 virus. After 48 hours, cells were harvested for SDD-AGE or SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with anti-MAVS. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Co-immunoprecipitation assay for PB1-F2-MAVS association. HEK293T cells in 60mm dishes were co-transfected with 1 μg pCAGEN-myc-MAVS and 0.5 μg PB1-F2-Flag expression construct. After 48 hours, cells were harvested for co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag (IP: Flag). Both input and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-Myc for MAVS, anti-Flag for PB1-F2 and anti-GAPDH for normalization. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Distribution of unaggregated MAVS on fissioned mitochondria in cells expressing H7N9 PB1-F2. HEK293T cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with 0.25 μg of CAGEN-V5-MAVS and 0.25 μg of PB1-F2-Flag expression constructs. After 48 hours, cells were stained with 500 nM Mitotracker Red CMXRos for 30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and probed with anti-Flag for PB1-F2, anti-MAVS and DAPI. The stained cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fractions of cells with unaggregated and aggregated MAVS were calculated by counting 100 cells per sample. Aggregated MAVS or PB1-F2 was visually defined as concentrated dots or structures with intense MAVS or PB1-F2 signal. Bars, 20 μm. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments.
