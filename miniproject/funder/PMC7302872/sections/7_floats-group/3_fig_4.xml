  <title>Suppression of type I IFN response by H7N9 PB1-F2 in cells infected with recombinant influenza A virus.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the genotypes of H7-2 WT and H7-2 ΔF viruses. (
   <bold>B and C</bold>) THP-1 (B) and A549 (C) cells were infected with H7-2 WT and H7-2ΔF at MOI = 1. At 6, 12, and 24 hpi, infected cells were harvested for RT-qPCR assay for IFNβ mRNA, TNFα mRNA, vRNA segment 4 (S4) and segment 6 (S6). The levels of mRNA or vRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA were analyzed by using comparative Ct method. Bars represent means ± SD of triplicate experiments. Unpaired Student’s t-test was performed to judge the statistical significance of the difference between H7-2 WT and H7-2ΔF groups. ***: P &lt; 0.001. **: P &lt; 0.01. *: P &lt; 0.05. n.s.: P &gt; 0.05. (
   <bold>D</bold>) WSN PB1-F2 does not suppress type I IFN response during viral infection. THP-1 cells were infected with WSN WT or WSN ΔF at MOI = 1. At 6, 12, and 24 hpi, infected THP-1 cells were harvested for RT-qPCR assay for IFNβ mRNA, TNFα mRNA, vRNA segment 4 (S4) and segment 6 (S6). The levels of mRNA or vRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA were analyzed by using comparative Ct method. Bars represent means ± SD of triplicate experiments.
