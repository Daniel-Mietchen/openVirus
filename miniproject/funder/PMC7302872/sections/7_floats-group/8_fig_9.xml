  <title>Suppression of TRIM31-mediated K63 polyubiquitination of MAVS by H7N9 PB1-F2.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells in 60mm dishes were transfected with 0.5 μg expression construct for Myc-Ub-WT, 0.5 μg pCAGEN-V5-MAVS and 0.25 μg PB1-F2 expression construct. After 48 hours, cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 (IP: V5). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-Myc for ubiquitin chain and anti-V5 for MAVS. (
   <bold>B</bold>) HEK293T cells in 60mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg expression construct for HA-Ub-mutants (K48, K63 or K27), 0.5 μg pCAGEN-myc-MAVS and 0.25 μg PB1-F2 expression construct. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE were performed as in (A). Western blot analysis was carried out with anti-HA for Ub mutant chains and anti-V5 for MAVS. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Same as in (B) except inclusion of WSN PB1-F2. (
   <bold>D-F</bold>) HEK293T cells in 60mm dishes were transfected with 2 μg expression construct for myc-TRIM31, 0.2 μg pCAGEN-myc-MAVS and 0.1 μg PB1-F2 expression construct. After 48 hours, cells were harvested for co-immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 (D and F) or anti-Myc (E) as indicated (IP: V5 or IP: Myc). Both input and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-V5 for MAVS, anti-Myc for TRIM31 and anti-GAPDH for normalization. Arrows point to the target Myc-TRIM31 and V5-MAVS bands. Two exposures (long and short) of the same blot are presented in (D). IgH: immunoglobulin heavy chain. IgL: immunoglobulin light chain. Results were representative of three independent experiments.
