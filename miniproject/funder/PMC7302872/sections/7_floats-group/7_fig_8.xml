  <title>Interaction of MAVS with TRAF3 but not TRAF6-TBK1-IKKε signalosome in the presence of H7N9 PB1-F2.</title>
  <p>HEK293T cells in 60mm dishes were co-transfected with 0.5 μg pCAGEN-V5-MAVS, 0.25 μg PB1-F2 expression construct and 0.5 μg expression construct for Flag-TRAF3 (
   <bold>A</bold>), Flag-TRAF6 (
   <bold>B</bold>), Flag-TBK1 (
   <bold>C</bold>) or Flag-IKKε (
   <bold>D</bold>). After 48 hours, cells were harvested for co-immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 (IP: V5). Both input and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-V5 for MAVS, anti-Flag for TRAF3 (A), TRAF6 (B), TBK1 (C) and IKKε (D). GAPDH served as loading control. Arrowheads point to the target TBK1-Flag and IKKε-Flag bands. IgH: immunoglobulin heavy chain. Three independent experiments were carried out and similar results were obtained.
