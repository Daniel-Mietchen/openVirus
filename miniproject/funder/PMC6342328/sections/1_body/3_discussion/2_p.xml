<p>An important limitation that should be recognised when interpreting these findings, and particularly when making comparisons between pathogens, is the lack of precision in many of our estimates of GCE, particularly at higher contextual levels. Hence, whilst estimates of VPC and MOR at the constituency-level were substantially different between, for example, hookworm and

 <italic>mansoni</italic> infection, the 95% credibility intervals overlap. This is a limitation of the sample available, both in terms of number of individuals and number of individual groups at the higher contextual levels. The magnitude of the MOR or VPC provides useful information on the importance of a particular level in structuring risk [

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic>, strongly suggests contextual drivers operating at the constituency level are more important for the latter than the former. However, when interpreting differences between pathogens at these higher contextual levels, or between different contextual levels for the same pathogen, it should be noted that the statistical support for many of the differences we observed was often limited.
