<p>A general contextual analysis can provide a tool for exploring the levels at which pathogen transmission occurs within a population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, we show that the majority of variation in individual hookworm infection was partitioned at the household level, with comparatively smaller amounts at sublocation and constituency levels. This suggests clustering at higher contextual levels is less important for this parasite in this population than for the other STHs. Individual infection with 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lumbricoides</italic>, for example, was partitioned at both the household- and constituency-levels, and therefore household clusters of infection can also be considered to cluster by constituency. Household clustering was less important for 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic>, but there was substantial variation in infection between constituencies, and to a lesser extent between sublocations within constituencies. Understanding these patterns of partitioning in infection risk may assist in the design of interventions that seek to reduce both the prevalence and health inequalities observed. For pathogens with limited evidence for higher level GCE, such as hookworm or 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>histolytica/dispar</italic>, it is likely that households in all parts of the study area would need to be targeted. Interventions in high risk constituencies are likely to be more cost effective for 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lumbricoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic>, potentially including a focus in high risk sublocations for the latter two pathogens. The general contextual analysis approach described here could be particularly valuable in monitoring the effectiveness of an intervention, such as mass drug administration. For example, a decline in population-level prevalence but persistence of, or increase in, general contextual effects at particular grouping-levels would point to ongoing or new health inequalities. Moreover, such a finding would suggest the presence of hotspots of transmission that may impact elimination [
