Hence, while spatially heterogeneous factors appear to influence cysticercosis risk, these effects are likely to operate at small spatial scales (i.e. at the sublocation-level).

The importance of non-spatially-structured sublocation effects in our own study area could therefore be hypothesised to reflect small-scale differences in pork consumption practices, or the existence of slaughterhouses in particular sublocations with inadequate meat inspection practices. Sublocation-level residuals for taeniasis showed substantial spatial structuring on the basis of the spatial scan statistic, and the lack of a similar finding for cysticercosis may point to a preponderance of the beef tapeworm,
