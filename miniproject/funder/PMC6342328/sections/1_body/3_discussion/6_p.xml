 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> have suggested that the majority (&gt;80%) of transmission events for the pathogen occurs in the public (or community) rather than domestic domain [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The comparatively small levels of individual variation partitioned at the household-level (particularly compared to the helminth pathogens under study) provides further support for these findings. Moreover, in the absence of higher level GCEs, we show there is little variation in community-level transmission between different parts of the study area for 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. Although we found evidence for a small cluster of sublocations with reduced risk of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> infection, the absence of higher-level contextual effects (at the sublocation- and constituency-level) for this pathogen suggests geographic or administrative place of residence does not have a major influence on infection risk. This is supported by a recent study from neighbouring Eastern Uganda which, using highly sensitive molecular-based diagnostic tests, demonstrated that the vast majority of community residents, regardless of age, demography and geographic location, were infected with malaria parasites [
