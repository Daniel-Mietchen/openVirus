<p>Quantification of general contextual effects provides a means to evaluate the importance of social and environmental conditions in structuring infectious disease risk within a population. Such an approach encourages the explicit consideration of group-level, contextual effects on individual health and can form the basis for subsequent analyses that seek to explain the variation observed. Using a general contextual analysis, we have demonstrated the existence of important place-based contextual effects for a range of pathogens in a rural farming community in Kenya and show that these are particularly large for the NTDs and HIV. This study provides evidence for important variation in infectious disease risk in this underprivileged population that point to the existence of health inequalities at a range of grouping-levels.</p>
