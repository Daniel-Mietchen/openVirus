<p>We have explored only a limited set of fixed effects at the individual level in this analysis, and no specific contextual effects (i.e. predictors operating at group-level). Having demonstrated the importance of these grouping-levels in structuring infectious disease risk, the next analytical step would be to integrate specific contextual effects, including household, sublocation and constituency-level indicators of social or environmental conditions that may explain the variation observed. The inclusion of individual-level predictors resulted in substantial decreases in the variation at higher contextual levels for pathogens such as 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lumbricoides</italic>, 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic> and HIV. There were large, overlapping spatial clusters for each of these pathogens, the size of which was reduced or made to be non-significant following the inclusion of individual level predictors. All of these pathogens had strong relationships with ethnicity, which is known to be highly spatially structured in the study area [
