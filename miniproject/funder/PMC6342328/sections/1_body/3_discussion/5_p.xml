<p>The nesting of variation in individual HIV infection at the constituency level supports the growing recognition that HIV epidemiology can be characterized as a number of diverse epidemics, often with substantial variation in prevalence even at small spatial scales [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In this part of western Kenya, individual risk of HIV infection was most concentrated in constituencies in the south-western part of the study area. Further work is needed to explore the important clustering observed, including the compositional effect of ethnicity; the Luo community who, as a group, have been previously been described to be heavily burdened by HIV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], reside primarily in the southern part of the study area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. 
 <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic>, which we did not test for but which is known to be an important co-factor for HIV infection in sub Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], is also likely to be common in the swampy area around Lake Victoria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and may also contribute to the clustering observed. There were substantial overlaps in the spatial distribution of HIV infection risk and that for several NTDs, most notably 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lumbricoides</italic> and 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic>. This supports earlier analysis of the same data that showed overlapping spatial clustering in household-level infection with these pathogens [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The observed co-distribution of these pathogens may point to the existence of shared environmental, cultural, behavioural or social conditions leading to poly-parasitism [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Alternatively, it may suggest immunological interactions between HIV and these helminth parasites that influence transmission dynamics, a hypothesis supported by a growing number of field and laboratory based studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].
