<p>In this general contextual analysis, we demonstrate the value of summarizing variation in individual infectious disease risk at one or more biologically relevant grouping levels using the outputs from multi-level regression. Deriving statistics such as the MOR and VPC (or ICC) as part of an exploratory analysis of infectious disease risk is straightforward, and can contribute important information about the heterogeneity that underlies population-level averages, such as prevalence [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Using this approach, we show that variation in individual infection risk is partitioned at the household, sublocation and constituency-levels for a range of NTDs in a rural population in Kenya. These findings point to the importance of social and/or environmental contextual conditions in shaping infection at each of these levels, and which may provide actionable targets for public health interventions seeking to reduce both the prevalence of infection and the health inequalities observed.
