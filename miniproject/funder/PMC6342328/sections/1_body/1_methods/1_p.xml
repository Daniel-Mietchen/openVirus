This was a large cross-sectional survey of all eligible and consenting members of 416 randomly selected households in a single, mixed farming community in western Kenya. In total, 2113 people of all ages meeting the inclusion criteria (≥ 5 years and without conditions that may have made blood sampling harmful) were included and sampled between September 2010 and July 2012. Samples from participants were tested for current infection with a range of pathogens. A questionnaire was conducted with all recruited participants in their preferred language (Kiswahili, Dholuo, Kiluhya or English).
