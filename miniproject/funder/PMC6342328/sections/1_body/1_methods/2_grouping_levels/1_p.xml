<p>Sampled individuals were nested within randomly selected households. These represented family groups living within a single compound, sharing meals and a common water source. The average reported household size was 7.6 people (range 1 to 30), from which our average sample size was 5.1 (range 1 to 21). Households were selected from within sublocations, the smallest administrative unit in Kenya. We sampled between 1 and 8 households in all 141 sublocations in the study area. The PAZ study focused on zoonotic disease risk, and the number of households selected per sublocation was proportional to the cattle population (see [

Sublocations were nested within constituencies, the level at which government funding for development, and particularly for poverty alleviation, is allocated in Kenya. There were a total of 13 constituencies in the study area. On the basis of the 2009 census (OpenData,
