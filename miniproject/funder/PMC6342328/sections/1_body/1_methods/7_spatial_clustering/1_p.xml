<p>Geographic effects not captured in the non-spatial multi-level logistic regression models were identified by testing the standardised sublocation level residual log odds for evidence of spatial clustering in high or low values using the spatial scan statistic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The default maximum cluster size of 50% of the sample was chosen using a circular spatial window. The sublocation was used as the highest contextual level for the exploration of spatial clustering due to the small number of groups at the constituency level (n = 13). We used a normal model in SatScan version 9.4.4 (
