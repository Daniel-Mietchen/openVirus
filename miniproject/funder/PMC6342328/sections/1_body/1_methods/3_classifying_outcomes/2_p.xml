<p>Individuals were classified as infected with 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic>, the only agent of malaria identified in the study area, if parasites were observed by light microscopy on thick or thin blood smears stained with Giemsa. Infection with the soil-transmitted helminths (hookworm, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lumbricoides</italic>, 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic>) and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic> was defined as the presence of at least one egg in a single faecal sample examined following preparation using the Kato-Katz (KK) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and formal ether concentration (FEC) techniques [

 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>histolytica/dispar</italic> was defined as the presence of at least one cyst in a single faecal sample prepared using the FEC technique. 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection was determined using a gamma-interferon assay (QuantiFERON-TB test, Cellestis) and HIV infection diagnosed using a rapid strip test (SD Bioline HIV 1/2 3.0, Standard Diagnostics). Infection with 
 <italic>Taenia</italic> species (causing taeniasis, or the presence of an adult tapeworm in the gastrointestinal tract) was defined on the basis of a non-species specific copro-antigen ELISA [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], whilst cysticercosis due to 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> (the presence of encysted larvae) was determined using a HP10-Ag ELISA on serum [
