<p>The entire sample of 2113 people was used for the general contextual analysis. Missing-ness was present in all outcome measures and ranged from 0.05% (for 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic>) to 11.1% (for 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic>). Missing-ness was related to an absence of a particular sample type (blood or faeces), typically due to inadequate volumes collected or because of participant unwillingness to provide it.
