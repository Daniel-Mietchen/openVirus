<p>Models were estimated for each pathogen in WinBUGS 1.4.3 (

The standard deviation for each of the group-level random effects was defined using a wide uniform hyper-prior (i.e. Uniform(1,100)). Model convergence was confirmed by visual assessment of MCMC chains. Inference was based on 3 chains that were allowed to run for at least 70,000 iterations after a burn-in of at least 30,000 with a thinning interval of at least 10. We derived the median and 2.5
 <sup>th</sup> and 97.5
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles from posterior distributions of each parameter for point estimates and 95% credibility intervals, respectively. All data manipulation was performed in R statistical environment (R version 3.1.1, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>) with logistic regression models estimated via the
