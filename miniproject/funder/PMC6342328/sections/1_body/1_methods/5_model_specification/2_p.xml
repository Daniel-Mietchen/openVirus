<p>Four-level logistic regression models were specified with infection as a binary outcome (infected/not infected) for each pathogen. Probability of infection was related to a set of predictors at the individual-level and random effects at the household-, sublocation- and constituency-levels. These models estimated the log odds of individual infection together with the variance at the intercept for the household (

 <italic>X</italic>, at the individual level in order to assess the impact of within-household composition on between-group variation. Models with and without fixed effects were estimated for each pathogen. A quadratic term was included for the continuous predictor age (recorded as 5 year intervals) based on the expectation of non-linear relationships with infection risk for several pathogens [
