<p>People living in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa are often at high risk of infection with a range of pathogens [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The burden of preventable infectious disease in many of these communities can perpetuate poverty [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], reduce well-being [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and contribute to high rates of mortality [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. An individual’s risk of infection with any pathogen depends on a complex interplay of factors that relate to their exposure and susceptibility [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The individual-level characteristics that determine the likelihood of encountering a particular pathogen, and of infection following exposure, are often greatly influenced by the social, cultural, political, economic and/or environmental contextual conditions in which a person lives [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since individuals living in the same geographic, administrative or institutional setting are generally exposed to the same contextual conditions (although not necessarily in the same way), adverse health outcomes commonly cluster within particular grouping levels. Hence, all else being equal, two people living in the same group will tend to be more similar in their health status than two people living in different groups [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such clustering effects are often large for infectious diseases, and particularly so at the household-level for pathogens that are spread through poor sanitation, contaminated water, endophagic vectors, and unhygienic practices [
