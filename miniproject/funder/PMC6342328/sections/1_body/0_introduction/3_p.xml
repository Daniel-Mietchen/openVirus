<p>A number of authors have described the value (and, it could be argued, the need [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) of considering and reporting measures of general contextual effect, such as within-group correlation or between-group heterogeneity, from multi-level studies of disease risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Such effects are described as “general” as they refer only to influence of the cluster boundaries, rather than the specific contextual characteristics of the cluster [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Quantification of the extent and level at which infection risk varies between these clusters of individuals can contribute to the development of research questions that are explicitly contextual, and which therefore seek to better understand how the conditions in which people live impact upon their health [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, if health inequalities can be defined as differences in health status between groups of individuals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], estimating general contextual effects (GCE), such as the median odds ratio or the intra-cluster correlation coefficient, can also provide a simple and standardized means with which to quantify and compare health inequalities within and between populations, and for different health outcomes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Estimation of these group-level effects is straightforward to integrate into the multi-level analysis of community-based disease risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and can provide fundamental information on the levels of variation that exist within a population.
