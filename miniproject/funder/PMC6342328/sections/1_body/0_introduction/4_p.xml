<p>Here, we describe a general contextual analysis that seeks to quantify the role of group-level effects in shaping variation in endemic NTD risk at a range of levels of aggregation in a rural farming community in Kenya. Since the NTDs commonly co-occur with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we compare the GCE observed for NTDs with infection with pathogens causing these three diseases. In addition to describing the levels of variation in helminth, bacterial, protozoal and viral infection risk that exists within a single population, our aim is to use this analysis to demonstrate the value that can be added to the multi-level analysis of NTD risk through the quantification of GCE.
