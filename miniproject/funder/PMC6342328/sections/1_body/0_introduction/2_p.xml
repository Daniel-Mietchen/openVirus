<p>Clustering of infection within groups, and the contextual effects that drive it, such as marginalization, poverty and access to health services, is integral to the conceptualization of an infectious disease as ‘neglected’ [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, it has been suggested that effects acting at the group-level are often forgotten in the epidemiological study of NTD infection risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], or indeed of infectious disease risk more broadly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This apparent deficit in “contextual thinking” has occurred despite the widespread use of multi-level models, also called random effect or hierarchical models, in community-based studies of infectious disease risk in low income settings. One possible explanation for the absence of explicit contextual thinking is that the condition that necessitates the use of random effects in these multi-level models, namely the presence of within-group correlation in the outcome of interest, is almost never reported as an outcome of substantive interest in studies of NTD risk. Intra-group correlation (and the need for group-level random effects) is evidence that the grouping level chosen, be it household or geographic or administrative area, has a role in shaping variation in risk, and therefore points to the importance of group-level effects on individual infection.
