<p>The posterior distribution of household-, sublocation- and constituency-level variance, VPCs, MORs and PTVs for the gastrointestinal nematodes and

 <italic>mansoni</italic> are shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, in

 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>histolytica/dispar</italic> and

 <italic>falciparum</italic> and

 <italic>tuberculosis</italic>. Some degree of clustering at the household-level was apparent for all pathogens. This was consistently highest for the helminth parasites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007016.g002">Fig 2</xref>), for which there was substantial heterogeneity in risk of infection between individuals in different households, as evidenced by MORs which exceeded 3.5 for each helminth infection in both the null and adjusted models (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). To put these effects into context, we would expect that were an individual to permanently move from one household to another with higher risk anywhere in the study area, their odds of infection with the helminth parasites under study would change by at least 3.5 times. This household clustering effect was particularly large for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic> (

 <italic>solium</italic> cysticercosis (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The partitioning of group-level variation was generally largest at the household-level, although the greatest proportion of individual variation was partitioned at the constituency level (VPC
 <sub>c</sub>) in null models for

 <italic>solium</italic> cysticercosis (PTV
 <sub>SL</sub>) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007016.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Using MORs, these higher-level contextual effects could be interpreted as an almost five- and three-fold change in the odds of infection for an individual that permanently moves to a higher risk constituency for 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic> and HIV, respectively. Similarly, the median odds of an individual permanently moving to a higher risk sublocation could be expected to increase by around eight times for 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> cysticercosis. Control for individual-level fixed effects resulted in declines in within-constituency correlation (VPC
