<p>The spatial distribution of sublocations with evidence for clustering in high or low values of residual log odds of infection is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007016.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Large spatial clusters of both high and low values were observed from null models for 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>mansoni</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lumbricoides</italic>, and 
 <italic>Taenia</italic> spp.. There was substantial overlap in clusters for all of these pathogens and a large cluster of sublocations with elevated risk of individual HIV infection. We found no evidence of spatial structuring in the sublocation-level residual log odds of infection with 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> or 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>solium</italic> and relatively small clusters for 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic>, hookworm and 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>histolytica/dispar</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007016.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The spatial extent of the clusters of both high and low sublocation residual log odds was reduced when controlling for individual-level fixed effects in the case of HIV. Adjustment for these fixed effects resulted in a loss of significance in spatial clusters of both high and low values from the model for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lumbricoides</italic>, and of high values for 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>trichiura</italic>. Only the spatial cluster of positive sublocation residual log odds remained significant in the case of 
 <italic>S</italic>.
