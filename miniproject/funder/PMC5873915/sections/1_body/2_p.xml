<p>Independent of the studies on WFCD, 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bergoin 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (1984)
 </xref> described 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> individuals from Mediterranean salt-marshes in southern France with an infection phenotype similar to WFCD. Using electron microscopy (EM), he showed that these 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> were infected with a virus most likely belonging to the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>. In 2016, 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">VÃ¡vra 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)
 </xref> published ultrastructural pictures of an iridovirus that caused the same symptoms in 
 <italic>Daphnia curvirostris</italic> in the Czech Republic. Both studies compared their findings to a previously observed iridovirus in another Cladoceran species, 
 <italic>Simocephalus expinosus</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Federici and Hazard 1975</xref>) but did not link their results to the research on WFCD. The phenotypic similarity between WFCD and the iridovirus infections prompted us to investigate if an iridovirus might be the causative agent of WFCD. We here report that WFCD is indeed caused by an iridovirus that induces a clear pathology in its host, and that it is likely the same virus described earlier by 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bergoin 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (1984)
 </xref> as an iridovirus.
