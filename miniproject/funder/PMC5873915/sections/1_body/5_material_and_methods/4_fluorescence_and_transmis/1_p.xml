<p>To conduct the fluorescence microscopy, we took daphnids showing signs of WFCD (population GB-EK2) and cut them on a glass slide. We then mounted them with VECTASHIELD containing DAPI (4â€™,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories), and further examined them using a Leica CTR 5000 fluorescence microscope. For transmission electron microscopy, we cut daphnids showing signs of WFCD (population GB-EK2) and prefixed them in Karnovsky fixative for 1 h at room temperature. Pieces of the cut 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> were mounted with agar and fixed with Karnovsky fixative for 24 h. The samples were then fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h 20 min and dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series (50- 100%). An 
 <italic>en bloc</italic> staining with 2% uranyl acetate was performed at 70% ethanol. Specimens were treated with acetone and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin sections were examined using the Philips CM100 electron microscope. Measurement of particles was done by ImageJ (
