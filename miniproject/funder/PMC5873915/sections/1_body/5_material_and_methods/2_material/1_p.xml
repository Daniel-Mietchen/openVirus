<p>The virus isolates used for the transmission experiment and the genome sequence in this study were collected from a natural rock pool population on the skerry island Spicarna (FI-SP1; 59°48’43.0”N 23°12’30.9”E), about 3 km from the site where 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Green (1957)</xref> first reported the disease. For the preparation of the infection assay we collected 20 infected animals and brought them to the lab where they were processed within two hours. Homogenates of infected D. magna were used to transmit the virus to an uninfected laboratory culture of a 
 <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> clone previously isolated and cloned from the same sampling site. This infected culture served as the stock for the infection experiment. For the genome sequencing project, we collected about 200 infected animals and brought them to the lab where they were processed within two hours (using the procedure described below). The virus isolate used for the fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy originated from a different population (Great Britain, population GB-EK2: 55°41’51.58”N, 2°20’36.36”W). A population sample was cultured in our laboratory and infected females were used for microscopy. This virus is phenotypically and pathologically indistinguishable from the Finnish virus isolate.
