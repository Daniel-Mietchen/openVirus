<p>Two 
 <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> genotypes (=clones) used in the transmission experiment originated from the same sites as the virus (clones: Finland_1 and Finland_2). Nine additional 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> clones from sites across Europe and Israel, covering the known geographic distribution of the virus, were also used. These clones originated from field isolates from Finland, Sweden, Hungary, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland, France, Greece and Israel. 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> clones were kept in mass culture under controlled environmental conditions in 400-mL jars, at 20Â°, 16:8 h light:dark cycle, with green algae 
 <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp. as the only food. Each clone had been started from a single offspring. The clonal replicates are genetically identical.
