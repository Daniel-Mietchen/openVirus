<p>By comparing the coverages of the candidate HGT regions (

Furthermore, the coverage of the virus was about 8000X in both prepared libraries, while the coverage of the host genome was below 10X. For both the Daisy approach and this independent coverage analysis, we used the full read dataset rather than the read subsets, which did not initially map to the
