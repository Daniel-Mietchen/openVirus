<p>To test the hypothesis that several genes of DIV-1 are involved in HGT, we had to ensure that we had limited the possibility of false positive calls. As none of the DIV-1 orthologs shared very high identity with 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> genes, it is unlikely that the DIV-1 genome was contaminated by host DNA as a result of misassembly. The G+C content of the candidate genes (34.8â€“44.1%) is similar to the G+C content of the overall DIV-1 genome (38.99%), the 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> genome (33.3%) and the 
 <italic>D. pulex</italic> genome (40.8%); therefore, an HGT prediction based on G+C content differences was not possible.
