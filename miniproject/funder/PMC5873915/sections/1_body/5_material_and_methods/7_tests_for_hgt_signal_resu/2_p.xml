<p>By using the software Daisy (
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Trappe 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>) to look for split-mapping of reads from the overall datasets of both the 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> and DIV-1 genomes, we were additionally able to conclude that the presence of nucleotide sequence within the DIV-1 genome did not stem from host read contamination or genome misassembly. The Daisy approach determines HGT boundaries with split-read mapping and evaluates candidate regions using read pair and coverage information (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>). If host read contamination is a factor, there would be significant instances of read pairs simultaneously mapped to both 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> and DIV-1.
