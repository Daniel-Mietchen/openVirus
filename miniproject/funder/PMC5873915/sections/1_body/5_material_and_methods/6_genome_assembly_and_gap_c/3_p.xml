<p>To close the genome gap, PCR was performed using specific primers targeting the flanking region of the gap (DIV-1_GCf 5′- AGT AAC ATA GCT CAG TGG TC -3′; DIV-1_GCr 5′- ATG TTG ATT GGT GAT GCT GG-3′). The PCR reaction contained 1 µL template of DNA, 0.2 µM of each primer solution, 2 units of Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs), 1x Phusion HF buffer, and 200 µM deoxy-nucleotides (Promega) for a total volume of 25 µL. PCR conditions were as follows: 95° for 4 min; 35 cycles of 95 C for 30 s; 50-60° for 30 s; 72° for 2 min; and 72° for 10 min. Both negative (no DNA added) and positive controls were included in the PCR reaction. Before being used for sequencing, PCR products were purified using 1 unit of SAP shrimp alkaline phosphatase, 20 units of Exonuclease I and 1 µL of 10x SAP buffer (Fermentas). The company Microsynth (Switzerland) determined the nucleotide sequences using Sanger DNA sequencing.</p>
