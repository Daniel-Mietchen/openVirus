<p>After acquiring raw sequencing reads in the form of paired-end fastq files, we removed Illumina adapters using Trimmomatic (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bolger 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2014
 </xref>) and assessed read quality with FastQC (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Patel and Jain 2012</xref>). FASTX toolkit was used to remove reads with Q scores &lt; 30 (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Pearson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1997
 </xref>). FastQC was used once again to verify the removal of low-quality reads. Reads resulting from both isolation methods were treated independently rather than pooled. Each set of reads was mapped to the 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> 2.4 reference (V2.4; Daphnia Genome Consortium) using BWAMEM (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Li 2013</xref>). The resulting sam alignment file was then converted to a bam and coordinate sorted using SAMtools (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Li 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2009
 </xref>). Reads not mapping to the 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> reference were extracted using SAMtools.
