<p>The Proteinortho tool v.5.13 was used to detect orthologs in 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>, including DIV-1, and in 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> based on reciprocal best hits strategy (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lechner 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). For the analyses, all available iridoviral genome sequences (n = 53) were downloaded from the NCBI Viral Genomes Resource (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Brister 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015
 </xref>); additionally, re-annotated iridoviral genomes (n = 15) were downloaded from the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (VBRC) (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Upton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2003
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Eaton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>). Protein sequences of the 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> genome reference clone Xinb3 (from a Finnish rockpool) (GCA_001632505.1) and 
 <italic>D. pulex</italic> (GCA_000187875.1) were downloaded from GenBank. Proteinortho was run using four different cutoff settings: minimal coverage 20%, minimal identity 20%, minimal connectivity 5%; minimal coverage 20%, minimal identity 20%, minimal connectivity 10%; minimal coverage 30%, minimal identity 30%, minimal connectivity 10%; and minimal coverage 30%, minimal identity 30%, minimal connectivity 5%. When the algebraic connectivity was below 10% (0.1) and 5% (0.05), respectively, Proteinortho split each group into two more dense subgroups. A connectivity of 1 indicates a perfect dense cluster of similar proteins. For the most conserved protein clusters of all 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>, we manually checked the clustering analyses for single missed genes and for any protein clusters that showed gaps of two or less invertebrate iridoviral proteins. We performed a tBlastn search against the nucleotide collection database in GenBank and the NCBI genomic reference sequences database to close the potential gaps. To confirm our findings, we manually inspected clusters of orthologs in 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> and performed a BLASTp search against the nr database in GenBank for the candidate proteins (only present in 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic>, mostly absent in other 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>). The frog virus 3 strain RUK13 (KJ538546), the Chinese giant salamander iridovirus (KC243313), SDDV (NC_027778) and the large yellow croaker iridovirus (AY779031 and its re-annotated version LYCIV-Unk) were excluded from further analysis. The Venn diagram was calculated using R (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">R Development Core Team 2014</xref>), but excluded partial and partially annotated genome sequences, resulting in 49 genomes from NCBI and 14 re-annotated genomes from VBRC.
