 <italic>D. magna</italic> collected in the field from the Finnish rock pool population (see above) were sorted to enrich the sample with animals that showed clear signs of WFCD infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1__D">Figure 1</xref>). We followed two different approaches for obtaining genomic DNA. In one batch of about 50 animals, we enriched the sample with infected tissue by cutting off body parts that showed no visible signs of infections, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, the head, the antenna, the carapace. The retained tissue was placed in a 2-mL screw-cap tube and submerged in RNA
 <italic>later</italic> solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The second batch of about 50 animals underwent an antibiotic treatment to reduce non-focal DNA sources, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, bacteria of the microbiome and food particles. Individuals were treated for 72 h with three antibiotics (streptomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin) at a concentration of 50 mg/L each, with the antibiotic solution refreshed every 24 h. During this time, animals were fed dextran beads (Sephadex, size class ‘Small’, about 50 µm diameter, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 0.5 g/100 mL to aid in the expelling of gut contents. The surviving animals were moved out of antibiotic solution and into a 2-mL screw-cap tube. Excess fluids were removed using a sterile pipette, and RNA
 <italic>later</italic> solution was added. After 12 hr at 4°, the tubes were moved to a -20° freezer and stored at -80° until further processing.
