<p>Before extracting the DNA, we pipetted the RNA
 <italic>later</italic> solution away from the tissue. The tissue was then rinsed twice with DNA- and RNA-free, sterile water. Extraction buffer (Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit, Qiagen) was added to the tubes, and the tissue was ground using a sterile and DNA-free plastic pestle. The resulting solution was incubated overnight with Proteinase K at 55°. The RNA was degraded using RNase treatment for one hour at 37°. Protein removal and DNA precipitation, which was facilitated by the addition of glycogen (Sigma-Aldrich CAS# 9005-79-2), were conducted following the Gentra Puregene Tissue Kit (Qiagen) instructions. The resulting purified DNA was suspended in 40 µL of DNA hydration solution (Qiagen) and tested for purity and concentration using Nanodrop and Qubit 2.0, respectively. Libraries were prepared using KAPA, PCR-free kits. Paired-End 125 cycles sequencing was performed at the Quantitative Genomics Facility (QGF) service platform in the Department of Biosystem Science and Engineering (D-BSSE, ETH) in Basel, Switzerland, on an Illumina HiSequation 2000.
