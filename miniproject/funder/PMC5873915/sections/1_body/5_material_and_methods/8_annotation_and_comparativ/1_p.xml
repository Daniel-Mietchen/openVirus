<p>ORFs were determined using the gene prediction software GATU, GeneMarkS v.4.28 and GLIMMER v.3.02 (

 <sup>−3</sup> and identities over 20%. InterPro v.53 was used for domain and transmembrane prediction (

Additionally, ORFs that had no homology to other proteins but contained motifs were functionally assigned. DNA repeats were identified using the program Tandem Repeats Finder v.4.09 with the parameters 2, 5 and 5 for match, mismatch and indels, respectively. The score cutoff was 40, and the maximum period size was 500 (
