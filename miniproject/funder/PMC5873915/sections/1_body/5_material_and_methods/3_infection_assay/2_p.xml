<p>To produce a virus suspension, 25 strongly infected 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> were taken from our infected laboratory 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> culture (see above). The animals were ground, diluted in artificial 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> Medium (A
 <italic>Da</italic>M) and strained through a filter with 0.2 µm pore size (Millipore) to ensure that the filtrates were free of bacteria, which are larger than 0.2 µm. The virus suspension was distributed across the treatment group (in total 202 animals). Controls (in total 81 animals) were sham infected with filtered ADaM only. Every second day, the animals were fed with 5 million cells green algae. After three days, the jars were topped-off with an additional 60 mL of ADaM. Over a period of 21 days, the animals were checked daily for infection and survival. In case of doubt, we used a dissecting microscope with reflected light to check for infection, as that made infections in the fat cells clearly visible. During the experiment, offspring were removed from the jars. A logistic regression (glm: infection ∼ hostclone, family = binomial(link=’logit’)) was calculated using the R software (
