<p>Female juvenile 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> from the 11 clones were placed individually in 100-mL jars with 20 mL artificial

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Klüttgen 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (1994)
 </xref>. We aimed for 30 animals per clone at the start of the experiment (11 host genotypes × 30 = 330 animals); however, due to problems raising some of the genotypes, we started the experiment with 283 females, with three genotypes contributing only 9, 15 and 21 animals. If enough females from a host genotype were available, we inoculated 20 with the virus suspension, while 10 were sham infected, otherwise proportionally less females.
