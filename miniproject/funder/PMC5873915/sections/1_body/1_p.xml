<p>Two diseases with very similar symptoms have been described for the water flea 
 <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> (Branchiopoda: Cladocera): one is an unnamed iridovirus (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Vávra 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>); the other is White Fat Cell Disease (WFCD) (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Green 1957</xref>). In both diseases, the normally semitransparent host presents with extremely enlarged fat cells that are white and nontransparent, with a characteristic greenish, iridescent shine in reflected light. Infected animals carry almost no eggs in their brood-pouch (

 <italic>D. magna</italic> in rock pool populations in southwestern Finland. 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Green (1957)</xref> postulated that the highly virulent infection was caused by a small coccoid bacterium and named it “White fat cell bacterium” and also “White bacterial disease” (WBD). The term “White bacterial disease” has since been picked up and used in many publications (for example (

 </xref>) and Israel (F. Ben-Ami, personal communication). Studies of WFCD in both the laboratory and the field have revealed that it is horizontally transmitted via waterborne transmission stages from dead hosts and is highly virulent (
