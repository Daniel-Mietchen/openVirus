<p>Infectious diseases affect almost all life forms on Earth and have been implicated as drivers of biodiversity and as the force behind the coevolution of hosts and infectious disease agents — a dynamic that has been theorized to explain many life phenomena, including high genetic diversity at resistance loci, the maintenance and evolution of sexual recombination, and sexual selection (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Schmid-Hempel 2011</xref>). Despite years of study, however, we still have a rather rudimentary understanding of the diversity of parasites, including pathogens, that occur in natural host populations. In water fleas of the genus 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic>, a model system for studying the ecology, evolution, epidemiology of infectious disease and host-parasite interactions, many 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> parasites and pathogens have been reported (

 <italic>Daphnia’s</italic> habitat — standing freshwater — is conducive to viruses, protecting them from desiccation and UV light, facilitating transmission, and allowing for the buildup of local epidemics and transmission stage banks.
