<p>Two Illumina libraries using different approaches for obtaining genomic DNA were treated independently and mapped to the 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> 2.4 reference genome. For both read libraries, the total quantity of reads mapping to the 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> reference was less than 5% of the total read dataset. For 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly, KmerGenie suggested an optimal k-mer value of 123 for each read dataset (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chikhi and Medvedev 2014</xref>). Both Velvet (
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Zerbino and Birney 2008</xref>) and SPAdes (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Nurk 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>) assembly yielded two major contigs that were successfully scaffolded into a single scaffold each. After the application to fill in the gaps in the assembly, a single gap remained resulting from a region of tandem duplication. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to close this gap and to finalize the assembly. The resulting viral genome sequence was 288,858 bp long, and the coverage of the genome combining both paired-end read datasets was âˆ¼16,000X. The genome sequence was then taken for gene prediction and annotation.
