<p>Between 11 and 19 protein clusters are shared by all invertebrate iridoviruses, depending on the cutoff parameter used (

Six protein clusters (DIV1_086L, DIV1_162R, DIV1_166R, DIV1_219L, DIV1_242L, and DIV1_290L) are consistent in all four analyses containing a metallopeptidase (DIV1_162R) that is conceivably involved in host-pathogen interaction or that acts on the extracellular matrix, facilitating virus spread within the host. There is also a high mobility group protein homolog (DIV1_242L) that may play a role in genome conformation, and four uncharacterized proteins (DIV1_086L, DIV1_166R, DIV1_219R, DIV1_290L) (
