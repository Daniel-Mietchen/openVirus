<p>The Daphnia iridescent virus 1 (DIV-1), the causative agent of White Fat Cell Disease (WFCD) in the water flea 
 <italic>D. magna</italic>, is a member of the invertebrate IV clade within the virus family 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>. Compared to other IVs of this group, the DIV-1 genome has apparently undergone a substantial gene loss and acquired a number of unique new genes after splitting from its most recently known ancestor. Horizontal gene uptake probably helped the virus adapt to its crustacean host. DIV-1 has a unique position within the IIVs, as it encodes genes that are probably involved in RNA capping. These genes are not usually found in IIVs. The uniqueness of DIV-1 among the IVs is also seen in that it contains genes for hostâ€“pathogen interaction and pathogenicity. Furthermore, with about 300 DIV-1 specific ORFs containing characterized and hypothetical proteins, the virus is strongly diverged from other IVs. Nevertheless, all IIVs share a set of specific genes involved primarily in conserved functions and host-pathogen interactions that enable these viruses to infect and replicate in invertebrate hosts.
