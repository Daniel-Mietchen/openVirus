<p>DIV-1 is widespread in natural populations of 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> in Western Eurasia and very easy to recognize, thus making it a good prospect for ecological and epidemiological research. Furthermore, it is easy to maintain in laboratory cultures of its host, allowing unprecedented opportunities for experimental and molecular studies. As little is known about iridoviruses and 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> viruses in general, DIV-1 opens up a promising new area for research in iridovirusâ€“host interactions and their influence on the ecosystem.
