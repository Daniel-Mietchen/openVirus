<p>RNA capping (in which the viral mRNA 5′ ends are capped) is an essential modification used by all eukaryotes and most viruses. Uncapped RNAs are degraded by cellular exonuclease, a process that may also trigger antiviral immune responses. Viruses that lack the cap structure either attach a VPg-like protein to their RNA 5′ end, or they recruit a eukaryotic multiprotein complex for translation initiation (

 </xref>). All eukaryotic species and most DNA viruses share a three-step capping process to form the cap at the 5′ end. This process consists of the following steps: (1) hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of the primary transcript by an RNA triphosphatase (RTPase); (2) transfer of GMP to the 5′-diphosphate RNA to form a GpppNp-RNA cap by an RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase); and (3) methylation of the cap guanine to form the m
 <sup>7</sup>GpppNp-RNA structure by a cap-specific RNA (guanine-N7) methyltransferase (MTase) (
