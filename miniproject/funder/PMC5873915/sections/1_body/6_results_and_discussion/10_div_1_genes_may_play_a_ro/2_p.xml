<p>The DIV-1 genome encodes genes that are probably involved in RNA capping. ORF DIV1_186R and DIV1_263R encode two helicases that belong to either the SF1 or SF2 helicase superfamily. They carry the classical Walker A motif forming the P-loop and the Walker B motif (D-E-X-D box) with an Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> binding site needed for hydrolysis. These proteins with NTPase-helicase activity may function as RNA triphosphatases responsible for the first step of the cap formation (

 </xref>). Finally, ORF DIV1_348L encodes a class 1 S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase (AdoMet-MTase). Some AdoMet-MTases contain a domain that conducts both RNA guanine-N7-methyltransferase (RNMT) activity and nucleoside-2′-O-methyltransferase activity. RNA guanine-N7-methyltransferase (RNMT) activity transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the cap guanine, while nucleoside-2′-O-methyltransferase activity transfers the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the ribose-2’-O position of the first nucleotide of the mRNA (

 </xref>). By potentially combining both activities, ORF DIV1_348L may conceivably be involved in the final step of the capping. In addition, ORF DIV1_203R encodes an RNMT-activating mini protein (RAM) consisting of an RNMT-activating domain and an RNA-binding domain. DIV-1 RAM may also interact with the AdoMet-MTase (DIV1_348L), enhancing the mRNA binding and cap methyltransferase activity, as it is known to do for other RAM (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>). The AdoMet-MTase (DIV1_348L), RAM (DIV1_203R) and the mRNA capping enzyme (DIV1_060L) have no orthologs in other IVs, although proteins similar to the mRNA capping enzyme (DIV1_060L) have been found in the megalocytiviruses. Therefore, DIV-1 may represent the first example of an IIV that uses RNA capping, although the functions of the proteins must be further examined.
