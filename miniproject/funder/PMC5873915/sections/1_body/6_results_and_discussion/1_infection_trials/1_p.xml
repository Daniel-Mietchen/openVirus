<p>Of the 202 animals that were exposed to the parasite, 175 survived until day 15. After day 15, host mortality increased markedly, leading us to focus our infection data analysis on day 15. It was not possible to determine if the animals that died before day 15 were infected. In total, 60 of animals exposed to the virus became infected, while all controls remained uninfected. There was strong variation for infection among host genotypes, ranging from total resistance (0% infection) to 78% infected (

These infection trials demonstrated that WFCD is most likely caused by a virus, not by a bacterium because it is unlikely that bacteria would pass through 0.2 Âµm filters. The trials further show that host genotypes differ strongly in their susceptibility to virus infection.
