<p>No bacterial-like structures were detected in the fat cells of infected 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> when we stained them with DAPI and examined them using a fluorescence microscope. However, ultrastructure analysis using an EM revealed highly abundant icosahedral virions in the cytoplasm of multiple types of tissue in the infected animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Paracrystalline arrays of virions were not observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The virions consisted of an electron-dense core surrounded by an icosahedral structure. They were similar to the virions Bergoin observed in 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> from Mediterranean salt-marshes (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bergoin 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1984
 </xref>), as well as those Vávra 
 <italic>et al.</italic> observed in 
 <italic>D. curvirostris</italic> from Czech Republic (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Vávra 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2016
 </xref>) and those observed in hosts infected with viruses of the family 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2012
 </xref>). The mean particle sizes were 157 nm (n = 50) edge-to-edge and 175 nm point-to-point (measurement according to the icosahedral virus model of 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Mattern (1969)</xref>). The virions in daphnids that exhibited WFCD symptoms were larger than those found in 
 <italic>S. expinosus</italic> (136 nm edge-to-edge and 154 nm point-to-point), but smaller than the virions observed in 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> from the Mediterranean salt-marshes (180 nm) and in 
 <italic>D. curvirostris</italic> from the Czech Republic (about 243 nm) (
