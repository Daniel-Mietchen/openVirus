<p>To trace the phylogenetic relationship of the 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> virus to other documented iridoviruses (IVs), we used a previously published set of ten annotated proteins of representative members of the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Ascoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Marseilleviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Piégu 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2015
 </xref>) (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300429/-/DC1/TableS1.xlsx;" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S1</ext-link>). Our analysis showed that the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> split into two well-supported clades: the invertebrate iridoviruses (IIVs), to which the 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> virus clustered, and the vertebrate iridoviruses (VIVs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The 
 <italic>Ascoviridae</italic> form the sister clade to the IIV, making the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> a paraphyletic group. The 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> virus and the other crustacean IV (IIV-31) did not cluster closely. The branching order near the root of the invertebrate 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>/ 
 <italic>Ascoviridae</italic> could not be resolved and differed between trees obtained with maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, maximum parsimony methods, and Bayesian inference. Thus, the precise phylogenetic position of the 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> virus within the invertebrate 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> clade remains unresolved. Given that its sequence similarity to known 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> is low, the 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> virus represents a novel species within the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> family’s clade of IIVs. We thus propose tentatively classifying this virus as Daphnia iridescent virus 1 (DIV-1), with “
 <italic>Daphnia</italic>” indicating the host, 
 <italic>D. magna</italic>, and “iridescent” referring to the iridescent shine of heavily infected daphnids. Taken together, the phylogenetic relationship of DIV-1 is consistent with the EM analysis, which shows highly abundant icosahedral virions morphologically similar to members of the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>. Strong evidence indicates that the causative agent of WFCD is a virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>, and, therefore, that the two diseases with similar symptoms described by 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bergoin 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (1984)
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Green (1957)</xref> are likely caused by the same pathogen species.
