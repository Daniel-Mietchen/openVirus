<p>A noticeable feature of the DIV-1 genome is its larger size compared to other 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Previously sequenced IIV genomes are 163-220 kbp, while those of VIVs are 102-187 kbp. The G+C content of DIV-1 (38.8%) falls about in the middle of the reported range for other IVs (27.2 to 55.4%). Consistent with the finding that only very closely related IV show collinearity (collinear arrangement of orthologous genes) in their genomes (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Eaton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>), the DIV-1 genome shows no collinearity with other 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> (IIV-3, IIV-6, FV-3, ISKNV, LCDV-1, IIV-31; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), nor with the type species (SfAV-1a) of 
 <italic>Ascoviridae</italic>. A total of 369 tandem repeats (TRs) are found in the DIV-1 genome: eight microsatellites (1-6 bp repeat unit size), 86 minisatellites (6-12 bp repeat unit size), and 275 longer satellite DNA (repeat units &gt;12 bp) (

Similar to other iridovirus genomes, microsatellites are rare, whereas minisatellites are found more extensively (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Eaton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>). The TRs are located in coding as well as in non-coding regions. While the current function of TRs in 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> is unknown, they have been detected in late transcription in IIV-9 (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Wong 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2011
 </xref>) and are known in other DNA viruses to contribute to genome replication and transcription (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ahrens 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 1995
 </xref>). Changes in repeat sequences may affect host range and virus pathogenicity (

  <italic>et al.</italic> 2010
 </xref>;

 </xref>). Repeat sequences may be useful as molecular markers for viral population genetics.
