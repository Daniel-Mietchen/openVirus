<p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a well known mode by which species acquire new genes. Many of the predicted ORFs in the DIV-1 genome are either orthologs to proteins belonging to 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> members or homologs to other members of the proposed order Megavirales (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Colson 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2013
 </xref>). Most of the remaining and assigned ORFs, on the other hand, are similar to genes in other viruses, phages, bacteria and eukaryotes. Because IVs are known to encode a number of proteins that are orthologs to cellular proteins (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Tidona and Darai 2000</xref>), we closely investigated proteins that showed homology between DIV-1 and its 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> host. We used a clustering analysis based on reciprocal best blast search with different cutoff settings for the reported 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> and 
 <italic>D. pulex</italic> proteins, for all available 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> genomes (n = 68), and for the DIV-1 genome. After further examining the candidates, we selected for additional analysis those proteins present only in 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> or in both 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> and 
 <italic>D. pulex</italic>, but absent in most 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> (

This analysis identified 22 proteins as potential candidates for HGT events between DIV-1 and its hosts or their ancestors (

These genes were related to such functions as host-virus interaction (DIV1_038L, DIV1_293R), proteinâ€“protein interactions (DIV1_003R, DIV1_065L, DIV1_082L, DIV1_142L, DIV1_270L), replication (DIV1_078R), transcription and RNA processing (DIV1_186R), signal transduction and regulation (DIV1_210L, DIV1_213L, DIV1_214L, DIV1_216L, DIV1_299L, DIV1_324R), or other metabolic (DIV1_151L, DIV1_280R, DIV1_288R) and uncharacterized functions (DIV1_035L, DIV1_59R, DIV1_098L, DIV1_337L). We will discuss three of these genes here in more detail.
