<p>A third gene, ORF DIV1_142L, encodes a von Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain-containing protein with a VIT domain and a vWFA domain, and is probably involved in proteinâ€“protein interaction, in protease inhibition, and in extracellular matrix binding and/or stability (
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Whittaker and Hynes 2002</xref>). Proteins containing the vWA domain are present in eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, phages, and viruses such as NCLDVs (

 </xref>). This protein is orthologous and highly similar to an uncharacterized protein of 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> (KZS17173.1, e-value 2e
 <sup>-106</sup>, ident. 32%) and a hypothetical protein of 
 <italic>D. pulex</italic> (EFX90299.1, e-value 9e
 <sup>-99</sup>, ident. 30%), but no ortholog is found in other 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>, suggesting that DIV-1 might have acquired this protein by HGT from 
 <italic>D. magna</italic>.
