<p>ORF DIV1_038L encodes a Golgi anti-apoptotic protein (GAAP) of the BI-1-like superfamily. Located in the Golgi and the ER of the host cell, the viral GAAP acts as an apoptosis inhibitor, affecting virus virulence. It has been linked to cancer progression and metastasis and can complement the eukaryotic GAAP (

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Rojas-Rivera and Hetz 2015</xref>). ORF DIV1_038L is most similar to 
 <italic>D. magnaâ€™s</italic> protein lifeguard 4 (KZS20159.1, e-value 3e
 <sup>-67</sup>, ident. 51%), to a hypothetical protein of 
 <italic>D. pulex</italic> (EFX68523.1, e-value 8e
 <sup>-59</sup>, ident. 45%), and to other eukaryotic proteins of the BI-1 -like superfamily. In viruses, DIV-1 GAAP has an ortholog in the megalocytiviral Scale drop disease virus (SDDV, ORF_095L (YP_009163856.1), e-value 9e
 <sup>-19</sup>, ident. 29%), but shows the highest similarity to the GAAP of the Vaccinia virus (AAV98625.1, e-value 1e
 <sup>-28</sup>, ident. 34%) and other poxviruses, members of the Megavirales. Based on our cluster analyses, the DIV-1 GAAP protein was probably acquired either independently from its eukaryotic host, or it was already present in the ancestors of the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> or the Megavirales, where it was transferred from DIV-1 to its host.
