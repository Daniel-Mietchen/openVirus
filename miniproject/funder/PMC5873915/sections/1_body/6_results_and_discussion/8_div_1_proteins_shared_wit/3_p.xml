<p>Another gene, ORF DIV1_078R, encodes a putative helicase with a PriCT-2 domain, a domain of the VirE superfamily that contains virulence-associated proteins, and a SF3 helicase domain involved in DNA replication and only found in viruses or prophage remnants of cellular genomes (

 <italic>Daphnia</italic> and 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> proteins or for 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> proteins only, this protein is orthologous to a 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> protein and iridoviral proteins (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, IIV-6_184R, NP_149647.1) but is not reported in

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Eaton

 </xref>), the C-terminal subunit of this protein is highly similar to an uncharacterized protein of 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> (KZS16065.1, e-value 6e
 <sup>-82</sup>, identity 47%), suggesting that it may be a candidate for a relatively recent HGT event from DIV-1 to
