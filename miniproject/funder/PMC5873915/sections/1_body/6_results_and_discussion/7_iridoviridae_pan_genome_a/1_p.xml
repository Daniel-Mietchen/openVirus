<p>Given the phylogenetic divergence of DIV-1 from IIVs and VIVs, we were interested in those proteins that are conserved among DIV-1, IIVs and VIVs and those that are distinct only to DIV-1 and therefore might be involved in the specificity of its interaction with the 
 <italic>Daphnia</italic> host. For the calculation, we relaxed assumptions about conserved genes by considering that if a particular gene were present in at least one species in a given group, it represented the entire group. The number of genes specific to the IIVs, VIVs and DIV-1 were similar in analysis using different cutoff values (

Using more stringent conditions with less clustering, we found that DIV-1 shares 25 genes with the IIVs and only two genes — one involved in nucleotide metabolism (DIV1_308L) and one in protein binding (DIV1_364R) — with VIVs of the genus 
 <italic>Megalocytivirus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), underlining the closer relationship that DIV-1 has with IIVs than VIVs. Twenty genes shared among the IIV and VIV groups were absent in DIV-1, possibly representing genes that are not necessary for infection and replication in 
 <italic>D. magna</italic> hosts or genes that evolved so rapidly that assigning orthology is difficult. We found that DIV-1 contained about 300 genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) not found in any of the other IVs genomes. Most of these genes (214) encoded hypothetical proteins with no assigned function or predicted motif (

The remaining 86 genes encoded proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination and repair, signal transduction and regulation, transcription and mRNA biogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, virion structure and morphogenesis, lipid metabolism, protein – protein interaction, or other, uncharacterized functions. The relatively high number of specific genes in the DIV-1 genome and the fact that its coding density is similar to other 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> goes hand-in-hand with DIV-1’s larger genome size (
