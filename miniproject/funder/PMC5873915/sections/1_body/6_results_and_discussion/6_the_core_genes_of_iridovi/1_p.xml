<p>To compare 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> on a genomic level, we performed clustering analyses of orthologous protein groups using published iridoviral genome sequences and the new DIV-1 genome. A set of core genes containing 26 proteins have been proposed for 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Eaton 
  <italic>et al.</italic> 2007
 </xref>). Our analyses showed that between six and 23 proteins are conserved among all 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> genomes depending on the cutoff settings (

The analysis with the least stringent parameters identified 22 core, previously-proposed genes and one additional gene with an uncharacterized function (DIV1_252L, protein NP_149770.1 from IIV-6 genome). Using less stringent parameters, there was no respective ortholog found in the DIV-1 genome for three of the four remaining previously proposed core genes (

 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> genomes, they do not belong to the set of 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> core genes. Furthermore, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (IIV-6, NP_149899.1; FV-3, YP_031663.1), a previously proposed core gene conceivably involved in DNA replication, was also not found in the DIV-1 genome. Using less stringent parameters, the IV proteins that were annotated as proliferating cell nuclear antigens clustered into two distinct orthologous groups: the IIVs and VIVs. These two clusters may represent protein groups with different functions, or the gene was acquired independently in the two 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> clades, making it questionable whether it belongs to the 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic> core genes.
