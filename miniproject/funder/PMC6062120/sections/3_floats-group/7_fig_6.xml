  <title>Chikungunya seroprevalence rates by assay and continent, according to subpopulations.</title>
  <p>Each square and associated 95% confidence interval were derived from an individual study (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006533.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). If a study was conducted in different places within a given country, only the overall mean seroprevalence was included in this figure.
