 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006533.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Among these studies, 18% (n = 48) were prospective or retrospective cohort or case-control studies, among which 16 studies provided a seroprevalence at baseline and enrolled participants according to our inclusion criteria. With respect to the study populations, 39.6% (n = 105) of these studies targeted febrile patients, hospitalized cases, suspected or confirmed cases, malaria or HIV patients, travelers, immigrants, relief workers or military personnel. Incomplete information was available for three studies. In total, 118 studies did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. Ultimately, the review was based on 185 data points from 147 unique studies (
