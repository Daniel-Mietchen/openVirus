<p>DENV seroprevalence studies were conducted between 1989 and 2017. Their distribution over the last decade indicated two peaks, one in 2004 and one in 2009â€“2010. The number of studies observed in 2004 might be enhanced by the re-emergence of CHIKV in Africa and the large DENV epidemic in Reunion Island. In 2010, the first phase III clinical trial for the now available tetravalent vaccine was initiated. This event may have encouraged seroprevalence studies to provide data for future vaccine programs. There were difficulties in interpreting the distribution of DENV studies with respect to the study year and location given the expansion of the virus in the Pacific, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Americas and the Middle East before the 1990s [
