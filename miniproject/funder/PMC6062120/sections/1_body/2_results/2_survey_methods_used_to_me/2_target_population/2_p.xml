<p>The target age groups selected for the serosurveys were variable. Mostly, studies were conducted among all age groups and adults (&gt;15 years old) (38% and 34%, respectively). However, nearly 20% of the studies were conducted among infants, children or adolescents. For 17 studies conducted among pregnant women, age was not mentioned; thus, we named the age group “women of reproductive age”, and the others were classified into the “adolescent and adult” category. Relatively few studies focused on infants and children (10%), as it can be difficult to include these populations in surveys. Nevertheless, among studies conducted among all age groups, 78% provided age ranges, and 47% of these studies included individuals from 0 to 1 years old, 15% included individuals from 2 to 3 years old, and 38% included individuals from 4 to 5 years old. Finally, nearly half (42%) of these studies presented seroprevalence data stratified by age.</p>
