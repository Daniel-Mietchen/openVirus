<p>Sources of bias in the study design were identified by the authors in 76% of studies. Many different sources of bias were reported, most frequently the cross-reactivity among flaviviruses with ELISA tests for DENV and ZIKV. Sampling design was also frequently cited as lacking representativeness due to non-random sampling or small sample size. Other authors reported that they could not identify the serotypes through PRNT or distinguish between past and recent infection, that there was a recall bias (i.e., when a questionnaire was administered) or that the period was not optimal for the survey. For instance, some authors reported that they could not ensure that the observations of housing and environment made during the survey faithfully represented the conditions that prevailed at the time when seropositive persons were infected, possibly many years ago.</p>
