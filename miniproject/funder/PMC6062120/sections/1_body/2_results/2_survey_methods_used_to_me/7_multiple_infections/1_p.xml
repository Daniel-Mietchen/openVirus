<p>Approximately 9% of studies assessed the proportion of single and multiple DENV infections using neutralization tests, and one study performed both PRNT and NS1 serotype-specific IgG ELISA tests [

All studies performed serotyping on a subsample of seropositive sera except for three studies, which performed the test among all sera, ranging from 164 to 1151 individuals. Most studies reported an association between multitypic response and increasing age. The main reported limitation indicated that although it was clear that the population had been exposed to more than one DENV serotype, neutralization assays did not distinguish between homotypic and heterotypic dengue neutralization responses in case of sequential infections by various DENV serotypes.
