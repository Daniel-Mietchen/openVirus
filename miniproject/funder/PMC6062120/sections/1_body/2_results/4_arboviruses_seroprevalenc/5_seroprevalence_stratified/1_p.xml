<p>Seroprevalence was stratified by age in 72 studies primarily conducted among the general population (53%, p&lt;0.001). The data were sufficient to describe the seroprevalence among children/adolescents (&lt; 18 years) and adults (â‰¥18 years). When studies presented data for 14- to 20-year-olds, members of this group were categorized as children/adolescents. Among CHIKV studies, there were no differences in seroprevalence between adults and children. This finding may be explained by the recent introduction of the virus into countries involved in each study. Overall, with respect to DENV infection, seroprevalence was higher among adults (58.1%; SD: 4.5) than among children (38.4%; SD: 4.1; p&lt;0.01).</p>
