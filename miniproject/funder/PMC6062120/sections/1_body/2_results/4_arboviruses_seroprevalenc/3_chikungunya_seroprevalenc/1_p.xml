 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] to 75.6% in a study conducted among 127 children living in an urban area in Haiti [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] and 76.0% in a study conducted among residents in French Polynesia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Although only a small number of countries were represented worldwide, we noted that CHIKV seroprevalence was the highest among the general population of Lamu Island (Kenya) at 72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 69–79) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]; among pregnant women in Thailand at 71.2% (95% CI: 52–84) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] and among the general population of French Polynesia at 76% (95% CI: 71–81) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>], with both studies performing IgG ELISA; and among Haitian children at 75.6% (performing multiplex assay) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] Variations within the same country were also observed in Kenya, where CHIKV seroprevalence varied substantially, between 1% and 72% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
