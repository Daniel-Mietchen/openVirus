<p>Our review included 185 studies worldwide according to well-defined inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that the distribution of our studies follows the same pattern observed for the expansion of their vectors [

However, the maps clearly demonstrated where seroprevalence survey data are lacking and identified potential places for implementing future seroprevalence studies; the maps also highlighted places in tropical regions where no data are available, especially for CHIKV and ZIKV, which are considered emergent or re-emergent viruses. Some countries located in the tropics and subtropics were not represented, although they are considered at risk of transmission by the WHO; this is especially true for Africa, where few studies were conducted and where the epidemiology of these arboviruses is under-exploited. In addition, a recent review suggested that dengue transmission is endemic to 34 countries in all regions of Africa [
