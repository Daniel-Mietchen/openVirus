<p>Serological surveys provide the most direct measurement for defining the immunity landscape for infectious diseases, but they remain difficult to implement. Overall, dengue, chikungunya and Zika serosurveys have followed the expansion of these arboviruses, but there remain gaps in their distribution. Serological studies can address future challenges in identifying trends in arboviruses transmission over time, and age-specific antibody prevalence rates can be used to estimate when major changes in transmission occurred.</p>
