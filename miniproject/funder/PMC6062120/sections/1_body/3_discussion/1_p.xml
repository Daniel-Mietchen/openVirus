<p>Arboviral infections are common causes of disabling fever syndromes worldwide. In many countries, the concomitant co-circulation of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses represents a major recent public health and biomedical challenge. Prior to the introduction and subsequent spread of CHIKV and ZIKV in the Americas, dengue was the predominant arboviral infection worldwide. In this context of emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases worldwide, estimating the burden of these diseases represents a major challenge to more efficient planning for disease control and reducing the risk of future re-emergence of arboviruses. Several affected countries face challenges in estimating the burden of arboviruses. Nonetheless, estimating the true burden of arboviral infections remains a difficult task given the large number of unapparent infections, especially those of dengue fever [

A recent estimate indicated that the number of cases affected by any of these three arboviruses dramatically increased after 2013, reaching over 3.5 million by the end of 2015 in the Americas [
