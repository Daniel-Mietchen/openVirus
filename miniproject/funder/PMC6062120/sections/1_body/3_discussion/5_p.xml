<p>Although we stratified seroprevalence data by assay to allow for comparisons, more than half of the ELISA tests were performed using different commercial kits and in-house assays with variable sensitivities and specificities. Moreover, differences in assay formats, usage of antigen, and detection systems make it difficult to estimate the performances value of each individual assay by proper comparison [

In a multicenter evaluation using a commercial assay, it was shown that the sensitivities and the specificities varied between studies depending on the serum samples of the respective collaborating centers used for the performance evaluation [
