<p>Although the proportion of seropositivity depends on the diagnostic method used, it also relies on study planning; if a serosurvey is conducted long after the end of an outbreak, the signal for the antibodies may be lower than in a study conducted close to the end of an outbreak. Our results indicate that DENV seroprevalence in the Americas was higher than that in Asia, which is surprising because dengue has been endemic in Southeast Asia for decades [
