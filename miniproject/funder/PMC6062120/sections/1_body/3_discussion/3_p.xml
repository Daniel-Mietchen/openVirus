<p>Overall, our results highlight the highly heterogeneous nature of study designs and serological tests used in arboviral seroprevalence studies. Seroprevalence surveys have the benefit of not being affected by surveillance system sensitivity or symptomatic case reporting rates but still have several limitations inherent to the adopted methodology. Selection biases, defined in our review as a distortion in the seroprevalence rate, may occur due to the use of a non-probabilistic sampling frame or poor field worker practices, such as replacing a selected household with one that is easier to reach [

Furthermore, the use of serum samples collected for various purposes frequently hinders the representativeness of the population sample and, consequently, that of the provided estimations. Even if the use of convenience samples is a good strategy for increasing the volume of serological data produced, the potential biases such sampling introduces must be considering during the analysis process to produce valid results. These limitations in the literature underscore the challenge of estimating global prevalence in the absence of nationally representative age-specific databases. Whenever surveys are conducted, all efforts to ensure high-quality collected data should be made. In particular, probabilistic samples should be used, and the sample size and number of clusters should be selected appropriately to rigorously estimate population seroprevalence rates.
