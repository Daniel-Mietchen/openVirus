<p>Although the diversity of study designs and serological tests used in the selected seroprevalence studies represents a major limitation for the comparison of seroprevalence rates by geographical region, our literature search highlights the highly heterogeneous seroprevalence of DENV and CHIKV worldwide as well as the significant variability among regions in the same country. The review also clearly shows that seroprevalence was the highest in island environments for both arboviruses. Some of these variations may stem from methodological differences, as well as the choice of study population, sample size and diagnostic test. This heterogeneity may also reflect differential exposure to mosquitoes. Indeed, disease transmission can substantially differ between regions characterized by different environmental and climatic determinants of vector density. For instance, in Kenya, alphavirus antibodies, specifically those against CHIKV, were detected only in children from the Kisumu District (lowlands) and not in children from the Nandi District (highlands) [

Geographic and climatic differences between these two regions could provide evidence for varying environmental factors related to arboviruses transmission risk. For instance, mosquito vectors are not as prolific in the colder climate of the highlands, whereas the lowlands offer warmer and wetter areas for mosquito development and could provide an appropriate environment for mosquito vectors and subsequent arboviral transmission. Moreover, the seroprevalence heterogeneity is related to the different transmission dynamics of these arboviruses, including force of infection, reproductive number and others factors such as strain [
