<p>The review also highlights the variety of serological tests used to measure antibodies activities. ELISA tests are the most common diagnostic method (used in more than half of the studies included in this review). Moreover, we noted that more than half of the studies that performed IgG ELISA tests used the indirect method, which is recommended, as it allows for the detecting of lower levels of antibodies than the direct method does and is thus more sensitive [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Most commercially available diagnostic IgG ELISAs that are adjusted to measure past arboviral exposure tend to have high sensitivity but suffer from low specificity due to high cross-reactivity with other arboviruses (flaviviruses or alphaviruses) circulating in a given geographical area or with Japanese encephalitis (JE) and YFV recommended immunization [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. The resulting false positives could lead to information bias that can be overcome through control with neutralization tests. Both tests provide complementary results because one test is a biochemical assay (ELISA) measuring antibodies binding to the antigen and the other is a biological assay measuring antibodies’ capacity to neutralize an infecting virus. Only neutralization tests measure the biological parameters of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> virus neutralization and are the most virus-specific serological tests [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Indeed, for seroepidemiological studies, neutralization tests remain the “gold standard” for confirming and serotyping DENV infections in regions where two or more flaviviruses are co-circulating. These tests, however, are time-consuming, labor-intensive and expensive and are not as amenable to testing large numbers of sera as the ELISA is. When neutralization tests are not performed to complete results from IgG ELISA, country-specific contexts, including the presence of other circulating flaviviruses or alphaviruses and immunization programs for JE and YF, must be considered when interpreting seroprevalence results.
