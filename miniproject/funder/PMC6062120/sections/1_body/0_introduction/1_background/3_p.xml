<p>Accordingly, some studies have estimated the burden of DENV outbreaks using a range of empirical or extrapolative methods and disease-modeling approaches [

In fact, these seroprevalence surveys are expensive and difficult to perform; such surveys require important logistical resources, including a large workforce (e.g., supervisors, technicians, physicians, nurses or phlebotomists, epidemiologists, statisticians, and field investigators) and biological support (e.g., sufficient freezer space for sample storage and reagents and kits for testing). Moreover, establishing good and reliable tests for arboviruses is an important task for public health institutions, especially when symptoms are difficult to distinguish from other common febrile illnesses and when cross-reactivity is observed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006533.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The problem of cross-reactivity, as a result of the co-circulation of multiple arboviruses belonging to the same family in the same area, requires additional tests and thereby increases overall cost, time and labor [
