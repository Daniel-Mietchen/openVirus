<p>Arboviral infections have become a significant public health problem with the emergence and re-emergence of arboviral diseases worldwide in recent decades. Arboviruses are considered emerging or re-emerging pathogens based on their geographic spread and increasing impact on susceptible populations. For instance, dengue virus (DENV) infection, once rare, is now estimated to be the most common arboviral infection globally, with transmission occurring in at least 128 countries and with nearly 4 billion people at risk [

The recent emergence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Caribbean in 2013 and its rapid spread to 45 countries and territories in North, Central, and South America highlight its high potential for epidemics [
