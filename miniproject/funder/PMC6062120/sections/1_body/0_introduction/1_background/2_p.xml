<p>Given the increasing number of cases; geographic spread; and health, social and economic impact of arboviral outbreaks, estimating their true burden represents a crucial issue but remains a difficult task. In their acute stages, arboviral infections cause a broad spectrum of disease, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe disease, which can lead to misclassification in case reporting, especially when several arboviruses co-circulate [

Furthermore, surveillance systems, which generally rely on clinicians, hospitals and laboratory reports, are appropriate for helping detect outbreaks promptly but are not designed to estimate the real disease burden and tend to underestimate the total number of cases. In fact, because of the nature of arboviral infections with 75%, between 3 and 25% and 80% of asymptomatic cases for DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV respectively [
