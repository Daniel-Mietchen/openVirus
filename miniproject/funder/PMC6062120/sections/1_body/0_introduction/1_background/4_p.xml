<p>However, data on arboviruses prevalence rates are essential for understanding their geographical distribution as well as their contribution to global morbidity and mortality. Such information is critical for determining the optimal allocation of the limited resources available for disease control and evaluating the impact of prevention policies and strategies such as vaccination. The rationale for conducting serological studies is straightforward; these studies provide surveillance that complements traditional symptom-based and laboratory-based surveillance. Serological studies provide an alternative approach for monitoring immunity levels in a population and do not require that people be tested during the short period when they are symptomatic [
