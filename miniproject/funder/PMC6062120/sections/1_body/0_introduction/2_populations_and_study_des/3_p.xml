<p>In contrast to general population surveys, specific population surveys focus on subgroups, (e.g., pregnant women, school children, blood donors, and patients). These subgroups are defined by membership in or contact with some social institution or by the presence of exposure. Furthermore, regardless of the type of population, because a census is resource-intensive, random sampling is highly recommended as a cost-effective method for obtaining seroprevalence estimates that are representative of the target population. Convenience sampling, such as selecting administrative units or schools that are easy to sample, is expected to result in bias. The reason is that administrative units selected because of convenience may not be generalizable to the larger population [
