<p>The general population concept is widely used in seroprevalence studies, but few studies provide a clear definition, and ambiguities related to the definition exist in the context of almost every country. Here, we present a definition that will be used throughout the review to classify serologic surveys according to the study population. A “general population” refers to the people (without any ethnic, socio-economic or health status restrictions) who inhabit a given area, usually in terms of political or geographical boundaries. The area may be quite small in size and population (e.g., a village of one hundred people) or quite large (e.g., a nation of one million people). A general population survey involves the collection of data to characterize all, or nearly all, people living in the area. Because of financial and logistical constraints, the data are typically collected from a representative sample of people residing in that area through a combination of personal interviews, administered on site using a standardized questionnaire, and blood samples drawn by skilled personnel (doctor, nurse or phlebotomist). Although surveys of the general population may gather data about inhabitants of all ages, lower and/or upper age limits are typically placed on eligible respondents, especially when blood samples are needed.</p>
