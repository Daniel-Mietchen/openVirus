<p>Articles were excluded if (i) the studies were published before January 1, 2000, or after March 15, 2018; (ii) the studies were published in languages other than English or French; (iii) the study sample included febrile patients, hospitalized patients, suspected or confirmed cases, or HIV or malaria patients because they are likely to provide biased estimates of seroprevalence, as well as if the study sample included immigrants, military personnel, travelers, or relief workers; and (iv) they were prospective/retrospective cohort studies that did not provide a baseline seroprevalence, because these study designs are likely to be associated with a specific first objective that only rarely focuses on determining seroprevalence rates.</p>
