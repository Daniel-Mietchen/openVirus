<p>Data from the selected sources were collated and summarized using a table consisting of a series of Excel spreadsheets. Eligible articles were abstracted for publication metadata, settings, design, population sampling approach, sample size, laboratory assays, age categories, seroprevalence rates, ethical approval and reported biases. When a study used several separate samples (e.g., from different countries or different study populations or age group), it was separated, and each sample was considered a unique data point. Duplicate citations were removed. When articles were not available or did not provide sufficient information, we contacted the authors for additional information.</p>
