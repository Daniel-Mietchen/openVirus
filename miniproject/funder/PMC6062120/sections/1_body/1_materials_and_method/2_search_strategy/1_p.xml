<p>Screening was first conducted through an online MEDLINE (United States National Library of Medicine) search for English- or French-language literature published between January 2000 and March 2018. Between November 2016 and March 2018, we searched several electronic databases with reference to the expanded Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus, using the following search terms: [“arbovirus” or “arbovirus infection” or “dengue” or “chikungunya” or “zika”] AND [“seroepidemiologic studies” or “seroprevalence” or “seroepidemiology” or “serosurvey”]. The databases included the following: MEDLINE, World Health Organization Library database (WHOLIS), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Database (Lilacs), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Scopus. A free search was also conducted through the Google search engine. Additional studies were identified through manual searches of the reference lists of identified papers. No attempt was made to identify unpublished studies. After deleting duplicates, the literature review group systematically screened the title, abstract and full text of each study for the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p>
