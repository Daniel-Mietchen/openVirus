<p>Vector-borne infections are mostly sensitive to environmental changes whether natural or anthropogenic. Slight variations in ecologic conditions may severely affect pathogen transmission capacity by impacting the diversity, abundance and/or behavior of vectors, their competence for transmission, together with several traits of the parasite itself [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Unraveling these factors helps understanding how vector borne diseases may express contrasted dynamics in different geographic locations and identifying drivers of emergence acting either at local, regional or large distance scales. Island ecosystems provide ideal

 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The peculiarities of such ecosystems (geographic isolation, limited land surface area, low species richness and often-high levels of endemism), make oceanic islands most suitable for comprehensive entomological surveys and investigations of original host/pathogen interactions [
