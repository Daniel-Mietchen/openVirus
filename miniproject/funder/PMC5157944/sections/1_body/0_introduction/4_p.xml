<p>The geographic proximity to Africa exposes the Comoros archipelago to arboviral emergence as evidenced by a number of epidemics recorded in the last decades. Hence, dengue, chikungunya and Rift Valley fever outbreaks flared up on the Comoros islands in first place before spreading to other islands of the SWIO. Most interestingly, there is evidence that these epidemics have had contrasted courses and severity on the 3 islands of the Union of the Comoros, despite their cultural homogeneity and the frequent inter island mobility of people and livestock.</p>
