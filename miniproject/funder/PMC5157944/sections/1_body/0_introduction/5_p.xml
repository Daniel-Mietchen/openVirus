In March 2010, a Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) epidemic was reported on Ngazidja where 1805 suspected cases were registered while the number of suspected cases was only 18 and 4 on Mwali and Ndzouani respectively, as informally reported by the Comorian Health Authorities (

Only 76 cases of dengue were confirmed on Mayotte despite an efficient surveillance system [
