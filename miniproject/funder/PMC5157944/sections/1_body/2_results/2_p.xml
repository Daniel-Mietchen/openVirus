 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for each arbovirus in the whole sample and according to the living Island. Data show that most individuals (75%) have been previously infected by DENV while seropositivity rates to CHIKV, RVFV and WNV were much lower (12.0%, 10.7% and 7.2%, respectively). Finally, very few individuals were seropositive for TBEV and YFV (0.7% and 0.5%, respectively). When the data generated from individuals suffering clinical conditions (n = 325) and from healthy individuals (N = 75) were analyzed separately (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the prevalence rates were not statistically different between the two subgroups for DENV, CHIKV, YFV and WNV but were found significantly higher for RVFV and TBEV in the subgroup of healthy individuals.
