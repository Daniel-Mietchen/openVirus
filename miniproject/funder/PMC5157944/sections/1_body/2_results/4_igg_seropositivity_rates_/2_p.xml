<p>As several dengue epidemics hit the Comoros archipelago during the last 70 years, we typed sera against each of the 4 DENV serotypes using the ELISA-format micro neutralization test derived from the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). A subgroup of 90 sera testing ELISA positive for DENV was randomly selected from persons aged less than 50. Sera from individuals over age 50 were not considered for this test since interpretation of the neutralization profiles is more complicated in older age classes which are more likely to have experienced sequential infections by different DENV serotypes, thus inducing stronger heterotypic DENV neutralization responses. Four samples testing ELISA negative were used as controls. Twelve sera tested negative by the ELISA-format micro neutralization test despite being positive through ELISA to DENV antigen, and were not further considered. Seventy-eight sera (54, 18 and 6 originating from Ngazidja, Ndzouani and Mwali, respectively) had individual titers over 40 to one or several DENV serotype(s) and were considered positive to the reactive serotype (
