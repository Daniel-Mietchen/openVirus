<p>Forty-three sera (10.7%) were positive for IgG antibodies to RVFV with seropositivity rates being again statistically different according to the sampled island (p&lt;0.001). Sera from Ngazidja, Mwali and Ndzouani displayed IgG seropositivity rates to RVFV of 15.8%, 5.2% and 6.8% (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), respectively. No significant difference in seroprevalence was observed according to age, although it tended to be higher in adults &gt;50 yo (18.9%) than in the three other age groups (10.4%, 9.8% and 7.6%, respectively). Finally, 29 sera were positive for IgG antibodies to WNV by ELISA, with most of them (21/29) originating from Mwali (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Using the most stringent criteria to discriminate between infections by members of flaviviridae family (See 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Material and Methods</xref> section), 21 among these 29 sera were unambiguously positive for WNV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004840.s001">S1 Table</xref>), 7 sera yielded ambiguous results between WNV and DENV and one serum between WNV and TBEV. Interestingly, most (15/21) sera unambiguously testing positive for WNV still originated from Mwali. This was also the case for 5 out of the seven sera with ambiguous positivity to both DENV and WNV (
