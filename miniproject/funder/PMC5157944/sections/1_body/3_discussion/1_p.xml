<p>IgG antibodies to arboviruses are long lasting signatures of the arboviral outbreaks that have been hitting inhabitants of the Comoros Islands for decades. Almost 85% of sera investigated in the present study reacted with at least one arbovirus and the seropositivity rate increased with age, stressing the intense and long lasting exposure of the Comorian population to arboviral risk. As demonstrated by the almost negative results for IgM antibodies, this study was conducted during an inter-epidemic phase for DENV, CHIKV and WNV infections. However for RVFV, we had evidence of recent or current circulation of RVFV on the whole country though mostly on the two southern islands of the Union of Comoros. The two subgroups composing the whole sample used in the study (

At the very least, this result argues that our data were not biased towards more detection of arboviral infections in the “not healthy” individuals (especially the febrile ones) compared to “healthy” individuals. Our data also indicate that the most significant risks pertain to DENV, CHIKV, RVFV and WNV infections, with DENV exposure clearly appearing as the most prominent. A strict criterion was used to define positive sera based on a panel of true negative samples that were confirmed by sero neutralization. Noteworthy, the use of the more stringent criteria to identify the likely infecting virus among the flaviviruses (

Titration of neutralizing antibodies to the four DENV serotypes indicates that most sera react with more than one serotype, an additional confirmation of the iterative epidemics bouts hitting these islands. Sera were most frequently reactive with DENV1 and DENV3 and less frequently with DENV2 and DENV4. These results are in keeping with the history of dengue epidemics on the archipelago during the last seventy years: DENV1 epidemics was recorded in 1948 and 1993, DENV2 in 1984 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] To our knowledge, serotype 4 has never been reported as causing an epidemic in the Indian Ocean region though some uncertainty remains with regard to serotypes that have been circulating during the 1948 and 1984 epidemics in Comoros [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Yet, neutralizing antibodies to DENV4 were detected in the present series in over half of titrated sera (44/78). As for sera neutralizing multiple serotypes, this DENV4 positivity may reflect a mere cross reactivity. However, 14 sera expressed the highest neutralizing titer to this serotype 4 and these sera were mostly (9 out of 14) from adults aged over 30. It is therefore probable that DENV4 has been circulating at low rate, presumably several decades ago.
