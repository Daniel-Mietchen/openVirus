<p>With regard to Chikungunya virus, our results indicate a similar trend toward a more severe exposure of Ngazidja to this arbovirus compared to the two other islands. Our study has detected IgG seropositivity rates to CHIKV of 18.9% on sera from Ngazidja and 5.8% and 2.3% on sera from Mwali and Ndzouani, respectively. Surprisingly, the seropositivity rate on Ngazidja appeared rather low compared to the attack rate of 63% (60% IgM antibodies, 27% IgG) reported on this island during the large epidemic of Chikungunya in 2005 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the one detected in the present study are relatively close and the contrast is mainly created by the very high level of IgM reported during this epidemic. This apparent discrepancy suggests either that IgM positivity to CHIKV was overestimated by Sargon 
 <italic>et al</italic>. or that a large fraction of IgM positive individuals actually failed to efficiently switch into high titres and long lasting IgG antibodies to CHIKV. Few data have been reported so far in the literature on the long-term persistence of antibodies to CHIKV following infection. However, almost 10% of seropositive sera from individuals infected on Reunion Island during the 2006 epidemics reverted to ELISA negative within 3 years after the epidemics (A. Michault, personal communication). In Thailand, nineteen years after a CHIKV outbreak occurred, over one third of 111 former patients had neutralizing antibodies reacting against CHIKV antigen [
