<p>The seroneutralisation analysis carried out in the present study on a subset of dengue ELISA positive samples indicates that almost all of these sera actually contained antibodies neutralizing DENV, with two thirds neutralizing 3 or 4 serotypes. Hence, a large fraction of the population (&gt;40%) could be considered as currently protected against dengue. This could explain the long interval (several decades) between two epidemic bouts, allowing immunologically naive individuals (mainly young persons) to accumulate into the pool of susceptible until the next dengue outbreak flares up. These periodic bursts do not preclude a low level of DENV transmission in the Union of Comoros during inter-epidemic periods; however proof of such low-rate transmission is missing as most dengue like syndromes are not investigated in this resource limited country.</p>
