<p>The present study shows that Mwali is clearly more exposed to WNV infection than the two sister islands. It is unlikely that this peculiarity relies on significantly different exposure to the bites of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., the usual vectors of WNV. It rather suggests, if one considers the major role played by birds in the transmission of this virus, some specificities of Mwali with regard to local birds populations. In fact, Mwali is known to host the major seabird reproduction colonies of the whole Comorian islands [
