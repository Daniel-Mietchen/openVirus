<p>The main limitation of our investigation is in the study design, which for feasibility reasons was based on the use of excess sera collected from laboratory consultants. Although enrolled participants reside in either of the three main islands, they were not representative of the whole Comorian population. However our results are in keeping with the scarce studies conducted so far in this country indicating an intense exposure of all islands of the Union of Comoros to arboviral infections with salient disparities among islands with regard to some arboviruses. They stress the importance of Ngazidja as the potential entry point for arboviral infections to the whole south Western Indian Ocean region and raise interesting working hypothesis to account for the local specificities of arboviral epidemiology in this tropical island ecosystem. Controlled studies are needed to identify risk factors to various arbovirus infections to which the population of the different islands are exposed.</p>
