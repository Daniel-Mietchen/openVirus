<p>Comorian islands are volcanic islands spanning along a South/North line which ages range from 7.7–15 yo in the eldest Mayotte to 0.1–0.5 yo in the youngest Ngazidja [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These stretched ages impact their geologic structure and shape the ecologic conditions that prevail on these islands. For instance, Ngazidja has a very shallow soil layer, which cannot hold water, while the other islands, geologically older, support more advanced soil lateritisation that allows better persistence of surface water. The absence of perennial river on Ngazidja due to the highly porous soil imposes rainfall water to be stored in catchment tanks, creating anthropogenic conditions that are conducive to the proliferation of mosquito larvae. Subtle differences may exist between mosquito populations in the different islands. For instance, several mitochondrial haplotypes displaying some level of geographical structuration have been characterized among natural populations of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> sampled throughout other islands of the South West Indian Ocean and these haplotypes may be associated with distinct morphological and ecological traits [
