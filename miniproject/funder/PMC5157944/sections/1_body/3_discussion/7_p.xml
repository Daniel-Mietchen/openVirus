<p>Finally, our study is the first reporting on WNV infection in the Comoros archipelago. Several studies have shown active circulation of WNV on Madagascar [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Seychelles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and the virus has been isolated at several occasions from birds in Madagascar [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004840.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Interestingly the island of Mwali clustered 75% of sera testing positive to this flavivirus in our study, indicating that among the Comorian population, inhabitants of Mwali bear the maximal risk of WNV infection. The use of stringent criteria to discriminate true WNV infection, as well as the observation that most seropositive sera clustered in the smallest island of the Union of Comoros are strong arguments against a mere cross reactivity with other flaviviruses. However, the formal proof would require testing for neutralizing antibodies.
