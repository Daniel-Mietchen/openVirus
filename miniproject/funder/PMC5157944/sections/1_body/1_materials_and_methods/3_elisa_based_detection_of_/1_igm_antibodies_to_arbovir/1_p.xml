<p>In-house immunoglobulin (Ig) M-capture enzyme immunoassays (MAC-ELISA) were used to detect serum IgM antibodies to CHIKV, DENV, WNV and RVFV. Briefly, IgM antibodies were captured with rabbit anti-human IgM antibodies (Interchim, Montlu√ßon, France). CHIKV, DENV, WNV and RVFV antigens were prepared on Vero cells in a BSL-3 environment, precipitated and inactivated by betapropiolactone (Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France). Specific antigen binding was demonstrated by using an ascitic fluid from mouse hyperimmune to CHIKV, DENV, WNV, and RVFV, respectively and a goat anti-mouse peroxidase-labeled conjugate (Interchim). Serum samples were considered positive if the optical density at 450 nm was &gt;3-fold the mean of negative sera with a Sunrise spectrophotometer (Tecan, Lyon, France) [
