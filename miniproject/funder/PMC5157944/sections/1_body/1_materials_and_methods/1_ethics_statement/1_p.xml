<p>The present study was implemented at the initiative of Health authorities of the Union of Comoros (Ministère de la Santé, de la Solidarité et de la Promotion du Genre) in order to evaluate the impact of vector borne diseases on the general population. The National Malaria Control Program (PNLP) was identified by the Health authorities as the promoter of the study to supervise the serological investigation according to a protocol ensuring that all samples were anonymized and the study conducted ethically (#1175/MSSPG/DNS). The present study used excess sera collected from the PNLP and from private laboratories established on Ngazidja, Ndzouani and Mwali. The PNLP has approved that only an oral informed consent should be required from the participants, in agreement with the Comoros cultural norms. The consent was collected by one of the co-authors (RS), who is member of the PNLP and explained the objectives of the investigation, how it will be realized and that anonymity will be strictly respected. Anonymization was achieved before transmission to CRVOI (Reunion Island) and the only information made available to this laboratory was the age, gender and the island of origin for each sample.</p>
