<p>This is a cross sectional study involving 400 individuals living on Ngazidja (n = 196), Ndzouani (88) and Mwali (116), the three main islands of the Union of Comoros. Anonymous participants were 325 individuals suffering diverse medical conditions, consulting either private laboratories of the three islands or the Surveillance Laboratory for Malaria (PNLP) located on Ngazidja. Patients consulting private laboratories had heterogeneous conditions and were mainly suffering from chronic diseases (diabetes, hypertension etc.) or occasionally fever, while PNLP patients were mostly febrile. Seventy-five healthy individuals accompanying patients also accepted to participate to the study and represented 22, 13 and 18% of all individuals enrolled on Ngazidja, Mwali and Ndzouani, respectively. The study was conducted from August 1–October 8, 2011 and was based on excess sera remaining after laboratory tests motivating the visit to the medical center were performed. The eligibility criteria were acceptance to participate to the study and age over 15 years. Sera were stored at -20°C until testing.</p>
