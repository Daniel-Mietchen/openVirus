<p>The differences in seroprevalence and in seroconversion rates between locations could not be readily explained based on geographic location or environmental factors. Two diptanks with high seroprevalence and seroconversion rates (Mbangwini and Hlanjwana, respectively) were close together and near the lower (northern) Pongolo River; however, they could not be distinguished from the other locations close to the river based on environmental or climatic variables and separate rainfall figures were not available for each location; animal management practices were also similar for all locations. Therefore, the risk and rate of RVFV infection are likely determined by a complex interplay of host, vector and environmental factors which our results show may vary substantially within a region, even over small distances. This is consistent with the marked spatial variation in seroprevalence observed in other studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The lack of an association between seroprevalence (reflecting past seroconversion rate) and subsequent seroconversion rate in our study, as well as the differences in seroconversion rates between the first and second years of the study, also indicates that these factors vary substantially over time. More detailed, fine-scale eco-epidemiological studies to describe the dynamics of these virus-vector-host-environment interactions are required in order to better understand the behaviour of and risk posed by RVFV in such endemic ecosystems.
