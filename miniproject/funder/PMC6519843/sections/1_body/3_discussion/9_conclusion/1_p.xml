<p>The results of this study show the presence of RVFV antibodies and active seroconversion in domestic ruminants in far northern KwaZulu-Natal, indicating that RVFV is circulating in the area at a rate that varies by location, season and year. Further investigation should be done into the important mosquito vectors in the area, the factors affecting viral circulation and survival, and the impact of the presence of RVFV on animal and human health.</p>
