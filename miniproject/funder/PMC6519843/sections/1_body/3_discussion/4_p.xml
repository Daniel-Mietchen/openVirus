<p>Rate or force of infection is a key parameter in modelling of infectious diseases in an attempt to understand the factors determining disease transmission. Our study showed a high seroconversion rate to RVFV in livestock, even during dry conditions, with substantial spatial and temporal variation. Low levels of seroconversion in sentinel sheep and goats have recently been reported in Kenya in areas in which outbreaks are known to occur [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; however, positive tests were not confirmed using virus neutralization and incidence rates were not reported. In the Kruger National Park, South Africa, seroconversion was demonstrated in 5/227 African buffalo (

This was also in the eastern part of the country, adjacent to Mozambique, but outside the tropical zone and in a wildlife area with no livestock and a very low human population. The epidemiology of RVFV in our study area more likely approximates that in other tropical areas of Africa and therefore our results provide useful insight into the dynamics of RVFV transmission in endemic areas, both during interepidemic periods in areas where outbreaks are known to occur, and in areas where outbreaks are not reported. Specifically, the range of seroprevalence and seroconversion rates observed in our study will inform the design of further epidemiological studies in known or suspected endemic areas, as well as the modelling of RVFV transmission in such ecosystems. Knowledge of likely force of infection in endemic areas, and its seasonal variation, will also inform studies to assess the risk of spread of RVFV from such areas via animal movements.
