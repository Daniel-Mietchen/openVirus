<p>Likewise, the potential impact of RVF on human health in the area is unknown. It is generally considered that human infection by RVFV in southern Africa occurs mainly via contact with infected animal tissues from clinical cases and that infection from mosquito bites is less common, as most human cases have a history of exposure to infected animal tissues and the known mosquito vectors tend to be zoophilic [

However, the last published serological surveys done in this region were in the 1950â€™s, in which 16% of human sera (19/118) collected from locations within in our present study area were protective against RVFV [

To our knowledge there has never been a report of clinical RVF in humans in the area; however, the fact that malaria is common there may result in other causes of febrile illness being overlooked. In support of this hypothesis, a recent study in Maputo, 100 km north of our study area, found a 10% RVFV IgG seroprevalence in febrile patients at a primary health care facility, with seroconversion to RVFV in 5%, concluding that undiagnosed RVFV infections occur in that region and that most RVF cases are misdiagnosed as malaria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, the current status and potential impact of RVFV infection in humans in our study area, and in similar areas along the coastal plain of southern Africa, urgently require further investigation.
