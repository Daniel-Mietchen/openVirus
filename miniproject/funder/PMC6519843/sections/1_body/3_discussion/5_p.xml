<p>As expected, the highest infection rate was seen during mid to late summer, when water levels are highest and mosquitoes are most abundant. However, despite the fact that rainfall was much higher during the second year of the study, the seroconversion rate was markedly lower, approximately one third of that observed during the first year. It is possible that the drought over the 1-2-year period prior to the study resulted in lower than normal infection rates with a resultant increased number of susceptible animals. This would have increased the number of viraemic animals available to infect mosquitoes, resulting in a higher than usual infection rate during the first year, followed by fewer viraemic animals during the second year. However, the suitable breeding habitat for vectors depends not only on local rainfall, but also on water levels in rivers that are determined by rainfall in their catchment areas. The important mosquito vector species in the study area, and their host preferences, are currently poorly known, and many other factors likely determine their population dynamics, most of which are poorly understood. This study showed very little difference in seroprevalence and seroconversion rate between cattle and goats, suggesting that RVFV is transmitted by one or more mosquito species without strict host preferences.</p>
