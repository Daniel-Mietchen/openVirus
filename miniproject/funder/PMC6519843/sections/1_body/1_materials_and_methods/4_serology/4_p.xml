<p>The SNT was performed in 96-well plate (AEC-Amersham) format according to the standard protocol of the Virology Section, Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, which follows the method prescribed by the World Organisation for Animal Health [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Briefly: Sera were diluted 1:5 in PBS+ (phosphate buffered saline with added MgCl and CaCl) and two-fold dilutions of the serum were made. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was determined using the Karber method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A volume of 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> virus (Smithburn vaccine strain) was added to each dilution and incubated at 37°C for 60 min. A total of 80 μl of African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) (480,000 cells/mL) in MEM containing 5% foetal calf serum (Biowest, Celtic) was added to each well. The microplates were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and observed daily for cytopathic effect; the titre was taken as the dilution at which 50% of the cells were affected. Results were only accepted if all controls gave the expected results (virus control, positive serum and negative serum). A serum dilution of ≥1:10 was used to define seropositivity.
