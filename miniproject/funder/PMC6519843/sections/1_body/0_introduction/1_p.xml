<p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic arboviral disease caused by RVF virus (RVFV), a 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], mainly affecting livestock and humans and transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes. Non-vector transmission of RVFV is not considered important in livestock but humans are easily infected by contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or by inhaling infectious particles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007296.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human infection may present in a self-limiting febrile disease with signs including fever, severe headache, malaise, muscle pain and nausea, but in severe cases can result in encephalopathy, haemorrhagic signs, retinopathy and even death. The disease in ruminants may be characterized by necrotic hepatitis but may also be inapparent or mild, and in pregnant animals usually results in abortions and neonatal mortalities [
