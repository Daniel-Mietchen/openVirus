<p>Seroconversion, determined by SNT, occurred at some stage during the study period in 66 (34%) of initially seronegative cattle. Seroconversions were observed during every interval between samplings for the duration of the study, and at every diptank followed except Masondo, where only six animals were followed for five months each. The overall incidence rate of seroconversion in cattle between June 2016 and June 2018 was 0.59 seroconversions per animal-year (95% CI: 0.46–0.75) (
