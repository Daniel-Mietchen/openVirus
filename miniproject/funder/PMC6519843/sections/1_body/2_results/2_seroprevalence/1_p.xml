<p>The seroprevalence in cattle sampled from nine diptanks in June 2016, based on IgG ELISA and SNT, was 34.0% (144/423; 95% CI 29.5–38.8%). Seroprevalence within diptanks varied from 18% to 54% and it was high in all age groups (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007296.s002">S1 Table</xref>) showed significant differences between diptanks, with the odds of seropositivity at Mbangwini (Odds ratio (OR) = 4.5; 95% CI: 1.8–11; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), Phelandaba (OR = 4.6; 95% CI: 1.8–12; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and Shemula (OR = 5.8; 95% CI: 2.3–15; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) being higher than at Madlakude. Odds of seropositivity was the lowest in the 2–4 y age group, being significantly higher in the 4–6 y age group (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.3–4.4; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006), tending to be higher in animals &gt;6 y (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.095), and tending to be higher in females than in males (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.064). Of the 144 seropositive animals, 114 were tested using the IgM ELISA and 5 (4.4%) were positive; this included 2/6 (33%) of samples that were SNT-positive but IgG ELISA-negative. Therefore the estimated prevalence of IgM-positive animals in the general population was 1.3% (5/393; 95% CI: 0.4–2.9%).
