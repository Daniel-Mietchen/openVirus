<p>For aDNA to resolve the origins of HBV it is of paramount importance to determine whether ancient samples can be used to calibrate the molecular clock to provide more accurate estimates of the time-scale of HBV origins and evolution. To this end, we report the detailed study of a complete HBV genome sampled from a 16
 <sup>th</sup> century Italian mummy.
