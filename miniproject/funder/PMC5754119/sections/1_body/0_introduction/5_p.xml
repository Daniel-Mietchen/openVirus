<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (family 
 <italic>Hepadnaviridae</italic>) presents a compelling case of the complexities of analyzing the evolution of DNA viruses. Despite considerable effort, the evolutionary rate and time of origin of this important human pathogen remain uncertain, even though it is chronically carried by approximately 350 million people globally, with almost one million people dying each year as a result [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Particularly puzzling is that although HBV utilizes an error-prone reverse transcriptase (RT) for replication, estimates of its evolutionary rate are generally low, yet also highly variable. For instance, mean rate estimates of 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year) have been derived from long-term studies utilizing internal node calibrations on phylogenetic trees built using conserved regions of the viral genome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], while rates of up to 7.72 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> subs/site/year have been recorded within a single patient [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and pedigree-based studies have returned mean rates of 7.9 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> subs/site/year [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As the highest evolutionary rates are observed in the short-term, this pattern is consistent with both relatively high background mutation rates and a time-dependent pattern of virus evolution in which rates are elevated toward the present due to incomplete purifying selection [
