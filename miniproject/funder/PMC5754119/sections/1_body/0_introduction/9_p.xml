<p>Ancient DNA has the potential to provide a new perspective on the evolutionary history of HBV. Notably, HBV has been sequenced from a Korean mummy radiocarbon dated to 330 years BP (±70 years) which translates to ca.1682 (with an error range of 1612–1752) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of this sequence (GenBank accession JN315779) placed it within the modern diversity of genotype C, which is common to Asia. This phylogenetic position is compatible with low long-term rates of evolutionary change in HBV such that the virus has existed in human populations for many thousands of years, with genotypes diversifying over this time-scale [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the authenticity of this sequence, and hence the evolutionary time-scale it infers, remains uncertain, as deamination analysis and read length distribution were not reported as the data were generated using PCR based methodologies. In addition, as genotype C is common in modern Asian populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and the mummy sequence (JN315779) clusters closely with modern sequences, there is no phylogenetic evidence to support the historical authenticity of this sequence.
