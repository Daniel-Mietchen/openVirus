<p>HBV is also genetically diverse, comprising ten different genotypes designated A–J, as well as additional subgenotypes within genotypes A–D and F [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Intra-genotypic sequence differences average 8%, while subgenotypes differ by an average of 4% [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The HBV genotypes differ in their geographic distributions. Genotype A is most prevalent in northwestern Europe and the United States, while genotypes B and C predominate in Asia, and genotype D in the Mediterranean basin, including Italy, as well as the Middle East and India. Similarly, genotype E is mostly seen in west Africa, genotype F in South and Central America, genotype G in the USA and France, and genotype H in Mexico and South America [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The more recently described genotype I has been identified in Vietnam [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and Laos [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while the one example of genotype J was isolated from a Japanese sample [
