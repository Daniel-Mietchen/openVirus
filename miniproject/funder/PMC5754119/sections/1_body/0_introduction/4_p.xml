<p>For rapidly evolving genomes, such as those from viruses, phylogenetic analysis can provide another means of establishing provenance. In particular, as the rate of evolutionary change is high in many viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], “ancient” viruses should generally fall closer to the root of a tree than their modern relatives. However, a complicating factor is that any phylogenetic inference that aims to determine evolutionary rates or time-scale is only meaningful when the virus in question exhibits clear temporal structure in the phylogeny, such that it is evolving in an approximately clock-like manner over the time-scale of sampling. Because DNA viruses generally exhibit lower rates of evolutionary change than RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], such populations tend to require larger sampling time-frames to discern temporal structure and clock-like behavior [
