<p>With over half of the nucleotide coding for more than one protein, the physical constraints of the HBV genome are likely to have a major impact on evolutionary dynamics. Partially double-stranded, the relaxed-circular DNA genome averages ~3200 bp in length for the longer strand and ~1700â€“2800 for the shorter, comprised of four overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). These ORFs encode seven proteins; the pre-core and core proteins, three envelope proteins (small, medium, and large S), the reverse transcriptase (RT, the polymerase), and an X protein that is thought to mediate a variety of virus-host interactions [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As noted above, the replication of HBV involves the use of RT, an enzyme that has no associated proofreading mechanism, such that mutational errors are expected to be frequent [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, due to the overlapping ORFs, many mutations are likely to be non-synonymous and therefore purged by purifying selection.
