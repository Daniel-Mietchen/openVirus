<p>The comparative analysis of viral genomes provides a wide and informative view of evolutionary patterns and processes. In particular, viruses often evolve with sufficient rapidity to inform on evolutionary processes over the timespan of direct human observation (weeks and days) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Importantly, recent technical developments in next generation sequencing [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have enabled the rigorous study of nucleotide sequences from increasingly older historical, archaeological and paleontological samples. Consequently, aDNA sequences can now facilitate the study of more slowly evolving pathogen populations, from which recent samples display limited sequence diversity, by permitting an expansion of the indirectly observable timespan to that of centuries [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hence, viral and bacterial genomes recovered from such ancient samples have the potential to reveal the etiological agents associated with past pandemics, as well as important aspects of the long-term patterns and processes of evolutionary change within pathogen populations.
