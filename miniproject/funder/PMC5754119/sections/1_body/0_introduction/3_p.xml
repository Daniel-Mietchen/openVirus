<p>A major challenge for any study of aDNA is the accumulation of post-mortem damage in the genome of interest. This damage includes fragmentation, nucleotide deamination, and polymerase-blocking lesions, such as molecular cross-linking, resulting from enzymatic and chemical reactions [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Certain environmental conditions, including desiccation of organic material and low ambient temperatures, can inhibit the activity of some endonucleases and environmental microorganisms, although oxidative and hydrolytic processes will continue to occur in all conditions at variable rates depending on the preservational context [

However, the predictably recurring forms of damage, such as the tendency for cytosine deamination to occur more often near the 3’ and 5’ ends of fragmented DNA molecules, also provide a means of addressing questions of contamination and inferring the authenticity of a recovered sequence through statistical pattern analysis [
