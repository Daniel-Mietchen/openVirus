<p>To date, investigations of ‘ancient’ viruses have been limited in number and scope. Those focusing on pathogens sampled prior to 1900 have considered four human viruses: variola virus (VARV, the agent of smallpox) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Taken together, these studies have helped to clarify the causative agents of specific outbreaks, whether ancient strains differ markedly from recent ones, and the evolutionary and epidemiological processes that have likely shaped virus diversity. Moreover, they have provided key information on the dynamics of evolutionary change, including the ‘time-dependent’ nature of viral evolution in which estimates of evolutionary rates are routinely elevated toward the present and decline toward the past due to a combination of unpurged transient deleterious mutations in the short-term and site saturation in the long-term [
