<p>We have enriched and sequenced a complete HBV genome from the remains of a mummified child estimated to have died in 1569 CE ± 60 years [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The cytosine deamination patterns occurring preferentially at termini in both the viral and mitochondrial DNA fragments support the ancient authenticity of these sequences. We have also subtyped the mitochondrial DNA from the mummy to haplogroup U5a1b, a common European haplogroup [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and the HBV to genotype D, a genotype predominant in the Mediterranean region today [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The nearly identical fragment length distributions, deamination patterns and same geographically recovered haplotypes (mitochondrial and HBV) argue for the authenticity of the sequences. The identification of consistent HBV reads in multiple (5) tissue samples (distal femur, fronto-parietal bone with skin, thigh muscle, temporo-maxillary skin and leg skin; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006750.t002">Table 2</xref>), suggests that the virus is distributed throughout the mummy and not in one location, as might be expected with contamination. Further, other mummies from the same site, excavated at the same time and processed in the same facilities, did not show any HBV reads in shotgun sequencing data. Thus, if the mummy was contaminated, it was specific to this one sample alone. Although hepadnaviruses like HBV exhibit strong tropism for liver cells (hepatocytes), hepadnaviral DNA has been shown to exist in other somatic cells, including mononuclear cells, which are protected by the hydroxalite matrix of the bone [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. HBV particles produced in the bone marrow and protected by the matrix may explain why we recovered the majority of our viral sequences from a femur sample. DNA isolated from ancient bone matrix has also been shown to be better preserved and less damaged than that recovered from corresponding soft tissue from the same remains [
