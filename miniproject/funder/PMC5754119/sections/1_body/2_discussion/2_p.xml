<p>Many reports of ancient epidemics and other disease outbreaks have relied upon historical reporting and paleopathological studies of human remains. Recent advances, including next generation sequencing technology [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and DNA enrichment methods [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], now allow recovery of ancient nucleotide sequences from these remains and the genetic verification of the pathogens responsible for disease, as well as the identification of pathogens undetectable by other means. Our study provides a strong argument for this latter approach, as mummy NASD24 was originally reported to have been infected with smallpox [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]; crucially, however, shotgun sequencing following enrichment for VARV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s010">S1 Table</xref>) and SEM analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) revealed no evidence of VARV in this mummy. This is particularly surprising given previous results in which electron microscopy studies and immunostaining indicated the presence of VARV particles in these samples [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Given our results, a new interpretation is that the child was not suffering from smallpox at the time of death, but rather Gianotti-Crosti syndrome caused by HBV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a rare clinical outcome of HBV that presents as a papular acrodermatitis in children between 2 and 6 years old [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This, in turn, illuminates the power of aDNA in providing definitive evidence or clarifying retrospective diagnoses, where etiology may be uncertain and morphology complicated for key type specimens that provide critical time points for the origins or presence of specific pathogens (e.g. smallpox).
