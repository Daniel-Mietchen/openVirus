<p>Our analyses of both modern and ancient HBV samples returned results consistent with the absence of temporal structure, not only within the full diversity of HBV but also within the D genotype and D3 subgenotype. Given that the genomic structure of HBV is likely to result in strong selective constraints, a likely explanation for our results is that many of the mutations that arise in the short-term, such as within chronically infected hosts or along single chains of transmission, are non-synonymous and eventually removed from the HBV population by purifying selection, yet artificially inflating evolutionary rates over this sampling period [
