<p>Despite the multiple streams of evidence supporting an ancient origin of NASD24SEQ, the results of the evolutionary analysis are less straightforward. In particular, our phylogenetic analysis reveals a close relationship between NASD24SEQ and modern D genotype sequences, as would be expected if the sequence were a modern (1980s) contaminant, and we note the same phenomenon with the Korean mummy sequence thought to date from the 17
 <sup>th</sup> C [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, however, data sets representing only modern HBV sequences, sampled over 50 years to the present, did not display discernible temporal structure. Clearly, without temporal structure we cannot accurately estimate the age of the ancient sequences using phylogenetic methods. Hence, the apparently paradoxical phylogenetic position of NASD24SEQ cannot automatically be taken to mean that this genome is a modern contaminant. In turn, if NASD24SEQ is indeed from the 16
 <sup>th</sup> century, then this phylogenetic pattern indicates that the diversification of the HBV genotypes occurred prior to 1500 and that any subsequent accumulation of diversity was either lost through strong purifying selection or masked by multiple substitutions.
