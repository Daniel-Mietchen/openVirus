<p>On balance, our analysis suggests that our HBV sequence is authentically 16
 <sup>th</sup> century and that no temporal structure is observable in over 450 years of HBV evolution. As such, these results have a number of important implications for the study of HBV evolution. In particular, such a phylogenetic pattern implies that the currently circulating viral genotypes must have been associated with their specific host populations long before the 16
 <sup>th</sup> century, and hence supports a long association of HBV with human populations. In addition, the lack of temporal structure means that it is not possible to use molecular clock methods to reliably date HBV evolution over the time span of genome sequences currently available.
