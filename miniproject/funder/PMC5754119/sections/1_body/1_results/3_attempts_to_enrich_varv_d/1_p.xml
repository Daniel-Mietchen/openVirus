<p>As it has been previously been suggested that the rash observed in this mummy is the direct result of a smallpox infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we enriched for VARV using an in-solution bait set previously published [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Importantly, we were unable to find a single significant read mapping to the VARV genome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Although we cannot conclusively exclude the presence of VARV in this sample, this result does not lend credence to the presence of any VARV DNA when compared to the successful enrichment of HBV DNA, unless VARV is far more sensitive to degradation post mortem than HBV is, which does not agree with our recent success at enrichment of VARV from a Lithuanian child mummy [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
