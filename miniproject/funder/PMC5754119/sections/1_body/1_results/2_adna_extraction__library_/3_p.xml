<p>The HBV genome used in all evolutionary analyses was assembled after pooling all the reads from the rib with skin, fronto-parietal bone with skin, thigh muscle, temporo-maxillary skin, leg skin, and the distal femur both with and without UDG treatment. This consensus genome is 3,182 nt in length and with a gap in the genome of 177 nt (positions 1427–1603) near the 5’ end of the X ORF and in the region of overlap with the polymerase ORF (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). This gap is likely due to low bait coverage because of locally high G/C strand imbalance affecting oligo production, rather than the existence of a true biological gap due to a deletion. The first 5 nucleotides of the sequence mapped to X65257 were marked as ambiguous, as were the last 36.
