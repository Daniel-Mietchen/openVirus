<p>We extracted total DNA from samples of the distal femur, skin attached to a rib, skin attached to the frontoparietal bone, thigh muscle, temporo-maxillary skin, and leg skin of mummy NASD24 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006750.t002">Table 2</xref>) using a modified organic phenol-chloroform-isoamyl method [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] in dedicated aDNA facilities at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. These extracts were converted into double-stranded (ds) Illumina indexed sequencing libraries both with and without uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) treatment and enriched for HBV, VARV, and mitochondrial genomes using in-solution bait sets. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform. We generated a total of 1,041,774 reads for the UDG-treated LM01 library (distal femur) and 3,869,248 for the non-UDG-treated LM01 library (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006750.t002">Table 2</xref>). Of the trimmed and merged reads (minimum 30 base pairs in length), 4,338 unique reads mapped to HBV D3 genotype X65257 from the UDG-treated library and 4,360 from the non-UDG-treated library. A smaller number of reads mapped to X65257 from other samples (
