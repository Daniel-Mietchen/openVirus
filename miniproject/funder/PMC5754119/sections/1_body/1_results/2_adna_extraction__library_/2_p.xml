<p>We first mapped all next-generation sequencing reads to the HBV reference genome (GenBank accession number NC_003977) using a dedicated aDNA pipeline [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006750.t002">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s010">S1 Table</xref>). Using BLAST, as well as an initial phylogenetic analysis of a sequence data set representing the genotypic diversity of HBV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006750.g002">Fig 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s011">S2 Table</xref>), the consensus of the draft HBV genome was identified as a subgenotype D3 virus. This subgenotype has a broad global distribution and is common in the Mediterranean region, including Italy [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To ensure a proper consensus we remapped all reads to a subgenotype D3 HBV (GenBank accession number X65257). In addition we mapped all reads to the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) for human mtDNA (GenBank accession number NC_012920 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) and identified the consensus as haplogroup U5a1b (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Haplogroup U5 is common in European populations and U5a1b is most commonly found in Eastern European populations but is also frequently seen in the Mediterranean region, including in Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].
