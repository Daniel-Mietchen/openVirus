<p>A damage analysis of the mapped reads (using the mapDamage 2.0 program [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]) from the subsamples with and without UDG treatment revealed an authentic post-mortem damage pattern, as expected for an ancient sample (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). If deamination had occurred within the lifespan of an infected host (for instance, as a result of deamination induced by human enzyme APOBECâ€“known to induce deamination in certain viruses), then we would expect to have seen deamination spread more evenly throughout the viral reads. Instead, deamination has preferably occurred at the termini of DNA fragments as seen in the non-UDG treated subsamples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006750.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As nearly identical patterns were observed with the mitochondrial reads, this suggests to us that the HBV DNA is more likely to be of the same age as the mtDNA than it is to be derived from a recent contaminant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006750.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). As expected, following treatment with UDG, viral reads do not display the deamination pattern, suggesting that the UDG did indeed remove uracils from the DNA fragments (
