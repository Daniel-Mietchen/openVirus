<p>To help determine the veracity of our ancient HBV sequence, we performed a series of analyses using both root-to-tip regression [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] as well as those within a Bayesian framework [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These analyses employed various calibrations, including collection dates for modern samples, radiocarbon-dating estimates of ancient samples, and viral co-divergence with human population migration.
