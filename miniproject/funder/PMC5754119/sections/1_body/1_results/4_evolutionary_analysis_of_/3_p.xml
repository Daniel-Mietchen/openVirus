<p>Importantly, NASD24SEQ occupied similar phylogenetic positions within subgenotype D3 when phylogenies were inferred separately for the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of the HBV genome, as well as for the polymerase ORF alone (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Hence, there is no evidence that the grouping of NASD24SEQ with modern subgenotype D3 sequences is a function of genome overlap.
