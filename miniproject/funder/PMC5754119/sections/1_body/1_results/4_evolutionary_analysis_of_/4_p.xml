<p>The sequence recovered from this 16
 <sup>th</sup> century Italian mummy therefore occupies a paradoxical phylogenetic position: although it exhibits legitimate signs of DNA damage, consistent with both the pattern seen in the mitochondrial reads and an ancient origin, it clusters closely with modern HBV sequences, as might be expected if it were a recent contaminant. If the NASD24SEQ sequence is 
 <italic>bona fide</italic>, then the only reasonable explanation is that our data set representing the last 450 years of HBV evolution is of insufficient duration to exhibit temporal structure, in turn implying that HBV has a long evolutionary history in humans with ancient diversification times of the different viral subtypes. To test this hypothesis, we performed a detailed analysis of HBV evolutionary dynamics, focused on addressing whether the evolution of this virus presents sufficient temporal structure for molecular clock dating.
