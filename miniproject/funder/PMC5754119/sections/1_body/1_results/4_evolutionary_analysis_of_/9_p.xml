<p>Finally, we employed a second set of internal node calibrations in which the node separating the F and H genotypes from the rest of the HBV tree had a normal prior with a mean of 16,000 years and a standard deviation of 1000 years. This follows a study that estimated that humans may have entered the Americas about 16,000 years ago, a more specific date than that estimated in earlier papers [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Using this more precise calibration, our analysis resulted in a mean rate estimate of 4.57 ×10
 <sup>−6</sup> subs/site/year (95% HPD: 2.62 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> to 6.96 ×10
 <sup>−6</sup> subs/site/year) similar to that obtained from the node calibrations employed above. The mean ages of the ancient samples were accordingly estimated at 214 years for JN315779 (95% HPD: 23 to 398) and 276 years (95% HPD: 29, 505) for NASD24SEQ (
