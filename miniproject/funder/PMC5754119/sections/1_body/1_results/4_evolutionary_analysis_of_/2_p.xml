<p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Italian sequence (NASD24SEQ) and the previously published Korean sequence (JN315779) fall within the genetic diversity of modern HBV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically, in phylogenetic analysis of HBV sequences representative of all genotypes (data set a-ii), NASD24SEQ grouped with modern HBV sequences of the D3 subgenotype collected between 1985 and 2008 with 100% bootstrap support, falling on the branch separating D3 from the D1 and D2 subtypes (
