<p>Data sets must possess temporal structure for tip-dated analyses to be informative [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We first assessed for temporal structure using a regression of root-to-tip genetic distances against year of sampling [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Strikingly, neither of the primary data sets (subsets a and b), with or without inclusion of ancient sequences, showed evidence of any temporal structure, with R
 <sup>2</sup> values of 8.98 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> (a-ii) and 2.78 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> (b-i), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006750.g005">Fig 5</xref>), as was true of the other genomic data sets (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Similarly, no temporal structure was observed in the D3 subgenotype, both without (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.85 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>) and with NASD24SEQ (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.90 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). To further assess the extent of temporal structure, we employed a Bayesian date-randomization test in which the nucleotide substitution rate is estimated using the correct sampling dates (see below), and the analysis then repeated 20 times on data sets in which the sampling dates have been randomized among the sequences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Notably, for both ancient sequences (NASD24SEQ and JN315779), the 95% higher posterior density interval (HPD) of the rate overlapped between the true and randomized data for both the modern and complete (including ancient) data sets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006750.g006">Fig 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). This indicates that there is insufficient temporal structure in HBV to performed tip-date-based analyses of evolutionary dynamics, even when including sequences that date to the 16
 <sup>th</sup> century.
