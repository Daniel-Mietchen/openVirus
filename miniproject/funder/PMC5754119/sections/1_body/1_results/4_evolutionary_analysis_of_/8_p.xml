<p>Similarly, we attempted to estimate the sampling times of NASD24SEQ and JN315779 under the assumption that HBV has co-diverged with human populations. Internal node calibrations can be more informative than tip calibrations when no temporal structure can be ascertained using sampling dates [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Accordingly, we used the same calibration scheme as Paraskevis 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2015, in which human migration dates were used to specify the prior distributions of ages on nodes from HBV subgenotypes found in endemic populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our analysis using subset a-ii yielded a mean rate estimate of 6.84 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> subs/site/year (95% HPD: 4.46 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> to 9.26 ×10
 <sup>−6</sup> subs/site/year), which is considerably lower than some previous estimates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Critically, however, the age estimates for the ancient samples again matched the uniform prior distributions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). Therefore, even with internal node calibrations, the sequence data and calibrations were not sufficiently informative to estimate the age of these viral sequences.
