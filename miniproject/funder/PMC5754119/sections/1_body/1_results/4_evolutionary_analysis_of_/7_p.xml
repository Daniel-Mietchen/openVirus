<p>Because of the lack of temporal structure from tip-dated calibrations, we next specified an informative prior distribution on the clock rate using a previous estimate of the long-term substitution rate of HBV at 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> subs/site/year [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The aim here was to estimate the ages of NASD24SEQ and JN315779 and determine whether these estimates matched the dates inferred from radiocarbon dating of the mummies and tomb materials. To this end, we tested (i) a prior of 2010 on the ages of both modern and ancient samples, such that no true sampling dates were considered, (ii) a uniform prior on the age of the ancient samples with a lower bound of 0.0 and an upper bound of 10,000 years before present, and (iii) a normal prior matching the radiocarbon dates. For both the ‘modern’ prior of 2010 and the uniform prior calibrations we expect that the posterior will differ from the prior if the rate calibration and the molecular sequence data are informative about the ages of the samples. Importantly, the inclusion of this long-term substitution rate as a clock calibration resulted in estimated ages for the ancient samples that were very similar to each of the priors tested in each case (
