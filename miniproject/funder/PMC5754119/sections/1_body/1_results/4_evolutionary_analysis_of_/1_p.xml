<p>We compiled two primary data sets representing (a) the full genotypic diversity of HBV and (b) that of D genotype alone (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006750.t003">Table 3</xref>). These consisted of publicly available HBV sequence data from GenBank with the additions of the HBV genome newly sequenced here (NASD24SEQ) and that previously obtained from a Korean mummy (JN315779) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s011">S2 Table</xref>). No evidence of recombination was found within either ancient sequence. While there was evidence for recombination in some modern sequences, equivalent results were found in evolutionary analyses conducted with and without these sequences, indicating that recombination has not had a major impact on the phylogenetic results presented here.
