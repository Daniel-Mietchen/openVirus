<p>Prior to the deposition in a coffin on a suspended passageway of the sacristy, the body of mummy NASD24 was eviscerated and embalmed. Records indicate the mummy was left undisturbed from 1594 [

Electron microscopic images produced in an earlier study of pustular tissue homogenates from this mummy showed egg-shaped, dense structures, and positive results in immunostaining with protein-A/gold complex of ultrathin sections of pustular skin incubated with human anti-vaccinia-virus antiserum supported the presence of a poxvirus [

However, in our study, we also attempted SEM analysis of the tissue samples of NASD24 and did not find evidence of particles resembling either VARV or HBV in their dimensions, though did discover particles consistent with an unknown viral origin (
