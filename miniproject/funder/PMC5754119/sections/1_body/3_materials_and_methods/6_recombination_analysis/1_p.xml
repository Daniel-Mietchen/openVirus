<p>The RDP, GENECOV, and MAXCHI methods available within the RDP v4 package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], with a window size of 100 nt (and default parameters), were used to analyze each subset for recombination. If at least two methods detected recombinant regions in a sequence, then we removed the region of recombination from the alignment.
