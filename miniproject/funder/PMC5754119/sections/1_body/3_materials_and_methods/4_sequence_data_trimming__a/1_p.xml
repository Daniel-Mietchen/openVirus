<p>Reads were demultiplexed using CASAVA-1.8.2 (Illumina, San Diego, California), then adapters were trimmed and reads merged using leeHom [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] with aDNA specific settings (—ancientdna). These processed reads were mapped to an appropriate reference genome (HBV genotype D3, GenBank accession X65257; revised Cambridge Reference Sequence for human mtDNA, GenBank accession number, NC_012920) using a network-aware version of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Duplicates were removed based on 5’ and 3’ positions (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The resulting BAM files were processed using mapDamage 2.0 on default settings with plotting and statistical estimation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Haplogrep v2.1.0 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] using PhyloTree Build 17 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] was used to identify the haplogroup of the mtDNA as U5a1b. The complete genome sequence of NASD24 has been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession number MG585269.
