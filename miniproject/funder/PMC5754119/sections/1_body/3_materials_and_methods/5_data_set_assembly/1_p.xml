<p>We analyzed the ancient HBV sequenced in this study in the context of modern whole-genomes of HBV. To this end we downloaded all human HBV genomes from GenBank that were over 3,000 nt in length and for which the year of sampling was available (all date information, including month and day, if available, was converted into decimal format). This initial GenBank data set comprised 3,696 sequences sampled between 1963 and 2015 (
