<p>Following this, a random subsample of HBV sequences was taken using the 
 <italic>Ape</italic> package in R [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Specifically, we sampled five representatives of each genotype and subtype, or the maximum number available if this was not five. This produced a data set of 135 sequences sampled between 1963â€“2013 which we refer to as subset a (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006750.t003">Table 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s013">S4 Table</xref>). We then added the ancient Italian HBV sequence NASD24SEQ to subset a to make data set a-i with n = 136. A third subset was built by adding the ancient Korean HBV sequence JN315779 to a-i to make subset a-ii with n = 137. We next randomly sampled only D genotype sequences from the initial GenBank data set to form subset b with n = 64 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s014">S5 Table</xref>). To this we added NASD24SEQ, generating subset b-i with n = 65. We aligned the nucleotide sequences in each subset using the L-INS-i routine in MAFFT v7.
