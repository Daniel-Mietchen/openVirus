<p>A library from the distal femoral sample of NASD24 was prepared according to a previously published protocol [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] that was modified to include an overnight ligation and with an input volume of 5 μL. Double indexing was performed using KAPA SYBR FAST (Kapa Biosystems) for 8 cycles of indexing amplification [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The library and blanks were enriched using two rounds of in-solution capture baits targeting HBV and the human mitochondrial genome (in separate reactions) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Mycrorarray, MyBaits) with recommended aDNA modifications. Baits, of 80nt in length with 4x tiling density (10nt flexible spacing), were designed based on the sequences of 5,230 HBV sequences, representing all major viral subtyptes. Template input was 5 μL for each reaction and bait concentrations were 100 ng per reaction using the in-solution bait mix targeting HBV and 50 ng per reaction for that targeting human mtDNA. Target genetic material was reamplified for 12 cycles both between and after rounds of enrichment. The HBV-enriched library generated 1,934,624 clusters (3,869,248 raw reads) and the human mtDNA-enriched library generated 2,844,500 clusters (5,689,000 raw reads) on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 at the Farncombe Metagenomics Facility (McMaster University, Hamilton Ontario, Canada).
