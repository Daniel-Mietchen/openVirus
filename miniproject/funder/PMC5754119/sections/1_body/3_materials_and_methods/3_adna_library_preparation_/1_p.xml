<p>Eight subsamples of 75–125 mg of organic matter were excised from samples of various body parts of NASD24 in a dedicated cleanroom facility at the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In brief, samples were demineralised using 1.5 mL of EDTA (0.5 M, pH 8.0) before being incubated at room temperature for 24 hours with rotation at 1000 rpm. Samples were then digested using a 1.5 mL proteinase K solution and incubated at 55°C for 6 hours with rotation at 1000 rpm. The supernatant from the demineralization and digestion steps was subjected to organic extraction using a modified phenol-chloroform-isoamyl (PCl) alcohol protocol. This means that 0.75 mL of PCl (25:24:1) was added to the demineralization/digestion supernatant, which was then vortexed, and spun via centrifuge (4000×g) for 20 minutes. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and a further 0.75 mL of chloroform added. The solution was mixed and spun via centrifuge (4000×g) for 10 minutes. The aqueous phase was collected and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL 30 kDa filter. This concentrated solution was purified over a MinElute column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted in 10 μL of 0.1 TE with 0.05% Tween-20. Reagent blanks were introduced at each step and processed alongside the samples.
