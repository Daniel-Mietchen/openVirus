<p>We employed three calibration strategies for these analyses. (i) First, we used the sampling times of the modern samples, but with a uniform prior for the rate bounded between 0 and 1. (ii) Second, we assumed that all the modern samples were contemporaneous, and specified internal node calibrations, corresponding to those used by Paraskevis 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2015) and Llamas 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2016) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and assuming that the spread of HBV corresponds to that of early human populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These consisted of setting normal priors for the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of F and H genotypes at 16,000 years, with a standard deviation of 1000, setting the tMRCA for subgenotype B6 at 3500 years with a standard deviation of 3000, and setting the tMRCA for subgenotype D4 at 8500 years with a standard deviation of 3500. (iii) Finally, we calibrated the molecular clock by specifying an informative prior for the mean (long-term) substitution rate of HBV based on the estimate by Paraskevis 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Accordingly, the prior was in the form of a normal truncated prior with mean of 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> sub/site/year, standard deviation of 5 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>, and lower and upper bound of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> and 3 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>, respectively. We again used the GTR+Γ
 <sub>4</sub> nucleotide substitution model for these analyses, although a codon-partitioned HKY model was also considered within the internally calibrated analysis.
