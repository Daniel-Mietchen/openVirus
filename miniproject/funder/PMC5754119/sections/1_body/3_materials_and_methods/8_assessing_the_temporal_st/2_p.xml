<p>We also performed more detailed Bayesian estimates of evolutionary dynamics. One method of validating the ages of ancient samples is to specify uninformative prior distributions for these and test if the tip dates or an informative rate give the postulated ages. Specifically, if the sequence data and calibrations are informative, the posterior should consist of a narrow distribution that includes the true sampling time of the ancient samples [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. However, if the prior and posterior distributions for the ages of the ancient samples are the same, then the data are considered to have insufficient information to estimate the ages of these samples. We conducted these analyses by setting uniform distributions for the two ancient samples between 0 and 10
 <sup>7</sup> with a mean of 10
 <sup>5</sup>. For the Korean sample we set a uniform prior with upper and lower bounds of 400 and 0, whereas for the Italian sample we used 507 and 0, with the maximum values in both cases reflecting their presumed sampling date. We also conducted analyses in which, for the Italian sample, we set a normal truncated prior distribution with the upper and lower values at 507 and 387, and mean of 447 and standard deviation of 10, whereas for the Korean sample we used 400 and 260 for the bounds, and 330 and 35 for the mean and standard deviation, respectively. These numbers are based on the radiocarbon dating analysis, with the upper and lower values reflecting the error margins.
