<p>We conducted a range of analyses to assess the extent of temporal structure in the data sets and to estimate the rate and time-scale of HBV evolution. To initially verify the temporal structure in the data we conducted regressions of root-to-tip genetic distance as a function of the sampling time (year) using TempEst v0.1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We then conducted a date-randomization test [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This involved analyzing the data using the Bayesian method implemented in BEAST v1.8.3 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] under a lognormal relaxed clock model [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and assuming a constant population size, with 20 replicates in which the sampling dates were randomized among the sequences. The HBV data were considered to have temporal structure if the mean rate estimate and 95% HPD intervals were not contained within the 95% HPD of any of estimates resulting from the randomized data sets [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. All analyses were run with an Markov chain Monte Carlo chain length of 10
 <sup>7</sup> steps with samples from the posterior distribution drawn every 2 Ã— 10
 <sup>3</sup> steps. After discarding the first 10% of steps as burn-in, we assessed sufficient sampling from the posterior by visually inspecting the trace file and ensuring that the effective sample sizes for all parameters were at least 200.
