  <title>Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the HBV sequence reads from NASD24 are from a subgenotype D3 virus.</title>
  <p>Maximum likelihood phylogeny of HBV sequences representative of the full genotypic diversity. Tip labels indicate viral genotype. The draft genome from HBV reads from NASD24 (Italian Mummy) and the JN315779 sequence (Korean Mummy) are colored in red. Nodes with bootstrap support above 70% are displayed. All horizontal branch lengths are scaled according to the number of nucleotide substitutions per site and the tree is mid-point rooted for clarity only.</p>
