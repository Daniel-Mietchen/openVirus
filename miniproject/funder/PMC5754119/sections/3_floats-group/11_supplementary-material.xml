  <title>NASD24SEQ consensus sequence as constructed from mapping next-generation sequencing reads from NASD24 LM1 to HBV subgenotype D3 sequence X65257.</title>
  <p>Genomic organization of overlapping open reading frames and approximate location of single-stranded portion of plus strand are indicated, as well as the relative GC (blue) to AT (green) content of the genome of X65257 and the likely location of CpG islands (light green).</p>
