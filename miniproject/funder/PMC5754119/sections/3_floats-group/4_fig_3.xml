  <title>Damage patterns of NASD24 HBV and mtDNA sequenced reads.</title>
  <p>Next-generation sequencing reads from non-UDG treated distal femur extraction (LM1) were analyzed for nucleotide deamination patterns following removal of reads less than 30 nt in length and after mapping of remaining reads. The upper plots display the nucleotide base frequency with the grey box indicating frequency within the read. The bottom plots show the position’s specific substitutions from the 5’ (left) and the 3’ end (right) of each fragment. (A) Deamination plots for processed reads from NASD24 LM1 enriched for HBV and as mapped to HBV reference sequence X65257. (B) Deamination plots for processed reads from NASD24 LM1 enriched for human mtDNA and as mapped to mtDNA reference sequence NC_012920. (C) Fragment length distribution plot for HBV reads. (D) Fragment length distribution plot for mtDNA reads.</p>
