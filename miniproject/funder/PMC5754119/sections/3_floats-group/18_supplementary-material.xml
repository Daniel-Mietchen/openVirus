  <p>Histogram showing the probability density estimation distributions for the Bayesian analysis of NASD24SEQ and JN315779 both with and without sequence data from subset a-ii and with the internal calibration scheme using the estimation of entry into the Americas from Llamas et al. 2016 [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006750.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] to calibrate the node separating genotypes F and H. (A) With a uniform prior bounded by 0 and 1,000 years for the samples. (B) With a uniform prior bounded by 0 and 10,000 years.
