  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of ancient and modern HBV sequences.</title>
  <p>Tip labels on the phylogenies include the GenBank accession number followed by genotype and subgenotype information and year of sampling (day and month information is encoded into decimal form). NASD24SEQ and JN315779 are colored in red. Nodes receiving bootstrap support above 70% are displayed. All horizontal branch lengths are scaled according to the number of nucleotide substitutions per site and the tree is mid-point rooted for clarity only. (A) Shows the analysis of subset a-ii, including the modern HBV subset with both ancient sequences. (B) Shows the analysis of subset b-i, including only the modern D genotype subset with NASD24SEQ.</p>
