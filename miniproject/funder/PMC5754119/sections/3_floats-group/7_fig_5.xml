  <title>Root-to-tip regression analyses of temporal structure.</title>
  <p>Plots of the root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling time (year) are shown for phylogenies estimated from alignments of random subsamples of whole HBV diversity (subset a) or only D genotype diversity (subset b). Each dot represents a sequence, with black dots representing modern samples while that for NASD24SEQ is colored in red and that for JN315779 is colored in blue. R
   <sup>2</sup> values are given as an indicator of the degree to which evolution has been clock-like. The central line corresponds to the regression line and the outer lines to the 95% confidence intervals. Regression analysis for other data sets are shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006750.s006">S6 Fig</xref>. (A) Modern sequences only (subset a). (B) All modern and ancient HBV sequences (subset a-ii). (C) Modern genotype D sequences (subset b). (D) Modern genotype D sequences with NASD24SEQ (subset b-i).
