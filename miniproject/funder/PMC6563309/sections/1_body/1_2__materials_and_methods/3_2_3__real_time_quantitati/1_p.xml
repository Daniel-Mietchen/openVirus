<p>Briefly, the extraction of viral RNA from serum samples was performed using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. A commercially available rtRT-PCR primer/probe kit (Path-CHIK-standard kits, Genesig, Primer design Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was used to detect and amplify Chikungunya RNA. All the serum samples were tested for Chikungunya RNA. The tests were performed using an Applied Biosystem step one real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystem, CA, USA). A reaction mix with a final volume of 20 μL was prepared adding 10 μL of oasig One step PCR Master mix, 1 μL of CHIK primers/probe, 1 μL of internal extraction control primer/probe mix, 5 μL of viral RNA, and 3 μL of RNAse/DNAse free water. The cycling conditions for the RT-PCR consisted of a reverse transcription step of 55° for 30 min; enzyme activation for the PCR was performed at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation 95 °C for 10 s, and data collection 60 °C for 60 s, as described by the manufacturer instructions. Fluorogenic data was collected through the FAM and VIC channels.</p>
