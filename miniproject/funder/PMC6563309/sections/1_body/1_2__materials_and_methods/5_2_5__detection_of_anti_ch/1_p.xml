<p>A total of 68 serum samples from febrile Mexican patients in an endemic area and 15 sera samples from healthy blood donors from a non-endemic area were tested in parallel. For the initial method development, seven patient sera from RT-PCR confirmed CHIKV infections were used for recombinant CHIKV E2-based IgG and IgM ELISA assay to measure the antibodies against E2 along with seven negative control sera from healthy volunteers. A CHIKV-positive control serum sample was obtained from a Mexican blood donor who was known to have confirmed CHIKV infection independent from this study. Briefly, human sera were diluted in Nunc Maxisorp Immuno ELISA plates coated with CHIKV E2 in PBS to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL. Following blocking, sera was incubated for 1 h; then, plates were washed six times with PBS/T (0.05%), and bound antibodies were detected by using a goat Anti-Human IgG–alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich UK, A3187-.5ML) or a goat Anti-Human IgM (μ-chain specific)–alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma, A3275-.5ML). Development was performed using 4-nitrophenylphosphate diluted in diethanolamine buffer, and absorbance values at OD405 were measured on a CLARIOstar instrument (BMG Labtech UK). Serum antibody endpoint titres for positive samples were defined by an absorbance value that was three standard deviations greater than the average OD405 of the negative controls.</p>
