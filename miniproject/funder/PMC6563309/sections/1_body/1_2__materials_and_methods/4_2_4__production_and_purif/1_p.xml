<p>The production and purification of recombinant CHIKV E2 protein was carried out as described previously [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, the expression plasmid (500 μg) was individually transfected in HEK-293T cells using polyethyleneimine (PEI) in roller bottles (surface area of 2125 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) under standard cell culture conditions. Five days after transfection, cells were discarded and media was filtered through 0.22-μM disposable filters. The secreted proteins were purified from the supernatant by Niquel Sepharose affinity chromatography (HisTRAP
 <sup>TM</sup>, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK), using the Äkta Start chromatography system and eluted with 500 mM of imidazole. Finally, eluted proteins were dialyzed using a Slide-A-LyzerTM cassette (Fisher Scientific, UK) against 1× PBS.
