<p>The in-house developed ELISA has higher sensitivity, and is also more cost-effective than using the commercial CHIKV assays. However, our E2-based recombinant ELISA assay would not detect anti-CHIKV E1 antibodies and some conformational epitopes targeting the E1/E2 heterodimers. We have recently reported the formation of virus-like articles by expressing the full structural cassette of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; it will be interesting to test those as captured antigens in the ELISA assay to compare with our in-house E2-based ELISA and commercial ELISA kit to address the recognition of both anti-E1 and anti-E2 antibodies conformational epitopes. In order to validate our ELISA assay further, it will be useful to test negative controls such as serum samples from ZIKV or DENV-infected individuals. In addition, it will be very informative to determine PRNT titres for positive serology serum samples [

It will also be interesting to explore the cross-reactivity toward the antibodies against other alphaviruses, as they could be co-circulating in CHIKV endemic areas and determine the specificity of our ELISA assay [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We have detected ~50% seropositive using our in-house IgM and IgG ELISA for the febrile patients in Lázaro Cárdenas. As CHIKV co-circulates with other arboviruses in various endemic regions, there is often difficulty in differentiating between acute and previous CHIKV infections when their symptomatology is similar. Nonetheless, our ELISA assay could be helpful for the serodiagnosis of CHIKV in acute patients in the endemic regions of Mexico where there is no availability of specialized laboratories for RT-PCR, which may be important for effective patient management. In conclusion, our in-house CHIKV-specific ELISA can be a useful tool for the serodiagnosis of CHIKV infection, for seroprevalence studies in endemic regions to contribute to the management of the potential future epidemics, and for the monitoring of vaccine immunogenicity during CHIKV vaccine clinical trials.
