<p>In this study, we aimed to test the potential for the clinical use of an in-house ELISA assay with an E2 CHIKV protein and compare it with an available commercial ELISA kit using samples of a cohort from a region of Mexico that is endemic for CHIKV. We have recently reported a recombinant CHIKV E2 protein produced in a mammalian expression system based on HEK293 cells [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, we tested whether our recombinant CHIKV E2 could be used to detect anti-CHIKV antibodies in clinical samples. Our results suggest that both IgG-based and IgM-based ELISA can reliably detect anti-CHIKV E2 antibodies in both acute and convalescent patient sera. Moreover, our assays provided higher sensitivity than the commercial kit used in this study, in particular for IgM ELISA. Many commercially available anti-CHIKV ELISA or immunofluorescence assays use whole virus-derived antigens, which can have high production costs due to virus culture and purifications steps, thus decreasing affordability and limiting their use in CHIKV-endemic regions in developing countries [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This could account for low sensitivity (one out of seven) in detecting IgM antibodies in RT-PCR positive samples by the Abcam IgM kit. Alternatively, this may be due to the low level of IgM antibodies in the acute CHIKV serum samples, which were insufficient to be detected by whole virus antigen used in the kit, as the actual amount of E2/E1 glycoproteins in the whole virus antigen plus the capsid and the same concentration of purified recombinant E2 may differ significantly. Previous studies have evaluated the

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It was shown that recombinant CHIKV E2 had higher sensitivity and specificity than CHIKV E1-based ELISA, and the results were comparable to the native antigen-based ELISA [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another study showed that IgG E2 ELISA provided ~90% sensitivity and 100% specificity in concordance with CHIKV-specific neutralization assay, whilst IgM to E2 showed similar sensitivity to a commercial immunochromatography for CHIKV IgG and IgM detection [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Other studies used the baculovirus-derived CHIKV E1 for ELISA [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Taken together, these studies provide strong pieces of evidence that recombinant protein-based ELISA may be safe and cost-effective, along with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for setting up CHIKV diagnostics. We have been using a mammalian-based cell culture system to purify large quantities of viral recombinant proteins that could be used in diagnostic assays [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Protein expression in a mammalian system ensures the post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It was previously shown that insect cell-derived CHIKV VLPs mainly consisted of oligomannose glycans, while HEK293-derived VLPs contain the mixture of oligomannose, hybrid, and complex glycans [
