<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CHIKV is transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The genome of CHIKV consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 11.8 kb, and contains structural genes that encode three structural proteins: envelope proteins 1 and 2 (E1 and E2) and a nucleocapsid protein along with two small peptides (E3 and 6K) [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The CHIKV E1 and E2 form spikes composed of triplets of E1â€“E2 heterodimers covering the viral surface [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since its appearance in 2013 in the Caribbean, it has rapidly spread throughout the Americas, raising public health concerns [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CHIKV infections are characterized by an acute onset of fever associated with myalgia, headache, and severe debilitating arthropathy [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Vaccines or specific anti-viral therapies for CHIKV are not yet available; thus, rapid and simple methodologies to detect CHIKV infections are important for effective patient management and the control of future epidemics [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The primary laboratory test to diagnose CHIKV infection relies on the specific detection of CHIKV genomic sequences in serum collected up to five to six days after the onset of fever [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00407" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, serological tests are required for the confirmation of CHIKV infection after the end of the viremia. Several commercial and in-house CHIKV serological assays that became available are based on whole virus antigens, and those reports indicate a variation of sensitivities and specificities [
