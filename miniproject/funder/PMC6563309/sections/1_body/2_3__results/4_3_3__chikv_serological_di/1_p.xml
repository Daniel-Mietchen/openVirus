<p>Next, we tested all the serum samples by using our in-house CHIKV IgM and IgG ELISA for the serodiagnosis of CHIKV infection. The graph in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00407-f005">Figure 5</xref>A shows the OD405 values over sera dilutions in range of 300 to 218,700 for IgG-based ELISA, which reliably detected and differentiated the sera from CHIKV-infected patients from control sera and CHIKV seronegative sera. Endpoint reciprocal titres (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00407-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) were calculated which showed that 57.4% and 54.4% of serum samples were positive for in-house IgG and IgM ELISA, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00407-f005">Figure 5</xref>B top and bottom). Importantly, all the RT-PCR positive serum samples (8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, and 19) were shown to be positive in our in-house IgM and IgG ELISA (
