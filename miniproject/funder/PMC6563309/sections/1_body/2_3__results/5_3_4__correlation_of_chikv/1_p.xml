<p>Next, we sought to correlate CHIKV antibody titres from our ELISA assay to the mean SU from the qualitative ELISA results from the commercial kits (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00407-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). The results suggest that E2-specific antibodies could be measured by reciprocal endpoint titres in our in-house IgG ELISA assay, which correlates with the commercial IgG mean SU.
