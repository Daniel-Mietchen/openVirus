<p>Next, we sought to test whether our recombinant CHIKV E2 could be used to detect anti- CHIKV E2 antibodies in human serum. We selected the seven CHIKV RT-PCR positive samples (blue), a positive CHIKV control (green), and seven control sera (red) from healthy volunteers to test the suitability of our recombinant CHIKV E2 proteins in IgG and IgM-based ELISA assay (
