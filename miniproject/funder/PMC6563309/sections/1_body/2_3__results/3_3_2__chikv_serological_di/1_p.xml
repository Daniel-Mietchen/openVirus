<p>After an initial screening of serum samples by RT-PCR, serological analysis was performed on all 68 serum samples along with 15 control samples from healthy blood donors obtained from Morelia, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00407-f002">Figure 2</xref>. We tested all the serum samples by using commercial CHIKV IgM and IgG ELISA Kits for the serodiagnosis of CHIKV infection, and the mean standard units (SU) were calculated (

Interestingly, among seven CHIKV RT-PCR positive samples, four out of seven CHIKV-infected patients (sample numbers 8, 10, 16, and 19) were identified by IgG commercial kit, while only one sample (sample number 10) tested positive as CHIKV infection. Overall, 30/68 (44.1%) samples that were both RT-PCR positive and negative were shown to be positive (mean SU &gt; 11) on the commercial IgG ELISA, with one sample in the grey zone (inconclusive) (
