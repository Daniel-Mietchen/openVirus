  <p>ELISA assays to assess the reactivity of human sera. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-infected patients (blue) confirmed by RT-PCR, sera obtained from healthy donors (HD) from a non-endemic region (red) and a CHIKV-positive control serum (green). (
   <bold>A</bold>) The graph of CHIKV E2 IgG OD405 against sera dilutions (left) and the corresponding endpoint log reciprocal titres (right). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The graph of CHIKV E2 IgM OD405 (left) and the corresponding endpoint log reciprocal titres (right). The black dotted line indicates the limit of detection (LoD), which corresponds to 1:300 serum dilution on a log scale.
