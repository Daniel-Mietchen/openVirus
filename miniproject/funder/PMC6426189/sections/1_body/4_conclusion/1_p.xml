<p>Measles remains a common, endemic illness in the CAR because of inadequate vaccination coverage. In this study, only 24.6% of reported cases were confirmed in the laboratory. Children under 10 years were most affected, with no difference between the sexes. The disease is seen most often during the dry season, with a peak in February, and most confirmed cases were reported from health district 3, which includes Bangui and its suburbs. Better control of measles in the CAR will require increased vaccination coverage, revision of the investigation forms to include the current WHO case definition and training of health personnel involved in case-finding in the field.</p>
