<p>When samples were received at the laboratory, tubes containing whole blood were centrifuged at 3000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the serum was placed in two 1.5-mL cryo-tubes, as were serum samples, labelled with the date the sample was received and an identification number (e.g. CAR-RS7-COM-2014-212), indicating the country (CAR), the health district (e.g. RS7) and region of origin (e.g. COM), the year and the order of reception (e.g. 212). One cryo-tube was placed in an archive box according to its order of reception and stored in a freezer at– 20°C, and the other was tested directly or stored at 4°C if the analysis was delayed.
