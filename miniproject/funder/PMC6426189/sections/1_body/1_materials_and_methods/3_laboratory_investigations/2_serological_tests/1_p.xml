<p>Measles-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Siemens Enzygost measles anti-measles virus/IgM kit, provided by WHO). According to the WHO diagnostic algorithm, if a test result is negative, a test is done for anti-rubella IgM; if the result for measles is indeterminate, the sample is tested again. If the second test results are negative or still indeterminate, rubella serology is done. If the result is positive for measles, rubella serology is not done. The Enteric Virus and Measles Laboratory at the Institut Pasteur of Bangui is a WHO national laboratory for measles since 2007 and participate early at the WHO proficiency testing programme, wich it never failed.</p>
