<p>From each patient, 5 mL of venous blood were taken by trained focal points and placed into two sterile tubes, labelled with the full name of the patient and the date. In certain districts, the blood sample was left for 2 h at ambient temperature, and the serum was collected and placed in two tubes labelled as above. If the transport was delyed, the samples were stored at 4–8°C in a frige available at the district or health centre level. The blood or serum samples were transported in refrigerated vaccine containers at 4–8°C by the focal points, who ensured transfer to the laboratory within 3 days of sampling. Urine samples and throat swabs, which are useful for diagnosis, were not taken regularly due to lack of proper equipment and because they are more difficult to obtain than blood samples.</p>
