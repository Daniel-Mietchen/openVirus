<p>The threshold of 10% IgM positives, above which an epidemic is declared, was exceeded throughout the study, except in 2007 (4%), 2008 (9%) and 2010 (2.1%). The CAR is thus still undergoing epidemics of measles, as in Nigeria [

The recommended investigation rate of ≥ 2 per 100 000 inhabitants was reached throughout the study, but the 80% rate of laboratory investigation was not attained in 2011–2013, when cases were declared only on the basis of clinical and epidemiological criteria. This may be associated with the sociopolitical problems of that period, which hampered systematic transport of samples to the laboratory. In the Philippines, the establishment of sentinel sites for notifying all suspected cases, the national surveillance policy and laboratory identification of cases increased the proportion of laboratory-confirmed cases from 29.5% to 88.6% [
