<p>Vaccination is the main strategy for protecting populations against measles; however, vaccination coverage in the CAR (49%) is insufficient. Furthermore, the single dose given at the age of 9 months within the Expanded Programme on Immunization does not result in seroconversion in 82â€“95% of vaccinated infants [

These findings indicate that one dose does not ensure satisfactory protection and protects only part of the vaccinated population. Two factors may be involved: an inadequate response to the vaccine and the difficulty of maintaining the cold chain in many countries of Africa.
