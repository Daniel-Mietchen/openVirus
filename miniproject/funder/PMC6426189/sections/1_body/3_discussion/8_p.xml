<p>During the 9 years of the study, 3767 suspected cases of measles were reported, corresponding to a mean of 418 cases per year, with wide variation from one year to another. In south-west Nigeria, 10 187 suspected cases were reported in 2007, for a mean of 1697 cases per year [

The difference from our results may be demographic, as Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, with 186 053 386 inhabitants in 2016, whereas the CAR is one of the least populous countries on the continent, with &lt; 5 000 000 inhabitants and sparse population density outside of Bangui [

In the CAR, there are few systems for notification, such as detection of suspected cases in families by local authorities, and only cases seen at consultations are notified. Patients usually present only for severe health problems, and eruptive fever, particularly if it is nonspecific, is often treated in the family. Of the 3767 suspected cases, 1797 (48%) were confirmed by either biological tests or by clinical or epidemiological criteria when a laboratory diagnosis was not available. The mean prevalence was 4.38 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year. This is much lower than that in Nigeria (8.81 cases) between 2007 and 2012 [

 <xref rid="pone.0213735.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results for the CAR therefore appear to be intermediate, although the prevalence is possibly underestimated and might be close to that in Nigeria.
