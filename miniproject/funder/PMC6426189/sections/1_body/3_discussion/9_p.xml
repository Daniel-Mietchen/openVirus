<p>The delay in sending samples to the laboratory was satisfactory only in 2007, when 100% of samples were sent within the prescribed time. The target of 80% required by WHO was not reached in the other years, with a very low rate of 42.1% in 2009. These results are associated with poor roads, long distances and inadequate public transport in rural areas, as the focal points do not have private means of transport and use buses to transport samples. In certain areas, there is no public transport for several days, due not only to the poor roads but also sometimes to lack of security. Once a sample has been taken, therefore, it often cannot be transported immediately. A survey should be conducted of the situation in the districts that send few samples per population size and send less than the threshold of two samples.</p>
