<p>This study was possible thanks to the measles surveillance system set up in CAR which covers the entire territory. Surveillance in health regions has made it possible to collect all suspected cases of measles, as defined by WHO. Although clinical information was limited to the presence of rash, in the laboratory, the techniques were used in accordance with WHO recommendations and the results obtained can be considered reliable because they meet the requirements of the WHO performance indicators and are regularly evaluated.</p>
