  <title>Comparison of the amount of amplification product produced by miniPCR (left section) and Maxygen (right section) thermal cyclers.</title>
  <p>A) Repeatability test using an initial amount of 0.5ng of a 300bp amplicon corresponding to the Ebola virus GP protein in the miniPCR (left section) and Maxygen (right section) thermal cyclers. Seven repeats (lane 1 to 7) and a negative control (lane 8) are shown. B) Average amount of nucleic acid material recovered from the agarose gels. No significant differences were noted between devices (p-value &gt; 0.05). Error bars indicate one standard deviation. C) Average amount of nucleic acid material recovered, as quantified by SYBR Green qPCR staining and fluorescence measurements in a real time thermocycler. Significant differences were noted between devices (p-value* = 0.043). Error bars indicate one standard deviation.</p>
