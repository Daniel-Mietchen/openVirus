<p>We analyzed 10Î¼L of each PCR product using 1% agarose electrophoresis in TAE (Tris-Acetic Acid-EDTA) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). Gels were dyed with GelGreen (CA, USA) using a 1:10,000 dilution and a current of 110 V supplied by a Bio-Rad PowerPac HC power supply (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) for 50 minutes. We used the Quick-Load Purple 2-Log DNA Ladder (NEB, MA, USA) as molecular a molecular weight marker. We analyzed the gels by UV transillumination using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS imaging system.</p>
