<p>In addition, in some of our experiments, we used the blueGel unit, a portable electrophoresis unit sold by MiniPCR from Amplyus (MA, USA). This is a compact electrophoresis unit (23 × 10 × 7 cm) that weighs 350 g. In these experiments, we analyzed 10μL PCR product using 1% agarose electrophoresis tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE). Gels were dyed with GelGreen (CA, USA) using a 1:10,000 dilution, and a current of 48V was supplied by the bluegel built-in power supply (AC 100-240V, 50-60hz).</p>
