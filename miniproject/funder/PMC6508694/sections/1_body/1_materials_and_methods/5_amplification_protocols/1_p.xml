<p>For all PCR experiments, we used the same three-stage protocol (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) consisting of a denaturation stage at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 20s, 60°C for 30s, and 72°C for 30s, and then a final stage at 72°C for 10 min, with a total duration of 76 and 80 minutes in the MaxyGene and the miniPCR thermocyclers, respectively.
