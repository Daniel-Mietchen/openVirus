<p>We ran equivalent sets of amplification experiments in a commercial standard thermocycler (MaxyGene from Axygen, CA, USA) and a miniPCR from Amplyus (MA, USA). The MaxyGene unit can run 96 amplifications simultaneously, has dimensions of 25×25×25 cm, and a weight of 3.5 kg. This unit requires 120V (AC) and 3.5 A to operate. The miniPCR can run 8 amplifications in parallel, has dimensions of 20×5×15 cm, and a weight of 0.7 kg. This unit requires 120V (AC) and 3.5 A to operate.</p>
