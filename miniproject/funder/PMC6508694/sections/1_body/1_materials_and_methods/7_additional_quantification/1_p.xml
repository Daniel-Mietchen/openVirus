<p>We evaluated the total amount of amplified nucleic acids (as quantified by absorbance analysis at 260 nm) and their purity (as quantified by the 260/280 ratio) using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). In these experiments, 10μL of PCR product was purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up kits (Promega, WI, USA), and the purified DNA (average yield of 41.5ng/μL) was re-suspended and dissolved in 50 μL of nuclease-free water.</p>
