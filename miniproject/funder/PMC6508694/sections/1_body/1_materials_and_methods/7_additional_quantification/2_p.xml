<p>In an additional set of experiments, the amount of amplified DNA was determined by staining with Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies CA, USA). We used 0.5 ng of synthetic EBOV or ZIKV as a DNA template, 2 μl of forward primer solution, 2 μl of reverse primer solution, 10 μl of 2× SYBR Green QPCR master mix, and nuclease-free PCR-grade water to adjust the final volume to 20 μl. After the PCR reaction was completed (3 minutes at 95°C; 40 cycles of 5 seconds at 95°C, and 12 seconds at 60°C), the amplification product was transferred to a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The amount of amplification product was determined by fluorescence measurements using a SYBR Green filter. For this purpose, 10 cycles of 10 seconds at 21°C were programmed in the Real-Time PCR System. The reading from the fourth cycle was used for statistical analysis.</p>
