<p>We used synthetic samples containing EBOV and ZIKV nucleic acids in our validation experiments. We prepared the EBOV samples by cloning a genetic sequence (
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) encoding the production of the EBOV GP capsid protein in an 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic> coli strain (TOP10). Similarly, we cloned a genetic sequence encoding the production of the ZIKV E capsid protein in an 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> strain (TOP10) to produce ZIKV nucleic acid material (
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The EBOV sequence was designed based on the consensus of GP sequences of the 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> documented in GenBank from 1976–2014 (
