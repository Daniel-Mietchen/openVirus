<p>The engineered bacterial strains were cultured overnight in LB-media (250ml) at 37Â°C in Erlenmeyer flasks under orbital agitation at 200 RPM. After 12 hours of culture, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and then lysed using a continuous homogenizer. Synthetic viral DNA was purified from the bacterial samples using the PureYield Plasmid Maxiprep System (Promega, WI, USA). Samples containing different concentrations of synthetic nucleic acids of EBOV and ZIKV were prepared by successive dilutions from stocks containing 400 ng/L of viral nucleic acids.</p>
