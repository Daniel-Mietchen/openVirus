<p>We conducted different sets of experiments to compare the performance of the miniPCR and a conventional commercial thermocycler. In a first round of experiments, we used five different sets of primers of different lengths that target different regions within the selected EBOV GP sequence. The lengths and sequences of each of the amplicons generated by each set of primers are presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g001">Fig 1C</xref> graphically shows the regions of the EBOV GP sequence to which each primer set binds and the length of each of the originated amplicons. These sets of primers generated PCR products of 91, 131, 167, 239, and 300 nucleotides (nt). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g002">Fig 2A</xref> shows images of a representative agarose gel experiment for the PCR products of different amplification reactions using different primer combinations. Products obtained using the miniPCR and the conventional thermocycler are presented. These results show that the use of primer sets designed to produce PCR products of different lengths has no meaningful effect on the performance of the amplifications. Moreover, we did not observe any substantial differences between the performance of the miniPCR and the conventional thermocycler. In addition, our use of a multiplex PCR strategy did not result in any obvious advantage over the use of conventional PCR; this observation holds for reactions conducted using both the miniPCR and the conventional thermocycler.
