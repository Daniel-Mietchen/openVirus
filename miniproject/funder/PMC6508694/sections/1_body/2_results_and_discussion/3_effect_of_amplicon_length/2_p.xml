<p>Interestingly, the profile of amplification products from the multiplexed reactions differed between the mini-PCR and the conventional thermocycler (

 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], where all targeted sequences are equally accessible to primer pairs and the polymerase, denser (more intense) bands are expected for the higher molecular weight amplification products (more base pairs per amplicon unit) than for the lower molecular weight products. Consistently, the higher molecular weight product of the multiplex reaction appears as a darker band in the miniPCR amplification. However, this is not the case for the conventional PCR results. This finding, which was consistent among experimental repeats, suggests a tighter control of the PCR microenvironmental conditions (i.e., mixing, temperature homogeneity, etc.) within the miniPCR reaction cells.
