<p>We further evaluated the effect of using primers that yield amplification products of different sizes (namely 91, 167, and 300 bp) in the miniPCR thermocycler. For this purpose, we conducted experiments in which we determined the amount of DNA produced by miniPCR amplifications using NanoDrop spectrophotometry. For this experimental set, we used 0.5 ng of EBOV DNA template. Our results suggest that the total amount of amplification product is statistically lower with the use of primers that flank a region of 91 bp (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results suggest that the use of primers of about 150bp in size for miniPCR amplifications will render similar results, in terms of DNA quantity and quality, as those obtained with larger primers. The total amount and purity of amplification product was statistically similar for multiplex amplification (using primers that yield amplicons of 91 and 167 bp) and single primer amplification (using primers that yield amplicons of 167 or 300bp) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). This observation is based on final-point PCR results; in a real-time amplification, multiplexing might provide faster results.
