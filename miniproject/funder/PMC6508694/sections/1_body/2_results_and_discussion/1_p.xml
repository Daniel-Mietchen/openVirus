<p>Previous epidemic episodes (for example, those related to EBOV in West Africa in 2014â€“2016) have proven that an actual emergency does not provide the required timeframe for testing new strategies. This is true for new therapies as well as for diagnosis. In the case of epidemic emergencies (or natural disasters), the first line of response must be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we compare the performance of a commercially available portable PCR unit (aimed at several markets, including POC applications) versus that of a conventional, regular-sized PCR thermocycler. The comparison was made in terms of the ability of both units to identify and amplify different synthetically designed genetic sequences of EVOB and ZIKV under the same set of experimental protocols and using the same materials and reagents (see
