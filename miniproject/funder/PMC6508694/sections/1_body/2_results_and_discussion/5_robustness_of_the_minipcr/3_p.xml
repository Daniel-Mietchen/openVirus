<p>In all previously described experiments, the products of amplification from both thermocyclers were primarily detected on agarose gels using conventional electrophoresis techniques conducted with conventional lab equipment. However, as previously mentioned, the miniPCR system is commercialized with its own “blueGel” electrophoretic unit (
