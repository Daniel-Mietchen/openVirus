<p>In an additional set of experiments, we quantified the amount of DNA amplified in different assay wells (in both thermocyclers) using SYBR Green staining followed by fluorescence determination in a RT-PCR apparatus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The results confirm that both thermocyclers are similar in terms of reproducibility, as both exhibited a variance coefficient of ~0.06. Interestingly, in these experiments (without purification), the miniPCR thermocycler produced significantly higher amounts of DNA than were obtained with the conventional thermocycler.
