<p>In a final set of experiments, we tested the robustness of the miniPCR system from two different angles. First, we validated the reproducibility of the results generated by the miniPCR between different assay wells. For that purpose, we dispensed the same sample of DNA (EBOV genetic material; at 0.5 ng/μL; expected amplicon of 300bp) in seven of the eight amplification wells of the miniPCR thermocycler (one well was left as a negative control). For comparison, the same amplification experiment was performed in eight of the amplification cells of the conventional PCR system, selected at random.

We did not observe any significant variations in intensity among the wells in any thermocycles. In addition, we quantified the intensities of the bands corresponding to amplification products using band purification and nanodrop quantification. The results revealed small standard deviations for both sets of samples. Both thermocyclers also performed similarly in terms of reproducibility; the average amounts of amplification products were statistically similar for both data sets (α-value = 0.5;
