<p>Besides its portability, the blueGel electrophoretic unit has other important advantages: its size allows optimization of reagent usage (agarose gel 15ml, buffer 25ml), the built-in power supply allows visualization of band separation in real time, which can shorten the electrophoretic time by up to 5 minutes; and exposure to ethidium bromide and UV light is completely avoided by the use of GelGreen dye and detection with blue light.</p>
