<p>In an additional experiment, we challenged the sensitivity of both PCR thermocyclers with a different set of primers. This time, we amplified a ZIKV sequence, aiming to produce an amplicon of 252 base pairs (bp). Different concentrations of ZIKV genetic material, in the range of 5 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> to 3.0 ng/10 μL, were used as reaction template. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g002">Fig 2C</xref> presents an agarose gel showing the amplification products of this experiment. As before, we observed a similar performance between thermocyclers. Both the miniPCR and the conventional systems were able to generate a visible band of amplification products across the whole range of DNA dilutions.
