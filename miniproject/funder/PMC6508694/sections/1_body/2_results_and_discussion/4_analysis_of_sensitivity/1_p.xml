<p>Next, we conducted a second series of experiments to assess the sensitivity of the PCR reactions conducted in both thermocyclers using primers that generate amplicons of two different sizes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> show the PCR products of amplification reactions conducted using a set of primers that produce amplicons of 91 nt and a 300 bp, respectively. In both cases, different concentrations of EBOV-GP genetic material, in the range of 5 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> to 3.0 ng/10 μL, were used as reaction template. The amplification proceeds with sufficient quality to allow proper visualization of the amplification product, even at low nucleic acid concentrations. However, we observed differences in the profile of the products of amplification when using primers to flank regions of 91 or 300 nt (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215642.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). For instance, at low DNA template concentrations, the primers that flank the 91nt region appears to be more effective than those that target the 300nt region. In this set of experiments, we were particularly careful to ensure the integrity of the genetic material used as a template. Evidently, under real conditions, the integrity of larger templates can be more compromised by environmental factors when compared to shorter DNA segments, so targeting shorter nucleic DNA sequences might be advantageous [
