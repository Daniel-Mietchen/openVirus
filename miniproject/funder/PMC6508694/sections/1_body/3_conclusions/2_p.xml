<p>In addition, we have documented the effect of using different primers that yield different amplicon sizes, thereby providing a reference resource for primer design for POC applications using the miniPCR. We also provided a detailed account of a strategy for producing Ebola- and ZIKV-related nucleic acids that is free of infection risk in any conventional lab. This is a useful, if not necessarily intuitive, resource that allows personnel to study the virus nucleic acids without the risk of contracting a deadly disease. This straightforward approach will facilitate POC research related to highly infective viruses in underdeveloped regions.</p>
