<p>The challenge of POC detection of viral threats is of paramount importance, particularly in underdeveloped regions and in emergency situations (i.e., natural disasters or epidemic outbreaks). In the context of an emergency, time is very limited (as are other resources) to do research or develop new technologies; therefore, the use of commercially available and tested technologies is an obvious first countermeasure. Our research extends the validation of the miniPCR technology to the as yet unexplored topic of detection of Ebola and Zika, and we have validated six sets of primers for Ebola and one set for Zika detection. Our results suggest that the capacity of selective amplification in a conventional thermocycler and in a miniPCR is essentially the same. The use of the miniPCR is intuitive and simple; the user can easily follow the advance of the iterative temperature cycling using a laptop. Despite its compact size, the miniPCR allows a full amplification protocol to be performed in a similar time as in a conventional thermocycler (a difference of only six minutes in a 30-cycle protocol). The mini-PCR thermocycler exhibits the essential attributes of a POC system: (a) the use of small volumes, (b) low capital cost, (c) portability, (d) and a fast, accurate, and selective response. Therefore, this already commercially available and simple nucleic acid amplification system has great potential for use in remote or underprivileged areas, in the case of natural disasters, on the battlefield, or during epidemic emergencies.</p>
