<p>In the case of evaluating the spread of an infectious disease, the deployment of any diagnostic effort has to rely first on commercially available equipment [

From 2014 to 2016, West Africa was the site of the most important Ebola epidemic documented so far; more than 20,000 persons were infected and more than 11,000 died of this disease. From 2015 to 2016, a ZIKV epidemic episode affecting Las Americas reached alarming proportions. The association of ZIKV with recent cases of microcephalic births has increased the concern about establishing systems for early diagnosis [
