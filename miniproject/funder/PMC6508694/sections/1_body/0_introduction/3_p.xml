<p>The first wave of miniaturized PCR machines has only recently become commercially available [
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The miniPCR from Amplyus (MA, USA) is one of the first highly compact PCR units on the international market [
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The first miniPCR units reached the marketplace in 2015, with an approximate cost of $600 USD (versus $3000 USD for a conventional PCR thermocycler) [
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus far, only a few papers have been published that directly relate to the validation of use of the miniPCR system as a diagnostic tool[
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, Guevara et al. demonstrated its use on the study of wild populations of lemurs in the field [
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, Pomerantz et al. demonstrated the combined used of miniPCR and minIon sequencer (a miniaturized sequencer) for the rapid identification of species in the Ecuadorian rainforest [
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (i.e., less than 24 hours after data collection). Boguraev et al. successfully amplified zebrafish DNA in a remarkably non-conventional setting—aboard the International Space Station—and they were able to amplify bisulfite-treated DNA to determine epigenetic variations. They found that methylation-specific primers differentially amplified bisulfite-treated DNA just as would be expected under standard laboratory conditions on Earth [
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Recently, Zaky et al. used the miniPCR system for the detection of Brugia parasites in mosquitos [
 <xref rid="pone.0215642.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The commercial availability, low price (as compared to conventional thermocyclers), portability, and user friendliness make the miniPCR an attractive and tangible solution that effectively brings PCR analysis to the POC.
