  <title>Emergence of Oseltamivir resistant viruses in ferrets.</title>
  <p>The emergence of Oseltamivir resistant viruses was monitored in throat and nose samples from untreated immunocompetent ferrets (A), untreated immunocompromised ferrets (B) and Oseltamivir treated immunocompromised ferrets (C) by mutation-specific RT-PCR for the Oseltamivir-resistance mutation R292K. The green bars depict the presence of the wildtype genotype (292R) and the magenta the presence of the resistant genotype (292K). If both genotypes were present in one sample, the proportions of the genotypes are stacked.</p>
