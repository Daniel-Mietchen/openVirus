  <title>The frequency of the R292K mutation as determine by Illumina next generation sequencing in oseltamivir treated immunocompetent ferrets.</title>
  <p>The percentage of the R292K variant was determined in pooled throat/nose samples collected at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 dpi from immunocompetent ferrets that received oseltamivir treatment. The graph depicts the frequency of the R292K mutation over time for each ferret separately, with circles, squares, triangles, down triangles, diamonds and open circles representing ferrets 1â€“6 respectively.</p>
