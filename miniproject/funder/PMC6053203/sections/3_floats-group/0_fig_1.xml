  <title>Viral RNA load in ferrets inoculated with influenza virus A/NL/16/98.</title>
  <p>Immunocompetent (blue) and immunocompromised (red, green) ferrets were inoculated with influenza virus A/NL/16/98 (H3N2) and subsequently treated with Oseltamivir (green) or left untreated (blue, red). Virus RNA load in samples of the throat (A) and nose (C) was determined by qRT-PCR daily for 18 days. The area under the curve of panels A and C was used to estimate the total amount of viral RNA shedding from the throat (B) and nose (D) of the inoculated ferrets. The line and bar graphs depict the mean Â± S.E.M. The asterisks indicates a statistically significant P value (***P&lt;0.001).</p>
