  <title>Influenza antibody titers of immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets against influenza viruses A/NL/16/98 and A/NL/271/95.</title>
  <p>Serum influenza antibody titers of the untreated immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets against the influenza homologous strain (A) A/NL/16/98 and (B) the heterologous strain A/NL/271/95 of immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets were determined by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay. The antibody titer of each animal are depicted as individuals points. The horizontal bars represent the mean Â± S.E.M.</p>
