  <title>Correspondence between the R292K resistance mutation as measured by mutation specific RT-PCR and Illumina next generation sequencing.</title>
  <p>The relative proportion of the R292K resistance mutation detected in samples of all oseltamivir treated immunocompromised (grey circles) and immunocompetent (open squares) ferrets inoculated with A/NL/16/98 (H3N2) as determined by mutation specific RT-PCR was compared to the relative proportion determined by Illumina NGS.</p>
