<p>Given that besides A/H1N1pdm09 viruses also A/H3N2 influenza viruses are circulating in nearly every winter season [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the question arose whether the results observed in immunocompromised ferrets infected with A/H1N1pdm09 would also be applicable to infection with A/H3N2 virus. Therefore, the present study compared the course of infection of A/H3N2 viruses in immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets. It was found that immunocompromised ferrets inoculated with A/H3N2 viruses had prolonged presence of viral RNA in the upper and lower respiratory tract and that the treatment of these ferrets with Oseltamivir resulted in the rapid emergence of the resistance substitution R292K in NA. Mutation specific real-time PCR and Illumina next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that resistance mutations were detected with a low frequency as early as 2 days after inoculation, which later increased over time. Additional minor variants detected by Illumina NGS present in the HA and NA genes were not associated with Oseltamivir treatment. The immunocompromised ferret model for A/H3N2 virus captures several features of influenza virus infection and antiviral drug treatment in immunocompromised humans, and may be useful for future preclinical studies on antiviral drug therapies.
