<p>Ferrets have been widely uses as a model to investigate influenza virus infection, because the susceptibility to infection and the range of clinical signs seen in infected ferrets are very similar to those observed in humans. Moreover, the anatomy of the airways and the distribution patterns of sialic acid receptor expression in the respiratory tract of ferrets are comparable to those in humans [

Ferrets may also be an appropriate model to study the levels of virus replication and associated clinical manifestations upon suppression of the immune system. Previous research has shown that ferrets receiving a mixture of immunosuppressive drugs that are also routinely given to humans undergoing solid organ transplantation, had reduced antibody responses following virus infection and deficient lymph node formation, indicating that the immune defense was weakened [

It was further shown that, similar to humans, immunocompromised ferrets infected with A/H1N1pdm09 virus had prolonged virus replication compared to immunocompetent ferrets. Treatment of these ferrets with Oseltamivir led to the rapid emergence of viruses with the H275Y NAI resistance substitution in NA [
