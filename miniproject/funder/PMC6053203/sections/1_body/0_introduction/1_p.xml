<p>Influenza viruses cause infections in millions of individuals worldwide every year. In most cases, infected patients develop mild clinical symptoms associated with modest virus shedding that usually resolves within one to two weeks. However, high risk groups, including young children, the elderly, pregnant woman and individuals with chronic medical conditions such as obesity, asthma, diabetes and neurological disorders are more likely to develop severe and complicated influenza, with increased risk of mortality [

Moreover, various studies have shown that patients with suppressed immunity due to diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and autoimmune disorders or due to the use of immunosuppressive drugs e.g. for chemotherapy or solid organ transplantation also have an increased risk to develop serious complications following influenza virus infection [
