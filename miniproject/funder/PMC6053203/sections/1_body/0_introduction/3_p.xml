<p>The overall efficacy of antiviral drugs to resolve clinical symptoms caused by influenza virus infection is relatively modest [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Accordingly, new antiviral drugs are being developed that target different steps in the viral replication cycle, such as receptor binding, membrane fusion, and genome transcription or replication, to treat infection with wildtype and resistant influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, various studies have indicated that combination therapy with different antivirals could be more effective, compared to monotherapy, in inhibiting influenza viruses in immunocompromised patients [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The proof of concept for these drugs that are in the pre-clinical and clinical pipeline as well as combination therapy may be demonstrated using appropriate animal models, including models that attempt to capture the situation in immunocompromised patients. It is challenging to assess an optimal regimen of antiviral therapy for immunocompromised patients, due to the heterogeneity of illnesses, varying levels of immune suppression and variable course of virus infection among patients in this group [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The majority of randomized clinical trials testing the efficacy of antiviral treatments against influenza virus infection has been conducted in individuals with a competent immune response [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The strategies adapted from these studies have also been used to treat influenza virus infected immunocompromised patients and they appear to be effective in these patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, virus replication can persist in these patients even after the administration of antiviral treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, it has been reported that immunocompromised patients have a higher risk to acquire antiviral resistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This may be due to the prolonged infection or the high virus turnover observed in these patients, which provide an increased likelihood of acquiring resistance mutations that are under positive selection in the presence of antiviral treatment.
