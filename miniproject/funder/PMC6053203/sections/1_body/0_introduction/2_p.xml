<p>The primary way to prevent influenza virus infection, especially in high-risk groups, is through the use of influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Unfortunately, vaccination is not always fully effective and individuals can still acquire influenza virus infection when the vaccine strains do not sufficiently match with the circulating viruses. Accordingly, antiviral drugs were developed for the treatment of patients with confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection to reduce symptoms and prevent serious complications of influenza [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The two classes of antiviral drugs that are available on the market for the treatment of influenza are the matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAI) Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Peramivir and Laninamivir [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, NAI are currently recommended to treat influenza virus infected patients [
