<p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the immunocompromised ferret model can be used to study virus shedding of influenza A/H3N2 virus. The immunocompromised ferret model is a promising model to study the duration of virus shedding and the efficacy of novel mono and combination antiviral treatments for immunocompromised humans. In combination with msRT-PCR and Illumina NGS, this model may also be used to evaluate the chance of developing and selecting mutations associated with drug resistance, direct and compensatory, in immunocompromised hosts.</p>
