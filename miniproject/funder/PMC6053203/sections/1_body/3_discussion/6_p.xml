<p>Individuals with suppressed immunity due to age, pregnancy, disease or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs are susceptible to various virus infections beyond influenza, which can lead to high morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The search for ideal medications to treat these various viral infections in immunocompromised patients will lead to the same challenges as faced with the development of anti-influenza viral treatments. The immunocompromised ferret model may be further developed to analyze other viral infections that occur in immunocompromised patients and to design novel drugs to treat them. For instance, Stittelaar 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that ferrets with a suppressed immunity were susceptible to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) infection and that the virological outcome observed in these ferrets mimicked the increased virus loads and sustained virus infection seen in humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, they showed that the prophylactic treatment of HRSV-infected immunocompromised ferrets with Palivizumab temporarily reduced virus replication, but it resulted in increased virus load (25). Thus, the immunocompromised ferret model is a suitable model to evaluate virus infections in immunocompromised hosts as well as specific intervention strategies for these viruses.
