<p>The effect of NAI such as Oseltamivir against influenza virus infection in immunocompromised patients has been controversial, where some clinical studies showed that Oseltamivir was effective to reduce disease burden, viral shedding, symptom severity, length of hospital stay and mortality, while others claimed that it had no or minimum beneficial effects [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The current data showed that the treatment of both immunocompromised and immunocompetent ferrets with Oseltamivir resulted in a lower total A/H3N2 viral RNA load in the nose and the throat samples compared to the ferrets that were untreated [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Interestingly, this reduction of viral RNA in Oseltamivir treated animals was larger in the nose compared to the throat. Oseltamivir has been shown to reduce viral replication in the nose of influenza A/H5N1 and A/H1N1pdm09 infected ferrets [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, throat samples were not taken from the ferrets in these studies. Therefore, it is not known whether the reduction of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract was higher compared to that in the lower respiratory tract upon Oseltamivir treatment of ferrets, which is largely reflected by viral replication in the nose and throat swabs respectively. The difference seen in total viral RNA load in the nose and throat upon Oseltamivir treatment could be due to a difference in the Oseltamivir concentration that is present in these areas of the respiratory tract. Additionally, since viral RNA loads peaked earlier in the throat of the ferrets compared to the nose, it is also possible that Oseltamivir treatment has to accommodate with higher amounts of virus compared to the nose, as studies have shown that virus inhibition by Oseltamivir is less efficient at higher virus titers [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, the distribution of Oseltamivir throughout the respiratory tract of the ferret is essential to reduce viral replication efficiently, which remains to be elucidated. Even though there was a reduction in total viral RNA upon Oseltamivir treatment, this did not lead to complete viral clearance, as viral RNA was still present at 18 dpi in immunocompromised ferrets. This was in accordance with a previous study demonstrating that immunocompromised ferrets inoculated with A/H1N1pdm09 still had prolonged viral shedding upon treatment with Oseltamivir [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the present study, none of the ferrets died during the course of the experiment or developed severe disease, hence no conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of Oseltamivir in reducing morbidity and mortality. In the previous study with A/H1N1pdm09 virus, Oseltamivir treatment was found to decrease mortality in immunocompromised ferrets [
