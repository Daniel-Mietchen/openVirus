<p>Previous studies have shown that the emergence of resistance mutations impaired the fitness of influenza viruses but that additional mutations may be acquired in HA or NA to compensate for this fitness loss [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This is relevant as the prolonged viral shedding in immunocompromised hosts could allow expansion of the quasi-species of influenza viruses present in the host due to the error prone viral replication. This in combination with Oseltamivir treatment creates a strong selective pressure on the influenza virus variant population and facilitates the emergence of resistant virus as a dominant variant in the population, if needed upon acquisition of additional–compensatory–mutations. In immunocompetent patients the resistant viruses may be cleared before they acquire such compensatory substitution. The presence of such resistant viruses that have regained full viral fitness may negatively impact the efficacy of the Oseltamivir treatment and account for the sustained virus shedding in the ferrets, even after the reduction of the total virus load. Three immunocompromised ferrets in the present study acquired additional substitutions in the HA (T151A) and the NA (T242I) proteins besides the R292K resistance substitution, which could represent compensatory changes. The substitution T151A in HA is not common in circulating viruses in the human population, as it is not present in the HA sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) Epiflu database. The T242I substitution in NA has previously only been detected in an immunocompromised child infected with multidrug resistant A/H3N2 virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The substitution was present together with the known E119V and I222V resistance substitutions. Therefore, this substitution may be associated with antiviral treatment and might have a compensatory function. However, in the immunocompromised child it was only detected in one clinical sample and did not become fixed in the virus population, suggesting that it may have emerged by chance and was not involved in determining antiviral resistance. Future experiments may be conducted to study the function of the substitution on the virus phenotype by reverse genetics. The other substitutions in HA (T151A) and NA (I57T) have not been identified in previous studies and their functions remain unknown.
