<p>Although the level of immunosuppression was not addressed directly in the present study, in previous studies it was shown that this ferret model results in immunosuppression as evidenced by lower influenza specific HI antibody titers, impaired formation of the lymphoid follicles present in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and depletion of lymphocytes in the tonsils of the ferrets [

Accordingly, similar to influenza virus infection in immunocompromised patients, the present data showed that influenza A/H3N2 viral RNA was detected for a longer period in immunocompromised ferrets compared to the immunocompetent ferrets [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Apparently, the immune response of the ferrets receiving the immunosuppressive drugs was not effective in clearing the virus infection, leading to more prolonged virus presence in the immunocompromised host. This indicated that immunocompromised ferrets might represent a suitable model to analyze virus shedding in immunocompromised hosts.
