<p>Here, the immunocompromised ferret model for influenza A virus infection and Oseltamivir treatment that was recently described for A/H1N1pdm09 virus infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] was evaluated for infection with an influenza A/H3N2 virus. The immune suppressive regimen employed in this immunocompromised ferret model mimics the regimen used for solid organ transplant recipients. Like A/H1N1pdm09 influenza virus, influenza A/H3N2 viruses continue to cause annual epidemics with substantial morbidity and mortality, for which NAI are used routinely as antiviral drugs, in particular in individuals with an impaired immune response.
