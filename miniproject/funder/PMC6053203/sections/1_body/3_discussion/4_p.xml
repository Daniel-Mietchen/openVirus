<p>Oseltamivir treatment led to the emergence the R292K substitution in immunocompromised and immunocompetent ferrets inoculated with A/H3N2 virus. The resistant R292K genotype of the A/H3N2 virus was detected initially as a minor variant by msRT-PCR. With Illumina NGS, resistance mutation R292K was already detected at 4 dpi in Oseltamivir treated ferrets. None of the immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets had acquired the E119V, although this is also a common mutation associated with Oseltamivir treatment that is found in NA. The E119V mutation was found to cause a 20 to 1000-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of Oseltamivir [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The R292K substitution was found to cause a greater reduction in susceptibility to Oseltamivir compared to the E119V substitution, conferring a &gt; 9000 increase of the Oseltamivir IC
 <sub>50</sub> [

 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Plasma levels of Oseltamivir have been shown to reach approximate concentrations between 2561 and 9603nM in ferrets [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which is higher than the IC
 <sub>50</sub> associated with the E119V mutation. This could explain why the E119V mutation was not detected in the present study.
