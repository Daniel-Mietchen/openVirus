<p>An Oseltamivir-sensitive influenza A/H3N2 virus A/Netherlands/16/1998 (A/NL/16/98) was used in this study. This virus was isolated from a respiratory specimen upon inoculation of a Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell culture (van Baalen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2014). Biological clones were obtained by plaque purification. A clone with a genome sequence identical to the consensus sequence of the original specimen was used as the inoculum.
