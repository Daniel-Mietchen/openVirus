<p>RNA was extracted from throat and nose samples taken 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days post inoculation (dpi), from immunocompromised and immunocompetent ferrets treated with Oseltamivir (groups 3 and 4), using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Subsequently, RNA sample volumes were reduced by evaporation in a SpeedVac at 65°C and first-strand cDNA was made using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, California, USA) and random primers (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Second strand cDNA was synthesized in NEBnext second strand synthesis reaction buffer with second strand enzyme mix (New England Biolabs, Massachusetts, USA) and nuclease-free water. The cDNA was concentrated using the Genomic DNA Clean &amp; concentrator kit (Zymo Research, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA products were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA).</p>
