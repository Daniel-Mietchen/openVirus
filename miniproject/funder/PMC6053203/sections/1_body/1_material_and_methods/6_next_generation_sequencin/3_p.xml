<p>Sequence reads were imported into CLC genomic Workbench version 8 (Qiagen) and trimmed using a quality score cut-off of Q30. The trimmed reads were then mapped against the HA and NA sequences of influenza virus A/Netherlands/5/1998 (GenBank Accession numbers, CY114485 and CY114487). Nucleotide substitutions that resulted in an amino acid substitution relative to the reference sequence of A/Netherlands/5/98 were called if the nucleotide position was covered in more than a 100 reads, with an average quality score of ≥ 30 and a forward and reverse balance of ≥0.4. The substitutions that varied within the samples and had a frequency above 1% were reported in the results tables.</p>
