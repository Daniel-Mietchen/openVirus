 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. RNA was extracted from these samples and virus load was determined using the semi-quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting the matrix gene segment. Oseltamivir resistance substitutions at amino acid positions 292 (R/K) and 119 (E/V) of NA were monitored using a mutation specific RT-PCR (msRT-PCR) as described [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. An electron-microscopy-counted influenza A/PR/8/34 virus stock (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Maryland, USA) was run in parallel to convert cycle thresholds to virus particle counts (viral RNA copies). Blood samples for serum were taken on day 0 and day 13 post infection. Serum influenza antibody titers against the homologous influenza strain A/Netherlands/16/1998 and the heterologous strain A/Netherlands/271/1995 were determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay as previously described [
