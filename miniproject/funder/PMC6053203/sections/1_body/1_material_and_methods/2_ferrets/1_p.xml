<p>The animal experiment was performed in strict compliance with the European guidelines (EU directive on animal testing 2010/63/EU) and Dutch Legislation (Experiments on Animals Act, 2014). An independent animal experimentation ethical review committee, Stichting Dier Experimenten Commissie Consult, approved the animal studies (EMC-3137; protocol 122-13-13). Eleven-month-old purpose-bred male ferrets were used, which were seronegative for Aleutian disease and circulating influenza viruses (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B). The animals were kept in standard housing until the start of the experiment. Four days before inoculation, the animals were transferred to negatively pressured isolator cages at animal biosafety level 3. Animals were sedated during animal handling using a mixture of ketamine (4 to 8 mg/kg) (Henry Schein Animal Health BV, Cuijk, The Netherlands) alone or in combination with medetomidine (0.1 mg/kg) (Henry Schein Animal Health BV, Cuijk, The Netherlands), which was antagonized by the administration of atipamezole (0.1 mg/kg) (Henry Schein Animal Health BV, Cuijk, The Netherlands) afterwards. Euthanasia under anesthesia was performed by exsanguination. Health status and animal behavior was checked twice daily and included the following parameters: weight loss, loss of appetite, degree of gastroenteritis, breathing problems and strong abnormal behavior. Commercial food pellets and water were provided
