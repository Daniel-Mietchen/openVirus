<p>Twenty-four ferrets were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 6) (group 1: immunocompetent, group 2: immunocompromised, group 3: immunocompromised receiving Oseltamivir and group 4: immunocompetent receiving Oseltamivir). A scheme of the experiment is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200849.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. At day -4, antibiotics (10 mg/kg amoxicillin and 2.5 mg/kg clavulanic acid) were administered orally once daily to animals in all groups. Starting at day -3, ferrets in groups 2 and 3 were administered a dose of the oral immunosuppressant cocktail (20 mg/kg MMF, 0.5 mg/kg, tacrolimus and 8 mg/kg prednisolone) twice daily. Twenty-four hours after virus inoculation, ferrets in groups 3 and 4 started receiving an oral solution of OSP (10 mg/kg) once daily. Ferrets in groups 1, 2 and 3 were euthanized by exsanguination 18 days post infection. The immunocompetent ferrets in group 4, which received OSP were euthanized on day 7 after inoculation.
