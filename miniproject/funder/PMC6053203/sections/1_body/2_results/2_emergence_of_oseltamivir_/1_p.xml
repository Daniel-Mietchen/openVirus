<p>Samples from all inoculated animals (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200849.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) were analyzed by mutation-specific RT-PCR to detect substitutions E119V and R292K in NA, the most common Oseltamivir associated resistance mutations in A/H3N2 influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Mutation E119V was not detected in these samples, whereas the R292K resistance mutation was detected in the nose and throat swabs of all immunocompromised (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200849.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) ferrets that were treated with Oseltamivir. In contrast, emergence of viruses with resistance mutations did not occur in any of the untreated immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets, indicating that resistance mutations did not emerge spontaneously. The R292K substitution first emerged in the throat at 5dpi in one animal (ferret 4) and at 6dpi and 7dpi in three (ferret 1, 2, 3) and two animals (ferret 5 and 6) respectively. When the R292K substitution occurred, it was initially present as a minor genotype in a mixed population of wild type and resistant viruses. At later time points, viruses with the resistance mutation represented the major genotype and frequently even the only genotype in the virus population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200849.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In two immunocompromised ferrets that were treated with Oseltamivir, virus was cleared from the nose and throat by 10â€“11 dpi. However, there was no difference in the emergence of Oseltamivir resistance mutations in viruses of animals that did (ferret 2 and 3) or did not (ferret 1, 4, 5, 6) clear the virus earlier (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200849.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). There were no substantial differences in the kinetics of emergence of Oseltamivir resistance mutations in immunocompetent ferrets treated with Oseltamivir as compared to immunocompromised ferrets, although resistant viruses were not detected in one of the animals in this short time-course experiment (
