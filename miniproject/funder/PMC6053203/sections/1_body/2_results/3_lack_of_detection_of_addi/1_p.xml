<p>Illumina NGS was conducted to analyze the emergence of mutations beyond R292K that were potentially associated with Oseltamivir treatment in the HA and NA genes of influenza viruses in immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 dpi. To validate this approach, the frequency of the R292K resistance substitutions was first determined by Illumina NGS. There was good overall correspondence between the relative proportion of the R292K resistance substitution as determined by msRT-PCR and Illumina NGS (
