<p>Illumina NGS revealed numerous mutations in HA and NA of the viruses beyond R292K, present in all Oseltamivir treated animals (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200849.s007">S1 Table</xref>). Minor variants with frequencies ranging from 1.0â€“7.7% were detected in the HA or NA genes in samples from all ferrets but one. In some ferret samples, such HA and NA mutations became predominant, but only temporarily. Examples of substitutions are NA-T242I (ferret 1 at 10 dpi) and HA-T151A (ferret 3 at 10 dpi) (
 <xref rid="pone.0200849.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, where viruses with the R292K substitution in NA generally increased in prevalence throughout the course of the experiment, to become dominant at the latest time points, none of the additional substitutions followed a similar trend. Thus, under these experimental conditions, the emergence of viruses with the R292K substitution in NA was not accompanied by co-mutations in NA and HA that could act to compensate for potential fitness losses associated with Oseltamivir resistance.
