<p>To determine the total amount of viral RNA that was present in the nose and throat swabs of ferrets, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for all groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200849.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>). The total amount of virus shedding from both the throat and the nose of untreated immunocompromised ferrets was significantly higher as compared to the throat and nose of immunocompetent ferrets (P&lt;0.001). Treatment of immunocompromised ferrets with Oseltamivir resulted in significantly lower virus shedding from both the nose and throat compared to untreated immunocompromised ferrets. The reduction of virus shedding from the throat of immunocompromised ferrets as a consequence of Oseltamivir treatment was relatively modest as compared to the reduction of virus shedding from the nose.
