<p>Ferrets were treated with a cocktail of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and prednisolone sodium phosphate for 3 days, which was previously shown to cause a steady-state of severe immunosuppression, which was continued by bi-daily dosing until the end of the experiment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200849.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). In the first week after inoculation, the virus loads were similar between untreated immunocompetent and immunocompromised ferrets. However, immunocompetent ferrets started to clear the infection from 7 dpi onwards with total virus clearance by 14–15 dpi, while immunocompromised ferrets continued to shed viral RNA throughout the course of the experiment (18 days). One group of immunocompromised ferrets inoculated with A/NL/16/98 was treated with Oseltamivir starting at 1 dpi. In this group of ferrets, viral RNA was detected in the throat and nose throughout the 18 days of the experiment, as in ferrets that were not treated with Oseltamivir. The RNA virus load in the throat swabs of immunocompromised ferrets were very similar with or without Oseltamivir treatment while virus loads were substantially lower in the nose swabs of immunocompromised animals treated with Oseltamivir, in particular in the early phase (1–10 dpi) of the infection.
