  <title>Nonlinear multidimensional scaling plot of the total collection of mosquitoes in light traps at each site across all sampling seasons.</title>
  <p>Arrows indicate the directional relationship of sites (not shown) and species (blue text and +’s) based on land cover classifications (red text) in the 2.59 km
   <sup>2</sup> buffer around each site. Only land class variables significant at p = 0.01 are shown, and only the names of the mosquito species which odds of arbovirus detection’s 95% confidence interval were greater than unity are shown. The label for 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>taeniorhynchus</italic> (farthest right cross) has been removed for plotting purposes.
