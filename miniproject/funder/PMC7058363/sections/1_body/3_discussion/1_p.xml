<p>Mosquitoes and the viruses they transmit are often studied in isolation of the communities in which they coexist. This may be due to the epidemiological need to protect humans or livestock from specific threats; it may also be due to resource limitations that result in limited spatiotemporal surveillance, selective testing of only certain vector species, and screening collections for only the most medically-important arboviruses. Using a unique long-term mosquito and arbovirus surveillance data set that includes information on the abundance and infection status of all collected species, our community ecology approach extends the understanding of the generality of multi-mosquito species associations with arboviruses circulating in U.S. We find that in the northeast U.S., vector-virus associations exist along a continuum, with the avian arboviruses behaving as vector specialists (infecting a few key species in discrete habitats) and the mammalian arboviruses behaving as vector generalists (infecting numerous genera throughout a transmission season in multiple habitat types). For the avian arboviruses, which presently represent the greatest mosquito-borne disease threats to human health in the region, our results support previous findings that WNV and EEEV associate with discrete habitats which are in part strongly associated with the presence of specific species in the mosquito community [

Additionally, our GLMM results suggest that the detection of these avian arboviral infections in predominantly mammalian biting species likely represent random exposure events. Rather than indicators of non-primary species contributions to transmission, infections in mammalian feeding species may better signify the intensity of enzootic transmission (assuming the rate at which mammalian feeding vectors encounter the avian arbovirus is proportional to the intensity of the virusâ€™ enzootic transmission cycle). In contrast, we found that the mammalian arboviruses may rely less on specific primary vectors and more on the functional presence of mammalian feeding species in the mosquito community. Enhanced surveillance and further vector competence studies of the mammalian arboviruses are needed to better clarify the role of the mosquito community in the transmission dynamics of these viruses.
