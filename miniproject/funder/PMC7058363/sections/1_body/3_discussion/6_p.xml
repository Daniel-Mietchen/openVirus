<p>The broad detection of each arbovirus across CT, especially WNV, indicates that numerous foci of transmission may exist for each arbovirus. If numerous foci of arboviral transmission exist, each could act as a source for infectious vectors and hosts and dilute the potential benefit of localized vector control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Therefore, spatially limited vector control interventions may have little to no overall impact on arboviral transmission at scales relevant to public health (i.e., municipal levels such as towns or counties) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The involvement of multiple mosquito species in arboviral transmission, as suggested by our analyses, will only compound the effort needed to control zoonotic arboviruses of public health importance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Due to the specificity of vector-virus associations among the avian arboviruses, regional integration of vector control programs could improve the control of WNV and EEEV. However, we caution that the successes and failures of WNV/EEEV control in the northeast U.S. may have limited applicability to the control of the mammalian arboviruses.
