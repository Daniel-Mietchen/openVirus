<p>We note that there has been an increase in the number of mosquito species in CT from 32 species captured in 2001 to 43 species captured in 2018. This increase may in part be driven by recent range expansions of both native and introduced species in the U.S., such as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (commonly detected beginning 2010) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], 
 <italic>Aedes atlanticus</italic> Dyar &amp; Knab (2014), and 
 <italic>Culex erraticus</italic> (Dyar &amp; Knab) (2012). We also found that mosquito communities across CT were more dissimilar between sites than between years, supporting previous reports that local-scale processes are the primary drivers of mosquito populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The noted increase in annual mosquito species richness was not accompanied by an increase in arbovirus richness, and, unlike for mosquito communities, arbovirus communities varied as much between sites as they did years. The lack of any detected spatial and temporal arbovirus community composition patterns could be due to the existence of multiple vectors for each arbovirus whose population dynamics vary across the state. The lack of detectable patterns may also be due to other factors unique to each arbovirus, such as the heterogeneous dynamics of herd immunity in the wildlife hosts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and/or weather events [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] across the state.
