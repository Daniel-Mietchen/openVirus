<p>Overall, mosquito communities varied more among sites than among years (average ecological distance: sites, 0.67 +/- 0.01 SE; years, 0.34 +/- 0.01 SE). This was not surprising as local scale processes are the primary drivers of mosquito population dynamics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and land cover in CT has changed little since 1985 (

Variation in the composition of barren, deciduous, developed, grass, open water, forested wetlands, and tidal wetland land cover classifications surrounding each sampling site were correlated with the ecological distances among sites (max correlation,

However, because this analysis utilized adult mosquito collections and habitat associations may be stronger among larval collections, many species showed no obvious associations with any land use classification.
