<p>Most mosquito species were widely distributed throughout the state (median number of sites occupied: 78.5, IQR: 27–87), and were captured in every sampling season (median number of years collected: 18, IQR: 10–18). Spatially, the median site-specific mosquito species richness was 30 species (IQR 28–31) with an average evenness estimate of 2.00 (+/- 0.04 SE). Trapping effort was sufficient to detect all likely mosquito species at each site, and observed mosquito species richness was similar to estimated species richness (average difference: 1.55 species (+/- 0.29 SE)). Increasing percentage of coniferous and wetland forest land cover were correlated with increased site-specific distinctiveness (coniferous: r = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001; wetland forest: r = 0.24, p &lt; 0.05); no other land cover classifications nor the variance in land cover composition within a site’s buffer were correlated with site-specific distinctiveness. Temporally, the median annual mosquito species richness was 36 species (IQR 34–39.5) with an average species evenness estimate of 2.60 (+/- 0.03 SE). Similar to site-specific analyses, state-wide mosquito surveillance detected almost all species present in the state each season (average differences between estimated and observed: 0.96 species (+/- 0.25 SE)). Of note was an observed increase in mosquito species richness in CT from 2001 to 2018 (
