<p>In total, forty-seven species of mosquitoes were collected in CT of which thirty-one tested positive for at least one arbovirus (

 </bold>). The fifteen species which did not test positive for any arbovirus were rarely collected and together accounted for less than 1% of all collected mosquitoes. We found that mosquito blood feeding ecology and number of generations per year were the most important natural history parameters associated with arbovirus isolations in mosquito species (Blood feeding: pseudo-F 2.20, pseudo-p &lt; 0.01; Generations: pseudo-F 3.34, pseudo-p &lt; 0.01). These associations were readily apparent in an NMDS plot: vectors of avian arboviruses were distinct from vectors of mammalian arboviruses, WNV vectors were distinct from EEEV and HJV vectors, univoltine 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. associated with JCV, and finally, there were no clear distinctions in vector species for the remaining mammalian arboviruses (
