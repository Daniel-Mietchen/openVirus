<p>Correlations between site-specific metrics of mosquito and arbovirus community composition (i.e., richness, evenness, average ecological distance, and distinctiveness) tended to be positive (

 </bold>); however, only measures of ecological distance were significantly related (Pearsonâ€™s r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001). This suggests that as sites diverge in mosquito composition they are also likely to diverge in the types of arboviruses detected. Correlations between year-specific metrics of mosquito and arbovirus community composition were more variable and none were significant (
