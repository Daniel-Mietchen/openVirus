<p>In total, at least three arboviruses were detected every sampling season, and at least one arbovirus was detected at each surveillance site (

 </bold>). Spatially, the median site-specific arbovirus richness was four (IQR: 4–5) with an average evenness estimate of 1.17 (+/- 0.04 SE). Temporally, the median year-specific arbovirus richness was five (IQR: 4–6) with an average evenness estimate of 1.15 (+/- 0.08 SE). Even though greater than 50% of the circulating arboviruses were detected at most sites and during most seasons, evenness estimates indicate that arbovirus communities were either dominated by only one virus or arboviruses were minimally detected. Additionally, unlike with estimates of annual mosquito community richness and distinctiveness, there were no clear temporal trends in arbovirus richness and distinctiveness (
