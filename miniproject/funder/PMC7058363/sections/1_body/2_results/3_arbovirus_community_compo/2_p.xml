<p>While mosquito communities were more dissimilar among sites than among years, arboviral communities were similarly different among sites and years (average ecological distance: site 0.63 (+/- 0.01 SE), years 0.58 (+/- 0.02 SE)). The land cover classifications that best correlated with ecological distances in arbovirus communities were different from those correlated with mosquitoes (arbovirus: coniferous, developed, grass, water, and forested/non-forested wetlands) and the magnitude of the correlation was also less for arbovirus communities (maximum correlation, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.28). The NMDS plot of site by virus associations further indicated that variability of only a few land cover classifications associated with variation in arbovirus community composition; only developed and forested wetland land cover classifications were associated with site-specific arboviral detections (
