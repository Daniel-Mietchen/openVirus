<p>Our mosquito and arbovirus community ecology methods relied on numerous functions available in the R package VEGAN [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and all functions listed in this report were implemented using default settings unless otherwise stated. To examine spatial and temporal patterns of community composition, we analyzed mosquito and arbovirus communities at two different levels: 1) all data aggregated to the site-level, and 2) all data aggregated to the year-level. We first estimated species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index (H, an estimate of species evenness) using the ‘
 <italic>specnumber’</italic> and ‘
 <italic>diversity’</italic> functions, respectively. Then, in order to assess how representative mosquito collections were at each site and during each year, we estimated the number of undetected species using the ‘
 <italic>estimateR’</italic> function, which is an abundance based estimator of species richness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; we report biased-corrected Chao estimates. To identify the sites and years contributing most to regional species richness we used the 
 <italic>‘contribdiv’</italic> function. This function returns three components of additive diversity: alpha values which are an estimate of the k
 <sup>th</sup> unit’s contribution to within-unit diversity, beta values which are an estimate of the distinctiveness of the k
 <sup>th</sup> unit, and gamma values which are an estimate of the k
 <sup>th</sup> unit’s total contribution to regional diversity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; we report the absolute and unscaled estimates of site-specific and year-specific distinctiveness. To assess how dissimilar mosquito species communities were among sites and years, we estimated the ecological distance among sites and years using the function 
 <italic>‘vegdist</italic>’ (method: Bray-Curtis). We chose the Bray-Curtis index because of this index’s ability to detect underlying ecological gradients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Using 
 <italic>‘vegdist’</italic>, values of 0 indicate complete similarity while values of 1 indicate complete dissimilarity.
