<p>To investigate the associations between mosquito species community composition and land cover classifications in a specified area around each trap, we first obtained land cover data for twelve classifications from the University of Connecticut, Center of Land Use Education and Research (

This file contained information on the amount of area in the state classified as agricultural, barren, coniferous, deciduous, developed, grass, grass (other), forested wetland, non-forested wetland, tidal wetlands, open water, and utility. We then used ArcMap (ESRI) to draw a 2.59 km
 <sup>2</sup> buffer (0.51 km radius, buffer area equivalent to 1 square mile) around the geo-location of each trap site. We chose this buffer size assuming, on average and across all mosquito species, a female mosquito flight range of 1 km/night and that each light trap collects a representative mix of species within the 2.59 km
 <sup>2</sup> area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We then calculated the percent coverage of each land use classification within each 2.59 km
 <sup>2</sup> buffer, and used two different functions in VEGAN to estimate associations among sites and mosquito species as they relate to differences in habitats sampled. We first used ‘
 <italic>bioenv’</italic> and 
 <italic>‘bioenvdist’</italic> to assess which land cover classifications best correlated with the estimated ecological distances from ‘
 <italic>vegdist</italic>.’ We then used ‘
 <italic>metaMDS</italic>’ to implement non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), which is a common unconstrained ordination approach used to visualize multidimensional data in 2-D space. To minimize stress values, we ran ‘
 <italic>metaMDS</italic>’ with k = 3 dimensions. Data on land cover classifications were then fit to our 
 <italic>metaMDS</italic> results using the ‘
 <italic>envfit’</italic> function, and results were displayed using the ‘
 <italic>ordipointlabel</italic>’ function.
