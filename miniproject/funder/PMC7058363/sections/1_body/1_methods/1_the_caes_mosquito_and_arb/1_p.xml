<p>The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) in New Haven, Connecticut (CT) developed a mosquito and arbovirus surveillance network for detection of multiple arboviruses circulating in CT following an epizootic of EEEV along the Connecticut-Rhode Island border in 1996 [

 </bold>). Today, the CAES surveillance network includes 92 locations state-wide which are sampled with CO
 <sub>2</sub>-baited CDC miniature light traps, gravid traps, and, in certain locations, BG Sentinel Traps on a ten-day trapping schedule from June to October. When an arbovirus is detected, positive sites are sampled twice weekly until there are four consecutive weeks with no arboviral detections. All collected female mosquitoes are morphologically identified to species using a dichotomous key [

All pools are screened for any arboviral infection using virus isolation techniques in Vero cell culture, and cultures positive for cytopathic effect are tested for a suite of arboviruses, including EEEV, WNV, CVV, Highlands J virus (HJV), JCV, Potosi virus (POTV), Trivittatus virus (TVTV), LACV, and Flanders virus (FLAV) using RT-PCR techniques [
