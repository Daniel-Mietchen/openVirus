<p>To better assess vector, site, and epi-week associations for each individual arbovirus, we implemented binomial-error generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) using the ‘
 <italic>glmer’</italic> function in the R package LMER [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In these GLMMs we included data from gravid traps in addition to light traps to account for differences in arbovirus detections by trap type. For each arbovirus, analyses were conducted at the level of the individual pool with the response variable coded as 1 = arbovirus positive and 0 = arbovirus negative. Each GLMM included an intercept offset for pool size, a categorical fixed effect term for trap type (gravid as the reference term), and random intercept effect terms for species, CDC week of collection, year of collection, and collection site. We chose to model species, site, week, and year of collection as random effects because pools collected from the same site, week, year, and/or species are likely to be related in some way due to the nature of spatiotemporally repeated measures and/or intrinsic differences between sites, years, and species. Modeling these terms as random effects also allowed us to assess variability in arbovirus detection among terms rather than in the context of a fixed reference for each variable. Because the beginning and ending dates of seasonal surveillance varied among years, we limited our analyses to data collected between epi-weeks 24 and 41 of each season. Odds ratio estimates for each random effect were generated using the “
 <italic>get_model_data</italic>” function available in the R package SJPLOT [
