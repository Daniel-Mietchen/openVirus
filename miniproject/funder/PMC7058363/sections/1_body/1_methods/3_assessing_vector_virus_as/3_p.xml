<p>Finally, we tested for global spatial autocorrelation of arbovirus isolates among sites using the Global Moran’s I spatial auto-correlation function available in ArcMap 10.5.1’s Spatial Statistics tool box (ESRI). The test was implemented using the default settings in ArcMap (conceptualization: inverse distance, distance method: Euclidean, row standardization: false, distance threshold: 25.72 km, spatial weights: not included). All other analyses and plotting functions not specifically mentioned were implemented in R V3.5.1.</p>
