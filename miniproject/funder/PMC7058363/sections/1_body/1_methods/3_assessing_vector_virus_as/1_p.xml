<p>Because mosquito species could be considered “sites” which arboviruses occupy, we calculated the ecological distances between mosquito species based on the number and types of arbovirus isolates identified from gravid and light trap data; species with zero positive isolates of any arbovirus were excluded from this analysis. We then used the ‘
 <italic>adonis2</italic>’ function to assess which natural history parameters best explained the variance in the estimated distances [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Natural history parameters included blood feeding behaviors (mammalian, avian, generalist, other), overwintering strategies (egg, larva, adult), and number of generations in a season (uni- and multi-voltine). Associations between mosquito species based on arbovirus isolations and natural history parameters were then visualized using ‘
 <italic>metaMDS</italic>’ (k = 2 dimensions), ‘
 <italic>envfit’</italic>, and ‘
 <italic>ordipointlabel</italic>’ as described above for mosquito communities.
