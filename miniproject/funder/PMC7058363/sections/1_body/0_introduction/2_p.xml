<p>There remain critical knowledge gaps pertaining to the ecology and epidemiology of zoonotic arboviruses that hinder the ability to forecast risk and prevent human exposure. One such knowledge gap is the importance of multi-species infections in the mosquito community. Many of the zoonotic arboviruses circulating in the U.S. are capable of infecting and being transmitted by multiple mosquito species [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Epidemiologically, distinguishing when and if arboviral infections in multiple mosquito species represent a risk to humans relies on having an adequate understanding of the mosquito species’ natural histories. The species most likely to perpetuate an arbovirus and drive exposure in humans (i.e., the primary vectors) are those that: 1) blood feed upon appropriate reservoir hosts, 2) are competent for the arbovirus, and 3) are commonly found infected in close spatial and temporal proximity to infections in wildlife hosts [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or link epidemics between host populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] while, in seasonal climates, competent species that are common during non-epidemic periods could extend the length of transmission seasons [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and/or increase the probability of the virus surviving inter-epidemic periods [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mathematically, any increase in mosquito species richness could increase the risk of arboviral transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008066.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; however, empirical evidence of such increases are scarce.
