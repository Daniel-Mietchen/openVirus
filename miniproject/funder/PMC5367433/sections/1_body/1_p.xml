<p>There are 2 primary Zika virus lineages: Asian and African (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>9</italic>
 </xref>). The Zika virus strain currently circulating in the Americas (American lineage) is derived from the Asian lineage (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>10</italic>
 </xref>). Because no vaccines or antiviral drugs are available (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>11</italic>
 </xref>), efforts to prevent Zika virus infection focus on controlling mosquito vectors. Historically, Zika virus has been isolated from several 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes, including multiple sylvatic species in Africa (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in Malaysia (

  <italic>1</italic>
 </xref>) and Mexico (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>14</italic>
 </xref>). 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are the main urban vector of other medically important urban arboviruses with similar origins, such as dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and yellow fever virus. However, studies of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito susceptibility for Zika virus have yielded varied results; some have suggested relative refractoriness (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>15</italic>
 </xref>). This finding has led to speculation that other vectors common in tropical cities, such as 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>16</italic>
 </xref>), implicated in a Gabon epidemic (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>), and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes, common in tropical cities, could be Zika virus vectors (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">
