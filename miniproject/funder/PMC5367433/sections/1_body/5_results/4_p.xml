<p>Because virus titers and sampling days for mosquitoes fed on mice (4, 6, and 7 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL sampled 7 and 14 days postfeeding) and artificial blood meals (4, 5, and 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL sampled 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14 dpi) did not completely overlap, we first compared mosquito infection only for blood meal titers (≈4 and 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL) and dpi (7, 14 dpi) that coincided between the 2 feeding methods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panels A [middle panel], C [middle panel]; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). A nominal logistic regression using these data (N = 81) showed no significant interactions among the independent variables; virus titer (χ
 <sup>2</sup> 24.3, df = 1, p&lt;0.0001) and feeding method (χ
 <sup>2</sup> 9.7, df = 1, p&lt;0.0019) significantly affected the likelihood of infection, whereas dpi did not (χ
 <sup>2</sup> 0.33, df = 1, p = 0.56). Using this same dataset, we found that virus titer, feeding method, and dpi all significantly affected dissemination from infected bodies to legs (N = 50, p
 <underline>&lt;</underline>0.0001 for all 3 variables). Because only 8 mosquitoes in this group produced infected saliva, we did not attempt analysis on this small sample. However, it was striking that only mosquitoes fed on mice produced infected saliva. An analysis using all data from Salvador mosquitoes fed on Zika virus strain FSS 13025 in artificial blood meals and mice revealed a significant effect of all 3 independent variables on infection (p&lt;0.0001 for all comparisons), with infection being greater at higher blood meal titers and later time points after infection and from blood meals acquired from mice.
