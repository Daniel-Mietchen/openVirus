<p>We detected no statistically significant interactions among mosquito strain, virus strain, and dpi in any analysis of infection, dissemination, or transmission after mosquitoes fed on an artificial blood meal (Table 1). Frequently, dpi significantly affected infection, dissemination, and transmission as expected based on the need for replication and dissemination in the mosquito, so these data are not presented in detail here.</p>
