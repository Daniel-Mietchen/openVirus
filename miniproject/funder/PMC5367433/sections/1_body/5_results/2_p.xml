 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL, we found no significant difference among the 3 Zika virus strains in infection, dissemination, or transmission. For all artificial blood meal concentrations, FSS 13025 and MEX 1–7 produced similar infection, dissemination, and transmission percentages in each mosquito population.
