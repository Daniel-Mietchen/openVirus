<p>In agreement with previous studies (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>15</italic>
 </xref>), we demonstrated significant variation in competency for Zika virus transmission among 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito populations from 3 different parts of the Americas. After artificial blood meals, strains FSS 13025 and MEX1â€“7 were refractory to transmission in all populations; we detected only 1 positive saliva sample after large oral doses. In contrast, mosquitoes from the DR were susceptible to and able to transmit all 3 Zika virus strains. A similar difference in DENV competency has been noted in comparisons of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito populations from different geographic locations (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>). This variation could be due to genetic differences among mosquitoes or differences in microbiome, virome, or immune activation. Understanding differences in competency and underlying mechanisms could help guide new strategies to control this vector.
