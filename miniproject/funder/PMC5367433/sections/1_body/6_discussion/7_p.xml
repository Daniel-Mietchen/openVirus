<p>Ideally, in investigations of viral adaption to vectors, virus and mosquito origins should be matched. The mosquitoes to match the locations of the Zika virus strains reported here were unavailable. However, vector-adaptive mutations in arboviruses are unlikely to remain geographically isolated because they spread more efficiently (

Therefore, adaptive evolution was investigated on the basis of available mosquitoes with minimal colonization histories, from sites at risk for Zika virus transmission or with reported autochthonous transmission. Surprisingly, despite the use of minimally colonized mosquitoes, most susceptible population of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from the DR had the longest history of 6 generations. Previous studies demonstrated altered DENV-2 susceptibility for
