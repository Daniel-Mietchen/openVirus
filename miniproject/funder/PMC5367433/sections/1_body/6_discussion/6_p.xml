<p>Another major factor in vector transmission is the amount of virus inoculated in the saliva, which can affect pathogenesis (

 </xref>); this value is critical for determining realistic animal model doses. We found saliva titers of up to 4 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU per collection, with the following mean ±SD log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/collection for each mosquito–virus strain combination: Salvador mosquitoes, DAK AR 41525: 2.49 ±2.93; DR mosquitoes, DAK AR 41525: 2.72 ±3.26; DR mosquitoes, MEX1–7: 2.30 ±2.35; RGV mosquitoes, DAK AR: 2.20 ±1.96; Salvador mosquitoes, FSS 13025 infected through a murine blood meal: 2.77 ±3.00. Because of the dearth of positive saliva samples, no statistically significant differences were found for these means. These infectious saliva titers are based only on a small number of positive samples after artificial blood meals. Some studies have found that in vitro salivation overestimates the amount of an arbovirus inoculated in vivo (
