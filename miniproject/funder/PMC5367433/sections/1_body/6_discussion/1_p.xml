<p>Because no vaccine or therapeutic drugs are available, Zika virus prevention depends on controlling the mosquito vector. Although some previous studies (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>15</italic>
 </xref>) showed relatively low Zika virus competence in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, raising questions about the role of other potential vectors, others have shown this species to be highly competent (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>24</italic>
 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>25</italic>
 </xref>). We demonstrated that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito competency as a vector for Zika virus in the Americas varies greatly and depends on mosquito origin, Zika virus strain, and type of blood meal used. Recent studies demonstrated that preexisting DENV antibodies in Zika virusâ€“endemic areas might enhance Zika virus infection in vitro (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>26</italic>
 </xref>); other studies have conversely demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies to DENV envelope neutralize Zika virus in vitro and protect immunocompromised mice from lethal infection (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>27</italic>
 </xref>). The role of preexisting immunity to heterologous viruses remains unclear; thus, even a moderately competent vector, such as 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, might be able transmit efficiently because of its highly anthropophilic behavior and ready access to homes without screening or air conditioning in much of Latin America and the Caribbean.
