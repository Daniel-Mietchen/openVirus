<p>Another contribution of our findings is the higher infectivity from murine blood meals than from artificial meals. Artificial blood meals are known to be less infectious than natural meals, at least in part because of the lack of coagulation and concentration of the virus adjacent to the mid-gut epithelium (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes at 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL by 14 dpi from an artificial blood meal, with 67% of these infections disseminating, and 0% involving the saliva. In contrast, 14 dpi after feeding on an infected mouse with a 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL viremia, 100% infection occurred; 92% of these were disseminated, and 61% of disseminated infections reached the saliva. With titers as low as 4 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL in murine blood meals, 40% of mosquitoes became infected, of which 100% were disseminated and had Zika virus detected in saliva. This dramatic difference in competency after artificial versus viremic blood meals undoubtedly contributed to the underestimation of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes as a Zika virus vector in previous studies (
