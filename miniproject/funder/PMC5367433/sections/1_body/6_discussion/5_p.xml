<p>An important determinant of vector capacity is the EIP, that is, the time before a virus can be found in the saliva of a mosquito after an infectious blood meal. The EIP for DENV varies depending on temperature and other factors, with an average of 6.5 days at 30°C and 15 days at 25°C (

 </xref>). A short EIP facilitates rapid spread, whereas a long EIP gives a larger window for mosquito death, including by human intervention. The 7-day minimum EIP we estimated after a murine blood meal, and 7–10 days after an artificial blood meal, are comparable to those of other flaviviruses in mosquitoes incubated at similar temperatures.
