<p>In addition to differences in competency among 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito populations, we showed a significant difference in infectivity among Zika virus strains. DAK AR 41525 was the only strain capable of disseminating and being transmitted by all mosquito strains. Furthermore, in mosquitoes from the DR, which were susceptible to all 3 Zika virus strains, DAK AR 41525 disseminated the most rapidly and resulted in the greatest proportion of infectious saliva. This finding is surprising given that African Zika virus strains have never been associated with outbreaks involving 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.
