<p>One hypothesis for the sudden emergence of Zika virus epidemics since 2007 is viral adaptation for more efficient transmission by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (

  <italic>18</italic>
 </xref>). A precedent for this mechanism is the adaptation of CHIKV for infecting 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, mediated through a series of envelope glycoprotein substitutions. This adaptation enabled the dramatic spread of CHIKV in the Indian Ocean Basin, Asia, and Europe since 2005 (

  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>). Similar adaptive evolution of the Asian and/or American lineages of Zika virus for transmission by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes could explain the lack of past major urban outbreaks.
