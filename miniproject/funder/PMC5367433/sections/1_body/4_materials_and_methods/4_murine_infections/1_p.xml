<p>Four-week-old interferon type I receptor-knockout (A129) mice were infected intraperitoneally with 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> focus-forming units (FFU) of Zika virus FSS 13025 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. This model generates viremias of 10

 <sup>7</sup> during 1–3 days post infection (dpi) (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (Salvador). Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 30 min, then cold-anesthetized, and fully engorged specimens were incubated. After blood feeding, mice were euthanized and exsanguinated for viremia quantification by FFA.
