<p>Positive saliva samples were titrated by FFA on 24-well plates of Vero cells. Means and SDs were calculated for all positive samples. Samples that were positive during initial screening but below the limit of detection (10 FFU) for the titration assay were given a value of limit of detectionâ€“1 for calculations.</p>
