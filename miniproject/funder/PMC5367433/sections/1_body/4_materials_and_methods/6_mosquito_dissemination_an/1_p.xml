<p>On days 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14 after feeding, ≈9 mosquitoes per group (fewer in some groups because of feeding efficiency and survival) were cold-anesthetized, and legs were removed and placed into Eppendorf tubes containing a steel ball bearing and 500 μL of DMEM, supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/mL amphotericin B (GIBCO, Waltham MA, USA). On days 4, 7, 10, and 14, after removal of legs, mosquitoes were immobilized and their proboscis inserted for 30 min of salivation into a sterile 10-μL micropipette tip containing 8 μL of FBS, after which the expectorated saliva/FBS was added to 100 μL of DMEM. Mosquito bodies were then triturated for 5 min at 26 Hz in a Tissue Lyser II (QIAGEN, Venlo, the Netherlands) in microfuge tubes containing a steel ball bearing and 500 μL of mosquito media. On day 2 after infection, only bodies and legs were collected. For mosquitoes fed on viremic mice, samples were collected 3, 7, and 14 days after feeding. Homogenized mosquito samples were clarified by centrifugation at 200 ×
