 <sup>6</sup> FFU/mL. Blood meals comprised 1% (wt/vol) sucrose, 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 12.5% washed human erythrocytes (University of Texas Medical Branch blood bank), 900 μM adenosine triphosphate, and viral dilutions in DMEM containing 2% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. After 1 h of feeding, mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized, and engorged females were extrinsically incubated. Infections were conducted in 4 separated experiments, with 1 of the 3 mosquito strains studied at a time, followed by the murine blood meal experiments.
