<p>For mosquitoes fed on artificial blood meals, the effect of mosquito strain, virus strain, and dpi, as well as interactions among these, on percentage of bodies infected was analyzed by using a nominal logistic regression, with separate analyses for each blood meal titer (≈4, 5, or 6 log
 <sub>10</sub> FFU/mL). Because of the large number of comparisons, the threshold for significance (α) was set to an arbitrary but conservative threshold of 0.005. Next, the effects of mosquito strain, virus strain, and dpi on dissemination, measured as the percentage of infected bodies that produced infected legs, were analyzed by using a nominal logistic regression, with separate analyses for each blood meal titer. Similarly, the effects of mosquito strain, virus strain, and dpi on transmission, measured as the percentage of mosquitoes with disseminated infection that secreted virus in the saliva, were analyzed by using a nominal logistic regression, with separate analyses for each blood meal titer. For both dissemination and saliva infection, interactions among each of the 3 independent variables were not fully explored, because some combinations were not included (i.e., some mosquito strain × virus strain × dpi combinations did not yield infected bodies). Virus titer in the saliva was not subject to statistical analysis because of small sample sizes. The effects of feeding mode (mouse versus artificial blood meal), virus titer, and dpi on the percentage of infections, dissemination, and transmission in Salvador 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes fed on Zika virus strain FSS were analyzed by nominal logistic regression.
