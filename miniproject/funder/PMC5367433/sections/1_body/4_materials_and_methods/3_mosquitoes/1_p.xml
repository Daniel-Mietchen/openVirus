<p>Colonized 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Salvador (generation F2), the DR (F6), and the RGV (F4) were housed in a 27° ± 1°C incubator (a typical temperature in tropical climates) with 80% ± 10% relative humidity in cardboard cups with mesh lids, fed 10% sucrose ad libitum, and maintained at 16:8 light:dark cycle. Mosquitoes were sex-sorted 3 days posteclosion. Twenty-four hours before experiments, sucrose was replaced with water, which was withdrawn 6 h before feeding.
