 </xref>) for viral stocks, blood meals, and all mosquito samples by inoculating 96-well plates of nearly confluent Vero cells with 50 μL of sample supplemented with 50 μL of mosquito media. After a 3-day incubation, plates were fixed, washed, and blocked before overnight incubation with mouse anti– Zika virus (strain MR-766). Plates were washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Plates were washed and developed with aminoethylcarbazole solution (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY, USA) prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol for detection.
