<p>We used the following Zika virus strains in these studies: FSS 130125 (GenBank accession no. KU955593.1), a human isolate from Cambodia isolated in Vero cells, passaged once in C6/36 before lyophilization; DAK AR 41525 (KU955591.1), an 
 <italic>Ae. africanus</italic> isolate from Senegal isolated in AP61 cells and passaged once in C6/36; and MEX 1–7 (KX247632.1), isolated from 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito on Vero cells with 3 additional passages. All viruses were acquired as lyophilized stocks from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX, USA). Viruses were cultured once in C6/36 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> cells, followed by 3 passages in Vero cells to generate stocks for mosquito feeding. All stocks were titered by focus-forming assay (FFA) and frozen at −80°C in 30% FBS before use in artificial blood meals or mouse infections.
