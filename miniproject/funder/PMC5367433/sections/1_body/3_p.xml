<p>During 2016, we tested this hypothesis by examining the ability of 3 Zika virus strains representing African, Asian, and American lineages to be transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Because geographically disparate populations of this species can vary in their susceptibility to flaviviruses (

 </xref>), we tested populations from 3 at-risk sites in the Americas—Brazil (Salvador), the Caribbean (Dominican Republic [DR]), and the United States (Rio Grande Valley [RGV], Texas)—with Zika virus strains from Senegal (DAK AR 41525), Cambodia (FSS 13025), and a 2015 Mexico outbreak (MEX1–7) (
