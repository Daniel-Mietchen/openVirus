<p id="Par26">In the study, AGE cases were divided into five age groups, where 922 (52.6%), 530 (8.9%), 451 (7.6%), 3282 (55.4%), and 742 (12.5%) AGE patients fell into the age ranges of 0–5, 5–14, 15–64 and over 65 years, respectively. Among all the age groups, the detection rate of adults (25–64 years old) was highest (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 41.93, P &lt; 0.001). The patients with more severe diarrheal symptoms and vomiting were more likely to be infected by NoV norovirus. The detection rates of NoV varies between different severity of diarrhea (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 15.68, P &lt; 0.001). The patients with vomiting seems more likely to be infected by NoV (χ
