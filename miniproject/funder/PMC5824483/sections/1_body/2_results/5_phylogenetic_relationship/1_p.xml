<p id="Par29">A phylogenetic tree was constructed with 139 sequences from the strains collected and 24 additional worldwide reference sequences. The nucleotide sequences of the NoV ORF2 gene revealed that the GII.17 strains tended to cluster more with the strain Hu/JP/2014/GII.P17_GII.17/Kawasaki323 than with the strain Hu/US/2002/GII.17/CSE1, which suggested that the Kawasaki323 strain became the novel prevalent strain in Shanghai [
