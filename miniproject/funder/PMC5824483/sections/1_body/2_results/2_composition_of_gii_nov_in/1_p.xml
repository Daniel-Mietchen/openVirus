<p id="Par25">A total of 866 NoV GII strains among 1363 GII NoV-AGE were further genotyped by sequencing the partial nucleotide sequence of ORF2. Twelve genotypes of NoV GII were determined by NoV Genotyping Tool Version 1.0 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). During the years from 2014–2016, the main genotypes were GII.17 (44.69%, 387/866) and GII.4 (39.26%, 340/866). These strains dominated the NoV-AGE epidemics jointly or in turn. The GII.17 strain was first detected in a case reported in Aug 2014, and it had replaced GII.4 as the dominant NoV genotype by Aug 2015. After that time, GII.4 and GII.17 predominated in turns from Sep 2015 to Dec 2016. Since June 2016, GII.2 has become more prevalent (Fig.
