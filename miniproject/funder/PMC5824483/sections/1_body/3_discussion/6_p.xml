 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Zhejiang Province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] in China have reported AGE outbreaks caused by a novel NoV genotype, GII.17. NoV GII.17 has a polymerase sequence and amino acid substitution in the capsid region, according to a study by Matesushiam et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The novel GII.17 genotype was first detected in AGE patients in Aug 2014 in Pudong New Area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], before the first report of an outbreak in Jiangsu. AGE outbreaks caused by the novel GII.17 genotype have also been reported from nurseries, schools and a military unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. NoV GII.17 could be detected in AGE patients, their close contacts and environmental surfaces such as trash cans and toilet bowls [
