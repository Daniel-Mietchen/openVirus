<p id="Par32">In this study, the proportion of NoV in AGE patients was 21.59% in Pudong, close to that of developed countries. This result could be the result of a reduced number of bacterially-caused AGE cases, along with improvements in environmental and personal hygiene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. NoV-AGE was prevalent throughout the year and peaked in the cold season, as previously reported. In Pudong New Area, the seasonal increase of NoV-AGE started in October and usually lasted until March of the following year, consistent with the results of Xue et al. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the study, the adult aged from 25 to 64 years old seemed vulnerable to get NoV infection, which was not consistent with previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Since health seeking behaviour is voluntary related to the severity of the illness and accessibility of health service, most mild patients may appeal to Over-The-Counter Drug. On the other hand, vomiting is considered as the most frequent symptoms in NoV infected kids and infants. The frequency of vomiting without concurrent diarrhea suggests that epidemiology studies that enroll subjects based on the presence of diarrhea may be significantly underestimating the true burden of NoV infection, especially in the young people [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The patients with more severe diarrhea symptoms and vomiting were more likely to be infected by NoV. However, vomiting with concurrent diarrhea should be regarded as the predictors of NoV infection for more efficient and direct testing and treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The circulating genotypes of NoV could vary geographically and longitudinally, which might influence the size and severity of NoV-AGE epidemics. Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that, during the winter of 2014–2015, 6 GII genotypes circulated among adult patients in Shanghai, i.e., GII.2, GII.3, GII.4, GII.6, GII.13, and GII.17. Despite covering only a part of Shanghai, this study found 12 GII genotypes in Pudong New Area from 2014 to 2016. NoV GII.4 is the most common genotype globally, due to its high diversity, and a new strain of GII.4 emerges every 2–3 years, since it has a 1.7-fold higher rate of evolution on average within the capsid sequence and a greater number of non-synonymous changes compared to other NoVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A study by Lindesmith and colleagues found that the NoV GII.4 strains alter their histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) carbohydrate-binding targets over time, which allows for not only escape from high-penetrance host susceptibility alleles but also immune-driven selection in the receptor-binding region to facilitate avoidance of protective herd immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This locus could represent a focal point for vaccine research to control NoV infection.
