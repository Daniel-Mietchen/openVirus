<p id="Par36">In this study, GII.2 infection was found to have increased slightly since June 2016. In late 2016, AGE outbreaks increased substantially in Pudong, greatly surpassing the numbers during the same season in previous years. Some studies reported that the majority of the outbreaks were associated with a new GII.2 strain that was likely to infect preschool children [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. From 2012 to 2016, a total of 313 NoV outbreaks in 24 provinces and 96 cities in China were reported to the National Emergent Public Health Event Information Management System; 109 (35%) were reported in 2016, mostly in winter. In November and December 2016, NoV outbreaks increased sharply, accounting for 56 (51%) of the 109 NoV outbreaks, and 78% of the GII.2 outbreaks occurred in kindergartens. Further analyses should be conducted to combine sporadic cases with outbreak data to explore the impact of the circulation of this new strain.
