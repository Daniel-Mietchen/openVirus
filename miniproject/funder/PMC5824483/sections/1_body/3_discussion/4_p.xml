<p id="Par33">For example, the GII.4 strain US95/96 was responsible for a majority of the norovirus outbreaks in the US and Europe from 1995 to 1996. Between 2000 and 2004, US95/96 was replaced by two new GII.4 variants: Farmington Hills in the US and a new GII.4 variant, GII.4b, in Europe. In 2004, the Hunter GII.4 variant was detected in Australia, Europe, and Asia, and then this variant was replaced in early 2006 by two new cocirculating GII.4 variants, Sakai and Minerva, in the US, Europe, and Asia [
