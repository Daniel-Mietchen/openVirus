<p id="Par34">In March 2012, a new GII.4 norovirus strain was identified in Australia and named GII.4 Sydney. As the predominant strain of the GII.4 genotype, Sydney_2012 and its variants have been widely reported since 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This emerging strain has caused AGE outbreaks in multiple countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. GII.4 NoVs remain the predominant cause of outbreaks, and the GII.4 Sydney strain appears to have replaced the previously predominant strain, GII.4 New Orleans. Compared with other genotypes, GII.4 NoVs were associated with increased rates of hospitalization and death during outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Similar to the results of Han et al., Sydney_2012, together with Den_Haag_2006b and New_Orleans_2009, were the main strains of GII.4 causing AGE in Shanghai, with Sydney_2012 and its variants being the predominant strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In this study, strain Hu/AU/2012/GII.4/Sydney/NSW0514 was more frequently observed than Hu/JP/2005/GII.4/Sakai was, indicating that the Sydney strain was still the predominant strain. Public health practitioners should remain alert to the potential for increased norovirus activity in future seasons related to variations in this strain. During the study period, we observed circulation of ORF2 genotypes that showed the trends in norovirus genomic diversity, recombination, and NoV reporting.
