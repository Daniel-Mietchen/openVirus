<p id="Par31">Given the high prevalence of NoV, representing a substantial disease burden to residents of all age groups, this study aimed to type the recent patterns of GII NoV presenting in AGE patients in Pudong through a laboratory-based syndromic surveillance system and to delineate the dominant strains circulating in the population. This 3-year data analysis and strain collection study could delineate the genotype circulation of NoV infection in AGE patients reported in Shanghai. The combination of epidemiological, etiological and molecular data analysis could provide comprehensive evidence to support NoV infection control.</p>
