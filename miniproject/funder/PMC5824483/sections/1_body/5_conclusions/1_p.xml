<p id="Par39">NoV GII has become the main cause of virus-infected AGE in Pudong New Area, Shanghai. NoV-AGE accounted for 65.88% of viral AGE during 2014â€“2016, with GII as the main group; GII.17 and GII.4 dominated the NoV-AGE epidemics. GII.17 strains tended to cluster more with the strain Hu/JP/2014/GII.P17_GII.17/Kawasaki323, and GII.4 with Hu/AU/2012/GII.4/Sydney/NSW0514, as shown by the phylogenetic tree. A Comprehensive laboratory-based surveillance is important for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Identification of emerging new genotypes is also crucial for the prevention and control of NoV-infected AGE.</p>
