<p id="Par20">NoV GI and GII positive samples were screened with QuantiTect
 <sup>®</sup> Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Each 20 μL reaction volume consisted of 5.7 μL RNase-free water, 12.5 μL 2× QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.3 μL 10 mM TaqMan prober, 0.3 μL RT mix, 0.6 μL–10 mM e forward and reverse primers, respectively. qPCR was performed with a LightCycler
 <sup>®</sup> 480II system (Roche, Switzerland) with the thermal profile of 50 °C for 30 min; 95 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 1 min.
