<p id="Par17">From January 1, 2014, to December 12, 2016, in each sentinel hospital every week, the first two to five AGE patients who sought medical care at the diarrhea outpatient department were identified for pathogenic-based surveillance. According to the definition given by the World Health Organization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and Diarrheal Syndrome Surveillance Protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the requirements for AGE reporting are those visiting diarrhea outpatient department with 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day. Each participant should have a 2-week symptom-free period before the episode. The AGE cases of suspected or confirmed outbreaks were excluded. Each patient was requested to submit one stool sample for bacterial culture and viral detection following the routine diagnosis procedure of AGE. The specimens were sent to the Pudong New Area Center for Disease Control and Prevention (PDCDC) within 24Â h.
