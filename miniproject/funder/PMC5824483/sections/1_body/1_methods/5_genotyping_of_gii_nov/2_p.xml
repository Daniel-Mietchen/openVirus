Sequences of the strains that were isolated in the study were deposited in the GenBank database. The accession numbers are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> according to their genotypes based on the capsed region of ORF2. Alignment of the sequences was performed using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor software v7.0.9.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The dendrogram was graphed by using the neighbour-joining method in MEGA version 7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Bootstrap resampling (1000 replications) was used, and bootstrap values ≥ 50% are shown.
