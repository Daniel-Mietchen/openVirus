<p id="Par21">The partial capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of NoV GII positive sample was amplified by RT-PCR according to the method of previous literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. RT-PCR was performed with an ABI9700 GeneAmp PCR system (ABI, Marsiling, Singapore) The reaction were carried out in a 20 μL reaction tube containing 5 μL 5× Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 1 μL Qiagen Onestep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) 12 μL of RNase-free water, 1 μL Dntp Mix, 0.5 μL–10 Mm forward and reverse primers, respectively. The thermal profile consisted of 50 °C for 30 min; 95 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 52 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were sized using QIAxcel DNA Screening Gel Cartridges (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on the QIAxcel system (Qiagen, Zurich, Switzerland), The expected PCR product size was 343 bp.
