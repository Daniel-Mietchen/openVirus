<p id="Par14">Norovirus is currently classified into five genogroups, among which only NoV GI, G GII and GIV are associated with human gastroenteritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The genome contains 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes non-structural proteins that include an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); ORF2 encodes a capsid protein (VP1); and ORF3 encodes a minor capsid protein (VP2). NoV G GII is known to have a wider circulation than that of NoV GI, playing a major role in AGE. Based on differences in capsid protein VP1, NoV G GII can be further classified into 23 genotypes, namely, GII.1â€“GII.23 [
