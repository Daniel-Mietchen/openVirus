<p id="Par16">The average annual incidence for NoV-associated outpatient visits was estimated to be 1.5/100 person-years with diarrhea in the community who sought medical care and a community incidence of 8.9/100 person-years by conducting the age-stratified Hospital Utilization Attitudes Survey among respondents residing in Pudong. NoV was a substantial burden on the community and healthcare system of Pudong [

Thus, understanding the dominant genotypes of NoVs and identifying longitudinal variation in circulating NoVs are key to NoV-AGE diagnosis, vaccine development, and outbreak prevention and control. This study aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of GII NoV presenting in AGE patients in Pudong New Area of Shanghai through a laboratory-based syndromic surveillance system and, furthermore, to delineate the dominant strains circulating in the population in recent years. Findings from this study could be useful in the early detection of and rapid response to potential NoV-AGE outbreaks.
