<p id="Par13">Norovirus (NoV), a member of Caliciviridae, is now recognized as the leading cause of AGE worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The first report of a NoV-AGE outbreak was in 1968 in the United States. Since then, NoV-AGE has become epidemic both in developed and developing countries, especially among children and the elderly. In Shanghai, according to the surveillance data, outbreaks occurred in schools and workplaces every year [
