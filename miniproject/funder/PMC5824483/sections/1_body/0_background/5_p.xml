<p id="Par15">Norovirus circulate widely and hold considerable genetic diversity. NoV GII.4 has become the most common genotype circulating globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and represents a typical example of NoV diversity. However, since the autumn of 2014, a new GII.17 strain has emerged as the major cause of AGE outbreaks. The emergence of new NoV genotypes suggests further threats of outbreaks all over the world. Moreover, some studies have found that the newly emerging strains might have stronger invasion abilities and target people with impaired immunity through displacing the previous predominant genotype [
