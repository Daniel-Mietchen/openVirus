<p id="Par38">There were several limitations on our research. Firstly, the subjects were mainly selected from 12 sentinel hospitals selected through Modeling Spatial means of surfaces with stratified Non-homogeneity. The first two to five AGE patients who sought medical care at the diarrhea outpatient department were enrolled which would bring selection bias because of the convenient sampling. Secondly, the people under 14-year-old always visit the pediatric department while NoV usually cause vomiting among them, which would under-estimate the prevalence of the NoV infection among the under 14-year-old age group. Thirdly, genetic characteristics analysis of NoV was only based on partial polymerase regions (ORF2) in this study. Genotyping of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions should be conducted in order to enhance the accuracy and completeness of NoV GII genotyping which is our next research plan of the NoV infection surveillance. Meanwhile, the 3-year data of molecular epidemiological analysis of NoV infection has initiated in the year of 2014, which could only tracing out the circulating pattens rather than capturing the genomic diversity. This would also become our research focus in the future.</p>
