 <caption>
  <p>Maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny of 248 VP1 sequences of coxsackievirus B5 and swine vesicular disease virus. For each branch, the colour indicates the most probable location. Blue bars at nodes indicate 95% highest probability density of time to the most recent ancestor. Numbers above major nodes indicate the support value of posterior/location probability. For each strain, the assigned name is indicated on the right, VP1 genotypes are differentiated by text colour, and 3D
   <sup>pol</sup> genotypes are differentiated by shade. Branch length is proportional to evolution time, and the scale bar depicts calendar time.
