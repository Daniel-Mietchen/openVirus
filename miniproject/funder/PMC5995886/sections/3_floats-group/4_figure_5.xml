 <caption>
  <p>Graphic depiction of haplotype networks in the (
   <bold>A</bold>) VP1 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) partial 3D
   <sup>pol</sup> regions of CV-B5 and SVDV at the amino acid sequence level. Circle size is proportional to haplotype frequency. Genotypes are distinguished by colour. Pie charts depict each haplotype across multiple genotypes. Small hollow circles represent unsampled intermediate sequences. Numbers of mutations are indicated by stripes on connecting branches.
