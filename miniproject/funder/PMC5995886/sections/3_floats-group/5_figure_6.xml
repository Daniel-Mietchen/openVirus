 <caption>
  <p>Graphic depiction of sequence variations in the (
   <bold>A</bold>) VP1 and (
   <bold>B</bold>) partial 3D
   <sup>pol</sup> regions. The CV-B5 consensus sequence is shown on the upper line, and the SVDV sequence is shown on the lower and is shadowed. The consensus sequence graphs were generated by the WebLogo program. The secondary structure guide is located at the top of consensus sequence graph (PDB ID code 1MQT for VP1 of SVDV and 3CDW for 3D
   <sup>pol</sup> of CV-B3). Dashes under the consensus sequence graph indicate negative selection sites, identified by SLAC method. Epistatic interactions are shown at the bottom of the figure. Each square represents a residue position that participated in at least one interaction with a marginal posterior probability (PP) exceeding a default cutoff of 0.5. Sites with multiple epistastic interactions are highlighted with a dark blue box. Arrows between squares indicate the epistastic direction between residues. The PP values are presented in the following order: PP(→)/PP(↔)/PP(←). Epistatic interactions are identified by BGM. Both SLAC and BGM were implemented on the DataMonkey website.
