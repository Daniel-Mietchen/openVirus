 <caption>
  <p>Maximum clade credibility phylogeny of 3D
   <sup>pol</sup> sequences of coxsackievirus B5, swine vesicular disease virus, and outgroups. For each branch, the colour indicates the most probable location. Numbers above major nodes indicate the support values. Genotypes and nucleotide/amino acid similarities within genotypes are shown on the right. For each strain, VP1 genotypes are differentiated by colour whereas 3D
   <sup>pol</sup> genotypes are differentiated by shade. Branch length is proportional to evolution time, and the scale bar depicts calendar time.
