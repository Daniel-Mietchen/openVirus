 </sup>. Earlier studies have reported that clusters in the structural region (e.g., VP1) are monophyletic by serotype whereas clusters in the nonstructural region (e.g., 3D
 <sup>pol</sup>) are monophyletic by species (e.g., EV-B). This study did not directly detect recombination events within the VP1 or 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> regions. However, CV-B5, similar to other serotypes in EV-B species, showed incongruent phylogenetic results for the VP1 and 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> regions. The VP1 tree had a monophylogenetic topology, but the 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> region was rooted together with other serotypes in EV-B
 <sup>23</sup>. The incongruent phylogenies constructed from structural (i.e., VP1) and nonstructural (i.e., 3D
 <sup>pol</sup>) regions indicate the occurrence of recombination events between these two regions. On the countrary, the SVDV phylogenetic trees constructed in this study were also incongruent; SVDV strains clustered together with genogroup A of CV-B5 in the VP1 tree, but clustered together with genogroup B of CV-B5 in the 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> tree. Interestingly, all SVDV isolates were monophyletic not only in the VP1 tree, but also in the 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> tree, and support values were high in both regions. This result supports a previous hypothesis that SVDV originated from a common ancestor after the host was transferred from human to pig
 <sup>

 <sup>pol</sup> tree of SVDV clustered together with SVDV strains alone instead of rooting at the species level with other EV-B strains.
