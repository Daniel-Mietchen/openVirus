<p id="Par23">In conclusion, comparing homologous virus variants in different host species can reveal genetic components needed for viral infection and adaptation to a different host. The VP1 gene has had a particularly important role in host tropism and transmission through the host barrier whereas the partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> region is associated with viral heredity and thus does not differ in a host switch from human to pig. This study used sequencing data to reconstruct the spatiotemporal transmission histories of CV-B5 and SVDV and detected selection events to reveal the key molecular sites associated with different host species.
