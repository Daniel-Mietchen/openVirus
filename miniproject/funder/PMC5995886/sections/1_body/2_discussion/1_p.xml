<p id="Par17">For a historical reconstruction of the spatiotemporal transmission of CV-B5 and SVDV, sequence changes during host switching were analysed in 834 nt of the VP1 region (248 sequences, 248_data) and in 420 nt of a partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> region (129 sequences, including prototypical sequences of CV-B1â€“B4 and CVB6 as an outgroup). Phylodynamic analyses were used to estimate the epidemic, evolutionary, and immunological characteristics of CV-B5 and SVDV transmission. Analyses of evolutionary history revealed haplotype networks with deduced aa sequences. However, virus phylogenetic analysis should be carefully considered owing to several limitations. Ancestral sequences are undersampled owing to insufficient data deposited in GenBank, whereas recently isolated strains are oversampled owing to the use of improved laboratory techniques. Meanwhile, virulent strains are reported more frequently than viruses with low pathogenicity. Furthermore, the lack of reports of a virus in a given country does not mean that the virus is not currently circulating in that country. Thus, the results of the analysis should be cautiously interpreted in these conditions.
