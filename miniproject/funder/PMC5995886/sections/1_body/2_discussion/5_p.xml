<p id="Par21">Sequence comparisons showed that VP1 starts with a conserved PALTAVETGHT motif (associated with viral uncoating) followed by a conical β-barrel commonly seen in the viral capsid protein. This β-barrel is composed of eight antiparallel β-strands (strand B to strand I). The main variations among VP1 are in the N- and C-terminus and in the loops that connect the β strands, especially in the outermost BC and DE loops

 </sup>. As reported in previous studies, five conserved mutations (83, 84, 201, 227 and 186) of VP1 were identified in CV-B5 and SVDV

 </sup>. A novel finding of the current study is the multiple epistatic interactions observed in the 186 residue. Positions 83 and 84 are located in antigenic site I (within the BC-loop), position 210 is located in the putative site of coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) binding, position 186 is located in the hydrophobic pocket, position 227 is located within the five-fold axis, and position 6 is located in the N-terminus before the PALTAVETGHT motif

 </sup>. Notably, CAR is a cellular receptor of CV-B, and mutations of residues 83 and 84 are often reported in association with neutralization escape. The hydrophobic pocket is a determinant of pocket factor selectivity and, like the cellular receptor, is an important determinant of viral tropism in Picornaviridae. Meanwhile, pocket factor expulsion is associated with capsid destabilization. Subsequent extrusion of the VP1 N termini (positions 5 to 18) then forms the viral genome propeller tip

 </sup>. Thus, all positions involved in the multiepistatic interaction were associated with viral tropism and viral decoating.
