<p id="Par20">Owing to a high selectivity for immune escape, VP1 has the lowest similarity of all EV genes. A “75/85% rule” is the common scheme used for molecular typing of EV species. That is, complete or partial VP1 sequences are assumed to have the same serotype if their nt or aa sequence similarity exceeds 75%

 </sup>. A cutoff value of 15% sequence similarity is widely used in EV genotype discrimination

 </sup>. We observed that ladder-like backbones were common not only in genogroup B but also in the terminal branches of recently circulating genotypes such as genotype A1 and genotype A4. These two genotypes included the strains after 2000. Improved laboratory techniques have reduced the loss of branch data. Given that tree imbalance is mainly determined by directional selection

 </sup>, these data imply that, after evolution of the fittest sequence, the population size increased, but variation was fixed. That is, balanced structures suggest a founder effect in adaptive haplotypes. Thus, haplotype size and a mix of early and recent strains are also useful fitness indicators.
