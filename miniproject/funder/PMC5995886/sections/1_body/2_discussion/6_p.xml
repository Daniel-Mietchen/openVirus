<p id="Par22">The RdRp proteins were organized as a closed right hand structure with three domains (fingers, palm, and thumb) consisting of seven motifs in the order G, F, A–E from the N terminus to the C terminus

 </sup>. In the partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> region, this study compared aa residues in positions 254–392 of motifs B to E in the palm region. Motif B is involved in the specific selection of rNTPs as substrates during RdRp polymerization. Motif C includes the strongly conserved GDD motif and has a catalytic residue Asp329 between β11 and β12. Motif E (β14 and β15) is the transition region between the palm and thumb domains

 <sup>pol</sup> region does not functionally differ between human and swine hosts.
