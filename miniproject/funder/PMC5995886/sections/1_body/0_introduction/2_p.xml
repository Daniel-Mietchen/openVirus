<p id="Par3">Swine vesicular disease (SVD) was first described in Italy in 1966. Since then, numerous outbreaks have occurred in Europe and Asia

 </sup>. Swine vesicular disease is difficult to detect because, although morbidity varies by strain, symptoms are usually mild. Additionally, SVD infections are usually detected during outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, which is clinically indistinguishable from SVD. In 2015, SVD was deleted from the Office of International Epizootics Listed Diseases

 </sup>. In Taiwan, surveillance data show that SVD infections occurred only sporadically during 1997–2000. The pathogenic cause of SVD is the SVD virus (SVDV), which comprises a single serotype. Due to the sequence homology of CV-B5 and SVDV and their antigenic cross-reactivity, SVDV is now classified as a porcine variant of CV-B5

 </sup>. Although pigs are currently the only known SVDV host, researchers hypothesize that SVDV evolved from a shared ancestor of CV-B5, and then crossed the species barrier from human to pig through adaptation

 </sup>. Given that biological sequences (DNA, RNA, and protein) are footprints of evolution, sites of sequence variation between ancestor and recent strains reveal not only the evolutionary history of a virus, but also the sequence conserved patterns thought to have functional value for survival

 </sup>. Owing to the close genetic relationship between CV-B5 and SVDV, a comparison of their sequence variation signatures could reveal the key molecular sites of cross-host species transmission.
