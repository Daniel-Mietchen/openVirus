 </sup>, whereas selection detection can further reveal how the direction of evolution is affected by interactions between gene sequence and molecular function. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining phylodynamic and epistatic analyses would yield useful information about viral host barrier crossing and adaptation. To clarify the molecular characteristics of CV-B5 and SVDV and the spatiotemporal characteristics of their evolution, a Bayesian statistical inference framework was used to analyse VP1 and partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> regions in both viruses. Relationships among genealogies were also depicted by haplotype network analysis, and patterns of variation associated with host range switching were analysed by comparing CV-B5 and SVDV sequences.
