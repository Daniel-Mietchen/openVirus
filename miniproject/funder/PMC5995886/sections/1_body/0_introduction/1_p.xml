<p id="Par2">Coxsackievirus (CV)-B5 is a small, naked, single positive-stranded RNA virus in the 
 <italic>enterovirus</italic> (
 <italic>EV</italic>)
 <italic>-B</italic> species of the Picornaviridae family. Enteroviral infections are highly contagious and are typically disseminated via faecal-oral and respiratory routes. As in EV-B, infection with CV-B5 is typically self-limiting; however, it can cause potentially fatal conditions (e.g., encephalitis, myocarditis, and neonatal sepsis-like disease) and chronic autoimmune diseases (e.g., insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus)

 </sup>. Approximately half of all documented CV-B5 infections have been in infants who are highly vulnerable to infections

 </sup>. The distinctive pattern of CV-B5 circulation is characterized by a sudden peak in infectious activity every 3–6 years. In intervening years, infections are sporadic but generally occur annually

 </sup>. Interestingly, heavy precipitation (130–200 mm) is a more important risk factor for EV infection (relative risk, RR = 2.45, 1.59–3.78) than for dengue fever (RR = 1.96, 1.53–2.52)

 </sup> because naked viruses such as EV are more stable during harsh weather conditions such as heavy rainfall compared to enveloped viruses such as dengue virus. For example, EVs can contaminate groundwater even after being washed out of their dominant areas by heavy rainfall. Although the prevalence of EV peaks in warmer seasons, factors such as global warming and migration resulting from economic or political events such as the Syrian conflict
