 </sup>. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> gene product that plays an important hereditary role in RNA viruses not only because mutations result in the loss of proofreading activity, but also because RdRp mediates template switching, which is a well-known recombination mechanism in RNA viruses

 </sup>. Both mutation and recombination contribute to the rapid evolution rate needed to maintain viral adaptability under selective pressure. Gene alignment can reveal the evolutionary history of a virus whereas analysis of amino acid (aa) sequence conservation can reveal not only the constraints on protein structure and function, but also the effects of evolutionary dynamics. Therefore, identifying sequence variations in the VP1 and 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> regions can reveal the evolutionary characteristics of CV-B5 and SVDV.
