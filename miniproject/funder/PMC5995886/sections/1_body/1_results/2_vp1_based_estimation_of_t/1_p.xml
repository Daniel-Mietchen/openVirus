<p id="Par9">The analytical results for 248_data resembled those for CV-B5 except that CV-B5 had a slightly higher EPS during 1965–2000. For 248_data, the estimated mean (95% highest probability density, HPD) TMRCAs were 1891 (1856–1920) for CV-B5 and 1955 (1948–1961) for SVDV with an evolution rate of 4.47 × 10

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the Bayesian skyline plots (BSPs) of the viral demographic histories for CV-B5, SVDV and 248_data. The results for CV-B5 show that a one-step increase in effective population size (EPS) occurred in 1960. During 1960-2015, the EPS was generally stable, i.e., fluctuation in EPS (e.g., a dip in 1965) did not appreciably affect the 95% credibility interval. On the other hand, the EPS of SVDV started from only 8.8 (1.7–31.1) and gradually increased to a plateau in 1999 before decreasing after 2000.
