<p id="Par11">The diffusion histories for both viruses were reconstructed using Bayesian estimation and annotated using the Spatial Phylogenetic Reconstruction of Evolutionary Dynamics 3 (SpreaD3) program. Based on the analysis of VP1, 11 transmission routes were supported by a Bayes factor &gt;3 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The 248_data revealed three transmission routes: one from the United States (to Denmark), one from Estonia (to Russia), and one from Australia (to Kuwait). The CV-B5 dataset revealed six transmission routes: one from Germany (to Denmark), three from China (to Taiwan, France, and Denmark), one from France (to the Netherlands), and one from Taiwan (to Denmark). The SVDV dataset revealed two routes: both from Italy (to the Netherlands and Spain). The analysis of the 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> dataset revealed five transmission routes supported by a BF &gt;3: one from Dominica (to Honduras), one from Russia (to the United States), and three from Italy (to the Netherlands, Spain, and Malta). In the 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> dataset, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Malta, and Russia only had SVDV strains, suggesting that these transmission routes were important in SVDV transmission. Notably, transmissions from Italy to Netherlands and from Italy to Spain were supported by both analyses based on VP1 region of SVDV data and 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> data, revealing the important role played by Italy in SVDV transmission.
