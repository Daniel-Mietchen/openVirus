<p id="Par10">Five phylogenetic clusters (A–E) with high support values were revealed in this partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup>-based analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Most prototypical CV-B strains were alone in a separate branch, and most strains were in clusters that corresponded with VP1 genotypes. The cluster A sequences of 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> tree included earlier isolates from the United Kingdom, France, and United States, and most of these strains were clustered in genotype B2 of VP1. The cluster B included all SVDV and CV-B5 strains that corresponded with genotype B1 of VP1. The cluster C strains included those isolated from Taiwan during 1995–2003 and one each from Korea (2000) and China (2009), which were mainly clustered in genotype A1 of VP1. The cluster D strains were isolated from Taiwan (1983–2011) and China (2008−2011) and were mainly clustered in genotype A4 of VP1. The cluster E included strains isolated from Dominica (1971), Hong Kong (1987), Pakistan (1991), China (2010–2013), and Taiwan (2013–2015); these were also clustered in genotype A4 of VP1. This partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup>-based analysis-revealed a notable incongruence: SVDV clustered together with genotype B1 in the 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> tree instead of with genotype A1 in the VP1 tree.
