 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref> clearly shows that based on the analysis of the VP1 region, CV-B5 and SVDV strains clearly clustered in separate branches (blue branch in the left and salmon branch in the right). The prototype strain of CV-B5 and SVDV were located near the junction of the blue branch and salmon branch. Both CV-B5 and SVDV networks revealed radical extensions, which were roughly grouped by genotype. The network revealed that the branch separated into genotype A1 and SVDV from prototype strain of CV-B5, each extending towards opposite directions. Next, the CV-B5 branch continuously extended A1 and formed a network that consist of genotypes A2 to A4 (on the upper-left of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>), and further extends to the network consisting of strains formed by mixing of genotypes B1 and B2 (in the lower-left of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Notably, this genogroup B network revealed a major group (the biggest circle) with short random extensions by mixing of genotype B1 and B2 strains (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The biggest haplotype mixing by random extension short branches suggests that the founder effect was established by the fittest haplotype.
