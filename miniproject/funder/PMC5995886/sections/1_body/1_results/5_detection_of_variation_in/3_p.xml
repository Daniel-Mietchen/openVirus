<p id="Par14">The prototype SVDV strain, from the junction of blue and salmon branches, extended to a mixed network of genotype I and II strains (light and dark purple circle on the right). This network then prolonged into two genotype II branches (upper-right) and genotype III network (lower-right), which corroborated the results of phylogenetic analysis and indicated that the SVDV strains had evolved with a spatiotemporal trend (Supplementary Fig.Â
