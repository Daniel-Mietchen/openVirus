 <sup>pol</sup> region, all strains were clustered into one large and small haplotype cluster each (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). The small haplotype included the prototype CV-B1 strain, 12 CV-B5 strains (four cluster C, six cluster D, and two cluster E), and five SVDV strains (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). All other strains were grouped together in the large haplotype cluster and its short branches. The presence of numerous haplotype clusters with short random extension branches also indicated the existence of a common ancestor and establishment of dominant traits.
