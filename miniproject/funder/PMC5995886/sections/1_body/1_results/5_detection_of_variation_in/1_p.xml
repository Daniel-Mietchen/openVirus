<p id="Par12">Although no recombination events were detected in either the VP1 (structural) or partial-3D
 <sup>pol</sup> (nonstructural) regions, the incongruity of constructed phylogenies indicated that recombination occurred between these regions. To investigate the codon sequence composition of SVDV, we analysed 27 CV-B5 and 50 SVDV full codon sequences in GenBank. According to the SimPlot results (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), genotype A1 of CV-B5 and genotype B1 of CV-B5 had high similarity in the VP1 and 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> regions, respectively. Additionally, the similarity between CV-B5 and SVDV was lower (&lt;75%) within nt 2650–3000. The segmental arrangement of various CV-B5 genotypes in SVDV indicated that multiple recombination events have occurred as SVDV evolved.
