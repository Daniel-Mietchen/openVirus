 </sup>. The two viruses showed aa sequence similarity in almost every VP1 and 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> residue (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) method obtained d
 <italic>N</italic>/d
 <italic>S</italic> values of 0.0334 and 0.0265 for the VP1 and 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> regions, respectively. A d
 <italic>N</italic>/d
 <italic>S</italic> value of &lt;1 indicates negative selection, in which the aa sequence tends to be fixed. Neither VP1 nor 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> revealed sites of significant positive selection by SLAC. Both regions showed scattered sites of significant negative selection. However, the two viruses had five conserved nonsynonymous mutation sites (G83D, T84S, S186G, N210S, and S227G) in VP1. The epistatic analysis based on 248_data revealed 25 pairs of epistatic interactions (PP &gt;0.5). Intriguingly, position 186 showed multiple epistatic interactions with positions 83, 84, 210, 227, and 6. These epistatic interactions occurred among all five nonsynonymous mutation sites. The partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> region revealed no positive sites and no mutation pattern common to CV-B5 and SVDV. Six pairs of epistatic interactions were identified; however, none of them differed between CV-B5 and SVDV. The only residue difference between these two haplotypes was residue 117 immediately before motif E, where T in the large haplotype cluster was replaced by A in the small haplotype cluster.
