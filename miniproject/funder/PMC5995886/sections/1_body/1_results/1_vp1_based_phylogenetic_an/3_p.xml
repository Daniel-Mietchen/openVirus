<p id="Par8">Unlike the dichotomous phylogeny of CV-B5, SVDV clustered monophyletically with genotype A1 with high support values. All three genotypes included strains isolated in Europe and Asia but sub-clustered by their isolation locations and timespans. Genotype I comprised strains isolated during 1966−1973, including the prototype strain KT284997 isolated in Italy (1966); Genotype II included strains prevalent during 1972–1992; Genotype ASIII strains were isolated only after 1990. Topology and clustering in the SVDV tree resembled those in the 248_data except for five strains isolated from Hong Kong (1973−1985), which clustered together with genotype III with high support values in 248_data. In contrast, certain earlier Asian strains (isolated from Hong Kong and Japan during 1970–1976) clustered with genotype III in the SVDV tree and had low support values (Fig.
