<p id="Par6">Three datasets were used to estimate spatiotemporal dynamics in the 849-nucleotide (-nt) VP1 region: a CV-B5 dataset (195 sequences isolated from 28 countries during 1952–2015, including 28 Taiwan strains isolated in this study), an SVDV dataset (53 sequences sampled from 14 countries during 1966–2006), and a combined dataset designated 248_data (195 CV-B5 sequences and 53 SVDV sequences). Supplementary Table

 </sup>, including EV-B. Sequential evolution of six CV-B5 genotypes (A1−A4 and B1−B2) were observed in this study. In each genogroup, some ancestor strains were separated from the main subcluster. Compared with the main subcluster, these ancestor strains had a wider range of isolation years, wider distribution of isolation locations, lower sequence similarity, and/or lower nodal support values, and were assigned as 0. For example, genotype A successively yielded A0, A1−A4, and SVDV; and genotype B successively yielded B0, B1, and B2. All SVDV strains were rooted in a single branch of genogroup A and clustered together with genogroup A1. The SVDV was further subdivided into genotypes I−III. Although all 248 strains were rooted together with high support values in both Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) tree and ML trees, these results indicate that SVDV evolved from CV-B5. However, support values on the rooted nodes of SVDV with genogroup A are low (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> also show within-genotype similarities. Dominant sublineages may have circulated for several years before being replaced by newer sublineages with extended branches. Different sublineages may have co-circulated during a given period in the same location, especially in recent decades.
