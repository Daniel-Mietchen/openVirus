<p id="Par7">The MCC trees for the CV-B5 and 248_data datasets showed similar topologies and clustering. On rooted branches, both trees had a balanced structure indicating co-survival in bifurcating sub-branches. On terminal branches, both trees had an imbalanced structure indicating temporal and geographic clustering of CV-B5 isolates, especially in those isolated after 2000, with a ladder-like backbone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). After the prototype strain of CV-B5 appeared in the US in 1952, it reappeared in France and Ecuador in the 1970s and later in Poland in 2001. This cluster, which had a low PP value and low sequence similarity, was not included in the GenBank after 2001. Genotype A1 strains were isolated from Asia (Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan, 1989−1992); whereas genotype A2 strains were isolated from Europe and Asia (1995–2003); genotype A3 strains were isolated from Europe (1996−2005); and genotype A4 strains were isolated from Asia and Europe (2002−2015). In genogroup B, genotype B1 strains had circulated in America and Europe (1970−1985), whereas genotype B2 strains had circulated only in Europe (1983−2011).
