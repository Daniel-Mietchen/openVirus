 </sup>. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 200 μl of viral culture supernatant using the QIAmp viral RNA purification kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA). The One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) was used to perform RT-PCR with 200 ng total RNA using specific primer pairs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) for 35 amplification cycles. Purified PCR products were sequenced with the ABI Prism Ready Reaction Dideoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Model 3730 v.3.4; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The sequences for forward and reverse strands were obtained simultaneously and edited with Sequence Navigator v.3.01 software (Applied Biosystems). The obtained VP1 (880 nt) and partial 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> (420 nt) gene sequences were submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers listed in Supplementary Table
