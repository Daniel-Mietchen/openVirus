 <sup>pol</sup> (positions 6671â€“7090 of accession no. AF114383) sequences of CV-B5 and SVDV were obtained using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool program. Multiple sequence alignments were performed with T-coffee

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. Sequences were manually excluded if they (1) lacked isolation date or location data or (2) if they had ambiguously codons, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. Sequences with the same isolation location and year were then stratified by random sampling. Recombination events were detected using Recombination Detection Program v.3.44 with default settings

 <italic>N</italic>/d
 <italic>S</italic>). A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Spidermonkey/Bayesian graphical model (BGM) was used to detect sites with epistatic interaction, and PP &lt;0.5 was considered statistically significant. All programs used to detect selection, including SLAC and BGM, were implemented on the DataMonkey website
