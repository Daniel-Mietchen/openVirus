<p id="Par24">For each year of positive CV-B5 isolation (1999â€“2015), 28 isolates were randomly selected from a pool of de-identified virus stock from two medical centres in southern Taiwan (Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital). The ethics committees of both hospitals approved this study. Experiments were limited to viral isolates obtained from clinically necessary laboratory procedures; medical histories were not reviewed, and no patients were harmed. As such, informed consent was not required. The SVDV sequences were obtained from the Animal Health Research Institute, Taiwan (AHRI-TW). Samples used in this study were obtained from certified farms that voluntarily sent samples to AHRI-TW. Animals were investigated according to the regulations established by the Central Epidemic Command Center of Taiwan. As such, this study did not require approval by the ethics committee of the institutional review board.</p>
