 </sup> under Akaike information criteria was performed. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the MEGA v.7 program. Further, the Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees (BEAST) v.1.8.4 program was used for BMCMC tree analysis

 </sup>. All sampled sequences were stamped with isolation times and locations. Eight candidate model compositions (substitution-clock-tree) were used for Bayesian estimation in all four datasets (three for VP1 sequences and one for partial 3D sequences). All model compositions included the SRD06 substitution model, relaxed uncorrelated clock model with either exponential distribution or lognormal distribution, and one of the four coalescent tree priors: constant size, exponential growth, logistic growth, and BSP (1*2*4 = 8). The best-fit model composition for each dataset was selected with the path sampling and stepping-stone methods. The MCMC tree analysis was also used to co-estimate rate of growth, substitution rate, and TMRCA. The TRACER v.1.6 program was used to calculate effective sample size (ESS) based on the stationarity of post-burn-in distributions and estimated parameters, which were considered significant if ESS &gt;200. These estimated parameters were expressed as mean value with 95% HPD. FigTree v.1.4.3 software was used to visualize the MCC tree. Nodal support was estimated by calculating PP, and significant support was defined as PP &gt; 0.9. A BEAST log file with rate indicators was generated by asymmetric Bayesian stochastic search variable selection in location reconstruction. The SPREAD3 v0.9.6 program was used to convert the tree into KML format and to estimate non-zero expectancy rates
