To clarify the transmission dynamics and molecular basis of host switching between CV-B5 and SVDV, we analysed and compared the VP1 and partial 3D<sup>pol</sup> gene regions of these two viruses. Spatiotemporal dynamics of viral transmission were estimated using a Bayesian statistical inference framework. The detected selection events were used to analyse the key molecules associated with host switching. Analyses of VP1 sequences revealed six CV-B5 genotypes (A1&#x02013;A4 and B1&#x02013;B2) and three SVDV genotypes (I&#x02013;III). Analyses of partial 3D<sup>pol</sup> revealed five clusters (A&#x02013;E). The genotypes evolved sequentially over different periods, albeit with some overlap. The major hub of CV-B5 transmission was in China whereas the major hubs of SVDV transmission were in Italy. Network analysis based on deduced amino acid sequences showed a diverse extension of the VP1 structural protein, whereas most sequences were clustered into two haplotypes in the partial 3D<sup>pol</sup> region. Residue 178 of VP1 showed four epistatic interactions with residues known to play essential roles in viral host tropism, cell entry, and viral decoating.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Coxsackievirus (CV)-B5 is a small, naked, single positive-stranded RNA virus in the <italic>enterovirus</italic> (<italic>EV</italic>)<italic>-B</italic> species of the Picornaviridae family. Enteroviral infections are highly contagious and are typically disseminated via faecal-oral and respiratory routes. As in EV-B, infection with CV-B5 is typically self-limiting; however, it can cause potentially fatal conditions (e.g., encephalitis, myocarditis, and neonatal sepsis-like disease) and chronic autoimmune diseases (e.g., insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Approximately half of all documented CV-B5 infections have been in infants who are highly vulnerable to infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The distinctive pattern of CV-B5 circulation is characterized by a sudden peak in infectious activity every 3&#x02013;6 years. In intervening years, infections are sporadic but generally occur annually<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In Taiwan, CV-B5 epidemics occurred in 1995, 2002, 2011, and 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Interestingly, heavy precipitation (130&#x02013;200&#x02009;mm) is a more important risk factor for EV infection (relative risk, RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.45, 1.59&#x02013;3.78) than for dengue fever (RR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.96, 1.53&#x02013;2.52)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> because naked viruses such as EV are more stable during harsh weather conditions such as heavy rainfall compared to enveloped viruses such as dengue virus. For example, EVs can contaminate groundwater even after being washed out of their dominant areas by heavy rainfall. Although the prevalence of EV peaks in warmer seasons, factors such as global warming and migration resulting from economic or political events such as the Syrian conflict<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> mandate year-round surveillance.</p><p id="Par3">Swine vesicular disease (SVD) was first described in Italy in 1966. Since then, numerous outbreaks have occurred in Europe and Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Swine vesicular disease is difficult to detect because, although morbidity varies by strain, symptoms are usually mild. Additionally, SVD infections are usually detected during outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, which is clinically indistinguishable from SVD. In 2015, SVD was deleted from the Office of International Epizootics Listed Diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In Taiwan, surveillance data show that SVD infections occurred only sporadically during 1997&#x02013;2000. The pathogenic cause of SVD is the SVD virus (SVDV), which comprises a single serotype. Due to the sequence homology of CV-B5 and SVDV and their antigenic cross-reactivity, SVDV is now classified as a porcine variant of CV-B5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Although pigs are currently the only known SVDV host, researchers hypothesize that SVDV evolved from a shared ancestor of CV-B5, and then crossed the species barrier from human to pig through adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Given that biological sequences (DNA, RNA, and protein) are footprints of evolution, sites of sequence variation between ancestor and recent strains reveal not only the evolutionary history of a virus, but also the sequence conserved patterns thought to have functional value for survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Owing to the close genetic relationship between CV-B5 and SVDV, a comparison of their sequence variation signatures could reveal the key molecular sites of cross-host species transmission.</p><p id="Par4">The VP1 gene of EVs encodes outer capsid proteins that determine host range and receptor binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a 3D<sup>pol</sup> gene product that plays an important hereditary role in RNA viruses not only because mutations result in the loss of proofreading activity, but also because RdRp mediates template switching, which is a well-known recombination mechanism in RNA viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Both mutation and recombination contribute to the rapid evolution rate needed to maintain viral adaptability under selective pressure. Gene alignment can reveal the evolutionary history of a virus whereas analysis of amino acid (aa) sequence conservation can reveal not only the constraints on protein structure and function, but also the effects of evolutionary dynamics. Therefore, identifying sequence variations in the VP1 and 3D<sup>pol</sup> regions can reveal the evolutionary characteristics of CV-B5 and SVDV.</p><p id="Par5">Phylodynamic analysis can elucidate the epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary interactions of a pathogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, whereas selection detection can further reveal how the direction of evolution is affected by interactions between gene sequence and molecular function. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining phylodynamic and epistatic analyses would yield useful information about viral host barrier crossing and adaptation. To clarify the molecular characteristics of CV-B5 and SVDV and the spatiotemporal characteristics of their evolution, a Bayesian statistical inference framework was used to analyse VP1 and partial 3D<sup>pol</sup> regions in both viruses. Relationships among genealogies were also depicted by haplotype network analysis, and patterns of variation associated with host range switching were analysed by comparing CV-B5 and SVDV sequences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>VP1-based phylogenetic and demographic analyses of CV-B5 and SVDV</title><p id="Par6">Three datasets were used to estimate spatiotemporal dynamics in the 849-nucleotide (-nt) VP1 region: a CV-B5 dataset (195 sequences isolated from 28 countries during 1952&#x02013;2015, including 28 Taiwan strains isolated in this study), an SVDV dataset (53 sequences sampled from 14 countries during 1966&#x02013;2006), and a combined dataset designated 248_data (195 CV-B5 sequences and 53 SVDV sequences). Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> shows the model compositions used. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and maximum likelihood (ML) tree for 248_data showed that the two main branches evolved from a common ancestor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Previous studies showed a bifurcating tree with two major circulating genogroups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This study applied the genogroup A and B designations used by Henquell <italic>et al</italic>. because dichotomous grouping is simple and clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The genotype A strains were prevalent mainly in Asia and Europe, while the genotype B strains were prevalent mainly in America and Europe. The two main branches evolved continuously in separate subclusters. Genotype analysis was limited to sequence with higher than 15% similarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and nodes with high support values (posterior probability value, PP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.9 or bootstrap value &#x0003e;70%), criteria that are widely used to discriminate non-polio enterovirus genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, including EV-B. Sequential evolution of six CV-B5 genotypes (A1&#x02212;A4 and B1&#x02212;B2) were observed in this study. In each genogroup, some ancestor strains were separated from the main subcluster. Compared with the main subcluster, these ancestor strains had a wider range of isolation years, wider distribution of isolation locations, lower sequence similarity, and/or lower nodal support values, and were assigned as 0. For example, genotype A successively yielded A0, A1&#x02212;A4, and SVDV; and genotype B successively yielded B0, B1, and B2. All SVDV strains were rooted in a single branch of genogroup A and clustered together with genogroup A1. The SVDV was further subdivided into genotypes I&#x02212;III. Although all 248 strains were rooted together with high support values in both Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) tree and ML trees, these results indicate that SVDV evolved from CV-B5. However, support values on the rooted nodes of SVDV with genogroup A are low (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Supplementary Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> also show within-genotype similarities. Dominant sublineages may have circulated for several years before being replaced by newer sublineages with extended branches. Different sublineages may have co-circulated during a given period in the same location, especially in recent decades.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogeny of 248 VP1 sequences of coxsackievirus B5 and swine vesicular disease virus.

On rooted branches, both trees had a balanced structure indicating co-survival in bifurcating sub-branches. On terminal branches, both trees had an imbalanced structure indicating temporal and geographic clustering of CV-B5 isolates, especially in those isolated after 2000, with a ladder-like backbone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). After the prototype strain of CV-B5 appeared in the US in 1952, it reappeared in France and Ecuador in the 1970s and later in Poland in 2001. This cluster, which had a low PP value and low sequence similarity, was not included in the GenBank after 2001. Genotype A1 strains were isolated from Asia (Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan, 1989&#x02212;1992); whereas genotype A2 strains were isolated from Europe and Asia (1995&#x02013;2003); genotype A3 strains were isolated from Europe (1996&#x02212;2005); and genotype A4 strains were isolated from Asia and Europe (2002&#x02212;2015). In genogroup B, genotype B1 strains had circulated in America and Europe (1970&#x02212;1985), whereas genotype B2 strains had circulated only in Europe (1983&#x02212;2011).</p><p id="Par8">Unlike the dichotomous phylogeny of CV-B5, SVDV clustered monophyletically with genotype A1 with high support values.

Phylodynamic analyses were used to estimate the epidemic, evolutionary, and immunological characteristics of CV-B5 and SVDV transmission. Analyses of evolutionary history revealed haplotype networks with deduced aa sequences. However, virus phylogenetic analysis should be carefully considered owing to several limitations. Ancestral sequences are undersampled owing to insufficient data deposited in GenBank, whereas recently isolated strains are oversampled owing to the use of improved laboratory techniques. Meanwhile, virulent strains are reported more frequently than viruses with low pathogenicity. Furthermore, the lack of reports of a virus in a given country does not mean that the virus is not currently circulating in that country. Thus, the results of the analysis should be cautiously interpreted in these conditions.</p><p id="Par18">Recombination occurs frequently in EV-B, particularly in the non-structural region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Previous results obtained from the phylogenetic analyses of structural and nonstructural regions of EV-B are often incongruent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Earlier studies have reported that clusters in the structural region (e.g., VP1) are monophyletic by serotype whereas clusters in the nonstructural region (e.g., 3D<sup>pol</sup>) are monophyletic by species (e.g., EV-B). This study did not directly detect recombination events within the VP1 or 3D<sup>pol</sup> regions. However, CV-B5, similar to other serotypes in EV-B species, showed incongruent phylogenetic results for the VP1 and 3D<sup>pol</sup> regions. The VP1 tree had a monophylogenetic topology, but the 3D<sup>pol</sup> region was rooted together with other serotypes in EV-B<sup>23</sup>. The incongruent phylogenies constructed from structural (i.e., VP1) and nonstructural (i.e., 3D<sup>pol</sup>) regions indicate the occurrence of recombination events between these two regions. On the countrary, the SVDV phylogenetic trees constructed in this study were also incongruent; SVDV strains clustered together with genogroup A of CV-B5 in the VP1 tree, but clustered together with genogroup B of CV-B5 in the 3D<sup>pol</sup> tree. Interestingly, all SVDV isolates were monophyletic not only in the VP1 tree, but also in the 3D<sup>pol</sup> tree, and support values were high in both regions. This result supports a previous hypothesis that SVDV originated from a common ancestor after the host was transferred from human to pig<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, as the 3D<sup>pol</sup> tree of SVDV clustered together with SVDV strains alone instead of rooting at the species level with other EV-B strains.</p><p id="Par19">A previous report has suggested Hong Kong as an important transmission hub<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.

A cutoff value of 15% sequence similarity is widely used in EV genotype discrimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

(Supplementary Table.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Continuous bipartite branches have been reported in genotype A<sup>19</sup>. This topology indicates that the sublineages co-circulated in a wide geographic area during their evolution. The genogroup B consists of one imbalanced ladder-like backbone and strains that mainly circulated in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We observed that ladder-like backbones were common not only in genogroup B but also in the terminal branches of recently circulating genotypes such as genotype A1 and genotype A4. These two genotypes included the strains after 2000. Improved laboratory techniques have reduced the loss of branch data. Given that tree imbalance is mainly determined by directional selection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, these data imply that, after evolution of the fittest sequence, the population size increased, but variation was fixed. That is, balanced structures suggest a founder effect in adaptive haplotypes. Thus, haplotype size and a mix of early and recent strains are also useful fitness indicators.</p><p id="Par21">Sequence comparisons showed that VP1 starts with a conserved PALTAVETGHT motif (associated with viral uncoating) followed by a conical &#x003b2;-barrel commonly seen in the viral capsid protein. This &#x003b2;-barrel is composed of eight antiparallel &#x003b2;-strands (strand B to strand I). The main variations among VP1 are in the N- and C-terminus and in the loops that connect the &#x003b2; strands, especially in the outermost BC and DE loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

A novel finding of the current study is the multiple epistatic interactions observed in the 186 residue. Positions 83 and 84 are located in antigenic site I (within the BC-loop), position 210 is located in the putative site of coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) binding, position 186 is located in the hydrophobic pocket, position 227 is located within the five-fold axis, and position 6 is located in the N-terminus before the PALTAVETGHT motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Notably, CAR is a cellular receptor of CV-B, and mutations of residues 83 and 84 are often reported in association with neutralization escape. The hydrophobic pocket is a determinant of pocket factor selectivity and, like the cellular receptor, is an important determinant of viral tropism in Picornaviridae. Meanwhile, pocket factor expulsion is associated with capsid destabilization. Subsequent extrusion of the VP1 N termini (positions 5 to 18) then forms the viral genome propeller tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Thus, all positions involved in the multiepistatic interaction were associated with viral tropism and viral decoating.</p><p id="Par22">The RdRp proteins were organized as a closed right hand structure with three domains (fingers, palm, and thumb) consisting of seven motifs in the order G, F, A&#x02013;E from the N terminus to the C terminus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

AF114383) sequences of CV-B5 and SVDV were obtained using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool program. Multiple sequence alignments were performed with T-coffee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Sequences were manually excluded if they (1) lacked isolation date or location data or (2) if they had ambiguously codons, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. Sequences with the same isolation location and year were then stratified by random sampling. Recombination events were detected using Recombination Detection Program v.3.44 with default settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and SimPlot v.3.5.1<sup>12</sup>. Pairwise comparisons of nt and aa sequences were estimated with the p-distance method in the MEGA v.7 program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The SLAC method was used to estimate site-specific selection, i.e., the ratio of non-synonymous substitutions to synonymous substitutions (d<italic>N</italic>/d<italic>S</italic>). A <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Spidermonkey/Bayesian graphical model (BGM) was used to detect sites with epistatic interaction, and PP &#x0003c;0.5 was considered statistically significant. All programs used to detect selection, including SLAC and BGM, were implemented on the DataMonkey website<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. For a comprehensive comparison of population differences between CV-B5 and SVDV, variations in deduced aa sequences between VP1 and 3D<sup>pol</sup> proteins of both viruses were graphically visualized with the WebLogo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The genealogical relationships were further visualized by using the method developed by Templeton, Crandall, and Singh (TSC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> to construct a network in PopART program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis</title><p id="Par27">The best-fit substitution model by jMODELTEST v.2.1.7 program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> under Akaike information criteria was performed. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the MEGA v.7 program. Further, the Bayesian evolutionary analysis sampling trees (BEAST) v.1.8.4 program was used for BMCMC tree analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. All sampled sequences were stamped with isolation times and locations. Eight candidate model compositions (substitution-clock-tree) were used for Bayesian estimation in all four datasets (three for VP1 sequences and one for partial 3D sequences). All model compositions included the SRD06 substitution model, relaxed uncorrelated clock model with either exponential distribution or lognormal distribution, and one of the four coalescent tree priors: constant size, exponential growth, logistic growth, and BSP (1*2*4&#x02009;=&#x02009;8). The best-fit model composition for each dataset was selected with the path sampling and stepping-stone methods. The MCMC tree analysis was also used to co-estimate rate of growth, substitution rate, and TMRCA. The TRACER v.1.6 program was used to calculate effective sample size (ESS) based on the stationarity of post-burn-in distributions and estimated parameters, which were considered significant if ESS &#x0003e;200. These estimated parameters were expressed as mean value with 95% HPD. FigTree v.1.4.3 software was used to visualize the MCC tree. Nodal support was estimated by calculating PP, and significant support was defined as PP &#x0003e; 0.9. A BEAST log file with rate indicators was generated by asymmetric Bayesian stochastic search variable selection in location reconstruction. The SPREAD3 v0.9.6 program was used to convert the tree into KML format and to estimate non-zero expectancy rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Discrete sampling locations were plotted as the centre of the country in which the strain was isolated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
