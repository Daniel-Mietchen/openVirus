<p>In this work, we propose an approach that aims at addressing the heterogeneity of seasonal influenza epidemiological signals in the various European countries, focusing on the individual symptoms collected directly from the general population. The goal is to develop a mathematical framework able to extract, in an unsupervised fashion, the groups of symptoms that are in good correlation with the ILI incidence, as detected by traditional surveillance systems for each country without imposing an a priori a specific ILI case definition. By using the daily occurrence of symptoms in form of matrix, we employ an approach based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [
