<p>In general, differences in seasonal influenza epidemics across European countries are characterised by heterogeneity in sentinel systems, climatic conditions, human mobility systems, as well as social contacts [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The result is a consequent heterogeneity in the prevalence of the disease among the population in the various countries which can present differences in severity during the same influenza season. This diversity makes it hard to have a unified, one-fits-all approach to influenza surveillance, let alone a unified ILI definition. Moreover, the ILI definition might change over time even for national sentinel systems [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, in Italy, the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†) adopted the ECDC definition only in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. France is a peculiar example as it had double surveillance (ILI and ARI) up till 2014 (Casalegno et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] assessed the performance of various influenza case definitions in France between 2009-2014). Mandl et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] explicitly addressed the variation in the definition of ILI over time.
