<p>In recent years the availability of novel digital data streams has given rise to a variety of non-traditional approaches for monitoring seasonal influenza epidemics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Such new digital data sources can be exploited to capture additional surveillance signals that can be used to complement GPs surveillance data [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this context, some so-called participatory surveillance systems have emerged in several countries around the world with the aim of monitoring influenza circulation through Internet reporting of self-selected participants [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. One of these systems, the

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], has been established in Europe since 2011 and it is now present in ten European countries. In this study, we excluded from the analysis the country of Sweden, due to the fact that the Swedish cohort is solicited upon invitation when required and not on an annual basis [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The system relies on the voluntary participation of the general population through a dedicated national website in each country involved in the project. Data are obtained on a weekly basis through an online survey [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] where participants are invited to report whether they experienced or not any of the following symptoms since their last survey: fever, chills, runny or blocked nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, headache, muscle/joint pain, chest pain, feeling tired or exhausted, loss of appetite, coloured sputum/phlegm, watery/bloodshot eyes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach ache, or other symptoms. Differently, from most traditional surveillance systems, this participatory form of online surveillance allows the collection of symptoms in real-time and directly from the general population, including those individuals who do not seek health care assistance. The list of proposed symptoms has been chosen to include the various ILI definitions adopted by national surveillance systems in Europe and, at the same time, to get a comprehensive list of symptoms that could be clearly articulated and understood by participants and would allow the detection of various circulating flu-related illnesses. Even though participatory systems generally suffer from self-selection biases, causing the sample to be non-representative of the general population [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], previous works have shown that the web-based surveillance data collected by Influenzanet can provide relevant information to estimate age-specific influenza attack rates [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, it has been largely demonstrated that weekly ILI incidence rates computed from the web-based surveillance data by applying the ECDC case definition to the set of self-reported symptoms correlate well with the weekly ILI incidence reported by GPs surveillance [
