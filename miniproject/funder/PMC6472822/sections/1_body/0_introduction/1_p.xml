<p>Seasonal influenza is an acute contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses that can be easily transmitted from person to person. Influenza viruses circulate worldwide causing annual epidemics with the highest activity during winter seasons in temperate regions and produce an estimated annual attack rate of 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 250 to 500 thousand deaths around the world [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. National surveillance systems monitor the influenza activity through a network of general practitioners (GPs) who report the weekly number of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases among the overall patients [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These traditional surveillance systems usually represent the primary source of information for healthcare officials and policymakers for monitoring influenza epidemics. However, due to the lack of specificity of influenza symptoms, they adopt quantitative indicators (influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory illness (ARI) being the two most common) which are defined at country level, while no defined standard exists at the international level [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One main reason might be that classification of ILI cases in GPs’ reports is usually based on common clinical symptoms observed among patients and, as with any syndromic-based disease surveillance, case definitions of “influenza-like illness” can vary [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They typically include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, nasal congestion, and weakness. Some previous works from hospital-based studies [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] aimed at exploring suitable ILI case symptomatic descriptions but, so far, no unique definition has been widely adopted by the various national surveillance systems worldwide. For this reason, seasonal influenza surveillance in European countries remains rather fragmented. Only in recent years, some state members have adopted the case definition provided by the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) which defines an ILI case as the sudden onset of symptoms with one or more systemic symptoms (fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia) plus one or more respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of European countries still adopts their own clinical case definition to compile seasonal influenza surveillance weekly reports.
