<p>Moreover, to reduce the noise due to low participation rates at the beginning of the data collection of each influenza season, we consider as starting point the first week for which the number of surveys corresponded at least to 5% of the total number of the surveys filled during the week with the highest participation for that season. This refers to the fact that at the beginning of the season, which is a period when the epidemic is still well below the epidemic threshold, the participation (i.e. the number of symptoms surveys) is rather low and therefore the signal to noise ratio can be very low too. Furthermore, we included only one survey per each week—the latest one—if more than one survey was submitted during the same week by the same participant. This exclusion corresponds to a small fraction of discarded surveys, approximately 5% of the total number of surveys; moreover, the distribution of the discarded symptoms and the submission time of the dropped surveys, are homogeneous
