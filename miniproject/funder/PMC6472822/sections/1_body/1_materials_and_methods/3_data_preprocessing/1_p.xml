<p>In general, the inclusion criteria of participants in the data analysis vary depending on the specific aim of the study [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In our case, we included only the individuals registered on the Influenzanet national platforms who filled in at least one Symptoms Questionnaire (hereafter referred to as “survey”) per season. This was done to focus the analysis on participants for which we have some information. We had to necessarily exclude individuals who have registered on the platforms but who have not submitted any symptoms survey during any influenza season. This corresponds to the exclusion of 0.3% of the registered participants.
