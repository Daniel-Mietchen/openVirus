<p>Seasonal influenza is traditionally monitored by national networks of general practitioners (GPs) who report the weekly number of visited patients with influenza-like illness symptoms according to the national ILI case definition.

Therefore, we used the traditional ILI surveillance data to evaluate the performance of our framework developed on the Influenzanet data. In this study, we used the weekly ILI incidence data for 6 influenza seasons, from 2011-2012 to 2016-2017, collected from the ECDC dedicated web page [
