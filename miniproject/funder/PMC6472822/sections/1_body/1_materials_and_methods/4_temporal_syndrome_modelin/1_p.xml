<p>In this section, we describe the methodology employed to extract the latent features from the self-reported symptoms collected by the various Influenzanet platforms of the participating countries. Our approach relies on the assumption that a specific group of self-reported symptoms corresponds to the symptomatic expression of one or more illnesses, hereafter called 
 <italic>syndromes</italic>, circulating among the population sample of Influenzanet. In our study we consider the 18 symptoms presented in the weekly Symptoms Questionnaire plus an additional symptoms-related variable, called “Sudden onset”, referring to the sudden appearance of symptoms, typically over the course of the previous 24 hours (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This totalizes 19 symptom variables that we hereafter designate interchangeably as “symptoms”. The symptoms were treated as binary boolean variables having value 1 if the symptom is present and 0 if the symptom is absent. We then aggregated the reported symptoms across all participants to build a matrix 
 <bold>X</bold> = [
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>], whose elements contain the occurrences of each symptom 
 <italic>j</italic> ∈ {1, ‥, 
 <italic>J</italic>} during each day 
 <italic>i</italic> ∈ {1, ‥, 
 <italic>I</italic>}. In other words, each element of the matrix corresponds to the number of times each symptom has been reported on each day of the influenza seasons under study. The result is a high-dimensional sparse matrix that can be linearly decomposed through a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) technique [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We opted for NMF since its non-negativity constraint offers the advantage of a straightforward interpretation of the results as positive quantities that can then be associated with the initial symptoms. This approach can be considered as a “blind source separation” problem [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] in which neither the sources nor the mixing procedure is known, but only the resulting mixed signals are measured.
