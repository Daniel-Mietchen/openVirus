<p>We applied the aforementioned framework to the data collected by the Influenzanet platforms in nine European countries throughout six influenza seasons (from 2011-2012 to 2016-2017). For each country, we applied the decomposition algorithm to the symptoms’ matrix 
 <bold>X</bold> as represented in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006173.e002">Eq (2)</xref> and, based on the AIC, we obtained the “optimum” number of components, 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>min</italic>
 </sub>, for the decomposition. The daily counts of the emerged components are eventually aggregated weekly to allow the comparison with the weekly incidence reported by the traditional GPs surveillance. Among the 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>min</italic>
 </sub> latent components, i.e. syndromes, extracted for each country, we identified the one that correlates better with the time series reported by the traditional GPs surveillance. In the following, we denote this component as IN_NMF. This component corresponds to the combination of symptoms that more closely represent the ILI time series recorded by the traditional surveillance, and hence, it can be used to build a data-driven, unsupervised ILI case definition, which is the ultimate goal of this study.
