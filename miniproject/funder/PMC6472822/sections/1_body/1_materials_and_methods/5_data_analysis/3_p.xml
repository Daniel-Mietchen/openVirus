<p>Additionally, we explored the predictive power of the proposed methodology in the following way: first, we trained the NMF decomposition framework with Influenzanet data only from 2011 to 2016 and then, we employed the resulting symptom weights to infer the weekly IN_NMF estimates during the 2016-2017 season. To assess the quality of this signal, we evaluated the Pearson correlation of the forecasted IN_NMF time series for 2016-2017 with both the GP time series and the IN_ECDC time series.</p>
