<p>To further evaluate the IN_NMF signal selected for each country, we also computed the Pearson correlation between: (i) the IN_NMF and the time series obtained by applying the ECDC case definition to the Influenzanet data (hereafter called IN_ECDC); (ii) the IN_NMF and the ILI incidence reported by the national surveillance systems per country (hereafter called GP); and (iii) the IN_ECDC and the GP. The reported correlations refer to the time series over the entire period analysed (2011-2017).</p>
