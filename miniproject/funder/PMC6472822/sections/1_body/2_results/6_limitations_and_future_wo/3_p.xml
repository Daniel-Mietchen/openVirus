<p>Moreover, in this work, we have not compared the performance of other machine learning algorithms besides NMF since this would go beyond the scope of this paper. Future work could explore the performance of other methods and clustering algorithms. Among the many algorithmic choices, LDA could be employed in a similar framework, since PLSA is simply a special case of LDA and Faleiros et al. [
