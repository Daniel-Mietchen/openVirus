<p>Other issues could rise from the variable reporting behaviours along the season, individualsâ€™ interpretation of the terms used for surveillance, and the correctness of their self-assessments. Some of these issues have been addressed partially in previous works [

In our approach, we assume that self-reported symptoms are consistent since Influenzanet data have been already proven to be accurate and reliable for ILI surveillance, even without providing any clinical confirmation. However, we are aware that one of the criticisms of online participatory surveillance is the lack of virological confirmation of influenza cases that would instead help to better assess the actual circulation of influenza in the population. To this respect, a pilot study has been developed in the United Kingdom by the national Influenzanet platform, called Flusurvey, which demonstrates that self-swabbing can be applied to an online cohort to conduct virological laboratory testing [
