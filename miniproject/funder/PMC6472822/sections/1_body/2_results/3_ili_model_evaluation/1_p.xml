 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> reports all the Pearson correlations between the different time series as mentioned in the Data Analysis section. For all countries, the correlation between the IN_NMF component and the IN_ECDC is very high, ranging from 0.82 to 0.92 (row (i)), thus showing that the IN_NMF signal captures symptoms highly compatible with those present in the ECDC ILI definition applied to the Influenzanet data. However, by carefully examining rows (ii) and (iii), we note slight variations per country. For the Netherlands, Belgium, and Ireland the ILI incidence reported by the traditional surveillance (GP) was more strongly correlated with the IN_NMF component, than with the ILI incidence obtained by applying the ECDC ILI definition to the Influenzanet data (IN_ECDC). For the United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark, and Portugal, the IN_NMF components perform equally well as the IN_ECDC. For Italy and France, the IN_NMF component had a slightly lower correlation (about 11% and 7% less respectively) with the traditional surveillance data (GP) than the IN_ECDC. Ireland is the only country for which we obtain a low correlation between the traditional surveillance data (GP) and both the IN_NMF and IN_ECDC, probably due to the limited number of participants in Influenzanet (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006173.s001">S1 Table</xref> in the supporting information). Despite this, the IN_NMF performs much better than the IN_ECDC in capturing the ILI incidence trend in Ireland (0.38 vs 0.23). This variation in performance is not an issue for the goal of this work since our focus is on paving the way towards a common cross-country ILI definition rather than finding the perfect signal that correlates best with the traditional national surveillance. Also, the loss in performance of IN_NMF vs GP with respect to IN_ECDC vs GP for Italy and France is only a small percentage. One might argue that, since it has been observed that people tend to go to the doctor if their symptoms are more severe or if the duration of the disease is longer [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], the high correlation between the IN_NMF time series and the GP time series might be attributable to the fact that participatory surveillance only captures individuals with perceived severe symptoms, who did visit a doctor for their illness. Unfortunately, we cannot assess the severity of self-reported symptoms, but we can assess the fraction of participants who claimed they have visited a healthcare provider for their symptoms and, in line with previous studies, we found that the vast majority of participants did not seek medical consultation. Specifically, the percentages of participants who did seek medical consultation per country are: NL 12%, BE 22%, IT 23%, FR 26%, UK 14%, ES 17%, PT 17%, DK 11%, IE 16%.
