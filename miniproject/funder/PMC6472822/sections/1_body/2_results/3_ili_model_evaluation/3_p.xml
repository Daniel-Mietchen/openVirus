<p>Finally, in order to assess the impact of the exclusion criterion for which we do not take into account duplicate reports from the same individual in a single week, we have determined the mean percentage of the symptoms discarded per country: NL 0.04%, BE 0.03%, IT 0.09%, FR 0.06%, UK 0.16%, ES 0.05%, PT 0.12%, DK 0.03%, IE 0.10%. Indeed, the duplicate report exclusion corresponds to a small number of symptoms discarded each week and the distribution of all discarded symptoms is homogeneous.</p>
