<p>Moreover, to investigate the performance of our framework with respect to healthcare seeking behaviour, we employed two different approaches. First, we trained our framework only with the subset of self-reported symptoms from participants who consulted a medical doctor for their symptoms, obtaining the following Pearson correlations with the GP time series: NL 0.83, BE 0.82, IT 0.87, FR 0.92, UK 0.88, ES 0.82, PT 0.82, DK 0.69, IE 0.51. Secondly, we trained our framework only with the subset of self-reported symptoms from participants who did not consult a medical doctor for their symptoms, obtaining the following Pearson correlations: NL 0.77, BE 0.59, IT 0.69, FR 0.78, UK 0.72, ES 0.54, PT 0.48, DK 0.64, IE 0.29. We notice that since by default our framework selects as ILI component the one that best correlates with the official surveillance, the IN_NMF signal emerged represents better the data reported by the official surveillance systems. Unsurprisingly, the correlations are higher when we compare the same population of individuals who did seek medical consultation for their illness. On the other hand, it is of extreme importance that our framework is capable of extracting a relevant signal in the latter case since the population of individuals who do not seek healthcare is complementary to the one depicted by the official surveillance data.</p>
