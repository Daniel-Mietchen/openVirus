<p>In the right panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006173.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the break-down of symptoms for each country’s IN_NMF component is expressed in terms of probabilistic contributions, denoted as 
 <italic>p</italic>(
 <italic>j</italic>|
 <italic>k</italic>), as described in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006173.e006">Eq (6)</xref>. In terms of symptoms’ composition, IN_NMF appears to be stable across the various countries and consistent with the expected set of symptoms clinically associated with ILI. The top contributing symptoms are fever, chills and feeling tired, often reported in combination with a sudden onset of symptoms. Notably, each of these top three symptoms contributes for about 10% or more of the overall component composition. This is consistent across all the nine countries and it is the most important result of this study since it represents the basis towards the development of a common ILI definition. Small heterogeneities in the component composition across countries are most likely due to differences in the ILI case definitions used by sentinel doctors in each country which are reflected in the data that we use as ground truth. In principle, this issue might be overcome by using seroprevalence data as ground truth.
