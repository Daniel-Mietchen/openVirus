<p>For the sake of comparison, we have examined how our framework performs with respect to other similar approaches. For example, Goldstein et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] have used two inference methods to estimate incidence curves from symptoms surveillance data. The first method essentially assumes that the distribution of symptoms is known. In our case, we have no such assumption; instead, we extract the symptoms and their probabilistic distribution from the observed data without making any a priori assumption on the distribution of symptoms. The second inference method proposed by Goldstein et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] is closer to our framework and falls under the umbrella of the term “blind source separation”. The Non-negative Matrix Factorization can be formulated as an expectation-maximization problem [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The difference with our approach is that they assume as an initial condition that the expected weekly incidence is equal to 1 for each infection in their survey sample. Their approach is sensitive to the ratio of flu/non-flu distribution while NMF manages to overcome this problem.
