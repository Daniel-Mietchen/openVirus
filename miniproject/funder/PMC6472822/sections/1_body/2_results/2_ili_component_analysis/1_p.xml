<p>In the left panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006173.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the IN_NMF component for each country is shown in comparison to the ILI signal as recorded by the traditional surveillance, GP. To allow for visual comparison, the IN_NMF time series has been rescaled on the GP time series with a fixed scaling factor. Specifically, the IN_NMF has been rescaled on the highest peak among all the GP time series for each country, hence the lower peak of the IN_NMF for the other peaks of the GP time series. Consequently, the performance of the selected ILI component cannot be evaluated in terms of amplitude and error with respect to the peak estimate.
