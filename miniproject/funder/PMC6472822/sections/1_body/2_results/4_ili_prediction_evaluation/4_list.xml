  <p>We trained a model following our NMF framework on the shuffled counts of symptoms observed among the users during the seasons of 2011-2016. Then, the resulting model was employed to infer the IN_NMF trend of the Influenzanet data collected in 2016-2017. Despite being trained on randomly shuffled data, the selected ILI component correlates well with the incidence estimated by sentinel doctors, but the combinations of symptoms in the syndrome are rather inconsistent (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006173.s009">S7 Fig</xref> in Supporting Information). Pearson correlations per country are: BE 0.81, DK 0.76, ES 0.74, FR 0.91, IE 0.66, IT 0.85, NL 0.85, PT 0.88, UK 0.61.

  <p>We trained a model following our NMF framework on the data from seasons 2011-2012 to 2015-2016, and then, we used it to predict the ILI component of season 2016-2017, randomly shuffling the resulting symptoms. In this case, the Pearson correlations are extremely low: BE 0.25, DK 0.08, ES -0.04, FR 0.25, IE 0.03, IT -0.15, NL 0.30, PT 0.07, UK 0.13. This provides us with a measure of how worse our predictions become with a random combination of symptoms.</p>
