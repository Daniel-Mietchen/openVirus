<p>The results of the prediction analysis described in the Data Analysis section are shown in

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (iv) reports the correlations of the forecasted IN_NMF time series and the national surveillance for the season 2016-2017 (GP). The correlation between the two time series is good for all the countries, ranging from 0.60 to 0.85. In supplementary information we depict the results of the prediction analysis described in the Data Analysis section. As already stated above, for the sake of visual comparison, the IN_NMF time series has been rescaled to the highest peak of the GP time series for each country, hence the lower peak for the other peaks. Consequently, the two time series cannot be evaluated in terms of amplitude and error.
