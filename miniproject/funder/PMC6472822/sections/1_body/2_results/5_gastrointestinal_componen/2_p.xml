<p>In the right panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006173.g002">Fig 2</xref> we depict the probabilistic contribution of each symptom to the IN_Gastro syndrome. Emerging symptoms, in this case, include also stomach ache, diarrhoea, and vomiting, which are in line with our expectations. Even if respiratory symptoms like runny nose or sneezing are also present, the contribution of fever and chills (which were the main contributors to the IN_NMF signal) is almost negligible. This suggests a rather good capability of our framework in discriminating between different syndromes. Despite limitations of the data availability, these preliminary findings indicate that the latent components of the decomposition, not related to ILI, may express syndromes related to allergies, common-cold or gastroenteritis. Understandably, additional adequate surveillance data are required to make a firm statement and reach a robust interpretation of the syndromes.
