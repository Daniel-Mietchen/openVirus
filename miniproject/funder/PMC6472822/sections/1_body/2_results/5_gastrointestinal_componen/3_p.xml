<p>Previous works have also focused on detecting gastrointestinal symptoms circulating among the general population through digital unstructured data [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006173.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] from participatory surveillance, big data, such as Twitter, as well as national pharmacy sales data. These examples show how crowdsourced digital health-related data, as well as passive digital traces generated on the web by individuals from the general population, can complement traditional and syndromic surveillance systems to estimate the circulation of gastrointestinal syndromes. This is particularly important because only a fraction (about a third) of individuals who reported gastrointestinal symptoms in France also declared that they visited a doctor. The NMF framework applied to the subset of data from participants who did not visit a doctor for their symptoms selected a component whose correlation with official surveillance data is 0.67 (with respect to a correlation of 0.66 when using all the data). This shows that people tend to visit a doctor rarely and probably only if their symptoms are severe. The NMF framework is capable of providing robust results even if we focus the analysis only on those individuals who did not visit a doctor, for which we can safely assume that their symptoms were not severe.
