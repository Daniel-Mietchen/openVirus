<p>In the left panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006173.g002">Fig 2</xref>, we show the time series for the incidence of acute diarrhoea episodes (GP_Gastro) as detected by the official national surveillance in France, and the time series of the syndrome identified by our framework (IN_Gastro). The Pearson correlation between the extracted syndrome and the official surveillance data is 0.66.
