 <p>This study suggests how web-based surveillance data can provide an epidemiological signal capable of detecting the temporal trends of influenza-like illness without relying on a specific case definition. The proposed framework was able to forecast quite accurately the ILI trend of the forthcoming influenza season based only on the available information of the previous years. Moreover, to broaden the scope of our approach, we applied it to the detection of gastrointestinal syndromes. We evaluated the approach against the traditional surveillance data and despite the limited amount of data, the gastrointestinal trend was successfully detected. The result is a near-real-time flexible surveillance and prediction tool that is not constrained by any disease case definition.</p>
