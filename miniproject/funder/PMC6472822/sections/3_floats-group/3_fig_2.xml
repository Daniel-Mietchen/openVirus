  <title>Composition of the IN_Gastro component and comparison with the incidence of acute diarrhoea detected by the national surveillance data (GP_Gastro) for France.</title>
  <p>Left panel: Time series comparison between the IN_Gastro component and the incidence of acute diarrhoea detected by the national surveillance data (GP_Gastro) for France. To allow for an easier visual inspection the depicted IN_Gastro syndrome is rescaled by a fixed factor on the respective GP_Gastro incidence. On the y-axis, the sample size of the GP incidence is reported. Right panel: symptomatic contribution of the automatically selected IN_Gastro component. The bars are coloured for readability purposes only.</p>
