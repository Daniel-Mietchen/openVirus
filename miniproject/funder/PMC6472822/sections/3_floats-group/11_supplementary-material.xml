  <title>Assessment of the modelâ€™s robustness in forecasting.</title>
  <p>Left panel: qualitative comparison between the forecasted IN_NMF and the national surveillance incidence (GP) time series. To allow for easier visual inspection, the depicted IN_NMF syndromes are rescaled by a fixed factor to the respective GP incidence. On the y-axis, the sample size of the GP incidence is reported. Right panel: contribution of each symptom to the automatically selected IN_NMF component. The bars are coloured for readability purposes only.</p>
