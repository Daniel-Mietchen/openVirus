  <title>Assessment of the model’s robustness in forecasting with randomly shuffled symptoms.</title>
  <p>Left panel: qualitative comparison between the forecasted IN_NMF—that emerges if we test our model on a 
   <bold>randomly shuffled</bold> matrix of symptoms—and the national surveillance incidence (GP) time series. To allow for an easier visual inspection the depicted IN_NMF syndromes are rescaled by a fixed factor to the respective GP incidence. On the y-axis, the sample size of the GP incidence is reported. Right panel: contribution of each symptom to the automatically selected IN_NMF component. The bars are coloured for readability purposes only.
