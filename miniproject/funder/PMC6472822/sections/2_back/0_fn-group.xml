      <sup>1</sup>Throughout this study we employ the term 
      <italic>latent</italic> as used in computer science, i.e. referring to variables that are hidden, not directly observed, but rather inferred through a mathematical model. There is no reference to the medical use of the term that usually indicates an asymptomatic infection.
