<p>On a structural level, reservations towards biomedical research in low-resourced settings in Sub-Saharan Africa that involves sample taking (usually blood) are not new and have been reported from several studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008327.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008327.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008327.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In a study by Newton et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008327.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] blood drawn from infants in Ghana led to rumors that it would be used for transfusions for elderly people. These perceptions led to substantial loss to follow up. Similarly, in a study by Nchito et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008327.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in Zambia loss to follow up was partly attributed to the fear of a rumor of blood thefts. Perceptions on body fluids and sample taking can influence decisions of participants to take part in studies and to retain in a study. Yet in the specific cohort study here evaluated, study retention was close to 100%, meaning that especially for some men they remained over a long follow-up time (approaching two years). Factors that have influenced the high retention in the cohort, based on our findings, seem to have been the perceptions of a very high level of trust in the confidential handling of all results, the interest and engagement in knowing ones status as body fluid/semen positive or negative, and the professionalism paired with in-depth community belonging of staff involved. The targeted pre- and post- test counseling offered, as well as the fact that actual sampling of blood was reduced to a minimum, can also have influenced retention positively.
