<p>Participants had very creative ways in re-gaining “control” over their body fluids and showing agency. Some male participants were not able or, on rare occasions, not willing to provide intimate sampling on several occasions. This was interpreted by study staff as either post-EVD related impotency or as a form of social resistance. In some instances staff suspected several male study participants to put gel into test tubes. The behavior was said by staff to have caused disturbances during the study process and was seen by some as abusing a system that was built on mutual trust. Still, the actual circumstances seem to tell another story, where missing samples for this reason was uncommon. Again, on a symbolic level very similar accusations are known from Saethre and Stadler [

Some who were called “gel-dumpers” were suspected to only pretend the vaginal application in order to receive the remuneration. Gel dumping was considered “irresponsible because it endangered the scientific process” (p. 110).
