 <p>After the whole process was explained to us and what they will be taking from us I really felt bad and I didn’t want to reject my elders that’s why I participated in the study. And until it finished I did not encounter any problem. Former SLEVP study participant IDI, female</p>
 <p>The first time I came on this study I did not feel good especially the woman side. To be honest with you I was so much adamant with the nurse, but she encouraged me and even removed her pant for me as a way to give me more courage. I gave them the different samples they needed from me. Also the second time again when I came I was still adamant to give the samples. They still counseled me and I gave them the sample. The last time there was no problem between us because I realized that they were trying to help me know my status. Former SLEVP study participant FGD, female group</p>
