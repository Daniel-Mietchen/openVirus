<p>Several participants mentioned rumors they heard on the study that the blood collected would be sold, that they “would make money out of our fluids” or that body fluids would be kept for a future epidemic. Some said that they were afraid that “the white people wanted to use us” and “sell our lives”. Not all believed in these rumors but clearly there was quite some anxiety among the participants initially. Study staff related that they employed different strategies to overcome those concerns: they talked to the survivors, the community elders and other representatives and tried to convince them on the good intentions of the study and that they would themselves profit from knowing their status.

Study staff also mentioned that the very fact that survivors were employed as liaison officers was a trust building measure.</p>
