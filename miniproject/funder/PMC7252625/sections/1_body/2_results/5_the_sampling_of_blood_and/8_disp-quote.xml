 <p>What I want to say is about the blood collection. It is number one because every time we came was blood, every time we came was blood. Some of us were afraid because we did not know where our blood was taken to. (â€¦) We were getting rumors that a ship was taking our blood away. For some of us we prayed that wherever our blood was taken to with negative intent let our blood be dark. Former SLEVP study participant FGD, female group</p>
 <p>I was thinking before when they came and collect our sperm, what are they doing with it? That what I was thinking. Where are they going with them? Because we are knowing the result but where are they going with them? Former SLEVP study participant IDI, male</p>
