  <title>Replication kinetics in MDCK cells of recombinant influenza A and B viruses carrying a single NA amino acid substitution.</title>
  <p>MDCK cells were infected with recombinant influenza A and B viruses at an MOI of 1 (A, C) or 0.001 (B, D). Virus titers were determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assays in MDCK cells after incubation for 72 h at 35°C (for influenza A viruses) or 33°C (for influenza B viruses). Each data point represents the mean virus titer (log
   <sub>10</sub>TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL) ± the SD from three independent experiments. *
