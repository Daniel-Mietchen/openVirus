  <title>The NA thermostability of the recombinant influenza A and B viruses carrying a single NA substitution.</title>
  <p>Influenza A/PR8 (A, B) and B/YAM (C, D) viruses were incubated for 15 or 30 min at the indicated temperatures. Residual NA enzyme activity was assayed and is presented as a percentage of the NA activity at 4°C (unheated). The bars represent the mean of the relative NA activity ± SD for different temperatures from three experiments. *
