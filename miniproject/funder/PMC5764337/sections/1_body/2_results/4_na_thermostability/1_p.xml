<p>NA amino acid substitutions can contribute to NA protein stability [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, we determined the thermostability of mutant NAs by measuring the NA activity of the recombinant viruses after 15 and 30 min of incubation at different temperatures. For recombinant influenza A viruses, the NA activity of the A/PR8-I222V virus was stable at 33째C to 55째C, whereas the A/PR8-S331G and A/PR8-S331R viruses showed lower activity at 55째C (
