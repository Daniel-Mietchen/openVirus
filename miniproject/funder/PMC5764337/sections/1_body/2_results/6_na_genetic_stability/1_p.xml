<p>To determine whether NA substitutions introduced into the A/PR8 and B/YAM genetic backgrounds could be stably maintained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the NA genes were amplified from viruses before and after three passages in MDCK cells, and the NA sequences were determined. The I222V, S331G, and S331R NA substitutions were genetically stable in NA proteins on the genetic background of the A/PR8 virus. A diverse pattern was observed for influenza B viruses. The A395T and A395D substitutions were genetically stable and were maintained unchanged during three passages, whereas the D342S and A395V substitutions were unstable and the NAs reverted to WT after three passages (
