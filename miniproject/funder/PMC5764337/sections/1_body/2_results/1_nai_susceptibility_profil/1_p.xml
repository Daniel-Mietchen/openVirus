<p>We used NA inhibition assays to determine the NAI susceptibility profiles of 7:1 recombinant influenza A and B viruses carrying single NA amino acid substitutions (

 <sub>50</sub> value of the A/PR8-WT virus, the fold changes in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of recombinant influenza A viruses were &gt; 10-fold. These results demonstrated that A/PR8 viruses carrying NA from A(H3N2) virus with single I222V, S331R, or S331G NA substitutions were susceptible to NAIs. For the recombinant B/YAM viruses, the fold changes in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were &gt; 5-fold when compared to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the B/BR/60/08 virus. These results revealed that B/YAM viruses carrying NAs from currently circulating influenza B viruses with single D342S, A395T, A395V, or A395D NA substitutions were susceptible to NAIs.
