<p>We investigated the effect of NA amino acid substitutions on the NA activity of 7:1 recombinant influenza A and B viruses by using a modified fluorescence-based assay. The NA enzyme sialidase activity was standardized according to the amount of infectious virus (per 1 log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) and expressed as the quantity of 4-MU (in μg) (

 <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.01, respectively), whereas the I222V NA substitution slightly increased the NA activity (

 <italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.01). The A395D substitution decreased the NA activity of recombinant B/YAM virus, whereas the A395V NA substitution increased the NA activity relative to that of the B/BR/60/08 virus (

 </bold>). Thus, the S331G substitution had the greatest impact on the NA activity of recombinant A/PR8 viruses, followed by the S331R substitution, and the D342S and A395T substitutions had the greatest effect on the NA activity of recombinant B/YAM viruses.
