<p>To evaluate the fitness 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> of recombinant influenza A and B viruses carrying NA amino acid substitutions, we studied their replication capacity in MDCK cells. At 6 and 12 h post-infection (hpi), the growth of A/PR8-I222V virus was similar to that of A/PR8-WT, but the A/PR8-S331G and A/PR8-S331R virus yields were significantly lower (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0190877.g002">Fig 2D</xref>
 </bold>). At 72 hpi, the viral titers of the recombinant influenza B viruses were 4.2 and 5.2 log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL. These results demonstrated that the NA substitutions S331G and S331R (on an A/PR8 background) and D342S, A395T, A395V, and A395D (on a B/YAM background) reduced the enzyme activity and thermostability of the NA. Although replication ability of recombinant influenza A and B viruses was heterogeneous at early time points, they showed at least equivalent yields as A/PR8-WT and B/BR/60/08 viruses at later time points. However, using B/BR/60/08 instead of the recombinant B/YAM virus with the wild-type NA is a caveat of this comparison.
