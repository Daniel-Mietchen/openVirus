<p>The influenza neuraminidase (NA) is a tetrameric type II integral membrane protein with sialidase activity that is responsible for releasing newly produced viral particles from virus-infected cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on their sequences, the NA genes of influenza viruses are classified as group 1 (N1, N4, N5, and N8), group 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, N9) and influenza B NA [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In influenza A and B viruses, the NA active site is formed by highly conserved framework (E119, R156, W178, S179, D/N198, I222, E227, H274, E277, N294, and E425 [in N2 numbering]) and catalytic (R118, D151, R152, R224, E276, R292, R371, and Y406) residues [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. NA amino acid substitutions located within or in close proximity to the NA active site can result in reduced inhibition of influenza viruses by NAIs and may affect the NA enzymatic properties, replication efficiency, transmissibility, and fitness of the virus

 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The various NA-subtype specific substitutions arise as a result of selection by different NAIs, and can be detected with different frequencies in clinical samples or in surveillance studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although substitutions have been reported at novel residues in NAs, the effect of these substitutions on the NAI susceptibility of viruses with different genetic backgrounds is largely undetermined. Substitutions at residue 222 (T/V/M/L) conferred reduced susceptibility to NAIs and were found in seasonal A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, and highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N1) viruses. I222T/V NA substitutions were reported to cause reduced susceptibility of A(H5N1) viruses to NAIs, with 60- to 105-fold higher IC
 <sub>50</sub>s to oseltamivir when compared to the wild-type NAs [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Antiviral surveillance studies identified novel NA substitutions (S331R in influenza A(H3N2) viruses; D342S and A395E in influenza B viruses) that were associated with reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir (as indicated by higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for these compounds) [

 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These substitutions were located outside the NA active site [

 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 variant containing double NA substitution at residues I427T/Q313R outside the NA active site had decreased NAI susceptibility, with altered NA properties and viral fitness [
