<p>Previously, we reported substitutions at residues 222 and 331 in the NA of influenza A(H3N2) viruses and at residues 342 and 395 in that of influenza B viruses circulating in Thailand [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, the effect of these NA substitutions on the susceptibility to NAIs, the enzymatic properties, and the fitness of the viruses were not determined. Here, we applied reverse genetics and generated recombinant influenza A and B viruses possessing either wild-type (WT) NA or an NA with a single I222V, S331G, or S331R substitution [in influenza A(H3N2) viruses] or a single S342S, A395T, A395V, or A395S substitution [in influenza B viruses].We then used these recombinant viruses to study the properties (activity, enzyme kinetic, thermostability) of their NAs, their susceptibility to NAIs, their replication kinetics, and the genetic stability of the NA substitutions during passages in MDCK cells.
