<p>Influenza viral RNA was extracted using a RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, CA). The full-length NA genes (numbering is based on an alignment of NAs from the following reference strains: A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Yamanashi/166/1998 [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) of influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses were amplified by one-step RT-PCR with primers previously described for the NA segments of influenza A [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and B [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] viruses. PCR products were gel-purified (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen) and then digested with

 <italic>Bsm</italic>BI [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Boston, MA). The plasmid vectors were digested with
