<p>Plasmids were transformed into One Shot chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and positive clones were inoculated into Terrific Broth medium containing ampicillin. The positive clones were purified using HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi Kits (Qiagen, CA), and the plasmid DNA concentrations were determined by both UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm and analysis on agarose gels. The constructed plasmids were sequenced to ensure their identity with the field strains.</p>
