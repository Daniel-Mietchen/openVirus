<p>Recombinant (7:1) influenza viruses carrying NAs of influenza A(H3N2) or B viruses circulating in Thailand (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0190877.t001">Table 1</xref>) were generated on a homogenous genetic background of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (A/PR8) and B/Yamanashi/166/1998 (B/YAM) influenza viruses, respectively. The A/PR8-WT was a 7:1 reassortant with the N2 NA of A/Thailand/CU-B11870/2015 in a background of A/PR8 (

 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The NA gene segment was amplified from the extracted viral RNA of rescued viruses by using one-step RT-PCR. The NAs of recombinant viruses were sequenced by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, using BigDye Terminator (version 3) chemistry and synthetic oligonucleotides. Samples were analyzed on Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA analyzers. The NA sequences were analyzed with SeqMan software (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Recombinant viruses were grown in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Marshall Durbin, Birmingham, AL) for 72 h at 35°C (for influenza A viruses) or 33°C (for influenza B viruses). The virus-containing allantoic fluid was stored at −80°C until use. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of each recombinant influenza virus was determined in MDCK cells incubated for 72 h at 35°C (for influenza A viruses) or 33°C (for influenza B viruses). The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by the Reed-Muench method [
