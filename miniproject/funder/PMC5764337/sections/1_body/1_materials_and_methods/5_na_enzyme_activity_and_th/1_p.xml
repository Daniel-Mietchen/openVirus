<p>The NA activity of recombinant viruses was measured by a fluorometric assay with MUNANA substrate as described above [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The NA activity was normalized against the amount of infectious virus and presented as the quantity of 4-MU (in μg) formed per 1 log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of the virus. The thermostability of the NA was determined by incubating viruses in a gradient thermocycler at 33, 37, 45, or 55°C for 15 or 30 min, then all viruses were brought to room temperature, and NA activity was subsequently measured [

 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The NA activity was determined and expressed as a percentage of the NA activity of the virus at 4°C (unheated). The NA activity of each virus was calculated based on the mean of triplicate assays.
