<p>Multi-step growth curves were determined for each recombinant influenza virus in MDCK cells. Confluent cell monolayers were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 0.001 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell. The supernatant was collected at 6, 12, and 24 h (for an MOI of 1 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell) and at 24, 48, and 72 h (for an MOI of 0.001 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell) after virus inoculation and stored at −70°C until use. Virus titers were determined by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assays in MDCK cells.
