<p>The enzyme kinetics (

 <sub>max</sub> and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub>) of the NAs of recombinant influenza A and B viruses with a single NA amino acid substitution were determined as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. First, the optimum dilution of recombinant virus to assess NA kinetic properties was determined. Briefly, 2-fold virus dilutions were incubated with the MUNANA substrate (100 μM), and NA activity was measured every 60 s for 60 min to identify virus dilution within a linear range of the curve that converts ≤ 15% of the total amount of MUNANA substrate and signal to noise ration &gt; 10 across most of time course. We then measured the NA enzyme kinetics at pH 6.5 with enzyme buffer and a final concentration of MUNANA substrate ranging from 0.98 to 1000 μM. The reaction was monitored at 37°C in a total volume of 150 μL, and the fluorescence signal was detected every 60 s for 60 min using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The MUNANA substrate affinity (

 <sub>max</sub>) values were calculated by fitting appropriate Michaelis-Menten equations to the data by using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 5 software.
