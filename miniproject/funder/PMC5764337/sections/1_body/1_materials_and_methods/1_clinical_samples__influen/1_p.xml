Substitution-encoding NA gene sequences were amplified from these samples, which were obtained from the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand as part of the influenza surveillance program. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of Medicine at Chulalongkorn University (IRB No. 581/58). The study was conducted according to the ethical principles regarding human experimentation set out in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the IRB waived the need for consent because the samples were de-identified and anonymous.
