<p>There were a few limitations in this study. As we could not generate a recombinant B/YAM virus with WT NA protein by using reverse genetics, we used the B/BR/60/08 virus, which is genetically similar to viruses circulating in Thailand, and compared the NA enzymatic properties and viral replication efficiency 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, our results require validation using the B/YAM-WT NA virus. NAs from influenza A(H3N2) PCR-positive samples with I222V, S331G, and S331R NA substitutions were generated in the A/PR8 (H1N1) backbone. The replication efficiency of these viruses in MDCK cells may differ from that of natural isolates because of the effect of the HA-NA balance [

 <sub>50</sub> does not account for defective/non-infectious virions in the virus preparations, which may be enzymatically active. NA content can be reliably standardized in purified NA proteins; however, protein production on this scale, and when evaluating numerous viruses/proteins, is not readily achievable.
