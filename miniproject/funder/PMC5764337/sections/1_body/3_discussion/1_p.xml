<p>In this study, we investigated the effect of novel NA amino acid substitutions on the NAI susceptibility, NA enzymatic properties, and replication capacity of influenza viruses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. We generated recombinant (7:1) influenza A and B viruses containing the NA glycoprotein from viruses currently circulating in Thailand on the homogeneous genetic background of A/PR8 and B/YAM viruses for the recombinant influenza A and B viruses, respectively. The conserved I222 framework residue in the NA of influenza virus provides support to the catalytic residues [

In our study, the A/PR8-I222V virus was susceptible to NAIs in a phenotypic NA inhibition assay and possessed slightly increased NA enzymatic activity. It was previously reported that an influenza A(H3N2) virus with a single I222V NA amino acid substitution was susceptible to oseltamivir and possessed slightly higher NA enzymatic activity as compared to WT virus [

Our data revealed that recombinant A/PR8-I222V virus has only a minor effect on the NA enzymatic properties and virus replication efficiency in MDCK cells. However, the I222V NA substitution has a compensatory effect on the influenza A(H3N2) virus carrying E119V, and the presence of these two substitutions resulted in partially improved viral fitness in cell culture and resistance to oseltamivir [
