<p>Regarding the S331G/R, D342S, and A395T/D/V NA amino acid substitutions, these are found outside the NA active site, and viruses with these substitutions showed normal inhibition by NAIs. The S331G and S331R substitutions affected the kinetic properties of the NA enzyme, changing its binding affinity (

 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> of the A/PR8-S331G and A/PR8-S331R virus NAs was nearly double that of the A/PR8-WT NA, demonstrating the compensatory effect as reflected in the lower replication capacity of viruses carrying S331G and S331R substitutions when compared to viruses with WT or I222V NAs. The significant decrease in NA activity and the increased 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> value demonstrated that S331G and S331R NA substitutions are deleterious to NA functions. The NA activity of the A/PR8-S331G and A/PR8-S331R viruses was decreased, and their viral titers in MDCK cells were lower than those of the WT virus at 6 and 12 hpi. The A/PR8-S331G and A/PR8-S331R viruses were characterized by a loss of NA activity at higher temperature (55°C), whereas PR8-WT and A/PR8-I222V viruses did not lose their NA activity. These data indicate that the viral replication capacity

 <xref rid="pone.0190877.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The B/YAM-D342S, B/YAM-A395T, and B/YAM-A395V viruses showed increased NA activity, whereas their 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> and 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> values decreased. These data suggest that there is an inverse relationship between NA activity and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>m</sub> and 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> values and that these amino acid substitutions are beneficial to NA functions. Moreover, B/YAM-D342S, B/YAM-A395T, and B/YAM-A395V viruses gave significantly higher viral yields at 48 hpi in MDCK cells, as compared to B/BR/60/08 virus. At higher temperature (55°C), the NA activity of recombinant influenza A viruses carrying NA substitutions was more stable than that of influenza B viruses. The A395V and D342S NA substitutions on the B/YAM background were unstable, and the NAs reverted to WT after three passages
