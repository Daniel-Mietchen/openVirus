<p>In conclusion, the recombinant influenza A and B viruses containing different NA substitutions located outside the NA active site exhibited normal inhibition by NAIs but differed in their NA enzymatic properties and their replication capacity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Continuous influenza antiviral surveillance is important for the identification of molecular markers of antiviral resistance and the characterization of NA enzyme functions and viral fitness.
