<p>In recent years, outbreaks of respiratory tract infections caused by HAdV have occurred frequently in China, and clusters of severe or fatal cases have appeared in some areas [

To guide medical institutions and local CDCs in the detection, reporting, investigation, and elimination of outbreaks of adenoviral respiratory infections, China issued a document, titled “Technical guidelines for the prevention and control of human adenovirus respiratory tract infection”, in August 2019. Based on our findings, we suggest that a national HAdV surveillance system should be established as soon as possible to better define epidemic patterns of adenoviral respiratory infections, monitor HAdV outbreaks in real time in China, and clarify the genetic characteristics of HAdVs currently circulating in China. Such an approach would facilitate the development of effective preventive and infection-control interventions for adenovirus infection.
