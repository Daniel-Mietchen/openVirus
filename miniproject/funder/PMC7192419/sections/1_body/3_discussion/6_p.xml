<p>We also identified subtype 3 virus from a vaccine (1950s) and two viruses (1960s and 1988) isolated in the USA based on the penton gene and supported by a high bootstrap value. Further amino acid sequence analysis of the three marker genes evaluated in this study indicated that all HAdV-7 viruses shared similar variation sites within subtypes for the three genes, further confirming the evolutionary independence of the subtypes. The nucleotide diversity of the penton base gene was also found for HAdV-C viruses [
