<p>In this study, we were interested in one strain (BJ/CHN/2018) isolated from China in 2018. We found that this strain had nine unique variations in the fiber knob region, which has receptor-binding activity and thus mediates primary interactions with host cells, including cell tropism. Variations in this region may affect the pathogenicity of the virus [
