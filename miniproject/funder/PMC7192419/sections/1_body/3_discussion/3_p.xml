<p>To explore the genomic variability of HAdV-7, REA is commonly used for genotyping worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, because of identification of new recombinant HAdVs (HAdV53â€“103) in recent years, genotyping based on only a few restriction sites can lead to misclassification of the virus strain. Therefore, as recommended by an international HAdV working group, the sequences of at least three target genes, including penton base, hexon, and fiber genes, should be used for preliminary genotyping, and determination of the whole genome sequence is also necessary if a potential new recombinant virus is identified (
