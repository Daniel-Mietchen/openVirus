<p>Compared with other members within species B, phylogenetic analysis of penton base and hexon genes indicated that HAdV-7 had a close genetic relationship with HAdV-3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232092.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For the penton base gene, because the HAdV-3 strain isolated in China in 2005 (strain Guangzhou01, DQ099432) and the HAdV-3 prototype strain isolated in 1954 (strain GB, AY599834) were closer to subtypes 2 and 3, respectively, the genetic distance between them was less than 0.8%. For the hexon gene, both HAdV-3 strains were closer to subtype 1, and the genetic distance between them was 3.4%. This result indicated that HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 may have originated from a common ancestor.
