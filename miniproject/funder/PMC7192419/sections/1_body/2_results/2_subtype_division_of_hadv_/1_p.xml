<p>For genetic analysis of 69 HAdV-7 strains isolated during 2012â€“2015 in this study, the complete sequences of penton base, hexon, and fiber genes were amplified by PCR. The sequences of the three genes were similar among different strains (&lt; 0.4% difference) or identical; 18 HAdV-7 strains were selected as representative viruses for further analysis (
