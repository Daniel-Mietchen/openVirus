<p>The 51 penton base sequences exhibited more heterogeneity than hexon and fiber genes and featured three genetic lineages with a bootstrap value of greater than 94%. An additional genetic group (subtype 3) including the HAdV-7 vaccine strain from USA and two USA strains isolated in the 1960s and in 1988, was also identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232092.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The genetic distances between the three subtypes were 0.7% (subtypes 1 and 2) and 1.7% (subtypes 2 and 3, subtypes 1 and 3; 
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). All mean genetic distances within subtypes of penton base, hexon, and fiber genes were less than 0.1%, indicating that the three gene sequences in HAdV-7 were well conserved across the subtypes, but with relatively higher divergence between subtypes.
