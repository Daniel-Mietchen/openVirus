<p>Because subtype 2 was the predominant subtype worldwide since the 1950s, its evolutionary rate was estimated based on three genes. We detected different evolutionary rates for different genes. Penton base (9.52 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> substitutions/site/year; 95% HPD: 2.79 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>–1.71 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) had a faster evolutionary rate than hexon (2.27 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> substitutions/site/year; 95% HPD: 9.80 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>–3.66 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) and fiber genes (7.58 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> substitutions/site/year; 95% HPD: 3.34 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>–1.25 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>).
