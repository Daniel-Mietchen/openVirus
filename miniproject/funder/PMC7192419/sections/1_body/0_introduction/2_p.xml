<p>HAdV is a highly contagious pathogen that can cause a variety of diseases owing to variations in tissue tropism and virulence. Several genotypes of HAdV, including species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, -14, -16, -21, -50, -55), species C (HAdV-1, -2, -5, -6), and species E (HAdV-4), have tropism for the respiratory tract and are commonly associated with adenoviral respiratory infections [
