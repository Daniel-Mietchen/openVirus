<p>Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis within each dataset were conducted using MEGA version 6.0. To ensure the accuracy of the results, both maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees were generated and tested by the bootstrap method with 1000 replications. Bootstrap values greater than 80% were considered strong support for the grouping. The similarity between sequences within each gene was evaluated using BioEdit version 7.1.7. The evolutionary rate for HAdV-7 was estimated with a coalescent-based Bayesian method implemented in BEAST version 1.7.4 (
