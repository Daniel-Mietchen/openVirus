<p>According to the FRS program, surveillance provinces collected respiratory specimens, including nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and sputum, from outpatients and hospitalized patients meeting the case definition [
 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The samples were then transported to the IVDC of China CDC under the cold chain for further identification. During 2012–2015, 5419 patients were enrolled, and their clinical specimens were collected. Pathogenic screening of common respiratory viruses was performed, and the baseline HAdV-positive rate was 3.7% (201 cases). Among these positive cases, 122 specimens were positive for HAdV-7 (60.7%), and no other respiratory viruses were detected. After three passages in HEp-2 human larynx epidermoid carcinoma cells, only 69 strains covering eastern (Shaanxi/8/2012–2013, Gansu/15/2015, Yunnan province/3/2013), central (Hunan/32/2012–2014, Jilin/5/2013–2014), and western regions (Hebei/2/2013–2014, Shandong/4/2013–2014) of China were obtained. Information for 122 HAdV-7 infection cases in this study is listed in
