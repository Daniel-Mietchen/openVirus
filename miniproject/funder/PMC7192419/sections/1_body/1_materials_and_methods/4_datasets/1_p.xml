<p>As of September 2019, 371 sequences for complete penton base (80 sequences), hexon (152 sequences), and fiber genes (139 sequences) of HAdV-7 were obtained from GenBank database. Patented sequences, sequences with unknown collection years and geographic information, sequences with consistent strain names, and identical sequences in the same country from the same year were excluded. Therefore, in addition to the sequences of 69 HAdV-7 strains in this study, the final datasets contained 33 representative sequences of HAdV-7 for the penton base gene (China: 18/2007–2018; United States of America [USA]: 13/1954–2017; Russia: 2/2013–2014), 45 representative sequences for the hexon gene (China: 21/2007–2018; USA: 16/1954–2017; Russia: 2/2013–2014; Taiwan, China: 3/2002–2011; Korea: 2/1995–1999; Japan: 1/1995), and 48 representative sequences for the fiber gene (China: 20/2007–2018; USA: 16/1954–2017; Russia: 2/2013–2014; Taiwan, China: 1/2011; Korea: 7/1995–2006; Japan: 2/1992–1995). Representative HAdV-7 strains from GenBank database used in this study are listed in
