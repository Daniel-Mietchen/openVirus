<p>The viral DNA was extracted from 69 HAdV-7 virus strains using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Previously reported primer pairs of HAdV-7 were used to amplify and sequence the entire penton base (1635 bp), hexon (2805 bp), and fiber genes (978 bp) [

 <xref rid="pone.0232092.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments were amplified with Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), purified with a QIAgel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and sequenced using classical Sanger sequencing and a 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, Japan). The raw sequence data were edited and spliced using Sequencher software Version 5.0 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Any ambiguous nucleotide sites were resequenced to obtain high-quality sequences from three major capsid genes for further analysis.
