<p>Serum samples were analysed for the presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to RVF with a SPU-02 RVF IgM and IgG Biological Diagnostic Supplies Ltd (ELISA) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, plates were coated with a recombinant nucleocapsid RVFV antigen diluted 1:1000 in sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH = 9.6), covered with plate seals and incubated at 4°C overnight. Unbound antigen was removed by washing three times for 15 s each with PBS-T. Plates were then blocked with 10% skimmed milk in PBS (PBS-SM) at 37°C for 1 h and then washed. Test sera were added in duplicate at a dilution of 1:400 in 2% PBS-SM and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed once more, and HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody, diluted 1:25 000 in 2% PBS-SM, was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After a final wash, chromagenic detection of HRP and absorbance measurement were performed as described previously. Negative and positive control sera were included for each plate. Sera samples were considered positive if their calculated optical density (OD) was ≥ 0.29 (net OD serum/net mean OD positive control).</p>
