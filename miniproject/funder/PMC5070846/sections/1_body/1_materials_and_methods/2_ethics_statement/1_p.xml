<p>The national ethical and scientific committees in charge of validating study design in the CAR approved the study design (No. 9/UB/FACSS/CSCVPRE/13). The study was described orally before blood samples were collected from human participants, and participants were included only if they gave written consent; for participants aged ≤ 18 years, a parent or guardian provided written informed consent. The informed consent form included a clause permitting use of the participants’ biological specimens for future research. No endangered or sheltered animal species were used in the survey. Verbal consent for testing their animals was acquired from farmers after the objectives of the study had been explained. Once permission was obtained for blood sample collection, an experienced veterinarian bled the animals gently.</p>
