Blood samples were also collected from people at risk, such as stock breeders and people working in slaughterhouses and livestock markets. From both animals and humans, venous blood samples were collected in 5-mL Vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA), which were placed in a cooler, transported to the laboratory, and centrifuged at 2–8°C for 10 min at 2000 rpm. Each serum sample was separated on collection into two aliquots and stored at –20°C until analysis.
