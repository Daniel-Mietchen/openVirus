<p>The distribution of serological results for RVFV was analysed by species, season, and human age and sex and presented as proportions. The effect of each variables on the RVFV positivity was examined using the chi-squared test. 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The variables were then put in a Logistic regression model in stepwise manner. The likelihood ratio test was used to compare the model with and without the variable. In case there was no evidence that the variable fitted, it was dropped (parsimonious model). Statistical analyses were performed with STATA software version 11.
