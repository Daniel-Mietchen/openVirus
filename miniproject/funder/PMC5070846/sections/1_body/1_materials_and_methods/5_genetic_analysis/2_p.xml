<p>In order to validate our approach for obtaining the complete sequence of RVFV by high-throughput sequencing, the RNA was extracted from three viral strains (HB74P59, HB1752, and ArB1986), and fragments of the small, medium, and large segments were amplified and sequenced. The sequence obtained from HB74P59 was compared with those obtained previously by Bird 
 <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; no difference was found in three segments obtained by high-throughput sequencing and classical Sanger sequencing. Moreover, no difference was found in the three segments of strain ArB1986 isolated from an 
 <italic>Aedes palpalis</italic> mosquito and that of a strain isolated in the same city, Loko-Zinga, in 1969 but from another arthropod, 
 <italic>Mansonia africana</italic>.
