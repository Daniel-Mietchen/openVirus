<p>RVFV was isolated from three samples: two strains isolated in 1969 from mosquitoes (ArB1986 and HB74P59) and one from human serum in 1985 (HB1752). It was amplified by inoculation into the brains of newborn mice in a laboratory of biosafety level 3. A brain suspension was prepared, lyophilized, and stored in glass vials at room temperature, and viral RNA was extracted with a QIAmp viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The extracted RNA was treated with Turbo DNase (Life Technologies Inc., Carlbad, California, USA) and then retro-transcribed into cDNA with a SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis kit in the presence of random hexamers. The cDNA generated was amplified with Phi29 enzyme as described previously [

 <sup>6</sup> single reads with 100 bases was obtained for each sample [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The quality of reads was assessed by FastQC, and the sequences were selected according to their quality. All reads corresponding to the mouse genome sequence were filtered by mapping with Bowtie 2.0 software on a 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> Mn10 sequence. The viral reads corresponding to the RVFV genome were selected by a similarity approach with BLASTN search tools [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. All selected viral reads were assembled with Ray software, with 
 <italic>k</italic> = 25, to obtain the full-length viral genomes [
