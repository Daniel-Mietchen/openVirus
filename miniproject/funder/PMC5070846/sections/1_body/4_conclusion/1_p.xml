<p>The results of this first study conducted in both humans and animals in the CAR are important for public health. They shows a high prevalence of RVFV in an area where neither epidemics nor clinical cases of RVF have been reported previously. These results are also important because, in the forested area south of Bangui where there is little husbandry, there is nevertheless low virus noise, which might suggest the presence of a reservoir that has come nearer to human habitats. Unexpectedly, we found low IgM titres in regions of previous intensive animal husbandry, because animal density in these areas has fallen sharply due to the migration of herders in response to the continuing instability in the CAR.</p>
