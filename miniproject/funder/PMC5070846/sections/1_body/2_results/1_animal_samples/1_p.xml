<p>A total of 1271 animals were sampled, comprising 727 cattle, 325 sheep, and 219 goats (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The overall seroprevalence in animals was 1.9% for anti-RVFV IgM antibodies and 8.6% for IgG antibodies. The seroprevalence varied significantly by ruminant. The IgM antibody titre, which indicates recent circulation of RVFV, was 4.3% in sheep, 1.4% in goats, and 1.1% in cattle (

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the multivariate analysis showed that IgM and IgG seropositivity rates in sheep were higher than other species (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1–3.0) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). No significant difference in seropositivity was found between male and female animals (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The IgG seropositivity rate was 9.6% in adults and 5.1% in juveniles (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.02), but no significant difference in positivity for anti-RVFV IgM antibodies was found between juveniles and adults (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The IgM and IgG seropositivity rates varied significantly according to the origin of the sample. No animals positive for IgG antibodies were found in Ndangala, whereas most of those positive for IgM antibodies were originated from this site, and cattle market are less likely to be IgM positive (OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.0–0.5) (Tables 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All animals with positive IgM were found in the rainy season, and IgG seropositivity was more pronounced during dry season (
