<p>A third RVFV strain obtained by high-throughput sequencing was isolated in Bangui at the end of December 1984 (HB1752). Genomic analysis of three segments showed that it was identical to a strain isolated in Bangui 3 months earlier; however, RVFV strains isolated from vectors in 1969 and from human cases in the CAR several decades later had different nucleic sequences, even though they belonged to the same cluster (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005082.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The complete genome sequence was made available to GenBank (HB1752 strain small, medium, and large accession numbers KJ782452, KJ782453, and KJ782454 respectively; ArB1986 strain small, medium, and large accession numbers KJ782455, KJ782456, and KJ782457, respectively).
