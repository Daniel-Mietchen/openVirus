<p>Our study was limited to Bangui and neighbouring areas because animals are brought to the capital from all regions of the country. As we were unable to isolate recent strains of the virus, we could not establish the precise geographical origin of the viral strains currently circulating in the CAR. Nevertheless, on the basis of genomic data for old strains, the same strain may be circulating relatively freely in several vectors in a defined geographical area over a long period. Furthermore, although IgG responses persist for several years in continually exposed people, we were unable to obtain a second sample at an interval of 2 weeks and therefore could not demonstrate seroconversion, which would support recent infection. The low IgG titres and high IgM titres found in the Ndangala region suggest recent introduction of the virus into this forested area, probably associated with illegal movement of sheep and goats from the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
