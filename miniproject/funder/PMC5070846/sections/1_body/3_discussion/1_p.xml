<p>This study, the first in the CAR since RVFV was isolated in 1985, shows that the virus continues to circulate in central Africa. The overall prevalence in animals in this study was lower than that reported in Comoros in 2009 (39% in sheep and 33.5% in goats) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The same ELISA kits were used in all these studies, suggesting that the differences are due to climatic factors, entomological parameters, agro-ecological conditions, or sampling strategies.
