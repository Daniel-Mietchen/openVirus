<p>As no epidemic of RVF or obvious clinical signs of the disease (such as abortions) was observed, the infections were minor or sub-clinical [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Viral activity may be maintained in mosquitoes near rivers that do not dry up during the dry season, resulting in a low level of transmission among domestic animals. These observations and the recent epidemics in East Africa illustrate the risk for introduction of pathogenic strains of RVFV to CAR from countries such as South Sudan, which shares a long border with CAR and has had many epidemics and epizootics of RVF.
