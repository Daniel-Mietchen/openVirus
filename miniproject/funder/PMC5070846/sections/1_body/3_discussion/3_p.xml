<p>The seroprevalence of RVFV was higher in adult than in juvenile animals. Similar results were reported in Mauritania and Senegal [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], supporting the hypothesis of endemic circulation of the virus, as older animals would have longer exposure than younger ones [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The presence of IgG in young animals (&lt; 3 years) in this study suggests recent circulation of the virus. This result is compatible with the IgM titres in each species, with high titres in samples taken from sheep in Ndangala (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The absence of IgG in animals from this region indicates that introduction of the virus south of Bangui is recent. Recent introduction of the virus associated with environmental modifications such as deforestation, population displacement due to the socio-political crisis, and introduction of a new vector competent for RVFV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] could increase the risk for emergence of an epidemic.
