<p>The absence of anti-RVFV IgM antibodies among people regularly exposed to animals would appear to indicate that contact with the virus is uncommon and the public health risk is low. Nevertheless, the presence of IgG among breeders and butchers, who are in contact with the blood of these animals, should alert the authorities to strengthen surveillance of circulation of this virus. Studies to isolate the virus in the vector (mosquitoes) and longitudinal studies in sheep, goats, and cattle should be conducted to detect clinical cases, particularly among sheep and herders in Ndangala village, where evidence of current circulation of the virus was found. As most of the inhabitants of the rural areas in which the small ruminants were sampled are farmers who share the same environment as their animals and may have the same exposure to mosquitoes, a study should also be carried out to determine the prevalence of RVFV antibodies and to establish whether RVF occurs regularly in these zones and is thus a neglected cause of morbidity and mortality.</p>
