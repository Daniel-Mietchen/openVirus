<p>The higher prevalence in sheep is consistent with previous work, indicating that this species is preferentially infected with RVFV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most infected animals, especially sheep, were found in Ndangala, a rural forested area south of Bangui that has more rainfall than the rest of the country, with lower temperatures and constant humidity in the rainy season, during which time there is little husbandry. The high prevalence observed at this site, with the presence of IgM antibodies, suggests endemic virus circulation, which would be maintained by a sylvatic cycle involving wild animals and mosquitoes, as suggested by Olive 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a previous study in a forested area of the CAR, RVFV was isolated from wild mosquitoes, including

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the rainy season, there are many potential breeding sites, which increases the density of vectors and subsequently increases transmission of arboviral diseases such as RVFV. IgM, which indicates recent infection, was present only during the rainy season, but IgG was also significantly associated with the rainy season. These finding are consistent with those in Mauritania and Senegal that indicate that the risk factors for RVF are linked to heavy rainfall and the presence of large temporary masses of surface water [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In a previous study, seropositivity for RVFV was associated with increased numbers of mosquito vectors [
