<p>We undertook a study to assess the current circulation of RVFV in livestock and humans in the CAR. We also sequenced the genomes of local strains isolated in 1969 from wild mosquitoes and in 1985 from humans in a forested area of the country in order to determine the genetic diversity of these strains which will serve as reference for the future.</p>
