<p>RVFV was first isolated in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 1969 from a pool of 
 <italic>Mansonia africana</italic> mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. RVFV-specific antibodies have since been detected in humans, and 15 strains of RVFV have been isolated from humans and sylvatic mosquitoes in CAR [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], although no RVF outbreak has been reported. Current circulation of RVFV in the CAR is unknown, after a gap of two decades without surveillance; however, as animal breeding plays a large part in the economy of the CAR, an epidemic involving humans and animals is possible.
