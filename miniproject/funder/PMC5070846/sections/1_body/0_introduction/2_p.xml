<p>The virus was first identified in 1930 during an epidemic that caused deaths and sudden abortions among sheep on the shores of Lake Naivasha in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since then, the virus has spread to most African countries. The disease occurs in endemic and epidemic forms along the east and south coasts of Africa, in West Africa, in Madagascar [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005082.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The animals most frequently infected are sheep and cattle, followed by goats, with heavy economic losses due to abortions and high mortality rates among juvenile animals [
