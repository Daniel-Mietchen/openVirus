  <p>Schematic representation of the distribution of mutations found in quasispecies of time-course infections of tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV), tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus (TYLCMaV) in quasi-isogenic susceptible (ST, 
   <italic>ty-1</italic>/
   <italic>ty-1</italic>) and resistant (RT, 
   <italic>Ty-1</italic>/
   <italic>ty-1</italic>) tomato lines, common bean (CB) and 
   <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> (SN) at 15, 30, and 45 days after inoculation of single sequence variants. Sequenced regions of quasispecies molecular clones include 357 nts of the 5′-end of 
   <italic>Rep</italic>, 200 nts of the 5′-end of 
   <italic>C4</italic> ORF, the IR, 187 nts of the 5′-end of the 
   <italic>V2</italic> ORF and the complete 
   <italic>CP</italic> ORF. Nucleotide positions refer to the TYLCSV sequence [ES:Mur1:92] (Z25751) (Noris et al., 
   <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Consensus sequences of the quasispecies were determined for whole viral genomic sequences. Mutations detected in separate quasispecies in the same host/time combination are indicated by the number of times they appeared. Mutations found in replicate samples are denoted with an asterisk.
