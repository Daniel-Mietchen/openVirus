  <p>Time-course infections of tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV), tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus (TYLCMaV) infectious clones in susceptible tomato, resistant tomato, common bean and the wild reservoir 
   <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic>. Genomic organization of the viruses showing the two open reading frames (ORFs), 
   <italic>V2</italic>, and 
   <italic>CP</italic>, on the sense strand, and four ORFs, 
   <italic>Rep, TrAP, REn</italic>, and 
   <italic>C4</italic>, on the complementary sense strand. They are separated by an intergenic non-coding region (IR) that contains the origin of replication in a region that adopts a stem-loop structure. Infectious clones and therefore single sequence variants of TYLCSV (black), TYLCV (gray) and recombinant TYLCMaV were used to inoculate three plants each of test hosts: susceptible (ST) and resistant (RT, carrying the 
   <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele in heterozygosis) quasi-isogenic tomato plants, common bean (CB) and the wild reservoir 
   <italic>S. nigrum</italic> (SN). Young apical non-inoculated leaves were collected at the indicated days post inoculation (dpi).
