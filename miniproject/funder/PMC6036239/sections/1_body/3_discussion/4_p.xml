<p>It could be argued that the probability of sequencing genomes with low frequency is expected to be extremely low because of a potential RCA bias (only 0.05% available genomes amplified with RCA) (Gallet et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and because of the limited number of sequenced genomes (about 20). In this sense, as a measure to reduce the amplification bias, 3–7 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> viral genomes were used as input for RCA, which means that roughly 1.5–3.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> molecules may have served as template for amplification so no bottlenecks were created at this step. Notwithstanding, there is a previous report with the same experimental nanovirus system (Grigoras et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) in which the relative quantity of the eight segments of FBNSV, measured by qPCR in total DNA of infected plant tissue, was similar. In addition, the same relative abundance was found in qPCR analysis after performing RCA of the same total DNA or after restriction of the same RCA product with a single-cut enzyme, which ruled out a bias in the RCA. Finally, the analysis of 20 clones per quasispecies may appear insufficient, but assuming each clone is present with a relative frequency of at least 5% within the quasispecies, it means that we might be detecting at least a portion of the most frequent viral variants that are high fitness variants.
