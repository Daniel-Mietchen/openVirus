<p>Positive selection in the 
 <italic>CP</italic> region was observed in all three begomovirus quasispecies evolving in common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, but not in tomato. This finding is unexpected because capsid proteins are involved in vector recognition and particle formation (Noris et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), and are therefore usually more resistant to selective pressures, as evidenced by lower d
 <sub>NS</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratios in other viruses (Chare and Holmes, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). However, our results indicate that under the conditions studied begomovirus 
 <italic>CP</italic> region incorporated nonsynonymous mutations and accepted more drastic amino acid changes than other genomic regions. Purifying selection might occur in nature during the transmission process, which was not included in our experimental design, as 
 <italic>CP</italic> strongly determines insect recognition (Noris et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Nevertheless, under the same experimental conditions, the absence of positive selection in tomato suggests that additional selective constraints on quasispecies development exist in tomato that are absent from the other hosts. Another reason why positive selection in the 
 <italic>CP</italic> region is surprising is because we showed that quasispecies consensus sequences did not change in any of the hosts. It has been suggested that rates of mutation fixation can be higher when viruses are under positive selection, such as when they are adapting to a new host or to cell culture, thus allowing beneficial mutations to become dominant in a short period of time (Carrigan and Knox, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>; Fares et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Acosta-Leal et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Domingo et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the host change between the plant from which the viral clones were isolated, where they were probably better adapted, and the test plants could constitute such an environmental change that would lead to the evolution and novel exploration of the sequence space. However, in the course of this experiment, we have not found evidence of begomovirus adaptation to different hosts by changing the consensus sequence. Successive passaging of the viruses through the hosts for a longer period of time would have allowed fixation of novel mutations and might have revealed adaptive evolution and perhaps changes in the consensus sequence. Nevertheless, our work suggests that differences in fitness across hosts could be influenced by the distribution of mutations in the mutant spectra. We have shown in previous studies the remarkable continuity of the TYLCSV consensus sequence over an 8-year period (SÃ¡nchez-Campos et al., 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). In this work we have shown that high genetic diversity is generated in all four hosts, especially in common bean and the wild reservoir 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> after infection with single sequence variants of three TYLCD-associated begomoviruses in spite of the invariance of the viral consensus sequences. Therefore, our results imply that quasispecies diversity need to be addressed to understand the adaptive potential of these economically important emergent viruses in their different hosts in order to design more durable control strategies.
