<p>Single-stranded DNA viruses belonging to 
 <italic>Parvoviridae, Geminiviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Nanoviridae</italic> have been shown to be as variable as RNA viruses. Moreover, ssDNA virus populations, composed of mutant spectra, have shown strong adaptive capacities similar to those observed in RNA virus populations (Isnard et al., 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Nishizawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; LÃ³pez-Bueno et al., 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Urbino et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Grigoras et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The origin of this variability, however, remains unknown for these viruses. Quasispecies-like evolution combined with invariance of the 
 <italic>Rep, C4</italic>, and IR genomic consensus sequences has been previously described for the begomovirus tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) (Ge et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) in naturally infected tomato, and in tomato and 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> plants experimentally infected with TYLCCNV clones. Here we have looked at the evolution of the whole genomic consensus sequence and mutant spectra variability of the 
 <italic>Rep, C4</italic>, IR
 <italic>, V2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CP</italic> ORFs of three TYLCD-associated begomoviruses in species of the family 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, that is, susceptible tomato, resistant tomato carrying the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> allele and the wild reservoir 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, as well as to common bean, a species of the distantly-related family 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>.
