<p>Here we have shown that, after the inoculation of a single sequence variant, complex populations arise with a high number of different begomovirus genomes accumulating within each individual plant. We estimate that an average of 2 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> begomovirus genomic variants coexist per gram of fresh tissue in apical tomato leaves. Tenfold higher-numbers are reached in common bean and the wild reservoir, 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>. This allows begomovirus quasispecies to explore intensively and efficiently sequence space conferring them an enormous capacity to adapt and overcome selective constraints imposed by the host such as the innate or adaptive immune response or post transcriptional gene silencing (Vanitharani et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Raja et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The presence of high viral loads of highly diverse geminiviruses is of particular importance for viral emergence. In the infection time-courses, TYLCMaV was able to infect and accumulate sustained high titers within every individual plant species tested, even in the resistant tomato. We showed that quasispecies complexity is especially high in common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>. Common bean is usually employed as a transition host between tomato crops in field rotations, for example in Spain (Sánchez-Campos et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), which might favor diversification of the begomovirus population between tomato crops. 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> is a common wild reservoir in growing areas (García-Andrés et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), therefore its presence can ensure the maintenance of begomovirus diversity for new epidemics. Importantly, mutations arising in wild reservoirs could be transmitted to crop plants by the insect vector 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, potentially resulting in the emergence and spread of new better fit variants. TYLCMaV can efficiently infect the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic>-resistant tomato frequently used to contain TYLCD epidemics, as well as the wild host 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> and common bean (Noris et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). Therefore, the high viral diversity of TYLCMaV infections might favor the appearance of ecologically-better adapted emergent variants.
