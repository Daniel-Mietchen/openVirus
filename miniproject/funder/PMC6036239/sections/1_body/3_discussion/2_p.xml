<p>In this work we noticed differences in the fitness of viral isolates between hosts. We used daily Malthusian growth rates (m) to estimate viral fitness since differences in growth rate reflect fitness to a great extent and also because single sequence variants were used to infect hosts (Lalić et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Further, because monopartite begomoviruses are restricted to the phloem and replicate only in companion cells perturbations in copy numbers are reduced. Thus, at the last assay time point (45 dpi) fitness in tomato of either TYLCSV or TYLCV was lower than in 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> or common bean, respectively. This was clearly evident in tomato plants bearing the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele, where negative growth rate values were obtained for both TYLCSV and TYLCV, in contrast to TYLCMaV. The fitness of this latter virus remained stable over time in resistant tomato and no significant differences were seen between hosts. Indeed, the statistics support that there are no significant differences in TYLCMaV accumulation between susceptible and resistant tomato. It is interesting that in genotypes with the resistance gene the accumulation of TYLCMaV does not decrease much, compared with the other two TYLCD-associated viruses tested. Its better adaptation in resistant genotypes can have important ecological consequences Therefore, our results corroborate that TYLCMAV is a virus with resistance-breaking properties. This was already observed previously (Monci et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and quoted subsequently (García-Arenal and McDonald, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). How TYLCMaV, is able to overcome the growth restriction conferred by the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> gene, despite the genome sequences of the recombinant virus sharing 99% identity with the corresponding parental virus sequences, is an interesting open question. An improved combination of coding and/or nonconding regions may have been selected after a recombination event in TYLCMaV that better overcame 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele limitations. The 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> allele has been shown to impair the accumulation of begomoviruses involved in TYLCD (García-Andrés et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), although, similar to the results obtained here, it has been shown to have little effect on TYLCMaV (Monci et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> encodes a γ type RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RDRP) (Verlaan et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), with 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance involving enhanced transcriptional gene silencing against TYLCV, as revealed by the enrichment of siRNAs directed against 
 <italic>CP</italic> and 
 <italic>REn</italic>, and cytosine methylation of the 
 <italic>CP</italic> promoter region (Butterbach et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We did not detect differences in the complexity or heterogeneity of the three begomovirus mutant spectra in the presence or absence of the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> allele for any of the genomic regions analyzed in this study. Nevertheless, in resistant tomato, our data show that a high mutation frequency value was observed for the 
 <italic>C4</italic> region of TYLCSV, the most restricted virus (Monci et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), suggesting exploration of TYLCSV for better adapted variants to overcome restriction imposed by this host. As 
 <italic>C4</italic> has been shown to be a mild suppressor of gene silencing (Luna et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and a viral determinant in overcoming the genetic resistance of some wild tomato species (Tomás et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), the role of this region in permitting viral accumulation in the presence of 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> merits further study. Since the sequence of the TYLCMaV isolate used in this work only differs in 7 and 15 nucleotide changes to the corresponding sequences of the parental TYLCV and TYLCSV viruses, respectively, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the key to overcoming 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance resides in this particular combination of nucleotide changes, with those detected in the 
 <italic>C4</italic> ORF being prime candidates. Alternatively, an optimized combination of genome fragments to overcome 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance might be achieved in this virus driven by a recombination event then supporting the importance of modular evolution to adapt to a fluctuating environment (Botstein, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Stavrinides and Guttman, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Belabess et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
