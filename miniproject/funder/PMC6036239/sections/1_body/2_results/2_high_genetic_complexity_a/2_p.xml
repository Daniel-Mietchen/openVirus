<p>Quasispecies genetic complexity was also assessed by analyzing average genetic distance 
 <italic>(d</italic>) values. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, 
 <italic>d</italic> values varied from 0.00012 to 0.00173. The maximum genetic distance values for the four coding regions and the IR were found in the 
 <italic>V2</italic> region (especially for common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>). High 
 <italic>d</italic> values were also observed for 
 <italic>C4</italic> in some cases (e.g., in resistant tomato for TYLCSV at 15 dpi or in common bean for TYLCV at 30 dpi).
