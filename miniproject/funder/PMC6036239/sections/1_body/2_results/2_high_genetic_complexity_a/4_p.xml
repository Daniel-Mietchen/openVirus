<p>Altogether, our results support the idea that begomovirus infections are characterized by the generation of highly complex and heterogeneous ssDNA mutant spectra in the host species tested, especially in common bean and the wild reservoir 
 <italic>S. nigrum. V2</italic> region supported the most complex spectra, 
 <italic>CP</italic> was the most heterogeneous, while 
 <italic>C4</italic> exhibited both the least complexity and least heterogeneity. Interestingly, despite the high genetic complexity and heterogeneity of TYLCD-associated begomovirus quasispecies, no changes were detected in their whole genomic consensus sequences in any of the four hosts at any time point during infection.
