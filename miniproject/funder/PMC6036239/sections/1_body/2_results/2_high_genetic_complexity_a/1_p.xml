<p>Next we analyzed the quasispecies complexity and heterogeneity of the three begomoviruses during the time-course infections. Specifically, viral quasispecies complexity refers to the composition of the mutant spectrum, which can be described both by mutation frequency and average genetic distance (
 <italic>d</italic>), whereas viral quasispecies heterogeneity refers to the proportion of different viral genomes in the mutant spectrum, as measured by Shannon entropy (Domingo et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). DNA samples from one infected plant per virus/host combination at each time point, plus a replicate sample of each combination at 45 dpi, were subjected to rolling circle amplification (RCA) to specifically amplify circular DNA using the high-fidelity φ29 DNA polymerase with a reported error rate of 3–6 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> (Esteban et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Nelson et al., 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). As a measure to reduce amplification bias we amplified 3–7 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> input viral molecules. Sequences obtained for each begomovirus region were compared to the consensus sequence to determine mutation frequencies. Despite large variation among viruses, the highest mutation frequency values calculated for the whole sequenced region were detected in common bean and in 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). When analyzed by genomic region, the mutation frequency of the quasispecies varied from &lt;0.616 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 8.91 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mutations/nt (mut/nt) (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The most complex region was 
 <italic>V2</italic> (e.g., 8.91 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> for TYLCV in resistant tomato, 8.6 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> and 8.0 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mut/nt in common bean for TYLCV and TYLCMaV, respectively, or 8.4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mut/nt in 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> for TYLCSV). In contrast, the least complex mutant spectra were found in the 
 <italic>Rep</italic> and 
 <italic>C4</italic> genomic regions with values generally below 3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> mut/nt (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Higher complexity values were found in common bean or 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> than in tomato for 
 <italic>CP</italic> or IR in all viral species. Thus, 
 <italic>CP</italic> mutation frequency of TYLCV in common bean was higher than in resistant tomato at 15 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.025), and also higher at 30 dpi than in susceptible (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.034) and resistant tomato (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.034). Only in TYLCV, 
 <italic>CP</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.030) and 
 <italic>V2</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) regions showed more complexity in resistant tomato than in common bean at 45 dpi. Additionally, our results suggest that 
 <italic>CP</italic> and IR were differentially enriched in mutations respect to other regions within a particular quasispecies. In 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> at 45 dpi the complexity of 
 <italic>CP</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and IR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) of TYLCSV was higher than that of both 
 <italic>Rep</italic> and 
 <italic>C4</italic> regions. Also in 
 <italic>S. nigrum CP</italic> region of TYLCMaV was more complex than 
 <italic>Rep, C4</italic>, and 
 <italic>V2</italic> at 15 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.045) and 30 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005). In susceptible tomato at 45 dpi the mutation frequency was higher in 
 <italic>CP</italic> than in 
 <italic>C4</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.025) for TYLCSV and in resistant tomato 
 <italic>CP</italic> was more complex than 
 <italic>Rep</italic> (P = 0.001) and 
 <italic>C4</italic> (P = 0.014) for TYLCV.
