<p>Begomovirus mutant spectra heterogeneity was evaluated by calculating the normalized Shannon entropy of viral quasispecies. Shannon entropy values calculated for the whole sequenced region were highest in common bean at 15 dpi and no difference between hosts were detected a later times post infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Susceptible tomato begomovirus quasispecies were the least heterogeneous, followed by those of resistant tomato and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>. Analyzed by genomic region, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Shannon entropy values ranged from 0 to 0.340. The 
 <italic>CP</italic> region showed the highest heterogeneity in all four hosts and viruses, although this was especially pronounced in common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>. Conversely, the lowest Shannon entropy values in the four hosts were detected in the 
 <italic>C4</italic> genomic region, except for TYLCSV at 15 dpi in resistant tomato. Therefore, heterogeneity of quasispecies was high in all host/begomovirus combinations, with the most heterogeneous populations exhibited by common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>. Notably, the wild host 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> contained the most heterogeneous populations at later infection time points for the viruses that were able to infect it. In general, mutation frequency, 
 <italic>d</italic> and Shannon entropy values at 45 dpi were similar for replicates 1 and 2 for each virus/host combination.
