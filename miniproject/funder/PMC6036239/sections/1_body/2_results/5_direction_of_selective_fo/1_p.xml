<p>To assess begomovirus mutant spectra adaptation to hosts, we studied the direction of selective forces on their coding regions. To this end the average rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (d
 <sub>S</sub>) and of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (d
 <sub>NS</sub>) for each mutant spectrum were estimated as reported previously (Pamilo and Bianchi, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Where possible, the d
 <sub>NS</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratio was also calculated. The results in Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">6</xref> show that d
 <sub>NS</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratios of begomovirus quasispecies evolving in tomato ranged from 0.149 to 0.616 in 
 <italic>Rep, V2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CP</italic>. Ratios calculated for TYLCSV and TYLCMaV were below 1, suggesting that all three regions were under negative selection, both in susceptible and resistant tomato. However, d
 <sub>NS</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratios ranged from 0.357 to 1.842 in common bean and from 0.464 to 1.778 in 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, showing that, in these hosts, selective forces acted differentially depending on the coding region. In fact, we observed positive selection (d
 <sub>NS</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> &gt; 1) in the 
 <italic>CP</italic> region of both common bean, at 15 and 45 dpi for TYLCV and TYLCMaV infections, respectively, and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, at 45 and 15 dpi for TYLCSV and TYLCMaV infections, respectively. The results on d
 <sub>NS</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratios of replicates 1 and 2 at 45 dpi of each virus/host combination were similar, although additional replicates would add more robustness to our conclusions. Altogether, these results suggest differing selective constraints of begomovirus quasispecies in different hosts. Also, it seems that 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance does not alter the way begomoviruses are selected in tomato, as purifying selection dominates in all the coding regions analyzed. Our data also support positive selection of virus variants in the 
 <italic>CP</italic> region in common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, whereas 
 <italic>Rep, C4</italic>, and 
 <italic>V2</italic> coding regions are under purifying selection. Positive selection of 
 <italic>CP</italic> region variants in common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> together with higher virus fitness and diversity, and differential mutation distribution occur without alterations to begomovirus consensus sequences. These results suggest that the mutant spectrum plays an important role in begomovirus infections in each host.
