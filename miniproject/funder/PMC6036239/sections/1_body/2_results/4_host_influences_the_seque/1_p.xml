<p>Sequence variations explored during begomovirus infections seemed to be affected by specific virus-host interactions. Sequence space distribution of the mutations detected in our time-course assays is summarized in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, which shows the location of the mutations found in begomovirus quasispecies by assay time point, host and begomovirus (TYLCSV, TYLCV, or TYLCMaV). Considering the genomic regions explored at each sampling time, we observed that the tomato 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele did not significantly influence mutation frequency for any ORF, since no significant differences between susceptible tomato and resistant tomato were found at any time point (generalized linear model assuming binary distribution and using logit link function, 
 <italic>P</italic> â‰¥ 0.05). However, differences between hosts were observed with respect to where mutations occurred over time. Thus, for example, mutation frequency of the 
 <italic>CP</italic> increased for TYLCSV in susceptible tomato between 15 and 45 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.048) and between 30 and 45 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003), and for TYLCV in resistant tomato between 15 and 45 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). This increase in 
 <italic>CP</italic> mutation frequency might be related to the decrease in fitness in tomato. In 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, TYLCMaV (replicates 1 and 2 at 45 dpi) showed a significant increase in the number of mutations in 
 <italic>Rep</italic> between 15 and 45 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.044) and between 30 and 45 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005) but not in the overlapping 
 <italic>C4</italic> ORF. A random distribution of mutations was found both in 
 <italic>Rep</italic> and 
 <italic>C4</italic> (runs test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) so mutational hotspots were ruled out. This result suggests an active exploration of sequence space in 
 <italic>Rep</italic> but not in 
 <italic>C4</italic> for the recombinant virus. No parallel mutations were found in replicate samples at 45 dpi. Our results suggest that begomoviruses explore different sequence space depending on host species, although further studies are needed to confirm this including additional replicates (at 15 and 30 dpi). They also suggest that the presence of the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> gene in tomato does not affect how begomoviruses move in sequence space at each time point. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that begomovirus consensus sequences were completely invariant throughout the infection time-courses regardless of mutant spectra or host, and despite the large number of mutations found.
