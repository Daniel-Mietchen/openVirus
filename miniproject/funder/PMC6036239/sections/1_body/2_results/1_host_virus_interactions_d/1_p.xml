<p>To evaluate how the host affects the behavior of the different begomoviruses first we measured the viral load of the three begomoviruses in the four hosts. Under the conditions studied, no effective amplification was possible from young apical non-inoculated leaves for TYLCSV in common bean or for TYLCV in 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, it was clear that the presence of the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele repressed accumulation of TYLCSV, and TYLCV to some extent, whereas no such repression was observed for TYLCMaV. Significantly higher TYLCV accumulation was observed in common bean at 45 dpi than in susceptible (510-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005) or resistant (1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>-fold; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.000) tomato plants. Also, significantly more TYLCSV molecules accumulated in the wild reservoir 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> at 45 dpi than in susceptible (60-fold, P = 0.005) or resistant (3.6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>-fold, P = 0.0004) tomatoes (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, TYLCV and TYLCSV infections in common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, respectively, resulted in the generation of larger virus populations suggesting higher viral fitness compared to tomato. Our results also suggest better adaptation of TYLCMaV to common bean (with an accumulation level similar to TYLCV) than to 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> (much lower accumulation than TYLCSV).
