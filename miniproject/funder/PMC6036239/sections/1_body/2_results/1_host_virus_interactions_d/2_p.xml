<p>To better understand the effect of the different hosts on the three begomoviruses absolute fitness was assessed. Since we used single-sequence variants as inoculum the Malthusian growth rate (m) during viral infection time-courses was calculated as an estimate for absolute fitness (Lalić et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The results shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> indicate differences in fitness across hosts during time-course infections. The presence of the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> allele significantly restricted the growth rate of TYLCSV (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) in apical leaves at 45 dpi, and of both TYLCSV and TYLCV during the time-course infection (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.000). However, as previously shown (Monci et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), the presence of the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele in tomato had no evident effect on TYLCMaV fitness at 45 dpi (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 5.56 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) or during the infection (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 6.25 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>). Despite being a recombinant of the former two viruses, TYLCMaV maintained similar fitness throughout the whole experiment in all four hosts (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 6.25 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> or 0.010). Moreover, viral fitness in common bean and in 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> was sustained along the experiment (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt;0.010). In summary, these results suggest better performance of TYLCV and TYLCSV in common bean and 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic>, respectively, whereas TYLCMaV accumulates similarly well in all hosts, including the resistant tomato.
