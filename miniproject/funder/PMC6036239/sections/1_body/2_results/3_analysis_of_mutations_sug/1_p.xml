<p>Mutation data, comprising 128 base substitutions and 16 indels (complete list shown in Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), were pooled together irrespective of sampling time, virus or host. Mutation types and their frequency (%) relative to the number of changes found in a given genomic region or the whole sequenced zone are indicated in Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Independent analysis of 
 <italic>Rep, C4</italic>, IR, 
 <italic>V2</italic>, and 
 <italic>CP</italic> regions, shows that the most abundant mutations were base substitutions (86.7–100%), with indels only absent in 
 <italic>C4</italic>. The IR contained the highest fraction of insertions, representing 11.1% of all mutations in the region. On the other hand, the highest fraction of deletions was detected in 
 <italic>Rep</italic> (5.3% of total mutations). Of the base substitutions, the most common transition was C → T, which was highly enriched in 
 <italic>C4</italic> and 
 <italic>V2</italic> regions. G → A was the next most common transition, although it was less common in the IR and absent from 
 <italic>C4</italic>. With regards to transversions, G → T was the most abundant. Conversely, A → T and A → C and G → T transversions were exceptionally frequent in the IR compared to the other four regions. Interestingly, the transition:transversion ratio was close to 1 in all regions. Transition:transversion ratios in DNA-based organisms (Begun et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Hodgkinson and Eyre-Walker, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) as well as in RNA and dsDNA viruses (Duchêne et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) are over 2. While it has not been shown for ssDNA viruses, lower ratios might suggest that in all the begomovirus regions analyzed, especially in the IR and 
 <italic>CP</italic> (with ratios of 0.9), either negative selection is removing transitions or transversions are favored. Nonsynonymous changes were more frequent than synonymous mutations in all regions, ranging from 65.4 to 79.2% of total mutations in 
 <italic>Rep</italic> and 
 <italic>V2</italic>, respectively.
