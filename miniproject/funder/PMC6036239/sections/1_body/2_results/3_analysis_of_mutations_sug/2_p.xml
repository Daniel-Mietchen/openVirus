<p>Next, we studied the frequency and acceptability of the amino acid changes found in the different gene products under study. Firstly, amino acid changes were analyzed using the SG matrix as described previously (Feng et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) generating values from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating the most drastic amino acid changes and 6 the least, and their relative frequencies shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>. The results show that amino acid changes in Rep were poorly tolerated, since 83.9% of changes have acceptability values above 3, with 38.7% having a value of 6 (synonymous changes). Although the overall degree of amino acid change was similar in all regions, the higher relative frequency of more pronounced changes (with values of 2 or less) found in the CP might indicate that this protein is more tolerant to drastic amino acid changes. We analyzed the probability of amino acid substitution occurrence using a PAM-250 substitution matrix (Feng and Doolittle, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The results shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> indicate that the highest frequency of probable amino acid replacements occurred in Rep and that unlikely amino acid changes were most prevalent in the CP protein. Altogether the results indicate that the Rep protein tends to be more conserved and that the CP protein is more amenable to change.
