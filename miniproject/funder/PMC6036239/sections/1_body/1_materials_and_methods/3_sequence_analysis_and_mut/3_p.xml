<p>To analyze the effect of selection on mutant spectra the rate of substitutions per synonymous (

 <sub>S</sub>) and nonsynonymous (

 <sub>NS</sub>) site was estimated using the Pamilo-Bianchi-Li method (Pamilo and Bianchi, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) implemented in MEGA. The structure-genetic (SG) matrix of Feng et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>) was used to obtain the acceptability values of amino acid changes found in each genomic coding region. The values range from 0 (drastic amino acid changes) to 6 (synonymous replacements) and take into account structural similarities and probabilities of amino acid changes. The probability of occurrence of amino acid replacements found in quasispecies was calculated according to the PAM-250 substitution matrix (Feng and Doolittle, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).
