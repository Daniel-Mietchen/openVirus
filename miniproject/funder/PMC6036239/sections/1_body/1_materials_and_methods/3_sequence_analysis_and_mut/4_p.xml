<p>Mutations in overlapping genes were only considered for the computation of mutation types or the estimation of 
 <italic>d</italic>, mutation frequency or Shannon entropy of each ORF but not of the entire sequenced zone. Also, since the 
 <italic>Rep</italic> and 
 <italic>C4</italic> ORFs are not in frame, neither 
 <italic>V2</italic> and 
 <italic>CP</italic>, the resulting amino acid changes in the overlapping sequence were considered for the d
