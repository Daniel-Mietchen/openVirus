<p>EditSeq, SeqBuilder and SeqMan software (DNAStar Inc., USA) were used for sequence assembly and analysis. Mutations were scored relative to the consensus sequence of each mutant spectrum. To analyze virus quasispecies genetic complexity (mutational composition of the ensemble) mutation frequencies were calculated by dividing the number of different mutations (repeated mutations in each quasispecies were computed only once) by the total number of nucleotides sequenced (Domingo et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Virus quasispecies genetic complexity was also assessed by analyzing the average genetic distance (
 <italic>d</italic>), defined as to the average number of mutations per site between any pair of sequences chosen at random from the population. Genetic distances were estimated for each genomic region by Kimura's two-parameter method (Kimura,
