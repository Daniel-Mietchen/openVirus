<p>Mutant spectra heterogeneity was determined using the normalized Shannon entropy (SE) calculation according to the formula − [Σ
 <italic>i</italic> (
 <italic>pi x lnpi</italic>)]/
 <italic>lnN</italic>], where 
 <italic>pi</italic> is the frequency of each sequence in the mutant spectrum and 
 <italic>N</italic> is the total number of sequences compared (Volkenstein, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>). SE values range from 0 (all sequences are identical) to 1 (all sequences are different).
