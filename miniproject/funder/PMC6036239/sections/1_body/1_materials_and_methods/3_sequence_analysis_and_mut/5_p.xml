<p>The statistical significance of differences in ORF mutation frequencies between samples was evaluated by a generalized linear model with logit link function assuming a binary distribution, and followed by post hoc analysis of pairwise comparisons with least square (LSD) correction to test for differences between treatments, using IBM SPSS Statistics v. 22 software (
