<p>For the absolute quantification of TYLCV-like viruses, standard curves were prepared using pBluescript II SK (+) containing full-length viral genomes. Phagemids were serially diluted tenfold in 5 ng/μl of DNA extracted from either non-inoculated tomato, common bean or 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> plants, to obtain 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10
 <sup>9</sup> viral genome copies per μl. For each PCR system (primer pair and background host DNA), standard curves were obtained by linear regression analysis of the threshold cycle (Cq) values of three standard dilution replicates over the Log of the number of genome copies present in each sample.
