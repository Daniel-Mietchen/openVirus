<p>Quantification of viral DNA in test plants was carried out on total DNA extracts previously analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and UV-spectrophotometry (ND-1,000 spectrophotometer, NanoDrop, Fisher Thermo). Quantification was done in triplicate with a final volume of 20 μl with SYBR Premix Ex Taq Perfect Real Time (Takara), 0.125 μM of specific primers and 10 ng of total DNA. An amplicon of 169 bp within the 
 <italic>Rep</italic> ORF of TYLCV and TYLCMaV was amplified with primers MA1508 and MA1509 (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the case of TYLCSV, a fragment of 240 bp also in 
 <italic>Rep</italic> was amplified with primers MA1506 and MA1507. PCR amplification was performed in an iCycler PCR System (BioRad) and consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s. Specificity of the amplified products was assessed by melting curve analysis. Data from total DNA plant extracts were normalized to the 
 <italic>25S</italic> ribosomal RNA gene amplified using primers 25S rRNA UNIV (+ and –) (Mason et al., 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). To obtain the total number of ssDNA molecules, values were multiplied by two as each standard dsDNA molecule (a phagemid harbors the infectious clone) contains two ssDNAs (virion sense and complementary sense).
