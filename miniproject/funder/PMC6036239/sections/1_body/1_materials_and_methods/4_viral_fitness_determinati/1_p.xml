<p>To determine absolute fitness the accumulation ability of a virus genotype in a given host, that is, the number of viral genomes produced after a given time (per unit of total DNA extracted from the plant tissue) in apical leaves was measured. Absolute fitness was approximated as the Malthusian growth rate per day,
