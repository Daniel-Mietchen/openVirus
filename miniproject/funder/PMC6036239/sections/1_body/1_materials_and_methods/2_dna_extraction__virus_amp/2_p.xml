<p>RCA products were digested with single cutter (in viral genome) restriction enzyme 
 <italic>Bam</italic>HI to obtain the linear full-length DNA (c. 2.7 kbp) that was subsequently cloned into pBluescript II SK (+) (Stratagene). The product obtained was transformed into 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5α by electroporation. Transformed colonies were analyzed by PCR using the universal M13 primers (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Only those clones containing inserts representing the 2.7 kbp full-length genome size were selected for the study. Amplification of molecular clones was also performed using RCA before sequencing. A total of 18–22 clones were sequenced per mutant spectrum from a single plant. Primers MA863 and M13 UNIV (-) were used for all virus isolates (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to sequence the 5′-end of 
 <italic>Rep</italic> and 
 <italic>C4</italic> ORFs, and the intergenic region (IR) on the C strand. On the virus sense strand the sequenced region comprises the 5′-end of the 
 <italic>V2</italic> ORF and the complete 
 <italic>CP</italic> ORF. Primers MA1197, MA1198, and MA1199 were used for sequencing molecular clones of TYLCMaV, TYLCSV, and, TYLCV, respectively, whereas primer MA1365 was used for all of them.
