<p>Knowing how hosts affect begomovirus diversity is important to understand the emergence of new begomovirus variants and to assist in designing more durable control strategies. To this end we have monitored the genetic variability of TYLCV, TYLCSV, and TYLCMaV begomovirus mutant spectra for 45 days after the inoculation of susceptible and 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistant tomato, common bean and the wild reservoir 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> with single sequence variants of each virus. Our results show that the host can have an important role in driving the fitness and diversity of begomovirus mutant spectra. Differences in absolute fitness of begomovirus in the different hosts existed without any modifications in their consensus sequences. However, quasispecies with high complexity and heterogeneity existed in all four hosts, especially in common bean and the wild host. Interestingly, the presence or absence of the 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele in tomato did not lead to differences in begomovirus mutant spectra. However, in tomato 
 <italic>CP</italic> mutation frequency of TYLCSV and TYLCV increased at 45 dpi, which may be related to their fitness decrease in this host. In the wild host TYLCMaV displayed lower fitness than in the other hosts and actively explored 
 <italic>Rep</italic> ORF but not the overlapping 
 <italic>C4</italic>. Our findings underline the great complexity and heterogeneity of begomovirus mutant spectra and that differences might exist between host plants. This is particularly relevant for the wild reservoir, which hosts a highly diverse begomovirus population containing potentially emergent variants in spite of the stability of their quasispecies consensus sequences.
