<p>Begomoviruses (genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Geminiviridae</italic>) are emerging pathogens transmitted by the whitefly 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Gennadius) (
 <italic>Hemiptera</italic>: 
 <italic>Aleyrodidae</italic>). They are responsible for severe losses of economically important crops such as tomato (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>), cotton (
 <italic>Gossypium</italic> spp.) or cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic>) in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions (Parrish et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Rojas and Gilbertson, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hanssen et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Navas-Castillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) is one of the most devastating diseases affecting tomato worldwide (Czosnek and Laterrot, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Díaz-Pendón et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Navas-Castillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). TYLCD is caused by a complex of at least 11 different begomoviruses, which produce similar symptoms in infected tomato plants but can differ in host range (Czosnek and Laterrot, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Díaz-Pendón et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Navas-Castillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Most TYLCD-associated viruses have a monopartite genome with coding regions present in both virion (V) and complementary (C) sense strands separated by an intergenic non-coding region (IR). A total of six partially overlapping genes are encoded by monopartite TYLCD-associated virus genomes: 
 <italic>CP</italic> (coat protein, open reading frame or ORF 
 <italic>V1</italic>), 
 <italic>V</italic>2 (movement-like protein, precoat protein), 
 <italic>Rep</italic> (replication associated protein, C1), 
 <italic>TrAP</italic> (transcriptional activator protein, C2), 
 <italic>REn</italic> (replication enhancer protein, C3), and 
 <italic>C4</italic> (involved in systemic movement and a pathogenesis factor) (Czosnek, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). TYLCD epidemics have occurred in the Mediterranean Basin since the late 1980s (Czosnek, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Navas-Castillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In Spain, outbreaks of the disease in the early 1990s were associated with the Spanish (ES) strain of tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) (Noris et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Navas-Castillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The subsequent introduction in the late 1990s and early 2000s of the type (also known as Israel, IL) (currently accepted as type member) and Mild (Mld) strains of tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) (Noris et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Morilla et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) resulted in new sources of genetic variation, and the emergence of recombinant species such as tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus (TYLCMaV), derived from a genetic exchange between isolates of TYLCSV and TYLCV (Navas-Castillo et al., 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Although 99% of the TYLCMaV genome sequence is shared with its corresponding parental virus sequences, the virus significantly differs in host range (Morilla et al., 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; García-Andrés et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Thus, TYLCMaV can infect common bean (
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>) and the wild host 
 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic>. In contrast, TYLCSV cannot infect common bean (Monci et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) and the accumulation of TYLCV is strongly impaired in 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> (Sánchez-Campos et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). None of the latter three viruses induce disease in tomato cultivars carrying the dominant 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> resistance allele, which has been shown to limit the accumulation of TYLCV, TYLCSV and, to a lesser extent, TYLCMaV (García-Andrés et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
