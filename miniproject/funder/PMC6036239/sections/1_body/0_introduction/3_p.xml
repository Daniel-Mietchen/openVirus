<p>Viral emergence requires a sufficient degree of genetic variation in the reservoir host to allow successful infection of the new host after transmission (Parrish et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Holmes and Grenfell, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Elena et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Once the virus adapts to the new host, the emergent virus may spread and reach epidemic levels. Thus, knowledge of the genetic structure of host viral populations, and the factors that determine their evolution and host adaptation, are essential for designing robust control strategies for plant viral diseases (Acosta-Leal et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The genetic diversity observed in several RNA plant virus quasispecies appears to be host dependent, indicating that virus-host interactions are responsible for the maintenance of variability in mutant spectra (Schneider and Roossinck, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). This diversity might influence viral adaptability to new hosts. It remains to be determined, however, to what extent hosts can play a similar role in shaping quasispecies genetic variability in ssDNA plant viruses.
