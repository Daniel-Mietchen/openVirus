Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in humans are considered to be mild or subclinical. However, during the recent epidemics in the Pacific Islands and the Americas, the infection was associated with Quillain-Barré syndrome and congenital infections with fetal brain abnormalities, including microcephaly. Thus, more detailed understanding of ZIKV-host cell interactions and regulation of innate immune responses by strains of differential evolutionary origin is required. Here, we characterized the infection and immune responses triggered by two epidemic Asian/American lineage viruses, including an isolate from fetal brains, and a historical, low passage 1947 African lineage virus in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. The epidemic Asian/American ZIKV replicated well and induced relatively good antiviral responses in human DCs whereas the African strain replicated less efficiently and induced weaker immune responses. In macrophages both the African and Asian strains showed limited replication and relatively weak cytokine gene expression. Interestingly, in macrophages we observed host protein degradation, especially IRF3 and STAT2, at early phases of infection with both lineage viruses, suggesting an early proteasomal activation in phagocytic cells. Our data indicates that ZIKV evolution has led to significant phenotypic differences in the replication characteristics leading to differential regulation of host innate immune responses.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par2">Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the family of <i>Flaviviridae</i>, which is a large group of viruses including e.g. Dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Tick-borne encephalitis and many other important human pathogenic viruses. In most individuals ZIKV infection is a self-limiting disease with fever, rash, arthritis, conjunctivitis, malaise and headache with perhaps 80% of infected individuals suffering from a very mild or a subclinical infection<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>. However, in 2015 there was increasing evidence that ZIKV is linked to congenital infections leading to spontaneous abortions and severe neonatal birth defects<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a>,<a href="#CR3">3</a></sup>. Indeed, it was observed that maternal ZIKV infection can spread to the fetal brains causing the death of developing neurons, brain calcification and cortical displacement leading to reduced brain volume and development of microcephaly<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a>,<a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. In addition, ZIKV infections have been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome and likely other milder neurological symptoms that may appear in early childhood<sup><a href="#CR6">6</a></sup>. Due to the rapid spread of ZIKV infections in the Americas and accumulating data on severe birth defects in children whose mothers had suffered a ZIKV infection during pregnancy, WHO declared ZIKV infection as a global health alert during the epidemic in 2015–2016<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par3">ZIKV was identified in <i>Rhesus</i> monkeys in Uganda and the virus was isolated in 1947<sup><a href="#CR8">8</a></sup>. Later on, it became evident that many <i>Aedes</i> (Stegomyia) species mosquitoes are transmitting the virus to primates and humans<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. Initially, the ZIKV appearance was restricted to certain areas in Africa and later on in Asia, but in recent years the virus has spread widely in the tropical and subtropical areas in the world. The virus follows well the geographic distribution of <i>Aedes</i> species mosquitoes such as <i>A</i>. <i>africanus</i>, <i>A</i>. <i>albopictus</i> and <i>A</i>. <i>aegyptii</i>, which are the vectors for other important flaviviruses as well. During the last ten years, ZIKV spread to Southeast Asia and the Polynesian Islands followed by an extremely rapid spread of the virus in Southern and Central America in 2015–2016, including the southern parts of the United States<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a>,<a href="#CR10">10</a>–<a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>. During its global spread, the virus has undergone marked genetic evolution and presently ZIKV strains have been classified as East African, West African and Asian lineages, the latter of which includes the virus strains isolated in the Americas<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a></sup>. At present, there is little information whether the viruses from different lineages show significant differences in pathogenesis or in their ability to replicate in human cells.</p> <p id="Par4">Innate immunity plays an important role in the early phases of microbial infections including viral infections. The key cell types regulating innate immunity include dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These cells reside in tissues where they are on alert for invading pathogens. DCs take up microbes, microbial components or they are infected by viruses, which leads to the activation of the cells, increased cytokine production and migration of activated DCs into the local lymph nodes where they present microbial antigens to T cells<sup><a href="#CR14">14</a></sup>. DCs thus operate as an important cell type regulating both innate and adaptive immunity. Macrophages, instead, reside in tissues where they act mainly locally by taking up and destroying microbes as well as by secreting inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators<sup><a href="#CR15">15</a></sup>. Although immature DCs in humans have been shown to be permissive to ZIKV infection, there is still some controversy on the impact of lineage differences on the cell-type specific infectivity and regulation of innate immunity<sup><a href="#CR16">16</a>–<a href="#CR18">18</a></sup>. Macrophages, which are readily infected by many flaviviruses like Dengue and West Nile viruses<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a>,<a href="#CR20">20</a></sup>, have been mostly neglected as a potential target for ZIKV infection.</p> <p id="Par5">In the present study, we have characterized Zika virus infection in primary human monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages. Firstly, we evaluated the susceptibility of human immune cells to a ZIKV infection. Secondly, we compared the infection pattern of Asian lineage fetal brain and blood ZIKV isolates and a historical African strain (initially a monkey isolate) in both cell types. We observed that the recent Asian/American lineage Zika viruses replicated well in DCs but poorly in macrophages, while the African lineage virus showed limited infectivity in both cell types. The ability of the virus to replicate correlated well with the magnitude of innate antiviral gene expression and cytokine production. However, all ZIKV strains analyzed induced innate immune responses in such a level that an antiviral state, as evidenced by enhanced expression of antiviral MxA protein, was established in both studied human cell types.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Infection of human DCs and macrophages by Zika viruses of different evolutionary lineages</div> <p id="Par6">In this study we analysed the infection profiles of ZIKV strains of African and Asian lineages in human innate immune cell models. A recent Asian lineage ZIKV strain (infection contracted in Guatemala) isolated from fetal brains (ZIKV-FB-GWUH-2016<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>), another Asian strain isolated from a viremic adult patient who contracted the infection in French Polynesia (ZIKV-H-PF-2013) and an ancestor, low-passage African strain (ZIKV-#976-Uganda-1947) were used. As shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1A</a>, GWUH is an Asian lineage virus and genetically very closely related to the 2015 epidemic Guatemala strains<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. The HPF strain is very closely related to the 2015–2016 epidemic strains of the Americas of which an isolate from Puerto Rico in 2015 (PRVABC59) is widely used as a reference strain for the epidemic<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a></sup>. The genetic difference between the recent epidemic strains and the original African lineage viruses is ca. 6% (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1A</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <p>Susceptibility of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages to fetal brain-isolated Asian lineage ZIKV and historical African lineage ZIKV infection.

In this time point we saw hardly any virus-positive DCs by flow cytometric analysis or macrophage infection by immunofluorescent microscopy when an in-house produced anti-ZIKV NS3 specific antibody was used. The specificity and sensitivity of anti-ZIKV NS3-specific antibodies was excellent in GWUH-infected Vero E6 cells and no background staining was seen in immunofluorescence analysis (Supplementary Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). To further evaluate ZIKV infection in DCs and macrophages we infected the cells with high doses of Asian lineage GWUH and African lineage #976 strains and analysed the percentage of virus-infected cells by immunofluorescence staining at 48 h p.i. In DCs very high doses of GWUH ZIKV(MOI 25-225) lead to a clearly detectable infection in 2–18% of the cells in different donors (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1B,C</a>). However, in African lineage ZIKV #976 virus-infected DCs, only a few percentage of cells showed evidence of virus protein expression (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1B,C</a>). In macrophages the infectivity rate remained low with both virus strains (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1B</a>). The data indicates that DCs are more permissive to the Asian ZIKV strains, whereas macrophages show low susceptibility to both Asian and African ZIKV strains.</p> </div> <div class="replicationofzikvinhumandcsandmacrophages" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Replication of ZIKV in human DCs and macrophages</div> <p id="Par8">As human DCs and macrophages were found to be rather weakly permissive to ZIKV infection even with an extremely high doses of viruses, we systematically evaluated the replication efficiency of the Asian lineage fetal brain isolate GWUH strain and the low passage African lineage strain #976 in these cell types. At high MOI values of 75 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell, viral RNA and protein expression readily increased with peak values seen at 24–48 h p.i. in DCs and at 48–72 h p.i. in macrophages (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2A,B</a>). The Asian lineage GWUH Zika virus replicated better in DCs compared to that in macrophages, and strong viral protein expression was seen in infected DCs. Western blot analysis showed that the #976 virus replicated to some extent both in DCs and macrophages (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2B</a>). Altogether, by comparing the ZIKV strains from African and Asian lineages, the data indicates that different ZIKV strains show clear differences in their replication and viral RNA and protein expression patterns in primary human leukocytes. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span></a></div>   <p>Comparison of virus replication in human DCs and macrophages infected with Asian and African lineage ZIKV strains.

(<b>C</b>) For the measurement of infectious ZIKV production into cell supernatants, cells were infected with low doses (MOI values 0.2, 1 or 5 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell) of GWUH or #976 strains followed by collection of cell culture supernatants at times indicated in the figure. Viral titers were measured from the supernatant samples using the end-point dilution assay in Vero E6 cells (TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml) and the virus titers were calculated using the Spearman-Karber method.

To analyze the productivity of the infection, cell culture supernatants were collected at different time points after infection and viral titers were determined in Vero E6 cells with an end-point dilution assay. Already at 24 h after the infection, GWUH virus-infected DCs were found to produce high levels of infectious viruses and the viral titers ranged from 10<sup>4</sup> to almost 10<sup>7</sup>/ml depending on the input MOI values (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2C</a>). In #976 virus-infected DCs the virus production was slower and the amount of secreted viruses continued to increase up to 96 h after infection reaching TCID<sub>50</sub> values of 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>/ml (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2C</a>).

Even though there were differences in the replication of ZIKV in cells obtained from different blood donors, ZIKV was able to replicate both in DCs and macrophages.

Activation of innate cytokine responses in ZIKV-infected human DCs and macrophages</div> <p id="Par10">Since the Asian lineage ZIKV GWUH appeared to grow well in DCs but inefficiently in macrophages, and the African lineage ZIKV #976 showed weak replication in both cell types, we addressed the question whether these viruses would also show differences in innate immune responses they induced. With a high MOI infection of 75 TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml both viruses induced IFN-λ1, IFN-β and CXCL10 mRNA expression relatively well in DCs with GWUH strain showing ca. 10-fold higher cytokine mRNA levels than the African #976 strain (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). In macrophages, instead, the infection with the African ZIKV #976 strain led to somewhat higher IFN-λ1, IFN-β and CXCL10 mRNA expression levels as compared to those induced by the GWUH strain. It is of interest that the fold induction of cytokine mRNAs by the #976 strain was at similar levels in DCs and macrophages, while there was a dramatic difference in GWUH virus induced responses between DCs and macrophages in favor of DCs (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Altogether, cytokine gene expression levels seemed to follow viral RNA expression patterns (compare Figs <a href="#Fig2">2</a> and <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Interestingly, type I and type III IFN-inducible MxA gene expression did not show very dramatic differencies between the viruses and cell types, which is likely explained by the fact that in primary human leukocytes MxA gene is induced with very low doses of IFNs<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a>,<a href="#CR22">22</a></sup>. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 3</span></a></div>   <p>Differential induction of cytokine mRNA expression in human DCs and macrophages infected with Asian and African lineage ZIKV strains.

Activation of IRF3 and STAT2 signaling molecules in ZIKV-infected human DCs and macrophages</div> <p id="Par12">Since both the Asian and African lineage Zika viruses induced cytokine gene expression in human DCs and also weakly in macrophages, we analyzed the level of phosphorylation of IRF3 and STAT2 in response to ZIKV infection. In addition, the expression of IRF3, STAT2 and antiviral MxA proteins were also analysed. In Asian lineage GWUH virus-infected DCs, we could only detect a very weak signal corresponding to the phosphorylated form of IRF3 (P-IRF3), while in influenza A virus-infected cells (a positive control) P-IRF3 was readily detectable (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5A</a>). Starting at 24 h after infection, we observed the appearance of phospho-STAT2 (P-STAT2) and an enhanced expression of STAT2, MxA and ZIKV NS5 proteins. In DCs the African #976 ZIKV strain was also able to induce the phosphorylation of STAT2 (P-STAT2) but no P-IRF3 was detectable. The expression of STAT2, MxA and ZIKV NS5 protein was enhanced starting at 24 h after infection with the #976 virus. As a whole, the observation is indicative of efficient type I and type III IFN secretion (IFN-α/β and IFN-λs, respectively), which are known to activate and phosphorylate STAT2 and enhance the expression of STAT2 and MxA, which are well-known IFN-inducible genes<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a>,<a href="#CR23">23</a></sup>. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 5</span></a></div>   <p>Expression of signaling molecules and antiviral proteins in ZIKV-infected human DCs and macrophages. Human primary (<b>A</b>) DCs and (<b>B</b>) macrophages were infected with GWUH or #976 ZIKV strains at a MOI of 75 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell and the cells from four individual blood donors were collected at different time points after infection, pooled and cellular protein samples were prepared for immunoblotting.

The expression levels of phospho-IRF3 (P-IRF3), IRF3, phospho-STAT2 (P-STAT2), STAT2 and antiviral MxA proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. The expression of ZIKV NS5 protein was analyzed for visualizing the virus replication with ZIKV-infected DCs and macrophages. ZIKV infected (GWUH) Vero E6 cell lysate functioned as a positive control, and GAPDH and β-Actin were stained as loading controls.

Interestingly, in macrophages, the expression of total IRF3 or STAT2 protein levels seemed to be reduced at 2 and 6 h after infection with both types of viruses (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5B</a>). However, at later times of infection (24–48 h) the expression of IRF3 returned back to basal levels and the expression of STAT2 was clearly enhanced. An early IRF3 and STAT2 degradation was induced by both the African #976 and the Asian GWUH strains irrespective of their differential growth or cytokine responsiveness in macrophages (Figs <a href="#Fig1">1</a>–<a href="#Fig4">4</a>). In addition, STAT2 was phosphorylated and the expression of both STAT2 and MxA proteins was seen starting at 24 h after the infection with either one of the viruses indicating that at least some IFN production took place in macrophages in response to ZIKV infection (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5B</a>). It was of interest that some P-STAT2 was detectable in macrophages at 2–6 h after infection with the #976 virus (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5B</a> right panel). This could be due to residual amounts of IFNs in Vero E6 cell-produced ZIKV stocks, albeit Vero cells are considered to be IFN-deficient<sup><a href="#CR24">24</a></sup>. Indeed, some IFN-λ1 (&amp;lt;100 pg/ml) was detectable by IFN-specific EIA in ZIKV stocks.

In ZIKV-infected macrophages, the expression of viral RNA was increased to some extent, but the levels remained much lower (one log) compared to viral RNA levels seen in DCs (Fig. <a href="#Fig6">6A</a>).

ZIKV is highly sensitive to the antiviral actions of type I IFNs</div> <p id="Par16">Next, we addressed the question whether the recent Asian lineage Zika viruses are sensitive to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs (IFN-β). Human DCs or macrophages were pretreated with recombinant human IFN-β with 10 or 100 IU/ml followed by infection with GWUH ZIKV (MOI 2). At 24, 48 and 72 h after the infection cells were collected, total cellular RNA was isolated and ZIKV RNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Pretreatment with as low as 10 IU/ml of IFN-β led to almost complete inhibition of ZIKV replication in DCs (Fig. <a href="#Fig7">7A</a>). In macrophages, ZIKV replication was also dramatically reduced by IFN-β pretreatment even though some residual viral RNA expression remained (Fig. <a href="#Fig7">7B</a>).

Discussion</div> <p id="Par18">The ZIKV epidemic in the Americas and its association with congenital defects like microcephaly raised a global infection alert. The characterization of ZIKV infection and the immune regulation induced by the infection have been studied in different <i>in vitro</i> cell lines as well as in type I IFN receptor knockout mouse model<sup><a href="#CR27">27</a></sup>. However, the studies in primary human immune cell models have remained rare. In the present study, we have demonstrated that virus strains from different ZIKV lineages show differential replication capacity and ability to induce innate immune responses in human monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages. We observed a productive infection in DCs with a recent epidemic ZIKV strain, while virus replication remained at a very low level in human macrophages as noted by low viral RNA and protein expression. Despite that, a clear antiviral state was likely established in response to virus infection as we observed marked MxA expression in macrophages infected with the Asian Zika virus strain. However, both cell types were as permissive to the African lineage virus and virus replication led to the activation of innate immune responses. Thus, we observed clear differences in virus strains of differential evolutionary origin in their ability to replicate and induce innate immune responses in primary human immune cells.</p> <p id="Par19">The reports of human infections with ZIKV remained sporadic until the outbreak in Yap Island in 2007 which proceeded with a rapid virus spread through the Pacific Islands to Southern and Central Americas in 2013–2015<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a>,<a href="#CR13">13</a></sup>. The absence of monkeys in the French Polynesian islands suggests that humans must have served as the amplification host for ZIKV during that epidemic<sup><a href="#CR28">28</a></sup>. The possibility that birds could transfer the virus along their migration routes for long distances is still unclear<sup><a href="#CR29">29</a></sup>. Also, the neurotropic clinical picture of ZIKV infection suggests that the increased pathogenicity may, at least partly, be due to evolutionary changes in the virus. In the present study, our goal was to compare the infection of a historical, low passage African strain and two recent epidemic strains, the other one of which was isolated from fetal brains. Previously, it has been shown that the fetal brain isolate GWUH has a replicative advantage over other related epidemic strains or the prototype African strain MR766 in some cell lines, such as in glioma cells or in microvascular endothelial cells of the newborn<sup><a href="#CR30">30</a></sup>. The GWUH strain has 10 amino acid differences from the HPF strain<sup><a href="#CR30">30</a></sup>, the other Asian strain used in the present study. However, these changes apparently did not affect the growth properties of the viruses in immune cells since both viruses showed similar growth kinetics and comparable innate immune responses (Fig. <a href="#Fig6">6</a>). This suggests that although the GWUH virus strain was isolated from the brains and it was likely adapted to fetal neuronal cells, it still maintains the ability to replicate in adult peripheral blood cells. The prototype African strain MR766 has been passaged several times in various laboratory models (suckling mouse brains and cell lines) and thus the virus shows adaptation to cell culture environment<sup><a href="#CR31">31</a></sup>. Therefore, we used another ancestral African lineage isolate, #976 which was available as a low passage mouse brain isolate (3 passages) followed by cultivation in Vero E6 cells (4 passages). This virus, which was initially a monkey isolate, showed replication in both DCs and macrophages in contrast to the recent epidemic Asian strains which showed attenuated replication in human macrophages (Figs <a href="#Fig1">1</a>–<a href="#Fig2">2</a>). In line with this, the only available studies on human blood-derived macrophages show that this cell model is permissive to a recent ZIKV strain (PRVABC59)<sup><a href="#CR32">32</a>,<a href="#CR33">33</a></sup>. Moreover, Khaibouillina and co-workers compared the infectivity of African and Asian strains and found, in accordance with us, a higher susceptibility of macrophages to the African ZIKV strain<sup><a href="#CR32">32</a></sup>. In DCs, Bowen and co-workers observed a faster infection kinetics with the African strain compared to that of the Asian lineage virus<sup><a href="#CR17">17</a></sup>. However, Vielle and co-workers did not find lineage-specific differences in infection profiles<sup><a href="#CR16">16</a></sup>. In our study, GWUH and #976 both induced IFN gene expression and cytokine secretion correlated with the magnitude of virus replication, but antiviral MxA expression was observed at similar levels (Figs <a href="#Fig3">3</a>–<a href="#Fig5">5</a>). Similar findings were reported by Bowen and co-workers although they showed reduced IFN secretion suggesting that ZIKV could block the translation of IFN mRNAs but yet induce an antiviral state<sup><a href="#CR17">17</a></sup>. This observation can, however, be explained by a possibility that small amounts of secreted type I and type III IFNs were rapidly used up by the cells to induce an antiviral response. Our data rather points to that direction since ZIKV induced IFN gene expression at a much lower level as compared to our positive control virus, influenza A virus, but yet the expression of antiviral MxA protein was readily induced by both viruses. It is of note that in the study of Bowen and co-workers a cell culture-adapted MR766 strain was used and thus the comparison to low passage epidemic strains may be difficult. Collectively, the published and our data indicate that ZIKV is able to induce IFN and IFN-induced antiviral gene expression in human immune cells, but the recent Asian-American lineage ZIKV strains have evolved to show restricted replication in human macrophages.</p> <p id="Par20">Given that the maternal ZIKV infection can be transmitted vertically to the developing fetus<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a>,<a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>, several studies have thus focused on identifying the target cells of ZIKV infection in the placenta and the uterus. Several placental cell types have been shown to be permissive to ZIKV infection, including placental fibroblast, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), placental trophoblasts and placental macrophages (Höfbauer cells)<sup><a href="#CR34">34</a></sup>. Interestingly, human placental macrophages showed a more productive infection with recent epidemic ZIKV strains compared with the placental trophoblasts<sup><a href="#CR35">35</a></sup>, which have been postulated to transmit resistance to ZIKV infection both in an autocrine and paracrine manner by secreting antiviral IFN-λ1<sup><a href="#CR36">36</a></sup>. There is evidence for an important role of IFN-λs in epithelial/endothelial-immune cell barrier against several human viral pathogens, including Dengue virus<sup><a href="#CR37">37</a></sup>, influenza A virus<sup><a href="#CR38">38</a></sup>, as well as other viruses infecting the respiratory<sup><a href="#CR39">39</a></sup> or gastrointestinal tract<sup><a href="#CR40">40</a></sup>. In accordance with previous studies on macrophages<sup><a href="#CR32">32</a>,<a href="#CR33">33</a></sup>, we also found out that human blood monocyte-derived macrophages can be infected with recent ZIKV isolates, even though the level of virus replication and host IFN gene expression remains at a very low level. Quicke and colleagues showed that placental macrophages were highly permissive to the epidemic ZIKV strains which induced the production of IFNs<sup><a href="#CR35">35</a></sup>. In addition, the study by Foo and co-workers shows that during pregnancy, the primary target cells for ZIKV infection in <i>in vitro</i> whole blood cell infection are CD14+ monocytes<sup><a href="#CR41">41</a></sup>. Furthermore, the same authors demonstrated that an Asian lineage ZIKV infection promoted the differentiation of non-classical M2-type, IL-10-expressing immunosuppressive monocytes by inhibiting the IFN pathway. However, the infection with an African ZIKV strain led to monocyte differentiation to M1-type inflammatory responses with increased IFN-induced CXCL10 production<sup><a href="#CR41">41</a></sup>. This is well in line with our macrophage results, where the early African lineage virus was able to induce innate immune responses (IFN-λ1, IFN-β and CXCL10 expression) but innate immunity was more weakly induced by the Asian ZIKV strain (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). These findings may provide insights into immunological differences between early African and recent Asian-American ZIKV strains which may be associated with increased frequency of congenital infections.</p> <p id="Par21">There is evidence that the primary target cells of ZIKV infection, skin fibroblasts and DCs are highly permissive to ZIKV, but yet the infection induces only weak immune responses<sup><a href="#CR16">16</a>–<a href="#CR18">18</a></sup>. This suggests that ZIKV must have efficient ways to antagonize virus-induced IFN signaling. Recent studies from many groups have postulated different molecular mechanisms by which ZIKV evades host’s IFN-mediated antiviral protection during the infection. The most convincing evidence is that ZIKV NS5 is interfering with IFN signaling by inducing the degradation of STAT2 protein. Studies by Kumar and co-workers with an Asian lineage virus HPF, Grant and co-workers with an African lineage virus MR766 and Hertzog and colleagues with an Asian lineage fetal brain-isolate, have shown that NS5 mediates the proteasomal degradation of STAT2 in human cell lines<sup><a href="#CR42">42</a>–<a href="#CR44">44</a></sup>. In productive ZIKV infection, STAT2 degradation has been shown to occur in Vero cells<sup><a href="#CR43">43</a></sup> and in human lung epithelial A549 and fetal astrocyte HFA cells<sup><a href="#CR42">42</a></sup>. In contrast to these observations, Bowen and colleagues reported a lack of STAT2 degradation in live infection in human A549 cells or in human DCs. In fact, the authors observed an increase in STAT2 levels together with other IFN-stimulated genes during ZIKV infection<sup><a href="#CR17">17</a></sup>. However, they reported a significant inhibition of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, which was also similarly observed in the case of STAT1 in the study by Hertzog and colleagues<sup><a href="#CR17">17</a>,<a href="#CR44">44</a></sup>. In our study, we saw a clear increase in STAT2 levels together with IFN-induced MxA expression in DCs, which was likely due to ZIKV induced type I and type III IFNs at late time points of infection. The phosphorylated form of STAT2 appeared at 24 h and peaked at 48 h p.i. and then gradually reduced during a 96 h follow-up (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5A</a>). Before the reduction in STAT2 activation, the expression of viral proteins was observed (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5A</a>), suggesting that in primary human DCs ZIKV infection is leading to down-regulation of STAT signaling. The role of STAT2 in the pathogenesis of ZIKV has now been proven also with STAT2 knock-out mouse and hamster models<sup><a href="#CR45">45</a>,<a href="#CR46">46</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par22">Surprisingly, we observed IRF3 and STAT2 degradation in macrophages at early times of ZIKV infection. This degradation was evident for both African and Asian strains. Macrophages are professional phagocytic cells, and viral recognition leads to an antiviral response including the activation of phagocytosis of the virus and phagolysosome activation. ZIKV NS5 has been associated with proteasomal degradation of STAT2, but this takes place only after viral NS5 protein is expressed<sup><a href="#CR42">42</a>–<a href="#CR44">44</a></sup>. It was of interest that the degradation of IRF3 and STAT2 in macrophages took place at early hours of ZIKV infection, clearly before viral protein expression occurred (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5B</a>). This suggests, that during the ZIKV entry process, the virus is likely activating the host proteasome/lysosome pathways. This finding could provide insights into a completely new evasion strategy of ZIKV where the early events of ZIKV entry trigger the degradation of innate signaling molecules. Other flaviviruses have been shown to utilize various immune evasion strategies in addition of inhibiting the signal transduction by non-structural proteins. For instance, Dengue and Tick-borne encephalitis viruses have been shown to use specific membrane vesicle structures to hide viral replication products in order to evade the host recognition<sup><a href="#CR47">47</a>,<a href="#CR48">48</a></sup>. Further studies are warranted to investigate the mechanisms of degradation of host signaling molecules during the early phases of ZIKV infection in human macrophages.</p> <p id="Par23">An early degradation of IRF3 and other molecules regulating pathogen recognition could lead to impaired IFN responses during ZIKV infection. In addition of blocking IFN signaling via NS5-mediated degradation of STAT2, several studies have reported an inhibition of RLR signaling suggesting another evasion strategy for ZIKV. With promoter-reporter assays some ZIKV proteins, especially that of NS5 have been associated with an inhibition of IFN gene expression<sup><a href="#CR42">42</a>,<a href="#CR44">44</a></sup>. NS1 and NS4B have also been reported to inhibit RLR-mediated IFN gene expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3<sup><a href="#CR49">49</a></sup>. Thus, the exact molecular mechanisms by which ZIKV is interfering with IFN induction and IFN signaling still needs further analysis in order to understand the pathogenicity of ZIKV and identifying the targets for therapeutic interventions in severe ZIKV infections.</p> <p id="Par24">In summary, we show here that recent epidemic Zika virus strains replicate very well in human DCs with strong IFN induction, but their replication is attenuated in macrophages likely leading to impaired host innate immune responses. The infection rate of a historical African ZIKV strain, instead, remains low in both human DCs and macrophages, and the virus activates relatively weak IFN-induced antiviral responses in these cells. In conclusion, our findings indicates that ZIKV evolution has led to cell-type specific differences in the infectivity leading to differential regulation of host innate immune responses in humans.</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
