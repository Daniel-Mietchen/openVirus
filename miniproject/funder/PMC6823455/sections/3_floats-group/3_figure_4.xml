  <p>Production of IFNs from ZIKV-infected DCs. For the measurement of secreted IFN-λ1 and IFN-α protein levels with enzyme immunoassay (EIA), cell culture supernatants were collected at different times after infection with GWUH or #976 strains at MOI of 75 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell. The samples were analysed in duplicates in EIA assay. The supernatants from ZIKV-infected DCs (obtained from 4 donors) were analysed separately and the results are presented as the mean values +/− SEM and the data of individual donors are shown with different symbols.
