  <p>Susceptibility of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages to fetal brain-isolated Asian lineage ZIKV and historical African lineage ZIKV infection. (
   <bold>A</bold>)  Phylogenetic analysis of complete coding regions of the Asian and African ZIKV strains used in this study. Maximum Likelihood tree based on Tamura-Nei model with bootstrap support of 1000 replicates constructed using MEGA7 is drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The percentage of replicate trees clustered together is shown next to the branches. Viral strains are shown with their name and place of origin. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Flow cytometric and fluorescence microscopic analysis of ZIKV-infected DCs or macrophages. Cells were infected with Asian lineage GWUH or African lineage #976 strains at high MOI values of 25, 75 or 225 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell and the cells were fixed at 48 h after infection. Data is presented as mean +/− SEM of cells generated from 4 independent blood donors. Individual donors are shown with different symbols. Immunofluorescence images of representative mock and GWUH-infected cells at a MOI of 225 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell. Blue: DAPI, green:anti-ZIKV NS3 antibody staining. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Representative histogram patterns from flow cytometric analysis of GWUH or #976 virus-infected DCs from one donor.
