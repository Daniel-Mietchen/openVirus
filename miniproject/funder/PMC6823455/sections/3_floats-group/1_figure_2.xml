  <p>Comparison of virus replication in human DCs and macrophages infected with Asian and African lineage ZIKV strains. The Asian lineage GWUH strain or the African lineage #976 ZIKV strain was used to separately infect human DCs or macrophages from four different donors. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Cells were infected by the viruses at MOI of 75 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell and collected at different times after infection as indicated in the figure. (
   <bold>A</bold>) ZIKV RNA expression was quantitated by qRT-PCR using NS5 gene-specific probes. Data is presented as mean +/− SEM from four individual donors and a representative experiment out of two is shown. (
   <bold>B</bold>) ZIKV-infected cells from the same 4 donors were collected at different times after infection, cells were pooled and proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and stained with anti-NS5 and anti-β-Actin antibodies. ZIKV-infected Vero E6 cell extract was used as a positive control in immunoblotting. (
   <bold>C</bold>) For the measurement of infectious ZIKV production into cell supernatants, cells were infected with low doses (MOI values 0.2, 1 or 5 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/cell) of GWUH or #976 strains followed by collection of cell culture supernatants at times indicated in the figure. Viral titers were measured from the supernatant samples using the end-point dilution assay in Vero E6 cells (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/ml) and the virus titers were calculated using the Spearman-Karber method. Results represent the means +/− SEM from DC or macrophage cultures from four different blood donors.
