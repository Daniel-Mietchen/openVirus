 </sup>. Initially, the ZIKV appearance was restricted to certain areas in Africa and later on in Asia, but in recent years the virus has spread widely in the tropical and subtropical areas in the world. The virus follows well the geographic distribution of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species mosquitoes such as 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegyptii</italic>, which are the vectors for other important flaviviruses as well. During the last ten years, ZIKV spread to Southeast Asia and the Polynesian Islands followed by an extremely rapid spread of the virus in Southern and Central America in 2015–2016, including the southern parts of the United States

 </sup>. During its global spread, the virus has undergone marked genetic evolution and presently ZIKV strains have been classified as East African, West African and Asian lineages, the latter of which includes the virus strains isolated in the Americas

 </sup>. At present, there is little information whether the viruses from different lineages show significant differences in pathogenesis or in their ability to replicate in human cells.
