<p id="Par34">Virus-infected cells were harvested and total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) including DNase digestion (RNase-free DNase kit, Qiagen). One Âµg of total cellular RNA was transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamers as primers. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix and Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). The ZIKV NS5 specific qRT-PCR primers used were modified from Faye

Gene expression data is presented as a relative gene expression in relation to unstimulated samples in order to calculate the fold changes seen in infection experiments.
