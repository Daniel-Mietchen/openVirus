<p id="Par32">For immunofluorescence microscopy cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h and infected with ZIKV as indicated in the figure legends. After infection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at RT for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min before staining with anti-ZIKV antisera. Polyclonal rabbit or guinea pig immune sera was used at a dilution of 1:200 for staining the coverslips at RT for 1 h. FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-guinea pig antibodies (Invitrogen) were used in secondary staining. NucBlue Fixed Cell Ready Probes reagent (Life Technologies, DAPI) was added to secondary antibody staining solutions and slides were analyzed with fluorescence microscopy.</p>
