 <italic>Ifnar-1</italic>−/− mouse, both expressing 
 <italic>Mx1</italic>, were kindly provided by Prof. P. Staeheli, Freiburg, Germany. The primary MEFs were immortalized by using a rigorous passaging protocol to obtain wt and KO cell lines. The MEF cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (D-MEM) supplemented with 0.6 µg/ml penicillin, 60 µg/ml streptomycin, 2mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES and 10% FCS.
