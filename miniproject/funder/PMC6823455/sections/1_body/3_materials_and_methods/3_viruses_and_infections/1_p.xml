 </sup>, and it is a member of an Asian ZIKV genotype. Another recent Asian lineage Zika virus strain ZIKV-H-PF-2013 (GenBank number KJ776791.2), originally a clinical isolate from a viremic adult patient from French Polynesia in 2013, was obtained from European Virus Archive (EVA, Marseille, France). The low-passage-number strain ZIKV-#976-Uganda-1947 is a historical isolate from a monkey and it originates from the European Virus Archive goes global (EVAg, Ref: 007V-EVAg1585). ZIKV strains #976 was isolated in baby mouse brain in 1947 in Uganda and passaged 3 times, then in 1961 it was lyophilised and stored at −80 °C. Then, in 2017 the virus was rehydrated and inoculated on Vero E6 cells. It was propagated in Vero E6 cells 3 times before preparing virus stocks. All Zika virus strains were obtained as Vero E6 cultures and further propagated once for this study resulting in passages p2, p7 or p4 giving TCID
