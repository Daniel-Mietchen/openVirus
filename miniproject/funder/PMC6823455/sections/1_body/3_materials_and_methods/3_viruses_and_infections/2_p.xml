<p id="Par29">The differentiated DCs and macrophages and immortalized MEFs were infected with indicated ZIKV strains at different MOI values (based on TCID
 <sub>50</sub> Vero E6 cell titers), as indicated in the figures. After 2 h of infection at +37 °C fresh media was added and the cells were incubated for different times depending on each experiment. Recombinant human IFN-β (Schering-Plough) was used at 10 or 100 IU/ml cencentrations to pretreat DCs or macrophages for 16 h before ZIKV infection. Infective Zika viruses were handled strictly under Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 laboratory conditions at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Finland.
