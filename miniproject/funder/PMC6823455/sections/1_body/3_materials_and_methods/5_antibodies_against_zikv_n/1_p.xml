 <italic>NS3</italic> or 
 <italic>NS5</italic> genes were ordered from GenArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific), based on ZIKV GWUH sequence. The coding sequence was cloned into a baculoviral expression vector GST-pBVboost

 <italic>Sf</italic>9 cells were infected with GST-NS3 or GST-NS5 expressing baculoviruses for 42 h. Cells were collected, and ZIKV GST-NS3 or GST-NS5 were purified by glutathione Sepharose affinity chromatography and preparative SDS-PAGE as previously described

 </sup>. The rabbit or guinea pig polyclonal antibodies against ZIKV NS3 or NS5 antigens were prepared by immunizing the animals with purified antigens (50 μg/immunization) for 4 times at 2 week intervals together with Freund’s incomplete (FCA) adjuvant (Difco laboratories). The animals were bled 10 days after the last immunization.
