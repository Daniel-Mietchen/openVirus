<p id="Par19">The reports of human infections with ZIKV remained sporadic until the outbreak in Yap Island in 2007 which proceeded with a rapid virus spread through the Pacific Islands to Southern and Central Americas in 2013–2015

 </sup>. The absence of monkeys in the French Polynesian islands suggests that humans must have served as the amplification host for ZIKV during that epidemic

 </sup>. The possibility that birds could transfer the virus along their migration routes for long distances is still unclear
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Also, the neurotropic clinical picture of ZIKV infection suggests that the increased pathogenicity may, at least partly, be due to evolutionary changes in the virus. In the present study, our goal was to compare the infection of a historical, low passage African strain and two recent epidemic strains, the other one of which was isolated from fetal brains. Previously, it has been shown that the fetal brain isolate GWUH has a replicative advantage over other related epidemic strains or the prototype African strain MR766 in some cell lines, such as in glioma cells or in microvascular endothelial cells of the newborn
 <sup>

 </sup>. The GWUH strain has 10 amino acid differences from the HPF strain
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>, the other Asian strain used in the present study. However, these changes apparently did not affect the growth properties of the viruses in immune cells since both viruses showed similar growth kinetics and comparable innate immune responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This suggests that although the GWUH virus strain was isolated from the brains and it was likely adapted to fetal neuronal cells, it still maintains the ability to replicate in adult peripheral blood cells. The prototype African strain MR766 has been passaged several times in various laboratory models (suckling mouse brains and cell lines) and thus the virus shows adaptation to cell culture environment

 </sup>. Therefore, we used another ancestral African lineage isolate, #976 which was available as a low passage mouse brain isolate (3 passages) followed by cultivation in Vero E6 cells (4 passages). This virus, which was initially a monkey isolate, showed replication in both DCs and macrophages in contrast to the recent epidemic Asian strains which showed attenuated replication in human macrophages (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In line with this, the only available studies on human blood-derived macrophages show that this cell model is permissive to a recent ZIKV strain (PRVABC59)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, Khaibouillina and co-workers compared the infectivity of African and Asian strains and found, in accordance with us, a higher susceptibility of macrophages to the African ZIKV strain
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. In DCs, Bowen and co-workers observed a faster infection kinetics with the African strain compared to that of the Asian lineage virus
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. However, Vielle and co-workers did not find lineage-specific differences in infection profiles
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. In our study, GWUH and #976 both induced IFN gene expression and cytokine secretion correlated with the magnitude of virus replication, but antiviral MxA expression was observed at similar levels (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Similar findings were reported by Bowen and co-workers although they showed reduced IFN secretion suggesting that ZIKV could block the translation of IFN mRNAs but yet induce an antiviral state
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. This observation can, however, be explained by a possibility that small amounts of secreted type I and type III IFNs were rapidly used up by the cells to induce an antiviral response. Our data rather points to that direction since ZIKV induced IFN gene expression at a much lower level as compared to our positive control virus, influenza A virus, but yet the expression of antiviral MxA protein was readily induced by both viruses. It is of note that in the study of Bowen and co-workers a cell culture-adapted MR766 strain was used and thus the comparison to low passage epidemic strains may be difficult. Collectively, the published and our data indicate that ZIKV is able to induce IFN and IFN-induced antiviral gene expression in human immune cells, but the recent Asian-American lineage ZIKV strains have evolved to show restricted replication in human macrophages.
