<p id="Par23">An early degradation of IRF3 and other molecules regulating pathogen recognition could lead to impaired IFN responses during ZIKV infection. In addition of blocking IFN signaling via NS5-mediated degradation of STAT2, several studies have reported an inhibition of RLR signaling suggesting another evasion strategy for ZIKV. With promoter-reporter assays some ZIKV proteins, especially that of NS5 have been associated with an inhibition of IFN gene expression

 </sup>. NS1 and NS4B have also been reported to inhibit RLR-mediated IFN gene expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3
