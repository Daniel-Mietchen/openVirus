<p id="Par24">In summary, we show here that recent epidemic Zika virus strains replicate very well in human DCs with strong IFN induction, but their replication is attenuated in macrophages likely leading to impaired host innate immune responses. The infection rate of a historical African ZIKV strain, instead, remains low in both human DCs and macrophages, and the virus activates relatively weak IFN-induced antiviral responses in these cells. In conclusion, our findings indicates that ZIKV evolution has led to cell-type specific differences in the infectivity leading to differential regulation of host innate immune responses in humans.</p>
