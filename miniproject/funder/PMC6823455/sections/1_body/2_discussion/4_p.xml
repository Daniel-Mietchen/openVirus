<p id="Par21">There is evidence that the primary target cells of ZIKV infection, skin fibroblasts and DCs are highly permissive to ZIKV, but yet the infection induces only weak immune responses

 </sup>. This suggests that ZIKV must have efficient ways to antagonize virus-induced IFN signaling. Recent studies from many groups have postulated different molecular mechanisms by which ZIKV evades host’s IFN-mediated antiviral protection during the infection. The most convincing evidence is that ZIKV NS5 is interfering with IFN signaling by inducing the degradation of STAT2 protein. Studies by Kumar and co-workers with an Asian lineage virus HPF, Grant and co-workers with an African lineage virus MR766 and Hertzog and colleagues with an Asian lineage fetal brain-isolate, have shown that NS5 mediates the proteasomal degradation of STAT2 in human cell lines

 </sup>. In productive ZIKV infection, STAT2 degradation has been shown to occur in Vero cells

 </sup> and in human lung epithelial A549 and fetal astrocyte HFA cells

 </sup>. In contrast to these observations, Bowen and colleagues reported a lack of STAT2 degradation in live infection in human A549 cells or in human DCs. In fact, the authors observed an increase in STAT2 levels together with other IFN-stimulated genes during ZIKV infection

 </sup>. However, they reported a significant inhibition of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, which was also similarly observed in the case of STAT1 in the study by Hertzog and colleagues

 </sup>. In our study, we saw a clear increase in STAT2 levels together with IFN-induced MxA expression in DCs, which was likely due to ZIKV induced type I and type III IFNs at late time points of infection. The phosphorylated form of STAT2 appeared at 24 h and peaked at 48 h p.i. and then gradually reduced during a 96 h follow-up (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). Before the reduction in STAT2 activation, the expression of viral proteins was observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>), suggesting that in primary human DCs ZIKV infection is leading to down-regulation of STAT signaling. The role of STAT2 in the pathogenesis of ZIKV has now been proven also with STAT2 knock-out mouse and hamster models
