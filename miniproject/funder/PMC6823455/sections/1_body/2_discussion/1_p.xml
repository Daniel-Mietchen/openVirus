<p id="Par18">The ZIKV epidemic in the Americas and its association with congenital defects like microcephaly raised a global infection alert. The characterization of ZIKV infection and the immune regulation induced by the infection have been studied in different

 </sup>. However, the studies in primary human immune cell models have remained rare. In the present study, we have demonstrated that virus strains from different ZIKV lineages show differential replication capacity and ability to induce innate immune responses in human monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages. We observed a productive infection in DCs with a recent epidemic ZIKV strain, while virus replication remained at a very low level in human macrophages as noted by low viral RNA and protein expression. Despite that, a clear antiviral state was likely established in response to virus infection as we observed marked MxA expression in macrophages infected with the Asian Zika virus strain. However, both cell types were as permissive to the African lineage virus and virus replication led to the activation of innate immune responses. Thus, we observed clear differences in virus strains of differential evolutionary origin in their ability to replicate and induce innate immune responses in primary human immune cells.
