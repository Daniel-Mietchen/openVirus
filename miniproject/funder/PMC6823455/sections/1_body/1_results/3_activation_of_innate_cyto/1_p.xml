<p id="Par10">Since the Asian lineage ZIKV GWUH appeared to grow well in DCs but inefficiently in macrophages, and the African lineage ZIKV #976 showed weak replication in both cell types, we addressed the question whether these viruses would also show differences in innate immune responses they induced. With a high MOI infection of 75 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml both viruses induced IFN-λ1, IFN-β and CXCL10 mRNA expression relatively well in DCs with GWUH strain showing ca. 10-fold higher cytokine mRNA levels than the African #976 strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In macrophages, instead, the infection with the African ZIKV #976 strain led to somewhat higher IFN-λ1, IFN-β and CXCL10 mRNA expression levels as compared to those induced by the GWUH strain. It is of interest that the fold induction of cytokine mRNAs by the #976 strain was at similar levels in DCs and macrophages, while there was a dramatic difference in GWUH virus induced responses between DCs and macrophages in favor of DCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Altogether, cytokine gene expression levels seemed to follow viral RNA expression patterns (compare Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Interestingly, type I and type III IFN-inducible MxA gene expression did not show very dramatic differencies between the viruses and cell types, which is likely explained by the fact that in primary human leukocytes MxA gene is induced with very low doses of IFNs
