<p id="Par15">Since the two analysed Asian lineage ZIKV strains appeared to replicate equally well in DCs and macrophages we analysed whether they also induced cytokine gene expression equally well. In DCs, both viruses were able to induce mRNA expression of IFN-λ1, IFN-β, CXCL10 and IFN-inducible MxA genes apparently at similar rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Induced cytokine mRNAs were seen already 6 h after infection and the induced levels peaked at 24–48 h p.i. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed induced cytokine and MxA mRNA levels to range from 100 to 1000-fold over the basal levels. However, in DCs ZIKV-induced cytokine mRNA levels remained approximately 10 to 100-fold lower levels compared with those induced by influenza A virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). It has to be pointed out that in general, influenza A virus is an excellent inducer of cytokine gene expression in human primary DCs and macrophages

 </sup>. In macrophages, the expression of cytokine genes remained close to the undetectable levels with both Asian lineage viruses (data not shown).
