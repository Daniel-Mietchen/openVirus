<p id="Par7">In order to define the susceptibility of human immune cells to ZIKV infection, we infected primary human monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages with the GWUH strain at MOI of 5 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/cell) and evaluated the frequency of virus-infected cells at 48 h post infection (p.i.). In this time point we saw hardly any virus-positive DCs by flow cytometric analysis or macrophage infection by immunofluorescent microscopy when an in-house produced anti-ZIKV NS3 specific antibody was used. The specificity and sensitivity of anti-ZIKV NS3-specific antibodies was excellent in GWUH-infected Vero E6 cells and no background staining was seen in immunofluorescence analysis (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To further evaluate ZIKV infection in DCs and macrophages we infected the cells with high doses of Asian lineage GWUH and African lineage #976 strains and analysed the percentage of virus-infected cells by immunofluorescence staining at 48 h p.i. In DCs very high doses of GWUH ZIKV(MOI 25-225) lead to a clearly detectable infection in 2–18% of the cells in different donors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). However, in African lineage ZIKV #976 virus-infected DCs, only a few percentage of cells showed evidence of virus protein expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>). In macrophages the infectivity rate remained low with both virus strains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The data indicates that DCs are more permissive to the Asian ZIKV strains, whereas macrophages show low susceptibility to both Asian and African ZIKV strains.
