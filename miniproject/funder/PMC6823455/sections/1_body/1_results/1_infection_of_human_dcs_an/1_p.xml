<p id="Par6">In this study we analysed the infection profiles of ZIKV strains of African and Asian lineages in human innate immune cell models. A recent Asian lineage ZIKV strain (infection contracted in Guatemala) isolated from fetal brains (ZIKV-FB-GWUH-2016

 </sup>), another Asian strain isolated from a viremic adult patient who contracted the infection in French Polynesia (ZIKV-H-PF-2013) and an ancestor, low-passage African strain (ZIKV-#976-Uganda-1947) were used. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, GWUH is an Asian lineage virus and genetically very closely related to the 2015 epidemic Guatemala strains
