<p id="Par16">Next, we addressed the question whether the recent Asian lineage Zika viruses are sensitive to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs (IFN-β). Human DCs or macrophages were pretreated with recombinant human IFN-β with 10 or 100 IU/ml followed by infection with GWUH ZIKV (MOI 2). At 24, 48 and 72 h after the infection cells were collected, total cellular RNA was isolated and ZIKV RNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Pretreatment with as low as 10 IU/ml of IFN-β led to almost complete inhibition of ZIKV replication in DCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>). In macrophages, ZIKV replication was also dramatically reduced by IFN-β pretreatment even though some residual viral RNA expression remained (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). This suggests that, in accordance with previous studies done in human DCs, human skin fibroblasts and human lung epithelial cell line A549
