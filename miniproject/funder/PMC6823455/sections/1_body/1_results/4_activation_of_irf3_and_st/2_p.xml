<p id="Par13">In macrophages, we could not find any detectable P-IRF3 in GWUH or #976 ZIKV-infected cells. Interestingly, in macrophages, the expression of total IRF3 or STAT2 protein levels seemed to be reduced at 2 and 6 h after infection with both types of viruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). However, at later times of infection (24–48 h) the expression of IRF3 returned back to basal levels and the expression of STAT2 was clearly enhanced. An early IRF3 and STAT2 degradation was induced by both the African #976 and the Asian GWUH strains irrespective of their differential growth or cytokine responsiveness in macrophages (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In addition, STAT2 was phosphorylated and the expression of both STAT2 and MxA proteins was seen starting at 24 h after the infection with either one of the viruses indicating that at least some IFN production took place in macrophages in response to ZIKV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). It was of interest that some P-STAT2 was detectable in macrophages at 2–6 h after infection with the #976 virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref> right panel). This could be due to residual amounts of IFNs in Vero E6 cell-produced ZIKV stocks, albeit Vero cells are considered to be IFN-deficient

 </sup>. Indeed, some IFN-λ1 (&lt;100 pg/ml) was detectable by IFN-specific EIA in ZIKV stocks. In most experiments the stocks were diluted to levels where STAT2 phosphorylation did not take place (Fig.
