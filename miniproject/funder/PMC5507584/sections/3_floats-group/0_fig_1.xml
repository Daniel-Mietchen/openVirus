  <title>Viral infection, dissemination, transmission (A-C) and saliva viral loads (D) at 3 and 7 days after 
   <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> (LEU) and 
   <italic>Aedes terrens</italic> (TER) from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, challenge with two CHIKV isolates of the two genotypes currently circulating in the Americas, CHIKV-115 (ESCA genotype) and CHIKV_SM (Asian genotype) when provided at a titer of 10

   <sup>6.5</sup> PFU/mL, respectively.

  <p>Infection rate (IR) refers to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected bodies among tested females. Disseminated infection rate (DIR) corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected heads among the previously detected infected mosquitoes (i.e, abdomen/thorax positive). Transmission rate (TR) represents the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among mosquitoes with disseminated infection. Transmission efficiency (TE) represents the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among the initial number of females tested [
   <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The number of mosquitoes analyzed for each vector competence rate is given on top of bars. The horizontal black bars (in panel D) represent the mean viral loads.
