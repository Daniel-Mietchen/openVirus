 <italic>leucocelaenus</italic> was able to transmit infectious viral particles as rapidly as 3 dpi (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>terrens</italic> and reached values as high as 69.5 to 76.2% in

 <italic>leucocelaenus</italic> than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>terrens</italic> when infected with CHIKV_SM (p = 0.01). When evaluating the same mosquito species, the saliva viral load did not differ between the two CHIKV isolates, but when infected with the CHIKV_115, the expectorated saliva viral load was higher in 
 <italic>H</italic>g. 
 <italic>leucocelaenus</italic> at 7 dpi than at 3 dpi (p = 0.008).
