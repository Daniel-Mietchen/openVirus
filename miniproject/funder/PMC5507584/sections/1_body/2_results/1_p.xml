 <italic>terrens</italic> exhibited high infection and dissemination rates with both CHIKV isolates at 7 dpi, demonstrating that they are CHIKV susceptible, regardless of the lineage (

 <italic>terrens</italic> were already infected with the CHIKV_115 at 3 dpi, when 66.6 and 60% had disseminated infection, respectively. As expected, viral dissemination increased from 3 dpi to 7dpi (
