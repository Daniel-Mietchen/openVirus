<p>However, the establishment of a CHIKV sylvatic transmission cycle in the Americas depends upon the susceptibility of local NHPs to this virus, which has not been assessed yet. Wild NHPs were detected naturally infected with CHIKV in Malaysia, which suggested that a sylvatic, zoonotic transmission cycle could also occur in Asia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, if Neotropical NHPs can amplify CHIKV and produce sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes, the establishment of a sylvatic CHIKV cycle in the Americas could occur. The establishment of a CHIKV sylvatic transmission cycle in the New World would have immediate public health consequences as, so far, there are no efficient methods to control the enzootic circulation of any arboviruses. As learned from the case of YFV, the control of a potential zoonotic transmission of CHIKV in the Americas would be extremely challenging. An effective fight against tree hole harboring, canopy feeding mosquito vectors is not feasible, and there is still neither antiviral treatment nor a licensed vaccine to prevent infection in the case of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, surveillance programs need to be organized in the continent to determine whether CHIKV has initiated a sustainable zoonotic transmission, which should search for natural infections in NHPs and enzootic vectors, together with the investigation of neutralizing antibodies in NHPs and other sentinel vertebrates as well as people living near forests, especially in 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic>-free sites. Besides, mitigating CHIKV epidemics in suburban and rural areas intimately linked to the forested habitats is crucial to prevent virus establishment in the wild in the tropical Americas, if it is not already too late.
