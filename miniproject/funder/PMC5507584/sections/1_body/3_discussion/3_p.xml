<p>The ability to experimentally transmit the two lineages of CHIKV circulating in the Americas described herein for 
 <italic>H</italic>g. 
 <italic>leucocelaenus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>terrens</italic> might become a pivotal factor facilitating the establishment of CHIKV in a zoonotic cycle in the Americas. The current CHIKV outbreaks in the continental tropical Americas covering a large geographical range of competent sylvatic mosquitoes enhance the chances of CHIKV to approach the forests. Indeed, the transit of CHIKV viremic people combined with the vector competence of 
 <italic>H</italic>g. 
 <italic>leucocelaenus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>terrens</italic>, the large distribution of vectors and their biological and behavioural features suggests potential for CHIKV to become zoonotic in the continent. Additionally, high densities of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations, experimentally CHIKV transmission competent, in the transition zone between urban and forest environments possibly favor this phenomenon as well [
