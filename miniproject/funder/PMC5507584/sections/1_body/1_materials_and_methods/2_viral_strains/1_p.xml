<p>Female mosquitoes were challenged with two CHIKV isolates belonging to two distinct lineages: CHIKV 05.115 (CHIKV_115) isolated from La Réunion in 2005 belonging to the ECSA lineage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and CHIKV_20235 (CHIKV_SM) isolated from Saint-Martin Island in 2013 and belonging to the Asian lineage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They are phylogenetically related to strains circulating in Brazil and other American countries (17,25–28). CHIKV_115 and CHIKV_SM were isolated from human serum on

 <italic>albopictus</italic> C6/36 and Vero cells respectively, and viral stocks were produced following three passages in the respective cell lineage, then harvested and stored at -80°C until used for the mosquito experimental infection assays [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Virus isolates were provided by the French National Reference Centers for Arbovirus at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and in Marseille.
