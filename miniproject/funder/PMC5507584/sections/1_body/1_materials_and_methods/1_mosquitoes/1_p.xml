Eggs were collected in Parque Natural Municipal de Nova Iguaçu (PNMNI), an Atlantic forest conservation area in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (22°46’45”S 43°27’23”W), with 20 ovitraps suspended in the forest canopy at a height of 5-16m (median = 10m). Each ovitrap had three wooden paddles that were fortnightly changed from June to November 2016. The paddles were allowed to dry at room temperature, examined for egg number and stored in an insectary (26±1°C; 70±10% RH) until use. Eggs were hatched by immersing the paddles in dechlorinated tap water for two consecutive days. Larvae were reared in pans (~50 larvae/pan measuring 25x25x10cm) containing 1 liter of dechlorinated tap water, supplemented with yeast powder and shed leaves, renewed every 2–3 days. Adults were morphologically identified [
