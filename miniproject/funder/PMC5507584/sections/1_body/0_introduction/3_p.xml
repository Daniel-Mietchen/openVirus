<p>In the Americas however, autochthonous CHIKV transmission was only described in late 2013 in the Caribbean, the starting point of a large epidemic in the Americas [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. From December 2013 to August 2014, nearly 660,000 cases were reported in the New World, and autochthonous transmission was confirmed to occur in 33 American countries and territories, 27 of which were in the Caribbean, while only French Guiana and Brazil reported CHIKV transmission in continental South America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. If in 2014 the CHIKV epidemic was primarily in the Caribbean, in 2015 the virus was identified in multiple countries of Central and South Americas with 30 countries or territories reporting CHIKV cases. In 2015, Colombia alone recorded 51.3% of the 693,000 cases in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In 2016, South America reported 89.2% of the CHIKV cases in the Americas where the virus was detected in 42 countries or territories, including Brazil with nearly 76% of the 347,647 suspected cases recorded in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Remarkably in 2015 and 2016, the distribution of CHIKV cases has progressively moved towards the inland and the forested areas resulting in a significant overlap with the area of the sylvatic YFV transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible that CHIKV viremic people infected in the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> urban cycle were bitten by sylvatic primatophilic mosquitoes in the neighboring forests or forest fringe. Since these mosquitoes are competent species transmitting a viral strain capable of being amplified by American NHPs or other vertebrates, CHIKV may initiate a sylvatic cycle as did the YFV in the past. Actually, the tropical American forest is presently more receptive to CHIKV transmission than ever due to the expanding and frequent CHIKV epidemic waves recently reported in zones contiguous to the wild.
