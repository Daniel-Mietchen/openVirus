<p>Several arboviruses of public health importance such as yellow fever virus (YFV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and, more recently, Zika virus have spread from Africa to other continents. Coincidently in their historical cradle in Africa, these arboviruses are transmitted between non-human primates (NHP) by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, mostly belonging to the Old World 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> and 
 <italic>Diceromyia</italic> subgenera [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Due to the spread of the anthropophilic mosquito 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. (
 <italic>Stg</italic>.) 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> outside Africa and the transit of viremic people, likely perpetrated by the globalization of trades and travel, these viruses have invaded several continents and are considered a most important alarming public health threat [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Owing to the domestic, synanthropic and anthropophilic behavior of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, these arboviruses exploit urban and periurban ecosystems limiting transmission between 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and humans, originally in Africa and then the secondarily invaded continents such as Asia and the Americas [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, the only documented exception is YFV (Flaviviridae: 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), which after migrating from Africa to the Americas, has spread into the forest in the tropical and subtropical areas. There, the YFV found susceptible NHPs capable of developing high viremia to infect Neotropical wild canopy-dwelling mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> genera, initiating a sylvatic cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thereafter, YFV became a zoonotic arbovirus in the Americas as it was originally in Africa. The urban transmission of YFV has been eradicated from the Americas since the first half of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century, but each year YFV has victimized dozens of people in South America due to infections acquired from the sylvatic cycle. As YF vaccine is not adequately supplied and vaccination coverage is insufficient, the risk of YF transmission by the bite of infected wild mosquitoes remains a constant threat [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005698.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, as the control of the YFV enzootic circulation would be highly challenging, the enzootic spillover to an urban cycle has more than ever been feared due to great infestation by competent mosquito vectors—
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>—colonizing habitats near sylvatic foci [
