HFMD induced by EV71 can cause serious health problems and has been reported worldwide, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity of a formalin-inactivated HFMD vaccine using an EV71 strain (FI-EV71 C4a) isolated from a Korean patient. The vaccine candidate was evaluated in mice to determine the vaccination doses and vaccine schedules. BALB/c mice were intramuscularly administered 5, 10, or 20 &#x003bc;g FI-EV71 vaccine, followed by a booster 2 weeks later. EV71-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were induced and maintained until the end of the experimental period in all vaccinated groups. To determine the effectiveness of adjuvant for the EV71 vaccine, three adjuvants, i.e., aluminium hydroxide gel, monophosphoryl lipid A, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, were administered separately with the FI-EV71 vaccine to mice via the intramuscular route. Mice administered the FI-EV71 vaccine formulated with all three adjuvants induced a significantly increased antibody response compared with that of the single adjuvant groups. The vaccinated group with triple adjuvants exhibited more rapid induction of EV71-specific and neutralizing antibodies than the other groups. These results suggested that the role of adjuvant in inactivated vaccine was important for eliciting effective immune responses against EV71. In conclusion, our results showed that FI-EV71 was a potential candidate vaccine for prevention of EV71 infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Korea National Institute of Health (KR)</institution></funding-source><award-id>NIH 4800-4845-300</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants from the Korea National Institute of Health (grant no.

Most cases of HFMD do not result in serious complications; however, infection with enterovirus 71 (EV71) can cause a high rate of neurologic complications, including meningoencephalitis and pulmonary edema [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EV71 is a group of viruses that belongs to the <italic>Picorvaviridae</italic>, it is a non-enveloped, positive, single-stranded RNA virus and four structural capsid proteins, including VP1, VP2 and VP3 on the external surface of the virion and VP4 within the interior of the viral particle [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. EV71 is currently classified into 3 genotype, A, B and C by VP1. Genotype B and C are further divided into B1-B5 and C1-C5 genotypes. Since 1969, when EV71 was first described, outbreaks of HFMD caused by EV71 have occurred worldwide, particularly in the Asia-Pacific regions [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Large outbreaks in China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam have been reported in cyclical epidemics every 2 or 3 years. EV71 has also continued to circulate in Africa, Europe, and the USA and causes sporadic cases or small outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Several EV71 vaccine candidates, including inactivated virus vaccines, attenuated live virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and virus-like particle vaccines, have been developed [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Inactivated virus vaccines are the leading strategy for developing vaccines against enteroviruses, as exemplified by the successful commercialization of inactivated poliovirus vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Inactivated virus vaccines have the advantage of conservation of linear and conformational epitopes required for the humoral and cellular immune response. Several inactivated vaccine candidates have been developed and achieved the phase &#x02162; clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of inactivated virus vaccines against EV71, and clinical trials are already being performed in China, Taiwan, and Singapore [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Inactivated virus vaccines consist of virus particles that are cultured using animal cells and killed by chemical or physical methods. In order to induce antigenicity, it is necessary to use adjuvants and multiple inoculations with inactivated virus vaccines. Adjuvants are used to enhance the immune response against vaccines, resulting in higher amounts of antibodies and long lasting protection. Several different classes of adjuvants have been developed that can promote the immune response. Aluminium hydroxide gel (alum), MF59, and virosomes are licensed for use in human vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), CpG, imidazoquinolines, and flagellin have been tested in humans but are not yet licensed for use [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alum potentiates the immune response, thereby ensuring the potency and efficacy of typically sparingly available antigen. Alum is most commonly used in licensed vaccines due to enhancement of T helper (Th) 1-type immunity [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) is a derivative of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram-negative bacterial cell membranes, and stimulates toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Poly I:C is a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, which is used to mimic viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, poly I:C is associated with TLR3, which is expressed in the membranes of B-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells.</p><p>In this study, formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine (FI-EV71) derived from a patient who showed clinical signs of HFMD and belonged to the C4 subgenogroup was developed, and the efficacy of FI-EV71 with various adjuvants was evaluated in mice. Our results provide a foundation for the development of inactivated EV71 whole-virus vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethic statements</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the are and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health The animal protocol used in this study has been reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) on their ethical procedures and scientific care and approved (Approval Number KCDC-024-16-2A).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Vero cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a penicillin-streptomycin solution.

Among them, the predominant subgenogroup in Korea and China is C4 [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this study, the EV71 isolate belonging to the C4 subgenogroup was used to produce a formalin-inactivated vaccine, FI-EV71, and the efficacy according to antigen dosage and diverse adjuvants was evaluated. FI-EV71 induced specific immune responses in terms of high levels of neutralization antibody titers and IgG antibody titers in all groups of vaccinated mice administered 5, 10, or 20 &#x003bc;g antigen. In particular, mice administered 10 and 20 &#x003bc;g FI-EV71 showed rapid induction of neutralization antibody titers by single vaccination. The cell-mediated immune response against FI-EV71 was also induced, as demonstrated by high levels of cytokines in mice vaccinated with an antigen dose of 10 &#x003bc;g. Our current findings suggested that 10 &#x003bc;g FI-EV71 antigen resulted in optimal vaccine efficacy.</p><p>Inactivated vaccines can have low immunogenicity following vaccination, particularly when the viral antigen is used alone. However, combination of the inactivated vaccine with a suitable adjuvant enhances the immunogenicity of the vaccine [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, the effective adjuvant properties of FI-EV71 were evaluated in the vaccination of mice against EV71. The group administered FI-EV71 formulated with poly I:C adjuvant induced higher antibody titers than other groups vaccinated with a single adjuvant (alum or MPLA). Thus, the addition of poly I:C was critical for boosting neutralization antibodies against EV71. Moreover, administration of FI-EV71 with all three adjuvants strongly stimulated the production of systemic antibodies compared with that using single adjuvants.</p><p>Recent epidemics of HFMD have been reported to be caused by diverse subgenogroups of EV71 in Malaysia (B3 in 1997, B4 in 2000), Taiwan (C2 in 1998, B4 in 2000), Singapore (B4 in 2000), Vietnam (C5 in 2005), China (C4 in 2008), and Korea (C3 in 2000, C4 in 2009) [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, it is important for an EV71 candidate vaccine to induce crossreactive neutralization antibodies against heterologous EV71 strains. In the present study, FI-EV71 with adjuvant exhibited significant crossreactivity to B3, C2, C3, and C5, and the crossreactive neutralization antibody titers of mice vaccinated with FI-EV71 combined with all three adjuvants were higher than those of any other group. Taken together, these results indicated that FI-EV71 combined with adjuvants had broad protection potential against diverse enterovirus strains.</p><p>Several adjuvants for vaccination have been licensed in humans; in particular, the adjuvant alum has been widely used for many years [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In previous studies, diverse adjuvant mixtures were used in human vaccines, and the efficacy of these adjuvants was approved [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The AS01 adjuvant (GlaxoSmithKline), a combination of the immunostimulant MPL (the clinical grade form of MPLA) and the saponin QS-21, is used in licensed or candidate human vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The AS01 adjuvant directly affects the innate immune response to orchestrate the quality and intensity of the adaptive immune response to vaccine antigens [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. AS03 (squalene, Tween 80, and &#x003b1;-tocopherol) and AS04 (alum and MPL) adjuvants are the only adjuvant combinations licensed for use in human vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. AS03 is currently licensed for pandemic influenza vaccines and is used worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. AS03 has been successfully used to enhance the efficacy, immunogenicity, and crossprotection of pandemic influenza vaccines. Recently, the adjuvant formulation AS25 (AS03, MPL) was shown to induce greater immunogenicity for the influenza vaccine than AS03 [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Another combination adjuvant, AS04, is approved for use with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. When combined with AS04, the HPV vaccine induces higher antibody titers and long-term immune responses than that when the vaccine includes only alum adjuvant, as demonstrated in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The crossreactivity to heterologous HPV strains was also enhanced by AS04. Although the efficacy of combination adjuvants is higher than that of single adjuvants, the selection of suitable adjuvants for antigens is important for enhancing the antigen-specific immune response. Enhanced cytokine production is thought to contribute to EV71 pathogenesis in humans and mice [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Secretion of cytokines and chemokines after EV71 infection from patients with HFMD is essential for developing effective protection against the disease [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Th cells, particularly Th1 and Th2 cells, play a major role in humoral and cellular immune responses. Th1 cells induce the cytokines interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, which are capable of promoting T-cell cytotoxicity. Th2 cells have the capacity to produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13, which enhance the B-cell response. Activation of Th1 cells enhances the production of IgG2a, whereas IgG1 is produced by Th2 cells [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In general, inactivated virus vaccines induce the Th2 immune response via B-cell stimulation. In this study, FI-EV71 with adjuvant induced high levels of the IgG2a response. Moreover, cytokine analysis showed that several cytokines, including IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10, which are associated with Th2 cells, were elevated in the vaccinated group. Overall, FI-EV71 with adjuvants triggered a mixed Th1/Th2 response.</p><p>In summary, the formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine FI-EV71 significantly enhanced immunogenicity against EV71. Currently, clinical trials of inactivated EV71 vaccine are being performed in China, Taiwan, and Singapore [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The safety of the inactivated EV71 vaccine has already been confirmed in humans [<xref rid="pone.0178259.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this study, we showed that an EV71 vaccine combined with multiple adjuvants elicited strong immune responses in mice. However, the cell-mediated immune response of vaccinated mice using FI-EV71 with alum or MPLA as adjuvants was higher than that induced using all three adjuvants. Thus, furthers studies are needed to determine the optimal adjuvant(s) for FI-EV71 and to analyze efficacy in nonhuman primates in order to assess the potential of FI-EV71 as a vaccine candidate for humans. These results will provide valuable information for the development of an inactivated EV71 vaccine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178259.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>The neutralizing antibody responses by a formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine in mice.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178259.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0178259.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yip</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yuen</surname><given-names>KY</given-names></name>. <article-title>Human enterovirus 71 and hand, foot and mouth disease</article-title>. <source>Epidemiology and infection</source>. <year>2010</year>;<volume>138</volume>(<issue>8</issue>):<fpage>1071</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>89</lpage>.
