  <title>EV71-specific humoral immune responses induced by a formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine in mice.</title>
  <p>Mice were administered inactivated EV71 vaccine mixed with 500 μg for alum, 2 μg for MPLA, and 10 μg for poly I:C adjuvant or PBS as a control. (A) Titers of total IgG antibodies against EV71 viral particles were determined by ELISAs. (B) The levels of neutralization antibodies against EV71 were measured by endpoint dilution of serum in neutralization assays.</p>
