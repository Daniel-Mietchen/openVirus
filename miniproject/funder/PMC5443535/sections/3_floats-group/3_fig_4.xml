  <title>EV71-specific immune responses in serum samples from mice vaccinated with the formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine combined with diverse adjuvants.</title>
  <p>Mice were administered the inactivated EV71 vaccine mixed with 500 μg for alum, 2 μg for MPLA, and 10 μg for poly I:C adjuvant and measurement of neutralization antibody titer(A) and cross-reactivity of neutralization antibodies (B) by heterologous EV71 strains. Crossreactivity was determined using sera from mice at 16 weeks postvaccination. ***
