  <title>EV71-specific cell mediated immune responses induced by a formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine in mice.</title>
  <p>Mice were administered inactivated EV71 vaccine mixed with 500 μg for alum, 2 μg for MPLA, and 10 μg for poly I:C adjuvant or PBS as a control. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were isolated and stimulated with the EV71 vaccine. The supernatants of splenocytes were harvested at 48 h after stimulation and analyzed for cytokines using a multiplex system. Graphs show means + SEMs. *
