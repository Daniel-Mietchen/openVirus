  <title>EV71-specific immune responses in serum samples from mice vaccinated with the formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine combined with diverse adjuvants.</title>
  <p>Mice were administered the inactivated EV71 vaccine mixed with 500 μg for alum, 2 μg for MPLA, and 10 μg for poly I:C adjuvant. (A) The lgG antibody titer against EV71 was measured by ELISA at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. (B) IgG isotype analysis of EV71-specific IgGs in sera of mice at 8 weeks postvaccination. The IgG isotype graph shows means + SEMs. ***
