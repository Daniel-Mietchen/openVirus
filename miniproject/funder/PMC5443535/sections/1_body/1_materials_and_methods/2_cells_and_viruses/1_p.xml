<p>Vero cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbeccoâ€™s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a penicillin-streptomycin solution. The Vero cells were used to prepare EV71 virus as antigen and to measure the viral titer. The diverse subgenogroups of EV71 (A, B3, C2, C3, and C5) were used for neutralizing assays. Virus titers were determined by microtitration using Vero cells and expressed as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), according to the Reed-Muench method.
