<p>Vero cells (7.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells) were seeded in 96-well microplates 1 day before the test. Serum samples from mice were two-fold serially diluted and mixed with equal volumes of EV71 vaccine strain (100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) at 37°C for 2 h. Virus-serum mixtures were added to the Vero cells and incubated at 37°C for 7 days. The neutralization antibody titers were determined as the highest serum dilutions that exhibited a 50% reduction in the cytopathic effect (CPE).
