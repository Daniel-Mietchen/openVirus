<p>To determine the dose of FI-EV71, female BALB/c mice (6 weeks of age) were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 per group). Each group of mice was intramuscularly administered FI-EV71 (5, 10, or 20 Î¼g) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control. FI-EV71 was mixed with alum as an adjuvant at a 1:1 ratio (0.5 mg/mouse). Two weeks after the primary vaccination, all mice were given a booster using the same vaccines. Serum samples were collected at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after primary vaccination (WPV) for assessment of the humoral immune response. Two mice from each group were sacrificed at 3 WPV, and the splenocytes were isolated for analysis of the cell-mediated immune response.</p>
