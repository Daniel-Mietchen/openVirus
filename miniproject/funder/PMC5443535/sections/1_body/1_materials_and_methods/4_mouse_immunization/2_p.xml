<p>To evaluate the efficacy of FI-EV71 by diverse adjuvants, female BALB/c mice (5 weeks of age, n = 5 per group) were used. The mice were randomly divided into five groups: MOCK, 10 μg EV71 antigen with alum adjuvant (500 μg), 10 μg EV71 antigen with MPLA adjuvant (2 μg), 10 μg EV71 antigen with poly I:C adjuvant (10 μg), and 10 μg EV71 antigen with a combination of all three adjuvants. Mice were intramuscularly administered with FI-EV71 with each adjuvant and triple adjuvants or PBS. Two weeks after the primary vaccination, the mice were administered a booster using the same vaccines. Serum samples were collected at 4, 8, 12, and 16 WPV for serology tests and stored at −80°C. Two mice from each group were sacrificed at 3 WPV, and splenocytes of the mice were isolated for analysis of the cell-mediated immune response.</p>
