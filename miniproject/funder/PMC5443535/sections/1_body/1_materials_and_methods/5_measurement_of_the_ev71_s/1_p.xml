<p>The EV71-specific IgG antibody response in mouse serum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described previously [

 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], with slight modifications. The EV71 vaccine strain (100 ng/100 μL) diluted in coating buffer (0.1 M sodium carbonate) was used as a coating antigen in 96-well microplates (Corning Costar) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 5% skim milk powder in PBS at 37°C for 2 h, 100 μL serum diluted 1:100 in dilution buffer (2.5% skim milk in PBS) was added to the microplates. After 2 h incubation at 25°C, 100 μL horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (Novex) diluted 1:2000 in dilution buffer was added, and samples were then incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After washing, 50 μL of 3,3’,5,5’-tetra-methylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Rockland) was added for development, followed by the addition of 100 μL of 2 M H
