<p>Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were isolated and treated with red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (0.84% NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl solution) to remove RBCs. After several washes with PBS, 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> splenocytes were cultured in 24-well plates with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. The splenocytes were stimulated with 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of EV71 C4a-89J and incubated for 48 h. The expression of cytokines and chemokines was examined using a Bio-plex Pro Mouse 23-plex kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and were analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software (Bio-Rad).
