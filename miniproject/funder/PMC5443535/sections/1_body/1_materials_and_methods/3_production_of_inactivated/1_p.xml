<p>EV71 C4a-89J, the vaccine strain used in this study, was isolated from a patient with HFMD in Korea in 2012. The EV71 vaccine strain belonged to subgenogroup C4 based on VP1 sequence analysis. The virus was initially isolated in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and propagated in Vero cells. Before use as a vaccine, the virus was inactivated by adding 0.2% formalin and incubated at 37°C for 5 days. The amount of virion protein was quantified by the Bradford method. FI-EV71 was mixed with 500 μg for alum, 2 μg for MPLA, and 10 μg for poly I:C adjuvant.</p>
