<p>EV71 consists of diverse genogroups (A, B1–5, and C1–5). Among them, the predominant subgenogroup in Korea and China is C4 [

 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this study, the EV71 isolate belonging to the C4 subgenogroup was used to produce a formalin-inactivated vaccine, FI-EV71, and the efficacy according to antigen dosage and diverse adjuvants was evaluated. FI-EV71 induced specific immune responses in terms of high levels of neutralization antibody titers and IgG antibody titers in all groups of vaccinated mice administered 5, 10, or 20 μg antigen. In particular, mice administered 10 and 20 μg FI-EV71 showed rapid induction of neutralization antibody titers by single vaccination. The cell-mediated immune response against FI-EV71 was also induced, as demonstrated by high levels of cytokines in mice vaccinated with an antigen dose of 10 μg. Our current findings suggested that 10 μg FI-EV71 antigen resulted in optimal vaccine efficacy.
