<p>Recent epidemics of HFMD have been reported to be caused by diverse subgenogroups of EV71 in Malaysia (B3 in 1997, B4 in 2000), Taiwan (C2 in 1998, B4 in 2000), Singapore (B4 in 2000), Vietnam (C5 in 2005), China (C4 in 2008), and Korea (C3 in 2000, C4 in 2009) [

In the present study, FI-EV71 with adjuvant exhibited significant crossreactivity to B3, C2, C3, and C5, and the crossreactive neutralization antibody titers of mice vaccinated with FI-EV71 combined with all three adjuvants were higher than those of any other group. Taken together, these results indicated that FI-EV71 combined with adjuvants had broad protection potential against diverse enterovirus strains.
