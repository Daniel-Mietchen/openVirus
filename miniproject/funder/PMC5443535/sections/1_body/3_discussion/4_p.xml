<p>Several adjuvants for vaccination have been licensed in humans; in particular, the adjuvant alum has been widely used for many years [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In previous studies, diverse adjuvant mixtures were used in human vaccines, and the efficacy of these adjuvants was approved [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The AS01 adjuvant (GlaxoSmithKline), a combination of the immunostimulant MPL (the clinical grade form of MPLA) and the saponin QS-21, is used in licensed or candidate human vaccines [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The AS01 adjuvant directly affects the innate immune response to orchestrate the quality and intensity of the adaptive immune response to vaccine antigens [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. AS03 (squalene, Tween 80, and α-tocopherol) and AS04 (alum and MPL) adjuvants are the only adjuvant combinations licensed for use in human vaccines [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. AS03 is currently licensed for pandemic influenza vaccines and is used worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. AS03 has been successfully used to enhance the efficacy, immunogenicity, and crossprotection of pandemic influenza vaccines. Recently, the adjuvant formulation AS25 (AS03, MPL) was shown to induce greater immunogenicity for the influenza vaccine than AS03 [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Another combination adjuvant, AS04, is approved for use with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. When combined with AS04, the HPV vaccine induces higher antibody titers and long-term immune responses than that when the vaccine includes only alum adjuvant, as demonstrated in clinical trials [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The crossreactivity to heterologous HPV strains was also enhanced by AS04. Although the efficacy of combination adjuvants is higher than that of single adjuvants, the selection of suitable adjuvants for antigens is important for enhancing the antigen-specific immune response. Enhanced cytokine production is thought to contribute to EV71 pathogenesis in humans and mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Secretion of cytokines and chemokines after EV71 infection from patients with HFMD is essential for developing effective protection against the disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Th cells, particularly Th1 and Th2 cells, play a major role in humoral and cellular immune responses. Th1 cells induce the cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which are capable of promoting T-cell cytotoxicity. Th2 cells have the capacity to produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13, which enhance the B-cell response. Activation of Th1 cells enhances the production of IgG2a, whereas IgG1 is produced by Th2 cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In general, inactivated virus vaccines induce the Th2 immune response via B-cell stimulation. In this study, FI-EV71 with adjuvant induced high levels of the IgG2a response. Moreover, cytokine analysis showed that several cytokines, including IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10, which are associated with Th2 cells, were elevated in the vaccinated group. Overall, FI-EV71 with adjuvants triggered a mixed Th1/Th2 response.
