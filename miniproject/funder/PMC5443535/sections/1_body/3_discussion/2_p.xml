<p>Inactivated vaccines can have low immunogenicity following vaccination, particularly when the viral antigen is used alone. However, combination of the inactivated vaccine with a suitable adjuvant enhances the immunogenicity of the vaccine [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, the effective adjuvant properties of FI-EV71 were evaluated in the vaccination of mice against EV71. The group administered FI-EV71 formulated with poly I:C adjuvant induced higher antibody titers than other groups vaccinated with a single adjuvant (alum or MPLA). Thus, the addition of poly I:C was critical for boosting neutralization antibodies against EV71. Moreover, administration of FI-EV71 with all three adjuvants strongly stimulated the production of systemic antibodies compared with that using single adjuvants.
