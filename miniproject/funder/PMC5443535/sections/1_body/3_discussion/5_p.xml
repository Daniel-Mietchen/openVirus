<p>In summary, the formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine FI-EV71 significantly enhanced immunogenicity against EV71. Currently, clinical trials of inactivated EV71 vaccine are being performed in China, Taiwan, and Singapore [

 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this study, we showed that an EV71 vaccine combined with multiple adjuvants elicited strong immune responses in mice. However, the cell-mediated immune response of vaccinated mice using FI-EV71 with alum or MPLA as adjuvants was higher than that induced using all three adjuvants. Thus, furthers studies are needed to determine the optimal adjuvant(s) for FI-EV71 and to analyze efficacy in nonhuman primates in order to assess the potential of FI-EV71 as a vaccine candidate for humans. These results will provide valuable information for the development of an inactivated EV71 vaccine.
