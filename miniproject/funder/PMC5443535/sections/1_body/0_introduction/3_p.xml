<p>Inactivated virus vaccines consist of virus particles that are cultured using animal cells and killed by chemical or physical methods. In order to induce antigenicity, it is necessary to use adjuvants and multiple inoculations with inactivated virus vaccines. Adjuvants are used to enhance the immune response against vaccines, resulting in higher amounts of antibodies and long lasting protection. Several different classes of adjuvants have been developed that can promote the immune response. Aluminium hydroxide gel (alum), MF59, and virosomes are licensed for use in human vaccines [
