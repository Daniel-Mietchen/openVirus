<p>Several EV71 vaccine candidates, including inactivated virus vaccines, attenuated live virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and virus-like particle vaccines, have been developed [
 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Inactivated virus vaccines are the leading strategy for developing vaccines against enteroviruses, as exemplified by the successful commercialization of inactivated poliovirus vaccines [

 <xref rid="pone.0178259.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Inactivated virus vaccines have the advantage of conservation of linear and conformational epitopes required for the humoral and cellular immune response. Several inactivated vaccine candidates have been developed and achieved the phase Ⅲ clinical trials [
