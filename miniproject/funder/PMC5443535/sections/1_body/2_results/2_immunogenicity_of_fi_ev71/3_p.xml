<p>To investigate cell-mediated immune responses, splenocytes from mice vaccinated with FI-EV71 combined with different adjuvants were isolated and used to measure induced cytokines. IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased in vaccinated mice compared with those in unvaccinated mice as a negative control (
