<p>The EV71-specific neutralization antibody titer was found to increase quickly after vaccination in all vaccinated groups, whereas the MOCK group did not show any neutralization antibody responses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178259.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To investigate whether FI-EV71 could induce crossreactive neutralization antibody responses by heterologous EV71 strains, five different EV71 strains (A, B3, C2, C3, and C5) were evaluated. Crossreactive neutralization antibody responses against subgenogroups B3, C2, and C5 were elicited in all adjuvant groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178259.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), and subgenogroup C3 was found in FI-EV71 with MPLA and triple adjuvant groups. In contrast, there were no crossreactive neutralizing antibody responses against subgenogroup A.
