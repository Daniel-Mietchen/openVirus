<p>Regardless of the antigen dosage, all groups of mice showed significantly increased neutralization antibody titers compared with those of control mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178259.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The neutralization antibody titers in mice vaccinated with 10 and 20 Î¼g EV71 antigen were induced as early as 2 WPV when the mice were vaccinated once. After booster vaccination, the neutralization antibody titers of all groups were increased and maintained at a constant level until the end of the experiment.
