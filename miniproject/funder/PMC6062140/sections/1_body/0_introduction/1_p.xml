<p>Febrile illness is one of the most common causes of consultations especially in developing countries[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A large range of infectious agents may be involved but clinical presentations are often non-specific, hence compromising the validity of diagnosis made with only clinical features[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The recent widespread use of rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) for the diagnostic of malaria infection combined with malaria control interventions lead to a decreasing proportion of confirmed malaria illnesses[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Clinical management guidelines for febrile illnesses have been developed but are often syndrome-based[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and clinical diagnosis can rarely be confirmed as clinical laboratory services are markedly lacking in low-income settings[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Clinicians frequently encounter non-malarial febrile cases with few paraclinical options to diagnose and treat patients. Several studies in Eastern Africa[

 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] highlighted the importance of non-malarial infections such as bacterial zoonoses or arboviral infections, which could be prevented and correctly treated if biologically confirmed.
