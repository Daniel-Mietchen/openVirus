<p>Among HBV positive patients, three were children below 5 years, two were adolescents (13 and 15 years old) and two were adults (33 and 40 years old). All children presented different abdominal pain (peri umbilical pain, gastralgia and suprapubic pain) and tested positive for malaria, and thus treated accordingly. Adenovirus (ADV) and 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> were each found in 0.3% (2/682) of patients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) and 
 <italic>Leptospira spp</italic> were detected in 0.1% (1/682) each. Leptospirosis infection was detected in a patient aged 17 years presenting with a high fever (39.7Â°C) associated with headaches, asthenia, myalgia, chills, nausea, anorexia, malaise, dark urines and tachycardia, and clinically diagnosed with cholecystitis. Leptospirosis infection was subsequently confirmed with PCR[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and melting temperature superimposition indicated that the strain was related to 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>kirshnerii</italic> and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>noguchii</italic> strains. One case of infection with Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) was also identified in a 7 years old patient clinically diagnosed with mumps and confirmed by sequencing.
