<p>Logistic regression of all symptoms and syndromes showed that clinical anemia (OR: 4.9; [CI95: 2.3–10.3]), vomiting (OR: 3.3; [CI95: 2.0–5.4]), headaches (OR: 3.1; [CI95: 1.8–5.6]), chills (OR: 2.5; [CI95: 1.5–4.2]), and sweat (OR: 2.0; [CI95: 1.1–3.6]) were statistically associated with RDT confirmed malaria. Similarly, catarrh, cough, headache and conjunctivitis were statistically associated to Influenza infection with respective OR of 8.2 [CI95: 3.3–20.3], 2.7 [CI95: 1.3–5.4], 2.5 [CI95: 1.2–5.0] and 2.0 [CI95: 1.1–3.7] (
