<p>A total of 685 febrile patients were recruited, and only 682 were included for analysis because 3 had insufficient volume of blood collected. Logistic constraints in the site of Maroantsetra have prevented us from reaching the objective of inclusion thus only 28 febrile patients were included. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents number of febrile patients included per site and age group. A total of 346 (50.7%) female and 336 (49.3%) male was recruited (F:M ratio = 1.0). Age of patients ranged from 0.5 to 68 years old (mean = 13.5 years, median = 8 years). Patients under 15 years represented 63.0% (429/682) of total inclusions. There was an interval up to 2 days between onset of symptoms and consultation for 59.4% of patients (405/682). The median interval was 2 days, and the mean was 4 days. The median temperature recorded was 38.1째C ranging from 37.5째C to 40.6째C (mean = 38.3째C) with no significant difference between age group and site of inclusion.
