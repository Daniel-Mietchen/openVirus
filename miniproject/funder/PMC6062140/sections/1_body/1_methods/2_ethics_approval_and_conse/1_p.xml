<p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Malagasy National Ethics Committee (approval #CNE 013-MSANP/CE of 26 March 2014). An informed written consent was provided to patients or parents/guardians for children before inclusion and an additional consent form for HIV testing was also provided for every patient included. All samples were anonymized prior to laboratory testing. Two databases were created: one containing all clinical characteristics with names of patients and another one for laboratory results. Both were linked with a unique identifying code for each patient. Individual results of laboratory investigations were returned by mail to health care center clinicians and patients as soon as available.</p>
