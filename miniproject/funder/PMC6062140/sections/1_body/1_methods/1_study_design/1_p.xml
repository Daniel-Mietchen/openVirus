<p>A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted in twenty-one sentinel sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006642.g001">Fig 1</xref>) across Madagascar which are representative of the islandâ€™s diversity in bioclimates and urban/rural settings. Sites were randomly selected among the 34 sites encompassed in the FSSN. One mobile team from IPM composed of a clinician and a laboratory technician visited all sites during predefined periods between April 2014 and September 2015. We used historical data from the FSSN database to estimate the duration of investigation in each site to reach the number of inclusions. Time of investigation for each site was determined according to various criteria such as availability of the local doctor and team, accessibility of the site and availability of liquid nitrogen. As the objective of our study is to provide a national description of causes of febrile illnesses in a countrywide sentinel network, an overall sample size of 685 consenting patients was deemed adequate to have sufficient precision for prevalent diseases and to detect infrequent pathogens. Hence, the amount of sentinel sites led to a convenience sampling of at least 30 and up to 40 febrile patients per site. A standardized clinical examination was performed and all consenting patients with fever were included and sampled regardless of clinical status.
