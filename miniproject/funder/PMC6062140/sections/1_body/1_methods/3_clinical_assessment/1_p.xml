<p>Each patient attending the study facilities and presenting an uncorrected axillary temperature equal to or exceeding 37.5Â°C were invited to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were children aged below 6 months. Written consent was obtained from adult participants and from parents or legal guardians of minors. Additionally, written assent was obtained from patients between 7 and 17 years old. A single anonymous number was attributed to each patient. Voluntary HIV screening (Alere Determine HIV-1/2 according to National HIV Program policies) was also proposed with an additional consent form. Refusal to HIV testing was not an exclusion criterion. Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) (CareStart Malaria HRP2/pLDH (Pf/PAN) Combo, ACCESSBIO) was completed on each febrile patient according to national policies.</p>
