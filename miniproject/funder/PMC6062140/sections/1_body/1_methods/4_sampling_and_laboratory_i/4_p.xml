<p>A whole blood sample (EDTA) was taken to investigate bloodstream infections. When venous sampling was impossible (children below 3 years old, patients refusing venous blood sampling), capillary blood samples were performed using microtube and capillary system (MiniCollect EDTA, Greiner Bio-One). A multiplex PCR-based macroarray assay (Chipron, GmBH), developed and validated at the Emerging vector-borne and respiratory virus program, Centre for Viral Zoonoses, University of Pretoria, South Africa, was used for simultaneous detection of 30 pathogens (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006642.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] combined conventional multiplex PCR with hybridization of biotinylated PCR products to streptavidin labeled probes on a macroarray chip (Chipron GmBH), followed by colorimetric detection. Briefly, each specimen is subjected to 2 multiplex PCR reactions containing biotinylated primers targeted to the 30 pathogens. Subsequently, the PCR products are denatured and hybridized to the chip surface which is coated with target probes directed against each of the 30 pathogens. A positive reaction is detected by addition of streptavidin-conjugated enzyme and substrate, resulting in the development of a color precipitate.
