<p>Our study contributed to an inventory of pathogens associated to febrile illnesses in Madagascar. Respiratory viruses and malaria are the major causes of febrile illnesses in outpatients. We detected one case of leptospirosis infection and one case of Rift Valley Fever virus infection highlighting a probable circulation of these two pathogens at low level in certain regions of Madagascar since no outbreaks or cases have been reported for these two diseases at the time of our study. Moreover, detections of pathogens such as HAV, HBV and HIV emphasize the need to increase prevention, surveillance, detection and support of these infections. The results of this operational research could help health authorities to prioritize sensitization programs for major febrile illnesses and lay the foundation for relevant Point of Care systems implementation to improve diagnosis and care of febrile patients in Madagascar.</p>
