<p>This study presents some limitations. Indeed, due to resource constraint, some specimens like urine and stools were not collected and we also did not perform hemoculture from blood specimen. Thus, some pathogens associated to sepsis, enteric and urinary tract infections were not investigated. Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of the assay used to detected blood stage infections (Venter et al. 2014), some blood pathogens (such as 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> or rickettsial infections) are present at very low levels and nearly impossible to detect in whole blood. Blood cultures and antibodies tests must be used. This might partially explain the percentage of febrile patients with no pathogen detected. The cross-sectional design of our study did not allow assessment of temporal variation of pathogens circulation within the country or a specific area. Given the seasonal pattern of some pathogens (respiratory viruses, malaria, other vector borne diseases) and the design of our study (we visited each site once in a year), we have probably underestimated and/or overestimated some of these pathogens. This is the reason why a comparison of pathogens detected per region is not feasible. Moreover, we believe that the grouping of sites per region or bioclimatic area would not be applicable in this study design. Indeed, socio-economic factors or local transmission pattern of some infectious agents (i.e.: tuberculosis, malaria) would impose separate analysis. Further study should be considered to assess seasonality of fever cases and infectious agents, especially in Madagascar where various bioclimatic regions are encountered. Another limitation is due to the inclusion of mainly patients aged below 15 years overestimating pathogens prevalent in children. However, this age imbalance reflects the true demographics of patients attending health care in Madagascar, where socioeconomic status, travel distance to the facilities and care utilization largely influence healthcare-seeking behavior[
