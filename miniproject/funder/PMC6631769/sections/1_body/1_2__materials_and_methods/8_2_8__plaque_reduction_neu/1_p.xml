<p>Plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay was performed to determine the efficacy of stimulated antibodies in sera from vaccinated/control BALB/C mice to neutralize MERS-CoV. Briefly, sera were inactivated by heating at 56 °C in a water bath for 30 min. Sera were diluted two-fold serial dilution from 1:20 to 1:160 dilution in 40 µL of DMEM/2% FBS. An equal amount of plaque forming unit in 40 µL DMEM/2% FBS was added over sera dilutions. The serum/virus dilutions were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Afterwards, 50 µL of each dilution were inoculated into individual wells of 12-well tissue culture plates with confluent Vero-E6 cell monolayers and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were periodically undulated every 20 min to avoid cell drying. After 1 h of virus adsorption, inoculum was removed gently from the infected monolayer cells, washed with 1× PBS and covered with an overlay containing 1× MEM media, 1% agar, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep). The plates were left to solidify and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> upside down until the formation of viral plaques were visible (3 days). The cell monolayers were then fixed with 3.4% formaldehyde solution for 1 h at RT, stained with 1% crystal violet solution (in 20% methanol) for 30 min at RT, and washed with water to visualize the plaques. The percent (%) of inhibition is calculated as following:
 <disp-formula>% of plaque reduction = (virus control plaques count-sample plaques count)/(virus control plaques count) × 100</disp-formula>
