<p>Influenza virus A/California/04/2009 (Cal-H1N1pdm2009) was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Webby, St Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. An Egyptian MERS-CoV isolate, MERS-CoV/Camel/Egypt/HKU-NRCE205/2013 (accession no. KJ477102), was obtained from the virus collection of Center of Scientific excellence for Influenza Viruses, National Research Centre, Egypt. The Cal-H1N1pdm2009 strain was propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, while the MERS-CoV strain was isolated and grown in Vero-E6 cells. The two viruses were used for preparation of the OMVs-based dual vaccine and inactivated vaccines were used as positive control.</p>
