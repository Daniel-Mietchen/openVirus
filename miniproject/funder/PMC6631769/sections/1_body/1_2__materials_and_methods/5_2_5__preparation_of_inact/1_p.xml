<p>The propagated virus was inactivated using 0.1% formaldehyde in 4 °C for 24 h. To ensure that there are no active viral particles following inactivation process of the inactivated control vaccines, MDCK and Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 100 µL of the inactivated strains. About 72 h post-inoculation, the cell-culture supernatant was then tested using either HA assay (for H1N1) or plaque assay (for MERS-CoV). A volume of 15 mL of the inactivated viral harvest was then carefully layered with 6 mL of 20% sucrose in an ultra-centrifugation tube and centrifuged in a Sorvall MTX 150 ultracentrifuge (Thermo Scientific, CA, USA) at 28,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were further resuspended in 500 µL 1× PBS. The required amounts of viral antigen (µg) of each virus were mixed with Imject Alum adjuvant (Invitrogen, CA, USA) in a ratio of 1:1 (
