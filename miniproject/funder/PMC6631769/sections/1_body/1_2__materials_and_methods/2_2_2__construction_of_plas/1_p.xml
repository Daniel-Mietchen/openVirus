<p>To construct the pMP-H1/RBD plasmid, three PCR fragments (F1, F2, and F3) encompassing (i) 5’-NCR and signal peptide of HA from Cal-H1N1pdm2009, (ii) RBD of MERS-CoV and a 7-amino acid/peptide linker (GSAGSAG), (iii) the coding sequence and 3’-NCR of HA were amplified with sequence-specific primers (

Briefly, for the PCR amplification of each fragment, 25 µL of 2× Phusion Master Mix, 2.5 µL of forward and reverse primers (10 µM/µL), and 50 ng of the according template DNA were mixed and the reaction was then brought to a total volume of 50 µL using RNase-/DNase-free ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. The plasmid pMP-HA-Gi [
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00046" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] encoding the HA of Cal-H1N1pdm2009 was used as template DNA for F1 and F3, while the plasmid pcDNA3.1-Spike-MERS-CoV encoding the spike protein from the isolate MERS-CoV/Camel/Egypt/HKU-NRCE-270/2013 was used as a template for F2. The PCR settings were: 95 °C for 1 min then 3 steps of 40 cycles (95 °C for 10 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min), with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The three amplified PCR fragments were then loaded onto a 1% agarose-gel for electrophoresis. Separation and purification of the three specific fragments was done by using QIAquick gel purification kit according to manufacturer`s (Qiagen, Germany) instructions. After purification the three fragments were digested by corresponding restriction enzymes, shown in
