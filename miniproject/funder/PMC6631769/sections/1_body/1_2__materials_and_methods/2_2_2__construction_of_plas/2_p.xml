<p>Ligation of the three fragments and the linearized vector was performed using T4 DNA ligase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) by adding 5 µL of each purified fragment (20 ng/µL) to 2 µL 10× buffer, 2 µL T4 DNA ligase, and 1 µL linearized vector (20 ng/µL). The mixture was then incubated overnight at 4 °C. Transformation of 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic> coli DH5-α competent cells was performed by mixing 5 µL of the ligation reaction with 50 µL bacterial suspension (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and subsequent incubation on ice for 30 min. The bacterial cells were then subjected to heat shock at 42 °C for 30 s in a water bath and were then chilled on ice for 2 min before adding 250 µL of SOC media (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The reaction tubes were then rotated at 250 rpm in a shaking incubator at 37 °C for 1 h. After an incubation time of 1 h, 100 µL of the transformed bacterial suspension was spread on ampicillin containing Luria-Bertani (LB) Agar plate and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Single colonies were then selected and incubated in 5 mL liquid LB for 16 h for subsequent plasmid isolation and the correct sequence was verified by sequencing using a Big Dye Terminator Kit 3.1 (Thermofisher, CA, USA) at Macrogen facility (Seoul, South Korea).
