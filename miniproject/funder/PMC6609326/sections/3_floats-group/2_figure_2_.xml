 <caption>
  <p>Systemic infection kinetic for 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
   <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> species infected with CHIKV. The upper panel shows the cumulative prevalence of systemic infection over time post CHIKV exposure. Data points represent the observed prevalence at each time point with their size being proportional to the sample size. Dashes represent the 95% confidence interval of the prevalence. The fitted values obtained with a 3-parameter logistic model are represented for each species by a coloured line. The lag time and rising time estimates are represented for each species. The lower panel shows CHIKV titres in mosquito heads measured at each time points after oral exposure to the virus.
