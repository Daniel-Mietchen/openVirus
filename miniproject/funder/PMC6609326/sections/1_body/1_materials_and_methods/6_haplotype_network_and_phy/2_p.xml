<p>A set of 36 COI sequences from 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and 2 COI sequences from 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were obtained from GenBank. An 
 <italic>Aedes echinus</italic> COI sequence (GenBank accession number: MK070853) was kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Krüger from the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM), Hamburg, Germany. COI sequences from our two specimens (GenBank accession numbers: MK796909, MK796910) were aligned to the sequences retrieved from GenBank using ClustalW v.2.0.12 [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. All COI sequences excepting both from 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were then imported in nexus format to the PopArt program [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to create a TCS haplotype network using a 437 bp COI section covered by all 39 sequences from 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. echinus</italic> mosquitoes.
