<p>Representative COI sequences (i.e. unique haplotypes over the full COI sequences) were analysed with RAxML v.8.2.10 [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to generate the best-scoring maximum-likelihood (ML) tree of 10 runs with 100 thorough bootstrap replicates to infer the reliability of the branches. Topology was rooted to an 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (MG198601) COI sequence. The GTR nucleotide substitution model was chosen from a list of substitution models implemented in RAxML based on corrected Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AICc) value using the PartitionFinder v2 software [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] with the linked branch length option. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using FigTree v.1.4.3 [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
