<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was extracted from single 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> specimens homogenates from Tirana (Albania) and Paris (France) using the NucleoSpin 96 Tissue Core Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> specimen from Albania belonged to the population that has been exposed to CHIKV in this study. PCR amplification was carried out along a 566-bp region of the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) gene with primers C1-J-1718mod (5’- GGWGGRTTTGGWAAYTGAYTAG -3’) and C1-N-2191mod (5’- AGHWCCAAAAGTTTCYTTTTTCC -3’) (adapted from Simon et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), corresponding to region 1531- 2096 of the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mtDNA (NC_035159) sequence [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Amplicons were cleaned using GenElute™ 96 Well PCR Clean-Up Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) before sequencing. Amplicons sequencing reactions were performed by using Big Dye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) and purified by ethanol precipitation. Cycle sequencing was performed on ABI3730XL sequence analyser (Applied Biosystems) using both the forward and reverse primers to create a consensus sequence and increase haplotype reliability. COI sequences from the two specimens were submitted to the identification tool of BOLD (Barcoding of Life) [
