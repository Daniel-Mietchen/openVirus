<p>The isolate CHIKV 0621 was used in this study. This viral strain was isolated from a traveller from India and possesses an amino acid change (A226 V) in the envelope glycoprotein E1 [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>] [GenBank accession number DQ443544]. The virus had been passaged three times in C6/36 cells prior to use in the experiments. Virus titration was performed by focus-forming assay (FFA) as previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The titre of the frozen virus stock was estimated as 10
 <sup>9</sup> focus-forming units per mL (FFU/mL). All infectious experiments were conducted in a BSL-3 insectary (Institut Pasteur, Paris).
