<p>Mosquitoes from both 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> species used in this study originated in Tirana, the capital of Albania. Eggs were collected by ovitrap in an urban park (41° 18’36” N; 19° 49’18” E) from July to August 2012. Eggs from both species were hatched at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and reared under standard conditions. Adults from the F0 generation were identified morphologically [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and 500 individuals of each species were placed per cage at 26°C ± 1°C with 60–70% relative humidity and a light: dark cycle of 16 h: 8 h. These temperature and humidity rate values were recorded throughout the rearing process with an electronic sensor. Adults were given 10% sucrose solution and females were allowed to engorge with rabbit blood on a membrane feeding apparatus (Hemotek, Discovery Workshops, Lancashire, United Kingdom) to obtain F1 eggs. Batches of eggs were hatched simultaneously to obtain females of the same physiological age for experimental infections. Larvae were reared to the adult stage under the same conditions. All experiments were realized with the F1 generation.
