<p>CHIKV infection, systemic infection and transmission were determined at 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14 and 20 days post virus exposure (DPE) for both species. Presence of CHIKV in bodies indicates a midgut infection, while the presence of virus in heads and saliva indicates a systemic (disseminated) infection and virus transmission, respectively. Saliva collection was performed using the forced salivation technique [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At each time point, batches of mosquitoes from each species were anesthetized at 4°C before to have their wings and legs removed under a magnifying glass. Proboscis were then inserted into a 100 µL filter micropipette tip filled with 5 µL of heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). After 45 min, the medium containing the saliva was transferred into 1.5 mL tubes containing 45 µL of Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Gibco) and stored at −80°C. After salivation, mosquito heads were separated from the bodies and each compartment was grinded separately with 1 mm glass beads and 250 µL of Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. Homogenization was realized in a grinder Precellys
 <sup>®</sup>24 for 2 × 30 s at 6000 rpm. All samples were frozen at −80°C before titration.
