<p>Females 9–10 days old were deprived of sucrose solution 24 h before experimental infection. The infectious blood-meal consisted of 1 mL of viral suspension, 2 mL of washed rabbit erythrocytes supplemented with adenosine triphosphate (10 mM) as a phagostimulant. Blood feeding was by an artificial feeding apparatus (Hemotek) covered with pig intestine. The final virus titre in blood meal was 10
 <sup>8</sup> FFU/mL corresponding to the viral load encountered in some patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Feeders were maintained at 37°C and placed on top of the mesh of a plastic box containing 60 females. After 15 min of feeding (to minimize the effect of virus degradation in the infectious blood meal), mosquitoes were cold anesthetized and sorted on ice. Fully engorged females were transferred to cardboard containers and maintained with 10% sucrose in an environmental growth-cabinet set at 28°C ± 1°C, 80% humidity, and a 16 h: 8 h light regime.
