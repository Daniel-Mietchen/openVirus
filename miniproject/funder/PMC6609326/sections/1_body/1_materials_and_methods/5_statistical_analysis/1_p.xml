<p>The time-dependent effect of the mosquito species on mosquito midgut infection, systemic infection and virus transmission was analysed by Firth's penalized likelihood logistic regression by considering each phenotype as a binary response variable. Penalized logistic regression, implemented through the 
 <italic>logistf</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used to solve problem of separation that can occur in logistic regression when (i) the outcome has high prevalence, (ii) when all observations have the same event status for a combination of predictors or (iii) when a continuous covariate predict the outcome too perfectly. A full-factorial generalized linear model that included the time post virus exposure and the mosquito species was fitted to the data with a binomial error structure and a logit link function. Statistical significance of the effects was assessed by an analysis of deviance.
