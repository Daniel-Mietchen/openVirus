<p>The intra-host dynamic of systemic infection was assessed by a global likelihood function for each mosquito species as described in Fontaine et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Probabilities of systemic infection at each time point post virus exposure were estimated with a 3-parameter logistic model. The probability of systemic infection at a given time point (
 <italic>t</italic>) is governed by 
 <italic>K</italic>: the saturation level (the maximum proportion of mosquitoes with a systemic infection), 
 <italic>B</italic>: the slope factor (the maximum value of the slope during the exponential phase of the cumulative function, scaled by 
 <italic>K</italic>) and 
 <italic>M</italic>: the lag time (the time at which the absolute increase in cumulative proportion is maximal). For easier biological interpretation, 
 <italic>B</italic> was transformed into Δt, which correspond to the time required to rise from 10% to 90% of the saturation level with the formula: Δt = ln (81) / 
 <italic>B.</italic> For each mosquito species, the 
 <italic>subplex</italic> R function [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used to provide the best estimates of the three parameters to maximize the global likelihood function (i.e. the sum of binomial probabilities at each time point post virus exposure). This method accounts for differences in sample size when estimating parameters values.
