<p>Virus titres in mosquito’s bodies, heads and saliva were compared between species by a Mann–Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified on the time post-exposure as implemented in the 
 <italic>wilcox_test</italic> function from the 
 <italic>coin</italic> R package [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The effect of time post exposure on each quantitative phenotype for each species was assessed using a Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test. Time post exposure was converted into ordered factors to implement both tests.
