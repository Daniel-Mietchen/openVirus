<p>First detected in Albania and later in Italy, the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> species [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] is now established throughout much of the Mediterranean basin and northward as far as Paris [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The ever-increasing air travel between Europe and regions with active arbovirus transmission, in combination with travel times that are largely inferior to the incubation period, has increased the risk of arboviruses introduction into Europe, as illustrated by transmission events of CHIKV in several European countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5â€“8</xref>]. For example, an outbreak of CHIKV in Italy in 2017 involved more than 420 confirmed cases [
