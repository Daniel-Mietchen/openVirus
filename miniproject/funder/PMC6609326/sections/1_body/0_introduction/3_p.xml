 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has been implicated as the vector for all European CHIKV outbreaks but an indigenous species, 
 <italic>Aedes geniculatus</italic> (Olivier, 1791) is frequently found in ovitraps used for surveillance of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in outbreak areas [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both are tree-hole species that breed in natural containers in woodland as well as in man-made containers in the peri-urban and peri-domestic environment [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Their eggs are resistant to desiccation and can overwinter in temperate areas. Both species are day-active, exophilic and feed aggressively on humans and other mammals. The implication of European mosquitoes in the transmission of emerging arboviruses has been poorly investigated despite evidence of transmission by other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species outside Europe [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We compared the competence of the native European mosquito species 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> to transmit CHIKV in comparison with the invasive and reference vector species for CHIKV: 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Importantly, the consideration of the dynamic nature of vector competence revealed that differences of vector competence between mosquito species were due to a time shift in the distribution of extrinsic incubation periods rather than differences in maximum proportion of infectious mosquitoes. The importance of considering indigenous species as potential vectors for arbovirus and the implication, in a theoretical framework, of our results on a CHIKV outbreak dynamic would be discussed.
