<p>CHIKV titres in bodies were significantly higher in 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> vs 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (stratified Mann–Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test,

 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, respectively). Virus titres in bodies were significantly different across time points post virus exposure in both species (Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test,

 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and
