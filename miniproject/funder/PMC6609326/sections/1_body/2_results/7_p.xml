<p>CHIKV titres in saliva were significantly higher in 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> vs 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (stratified Mann–Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 1.8e-3), with 0.24 log 
 <sub>10</sub> difference between values average across time points (0.51 vs 0.27 log 10 FFU/mL for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, respectively). Titres in heads were significantly different across time points after virus exposure in mosquitoes from the 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> species only (Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 4e-03 and 0.14 for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and

 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> species.
