<p>Virus transmission prevalences were measured by assessing the presence of the infectious virus in mosquito saliva. Virus transmission prevalences were significantly different between mosquito species (analysis of deviance, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0038) and the effect of time post-exposure varied significantly between mosquito species (analysis of deviance, interaction term, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 3.05e-4). It was not possible to model the cumulative virus transmission prevalence over time for the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> species because of a lack of saturation level. Proportion of virus in saliva clearly collapsed from day 5 post virus exposure (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary figure 2). The same phenomenon could be observed for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>. However, the 3-parameter model could nonetheless fit the data, giving the following estimates: 70% of saturation level, an EIP-50 of 8 days and a rising time of 6.2 days (Supplementary figure 2).
