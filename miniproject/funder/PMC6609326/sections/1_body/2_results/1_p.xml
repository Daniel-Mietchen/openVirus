<p>The COI sequence from one specimen from the Albanian population of 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> that has been exposed to CHIKV in this study has been sequenced. This COI sequence matched a Dahliana geniculata (an alternative name for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> based on Reinert et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) sequence with 100% similarity and 100% probability of species assignment. This bold entry has an “early-release” status at the time of accession with no information excepting a rough location in Central Europe (most probably Germany). This sequence clusterized with two other COI sequences from Aedes specimens collected in Germany deposited in GenBank as 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). While being very closed from the 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> genetic cluster, this cluster can be distinguished from the Ae. echinus specimen on both the haplotype network (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(A)) and phylogenetic analyses with a high branch support (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(B)). Interestingly, a COI sequence from a specimen collected in Austria and identified as 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> (GenBank accession number: KM280584) clustered apart from all other sequences. The COI sequence of our 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> specimen from Albania, matched an 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> sequence with 100% similarity and 100% probability of species assignment. This specimen clustered with 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> mosquitoes collected all over Europe.
