<p>A total of 134 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and 124 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> engorged females were analysed, considering the mosquito mortality during the experiment. Indeed, 16 and 17 females died prior to sampling, respectively for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. High midgut infection prevalences (&gt;85%) were obtained for both species from the first time point after virus exposure. With 100% midgut infection among the exposed mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> was highly susceptible to CHIKV infection (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary figure 1). Midgut infection prevalences were not influenced by the time post exposure (analysis of deviance, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0659) and a significantly higher midgut infection prevalence was observed in 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> vs 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (analysis of deviance, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0438).
