<p>Systemic infection, as measured by the head infection prevalence, was significantly influenced by the time post exposure (analysis of deviance, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 5.43e-13) and the mosquito species (analysis of deviance, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 4.10e-15) but the time post exposure effect was not significantly different across the mosquito species according to logistic regression (analysis of deviance, interaction term, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.6). The intra-host dynamic of systemic CHIKV infection (SIR values in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was quantified in both mosquito species by fitting a 3 parameters logistic model that assumes a sigmoidal distribution of the cumulative proportion of mosquitoes with a systemic infection over time. Both species presented a saturation level (K, or maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes with a systemic infection) equal to 100% (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, this saturation level was achieved later for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> than for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Indeed, an estimated 14.6 days were needed for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> to go from 10% to 90% of the saturation level whereas the saturation level was reached in less than one day for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. The lag time M, which can represent a proxy for the Extrinsic Incubation Period-50 (EIP-50) – the time required for transmission prevalence to reach 50% of the saturation level – was 2.7 days in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes compared to 7.6 days in 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).
