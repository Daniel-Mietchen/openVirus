<p>The biology of 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> is poorly studied [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. From what is known, the species can bite aggressively both humans and animals mainly during daylight hours [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and personal observation. Its larvae are commonly found in mature trees’ holes [
 <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Adults often coexist with 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Europe but population densities of 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> generally didn’t reached those of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in peri-urban areas. More data are needed to fully characterize the level of contact with human hosts. As an anecdote, we captured 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> on Jim Morrison grave, one of the most visited graves by tourists of all nationalities in Pere Lachaise cemetery, in the centre of Paris, where millions of people come every year, strengthening the threat for this species in local virus transmission. Its flight dispersion is not considered superior than 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Consequently, this species would not carry viruses outside of the area treated in the frame of the vector control intervention. Arbovirus vertical transmission is a rare event, and its occurrence hazard is correlated with vector density and the surveillance of virus. If higher CHIKV vertical transmission rates are achieved in 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> species, vertical transmission of CHIKV in overwintering 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes might contribute to the maintenance of this virus during winter. Populations of 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> are generally monovoltine (i.e. one generation per year), and their diapause termination is asynchronous [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], enabling a reintroduction of the virus later in the following year when the population of the primary vector 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is already high. It seems therefore necessary to improve the knowledge on this species biology, including longevity, flight and host-seeking behaviour, diapause and virus overwintering to fully assess its epidemic potential. At last, temperature is strongly influencing vector competence. It can be of interest to compare vector competence for CHIKV between both mosquito species at lower temperatures.
