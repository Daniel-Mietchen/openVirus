<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIK) is one of four arboviruses with dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) that can be sustained in a human-vector-human transmission cycle. All four originated in wild primates but can cycle in the urban environment, transmitted by peridomestic mosquitoes. Intercontinental travel and trade were historically involved in the transmission of these viruses world-wide, sometimes involving recruitment of new local vectors [

For instance, the YFV, originating in Africa, was introduced to the Americas during the slave trade, where it entered new transmission cycles involving autochthonous arboreal species, such as Haemagogus janthinomys and mosquito from the Sabethes genus, and non-human primates in primary tropical rain forest. The virus then regularly propagated from the jungle into urban transmission cycles [
