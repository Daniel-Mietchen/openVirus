<p>The Albanian population of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was highly susceptible to CHIKV with 100% of systemic infections achieved before the fifth days post virus exposure. Fast CHIKV disseminations were already reported at equivalent infectious blood titres for several 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations. CHIKV infectious particles were shown to be present in salivary glands or other peripheric organs as soon as 2 days post virus exposure [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56â€“58</xref>] further confirm the risk for CHIKV emergence in Europe [

 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Vector competence dynamic for a virus/mosquito species combination is strongly influenced by the infectious blood meal titre (virus dose), the environmental conditions, the time of mosquito sampling post virus exposure, sample sizes from which proportions were inferred, or the genetic background of the viruses, their mosquito vectors and their interaction [
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This lack of standardization across vector competence studies impedes direct comparison of results. Modelling vector competence dynamic for a set of parameters can provide a holistic view of the impact of time on vector competence and give reference estimates that can help direct result comparison across studies.
