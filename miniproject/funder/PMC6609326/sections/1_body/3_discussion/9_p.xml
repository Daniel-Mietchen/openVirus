<p>Assessing the vector competence of the different European mosquito species, but also other regions around the world potentially exposed to arboviral outbreak, for other arboviruses or other strains, will help to anticipate patterns of transmission of arbovirus as CHIKV, ZIKV and DENV and the relative contribution of different vector species to virusâ€™s amplification and persistence (transmission and reservoir) in these areas. Moreover, we recommend to monitor on the field all mosquito species, whether native or invasive, during surveillance programmes on future outbreaks to further characterize the autochthonous mosquito fauna that can be potentially involved in arbovirus transmission.</p>
