<p>Europe is the world’s leading tourism destination with 671 million arrivals (50% of all international tourists) in 2017, a number that continues to increase [

 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] have assessed the potential for CHIKV infection in five indigenous species from the south of France and Italy (
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>,

 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anopheles maculipennis</italic>)[
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The three 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species were susceptible to virus infection but the transmission potential of infectious viral particles in the mosquito saliva was not investigated. These insects represent a small portion of all European anthropophilic mosquitoes.
