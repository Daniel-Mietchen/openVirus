<p>CHIKV is in expansion throughout the world and Europe is not spared. Since the CHIKV outbreak in Northern Italy in 2007, and more recently the isolated cases of chikungunya and dengue recorded in France and Croatia from 2010 to 2013 [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], it has been acknowledged that Europe is vulnerable to local transmission of “tropical” arboviruses. Epidemics risk is in connection with the steady increase of imported cases of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-bornes viruses as well as with the European expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. So far, studies on the epidemiology of the arboviral diseases chikungunya and dengue in European countries have focused on the invasive “Asian tiger mosquito” without considering the potential role for indigenous vector species. 
 <italic>Aedes geniculatus</italic> and other potential vector species are, to this day, absent from epidemiological models so far [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These results show the importance of considering European indigenous species to assess overall risk of arbovirus transmission in Europe. We suggest that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>geniculatus</italic> species should be considered as a potential secondary vector in the Palearctic region.
