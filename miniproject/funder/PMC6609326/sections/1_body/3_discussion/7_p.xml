<p>Our study has several limitations. First, our estimates of virus dissemination dynamic can be biased. They rely on the modelization of the measured cumulative proportion of mosquitoes with a disseminated infection over time. Concerning 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>, the modelized proportion is not null at the time of mosquito exposure to the virus as it should be. The number and repartition of time points and the proportions accuracy (that depend on sample size at each time point) are influential in determining accurate parameter estimates of the virus dissemination dynamic. This method can nonetheless provide realistic estimates and offer the possibility to consider the dynamic nature of vector competence. Importantly, this allows to disentangle the incubation period effect from the maximum proportion of systemic virus infection (i.e. the maximum proportion of mosquito with a systemic infection is similar for both species but is reached later for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>. An assessment of systemic infection prevalence at an early single time point would have conclude to differences in dissemination rates between species). Then, the transmission dynamic estimates must be considered with caution because the method to detect viruses in mosquito saliva do not distinguish true negatives from negatives resulting from mosquito that did not expectorate saliva. This might explain the observed decrease of transmission rates for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Because lower virus titres were observed in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> saliva as compared to 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>, false negative virus detection might have arisen more frequently in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> saliva as compared to 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> saliva samples due to a detection threshold issue. Alternatively, this decrease could be explained by the fact that infected mosquitoes died before non-infected mosquitoes or that oldest mosquitoes begin to clear the infection through immune function [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] or by the natural death of virions. A difference in the decline of viral titre of CHIKV over time was already shown between 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, suggesting a species-specific interaction with the virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It can, however, be concluded that both species can transmit infectious CHIKV particles as soon as 3 and 7 days post exposure for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>, respectively.
