<p>Our study has revealed the ability of the European mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> to transmit CHIKV experimentally. Vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>geniculatus</italic> for CHIKV was compared to the vector competence of an 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population originating from Albania, the first European nation that has been reported to be colonized by this species. Aedes geniculatus was revealed to be highly susceptible to CHIKV infection. Midgut infection by an arbovirus is achieved very rapidly after exposure to the infectious blood meal when infectious virus particles are still in contact with the midgut wall cells. Virus dissemination in secondary tissues can only occur in mosquitoes with infected midgut and is, in contrast to the infection phenotype, a dynamic process scaled in a day unit that can have epidemiological significance. Variation in DENV dissemination dynamics in mosquitoes was reported to significantly affects the risk and magnitude of dengue outbreaks [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We revealed that both species were completely able to disseminate CHIKV in their secondary tissues. However, this 100% saturation level of infected mosquitoes with a disseminated infection was reached in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> 15 days earlier than 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus.</italic> The estimated virus dissemination lag time, that can be considered as a proxy for the EIP-50 (extrinsic incubation period in days until 50% of maximum infectiousness), was nearly 8 days for 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> whereas is was less than 3 days for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> Combined with vector longevity, EIP is the most powerful contributor to vectorial capacity according to the Ross-MacDonald equation [
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Vectorial capacity is a restatement of the basic reproductive rate (R0) of a pathogen and define the number of secondary infections expected to occur from the introduction of a single infection in a naive population [
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The longer it would take for a virus to disseminate from the infected midgut to the saliva, the fewer opportunities the mosquito would have to transmit the virus to a human host before its death. For an equal vector longevity and gonotrophic cycle duration, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> can thus be considered as a better vector than 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic>. In other words, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes would infect more susceptible human hosts before they died than 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> because they would achieve an infectious status sooner. As a result of these intra-host systemic infection dynamic difference among mosquito species, the probability of outbreak initiation and the number of human cases would be lower in the field [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] when 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> only is present, as compared to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. This theory can be thwarted if 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> mosquitoâ€™s life span is longer than 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> one [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes geniculatus</italic> might then be involved in autochthonous CHIKV transmissions in Europe in complementation with or in absence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. The higher CHIKV titres observed in 
 <italic>Ae. geniculatus</italic> saliva as compared to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> can mirror a higher infectiousness for the European native species. The impact of virus titre in mosquito vector saliva in initiating an infection in the human host and in influencing the intrinsic incubation period is not known. This has never been studied because of the difficulty to carry out dose-response experiments in human hosts or animal models. In addition, possibility of rapid virus adaptation to new vectors was already observed [
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. CHIKV evolution toward restricted EIP duration in this autochthonous species would greatly increase the epidemic potential of this vector-virus couple.
