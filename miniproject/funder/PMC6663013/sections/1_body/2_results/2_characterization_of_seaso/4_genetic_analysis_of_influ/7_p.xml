<p>Genetic analysis of A(H3N2) influenza virus was performed for 26 selected cases, including 2 lethal cases (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220401.s007">S3 Table</xref>). Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 25 full-length HA sequences, the A(H3N2) viruses belonged to clade 3C.2a (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220401.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), which could be further classified into three clades: 3C.2a1b, 3C.2a2 and 3C.2a3, according to the classification criteria presented in [

 <xref rid="pone.0220401.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For clade 3C.2a1b the combination of K92R and H311Q substitutions in HA1 was observed (H3 numbering is used for all A(H3N2) amino acid substitutions). Eleven viruses of the clade were further subgrouped. One of the subgroups included viruses with HA genes that encode E62G and R142G in HA1 with an additional substitution of T135K. Another subgroup included a virus with HA gene that encodes the T135N substitution. For 3C.2a2 clade, a combination of T131K, R142K and R261Q substitutions was seen, and a combination of N121K and S144K substitutions was observed for 3C.2a3 clade.
