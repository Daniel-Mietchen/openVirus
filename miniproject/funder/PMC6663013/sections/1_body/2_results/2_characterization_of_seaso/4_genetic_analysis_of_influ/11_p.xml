<p>A comparative genetic analysis of selected 18 B/Yamagata-like viruses, including 8 viruses from lethal cases (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220401.s009">S5 Table</xref>), showed that all the viruses are genetically similar to the B/Phuket/3073/2013 vaccine strain. No mutations were identified that contribute to the increased pathogenicity of the viruses from lethal cases compared with the vaccine strain. The majority of the fatal of influenza B/Yamagata-like viruses were associated with the presence of the influenza illness risk group factors established by the WHO (age between 6 months to 5 years old, age more than 65 years old, chronic medical conditions) [
