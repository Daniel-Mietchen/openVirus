<p>Influenza viruses from 75 selected cases (original specimen and/or MDCK isolate) were genetically analyzed and complete genomes or partial sequences of selected genes were obtained. Selected cases included 29 viruses of A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype (

The complete nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene for 70 influenza viruses were determined and were used to perform a phylogenetic analysis. The results of the phylogenetic analysis showed that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from 26 cases grouped in clade 6B.1 (
