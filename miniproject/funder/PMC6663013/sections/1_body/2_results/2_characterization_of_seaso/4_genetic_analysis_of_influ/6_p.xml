<p>Analysis of the neuraminidase (NA) gene of 29 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses revealed the presence of the H275Y mutation (H1 numbering) in a single virus, A/Samara/117868/2018 (in the primary material and in the MDCK isolate). The H275Y substitution was previously associated with highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and reduced or highly reduced inhibition by peramivir of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (according to the criteria of the WHO expert working group on surveillance of influenza antiviral susceptibility) [
