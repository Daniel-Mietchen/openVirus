<p>Influenza A(H3N2) virus isolates had hemagglutination characteristics similar to the strains isolated in the previous season, namely: agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes was detected only for the second passages of the strains in MDCK cell culture and only 7 of 13 isolates were able to hemagglutinate in the presence of 20 nM oseltamivir [

Reverse titers of anti-A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 serum (produced using the egg-based vaccine strain) in the HI with the A(H3N2) isolates were 8 times lower than the titer against homologous virus. Such a decrease in the reactivity of the antisera raised against the vaccine strain of egg-based origin against circulated A(H3N2) strains is noted by experts all over the world, while the analysis of viruses with the antisera raised against the cell-based vaccine strain did not reveal any significant antigenic differences from the vaccine strain, suggesting that egg adaptive changes decreased vaccine effectiveness [
