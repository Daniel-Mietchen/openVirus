<p>The United States were characterized by a significant prevalence of influenza A viruses (71.2%) over influenza B viruses (28.8%); of the influenza A viruses, 84.9% belonged to the A(H3N2) subtype and 15.1% belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype. Among influenza B viruses, viruses of the B/Yamagata genetic lineage prevailed at 88.8% [

For the majority of other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, a comparable distribution of the two types of viruses was observed with occurrences of a slightly higher prevalence of influenza A virus (Canada, 57%), or influenza B virus (Europe, 56%). Different countries in Europe demonstrated the predominance of a particular subtype of influenza A virus (A(H3N2) in the UK, A(H1N1)pdm09 in France, Germany, Italy); in the region as a whole, however, the proportions of both subtypes were approximately equal [
