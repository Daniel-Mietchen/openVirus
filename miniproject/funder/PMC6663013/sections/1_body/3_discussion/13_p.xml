<p>Molecular genetic analysis revealed the presence of D222G and D222N amino acid substitutions (H1 numbering) in the receptor-binding site of HA in the most predominant variant of the virus in four virus isolates from the 19 studied lethal cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220401.s006">S2</xref> Tables). It is known that the presence of D222G and D222N mutations in the HA gene often correlates with increased disease severity and mortality. These mutations provide increased tropism of the virus to the cells of the lower parts of the human respiratory tract, which can lead to an increased risk of developing viral pneumonia. Some researchers suggest that increased virulence and lethality of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus may be caused by the presence of D222G/N mutations in HA [
