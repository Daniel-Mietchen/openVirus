<p>The A(H3N2) isolates analyzed in the HI test were antigenically different from the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 egg-based vaccine strain, which may be explained by changes in its antigenic properties during the adaptation process for the growth in embryonated chicken eggs. According to the literature, serological studies showed that a significant proportion of A(H3N2) strains, which circulated in the world during the 2017â€“2018 epidemic season, were antigenically different from the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 egg-based vaccine strain, while majority of the strains were antigenically similar to the cell-based vaccine strain [
