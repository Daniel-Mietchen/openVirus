<p>In Russia, none of the influenza virus subtypes was dominant in the 2017â€“2018 epidemic season: during the entire period, A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B/Yamagata-like viruses circulated in almost equal proportions. Few isolated cases of B/Victoria-like virus were detected and no variants of the virus with the deletion were identified [
