PCR-based diagnostics of the original material for influenza virus RNA was conducted in local laboratories, and then all the positive samples were sent to the SRC VB “Vector”, Rospotrebnadzor. All samples received in the SRC VB “Vector”, Rospotrebnadzor were retested using diagnostic PCR; and viral strains were isolated in MDCK by infecting a monolayer of cells [

Diagnostic real-time PCR for detecting RNA of influenza A virus and influenza B virus was performed using RNA isolated with the “RIBO-sorb” kit, cDNA prepared using the “RevertaL” kit, which was analyzed using the reagent kits “AmpliSense Influenza virus A/B-FL”, “AmpliSense Influenza virus H1N1pdm2009-FL” and “AmpliSense Influenza virus H3N2-FL” manufactured by the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology of the Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Moscow, Russia).
