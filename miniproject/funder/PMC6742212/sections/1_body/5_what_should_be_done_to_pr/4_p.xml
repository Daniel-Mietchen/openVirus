<p>Currently, CHIKV transmission in the Americas is very low. Yet it is expected that new outbreaks will emerge as the virus spreads to new areas (in the Americas and other regions) and as the susceptible population in previously affected areas builds up. In anticipation of new epidemics, it is critical that new protocols of chikungunya management be devised, with a particular attention to mortality prevention, especially among well-known high-risk groups. Failure to do so will result, once again, in an unacceptable number of chikungunya-related deaths. While most of these deaths may not get reported, as recently happened, all will be foretold. Time will tell.</p>
