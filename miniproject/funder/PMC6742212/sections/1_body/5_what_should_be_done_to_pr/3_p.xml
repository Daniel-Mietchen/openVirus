<p>Considering the complexity of the clinical course of chikungunya, and in the absence of antivirals, efforts should be undertaken to make continuous treatment, specific for each stage of the disease (acute, post-acute, and chronic), in order to prevent deaths. Protocols must be regularly updated as new knowledge is produced so that treatment follows the most current evidence. In addition, it is important to create a patient mortality risk classification based on the available knowledge. While we acknowledge that scant histopathological data and knowledge gaps in the pathophysiology of chikungunya limit the comprehensiveness of the risk classification, available knowledge already offers a unique opportunity to mitigate mortality, particularly among elderly patients with specific comorbidities.</p>
