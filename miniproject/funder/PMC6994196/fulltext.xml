Outbreaks in sheep herds are characterised by newborn fatalities and abortion storms. The association of RVFV infections with abortions of ovines and other ruminants is well recognized, whereas the pathology resulting in abortion has remained undescribed.

The results show that RVFV replicates efficiently in maternal placental epithelial cells before the virus infects foetal trophoblasts. Moreover, the virus was shown to bypass the maternal epithelial cell layer by directly targeting foetal trophoblasts in the haemophagous zone, a region of the ovine placenta where maternal blood is in direct contact with foetal cells. Abortion was associated with widespread necrosis of placental tissues accompanied with severe haemorrhages.

Outbreaks are characterised by high mortality rates among newborn lambs and abortion storms in sheep herds. The severe outcome of RVFV infection during pregnancy in livestock is well documented, whereas the pathological changes that result in abortion have not yet been described. To investigate how RVFV crosses the placenta and how infection results in abortion, pregnant ewes were infected with RVFV and target cells in maternal and foetal tissues were identified at different time points after inoculation. We show that epithelial cells of the ovine placenta and foetal trophoblasts are primary target cells of RVFV and that placental demise is the primary cause of abortion. The same RVFV strain was shown to replicate efficiently in human placental explants, targeting both cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality</institution></funding-source><award-id>WOT-01-001-003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kortekaas</surname><given-names>Jeroen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was commissioned and financed by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality of the Netherlands, project code: WOT-01-001-003.

RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes, predominantly by species of the genera <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The virus is pathogenic to domesticated and wild ruminants, of which sheep are the most susceptible. Newborn lambs may succumb within hours after onset of symptoms and seldom survive the infection [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The most typical pathological feature in lambs is severe necrosis of the liver. Specifically, necropsy of fatal cases reveals a swollen, pale liver with focal to widespread necrosis of hepatocytes. Direct and indirect consequences of liver necrosis include icterus, oedema, and hydrops ascites. Other organs, such as the spleen, heart, kidney and intestines may reveal haemorrhages and congested veins. Fatal cases are generally associated with haemorrhages and signs of shock. Susceptibility decreases with age, although mortality rates in adult sheep may be as high as 60% [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The most characteristic feature of RVF outbreaks in sheep herds are abortion storms, in which all pregnant ewes in a herd may abort [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Humans can be infected via mosquito bite, although most human cases are attributed to contact with contaminated animal tissues, particularly during the slaughtering of diseased animals [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The disease in humans generally follows a transient, febrile course with severe headache and muscle pains. Infection of the eye may induce temporal or permanent loss of vision resulting from retinal damage [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In a minority of patients, the infection progresses to encephalitis or haemorrhagic fever, of which the latter is often fatal [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A cross-sectional study of Sudanese women correlated RVFV infection with an elevated miscarriage rate [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Notably, experiments with second-trimester human foetal tissue explants recently revealed that human syncytiotrophoblasts are susceptible and permissive to RVFV replication [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These reports warrant further studies to determine if RVFV infections pose a perhaps underestimated risk for human pregnancy.</p><p>The high abortion rates in sheep herds suggest that RVFV crosses the ovine placenta extremely efficiently. The placenta of sheep, and that of other RVFV susceptible ruminant species, is very different from the human placenta. The human placenta has the shape of a single disque whereas the ovine placenta consists of placentomes, varying in number among the different ruminant species [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Placentomes are discrete areas of extensive villous interactions between the maternal epithelial cells of the uterus, the caruncle, and the foetal trophoblasts of the allantochorion, the cotelydon, enabling efficient exchange of gases and nutrients between mother and foetus. In sheep and goats, pools of maternal blood are located in the crypts of the foetal villi, directly bordering the foetal trophoblast layer. At these so-called haemophagous zones, maternal erythrocytes are phagocytosed by trophoblasts as a principle source of iron for the developing foetus. Notably, this part of the ovine placenta resembles the haemochorial placenta of humans, in that maternal blood is in direct contact with foetal trophoblasts. However, the blood pools at the haemophagous zones in sheep and goats are filled with stagnant blood and therefore do not contribute significantly to the maternal-foetal exchange of nutrients, whereas in the human haemochorial placenta maternal blood flows along the foetal trophoblasts enabling efficient nutrient exchange.</p><p>The detrimental consequences of RVFV infection during ovine pregnancy were already reported after the first outbreak of RVF in 1930 and abortion storms have since then become a hallmark of RVF epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of RVFV-induced abortion in pregnant ewes was not yet described in literature. In the present study, we experimentally infected pregnant ewes at one third- or at mid-gestation and describe the pathogenic events that result in abortion of the ovine foetus. We furthermore investigated the susceptibility of human placental explants for the same RVFV strain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Culture media and supplements were obtained from Gibco unless indicated otherwise.

As expected, and similar as observed in lambs, all RVFV-inoculated ewes developed fever (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), which correlated with viremia as determined by RT-qPCR and virus isolation on plasma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). At 4 days post infection (dpi), one of the RVFV inoculated ewes (animal number 1764) acutely succumbed to the infection. Necropsy revealed a swollen, discoloured liver and signs of shock. Analysis of liver and spleen samples by RT-qPCR revealed high levels of viral RNA in both organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Extensive haemorrhages were found in the placentas of the two foetuses carried by this ewe and in the uterine wall. The remaining ewes were euthanized and necropsied as scheduled at 6 dpi. All ewes showed a multifocal necrotizing hepatitis which was most severe in the animal that died at 4 dpi.

During these events, all pregnant ewes in an affected herd may abort their foetuses. Although the detrimental effects of RVFV infection on ruminant pregnancy are well-recognized, the route that the virus uses to cross the placenta and the pathogenic events that result in abortion have remained undescribed. Here, we report that maternal and foetal epithelial cells in the ovine placenta are highly susceptible and permissive for RVFV and that abortion results from severe pathology of the placenta. In some ewes, the rapid progression of placental demise caused foetal mortality before foetuses could be infected.</p><p>During gestation, the progesterone hormone keeps the uterus and myometrium in a quiescent state to allow successful foetal development until parturition [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. During the first trimester of gestation in sheep, progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum which resides in the ovaries. During the second and third trimester, the developing placenta becomes an additional source of progesterone. Placental progesterone is produced by binucleate trophoblasts that migrate to the maternal epithelium to fuse with uterine epithelial cells to form so-called syncytial cells. At about 90 days of pregnancy, half of the progesterone in the pregnant ewe is produced by the corpus luteum and half by the placenta. Our study has revealed that both trophoblasts and (syncytial) epithelial cells are major target cells of RVFV. Widespread necrosis of these cells likely results in a drop of systemic progesterone levels. In addition, virus-induced necrosis of placental cells leads to the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines like TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-8, which stimulate prostaglandin (E2/F2&#x003b1;) excretion by the placental epithelium. Prostaglandins bring the corpus luteum in regression, resulting in a further drop in progesterone levels. In the absence of the inhibitory effect of progesterone, prostaglandins induce uterine contractions and cervical effacement resulting in abortion. Inflammatory cytokines, most notably TNF-&#x003b1;, are also known to reduce vascular integrity. In the face of lowered coagulation factors in maternal blood resulting from liver necrosis, this could explain the observed placental haemorrhages.</p><p>Our study has revealed that RVFV uses at least two routes to cross the ovine placenta. The first route involves the haemophagous zones of the placenta, where foetal trophoblasts are in direct contact with maternal blood. Trophoblast cells in the haemophagous zone are specialised in phagocytosis of erythrocytes from the blood to provide the foetus with iron. The presence of RVFV in maternal pools of blood in the haemophagous zone may therefore result in direct infection of trophoblasts or via co-uptake of the virus during erythrophagy. The second route initiates with infection of maternal epithelial cells of the placenta. Virus released from these cells exposes foetal trophoblasts. Progeny virus produced by infected trophoblasts is subsequently released into the foetal mesenchyme exposing endothelial cells of foetal bloodvessels, which were also identified as target cells of RVFV.</p><p>The finding that foetal endothelial cells and endothelial cells in the maternal caruncle are target cells of RVFV is notable, as most of our previous studies with juvenile and adult sheep did not reveal endothelial cell infection. However, in one of our studies, RVFV-positive endothelial cells were detected in lymphoid organs of a lamb that peracutely succumbed after developing exceptionally high viremia [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In another study, endothelial cells of the skin became infected after feeding of mosquitoes on a viremic lamb [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These findings, together with the haemorrhagic manifestations that were seen in RVFV infected placentomes in this study, calls for further research into the interaction of RVFV with endothelial cells.</p><p>In a recently published study by McMillen and co-workers, RVFV infection of human placental explants was shown for the first time, using a strain that was originally isolated from humans [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our experiments with human placental explants corroborate this research and highlight the potential risks of RVFV infection during human pregnancy. In the same study, the pathogenesis of RVFV infection in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats was described. This work demonstrated that vertical transmission in these rats occurs through direct placental infection and that viral loads in the placenta were higher than in the liver and other maternal organs, similar as observed in the present study. In our study, the ovine placenta was not only found to contain the highest viral loads but was also the only organ still containing high levels of infectious virus at the moment of necropsy. These findings suggest that RVFV efficiently counteracts innate immune responses in placental cells.</p><p>RVFV counteracts host innate immunity through several functions of the nonstructural NSs protein [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. One of the major functions of NSs is the downregulation of type I interferon (IFN) responses, which occurs through downregulation of general host gene transcription and the direct inhibition of IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA production [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Whereas in most cell types, type I IFNs play a major role in innate immunity, in cells of epithelial origin, such as the cells of the placenta, innate immunity is regulated by type III IFNs, referred to as IFN-&#x003bb; [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Importantly, both type I and type III IFNs trigger the JAK/STAT pathway, which was shown to be targeted by NSs [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that RVFV NSs facilitates replication in placental tissues by downregulating JAK/STAT signalling. On the other hand, previous studies have demonstrated that RVFV can also cross the ovine placental barrier without NSs [<xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These infections did not result in abortions but instead in stillbirths and congenital malformations, including arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly, resembling pathology in ovine foetuses infected by members of the genus <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, such as Schmallenberg virus.</p><p>In conclusion, the present work has revealed how RVFV crosses the ovine placental barrier and has provided novel insights into the pathology that results in abortion in the most susceptible target species. The sheep isolate that was used was shown to replicate efficiently in human placental explants as well, calling for further research on the risk of RVFV infection during human pregnancy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007898.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>RVFV infection results in extensive placental haemorrhages.</title><p>Placenta from a healthy ewe (A) and from an ewe inoculated with RVFV, necropsied six days after inoculation (B).

Surprisingly, pathology resulting in abortion remains poorly described. In the present work, pregnant ewes were inoculated intravenously with a highly virulent strain of RVFV and necropsied at different time points post inoculation. Tissues were collected and analyzed by real-time qPCR, virus isolation, and immunohistochemistry. Results reveal that maternal epithelial cells are the first placental cells to be infected, followed by fetal trophoblasts. In addition, RVFV can bypass the maternal epithelial cell layer by directly targeting fetal trophoblasts in the hemophagous zone, a region of the ovine placenta where maternal blood is in direct contact with fetal cells. Abortion was associated with widespread necrosis of placental tissues and severe hemorrhage. Experiments with human placental explants revealed efficient infection and replication in both cyto- and syncytiotrophoblasts. Results demonstrate that RVFV targets the fetal-maternal interface in both ovine and human placentas. The virus crossed the ovine placental barrier via two distinct routes, ultimately resulting in placental and fetal demise followed by abortion. Finding show that the same RVFV strain replicates efficiently in human trophoblasts and underscores the risk of RVFV infection during human pregnancy.</p><p>This is an excellently executed and well-illustrated study. Authors have nicely analyzed and compared ovine and human placental tissue with respect to RVFV infection.</p><p>It remains unclear how closely human placental explants mimic the in situ situation. In order to infect an ovine fetus a pathogen has to overcome several tissue layers compared to human placental tissue. This could indicate that human fetal infection should occur very frequently.</p><p>Authors report &#x02026;.. &#x0201c;In addition, RVFV can bypass the maternal epithelial cell layer by directly targeting fetal trophoblasts in the hemophagous zone, a region of the ovine placenta where maternal blood is in direct contact with fetal cells.&#x0201d; Does this represents a back-door for any kind of placental infection in ruminants?</p><p>Conditions of RVFV PCR including used primers should be provided in more detail.</p><p>Table 1 should be accompanied by a more informative legend explaining the different colors, NT, abbreviations, mentioned internal case numbers, meaning of 1/3 and &#x000bd; gestation etc. Table should be readable without reading the remaining manuscript.</p><p>Numbering of figures starting at line 253 should occur in numeric/alphabetic order (e.g. please start with Figure 1a and not 1e).</p><p>It would be interesting to know whether alive fetuses of experiment 2 would develop long-term alterations in any other organ? </p><p>How would the authors explain the difference with respect to placental/fetal susceptibility between experiment 1 and 2?</p><p>Line 272: it is stated: &#x0201c;&#x02026;..observed an increase in mass of the fetal and maternal villi with concomitant decrease in mesenchyme (meaning mesenchymal tissue?)&#x02026;&#x02026;.&#x0201d;. How was this statement substantiated (e.g. quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis?)? Furthermore, how would authors explain this tissue enlargement and decrease in mesenchymal tissue within such a short time period, especially in experiment 1? What about placental tissue of experiment 2 without macroscopic lesions? </p><p>The question remains whether the extensive hemorrhage in placental tissue is solely due to a direct virus effect or represents a secondary event, at least in part, mediated by (maternal?) liver damage. </p><p>Overall, I miss a comment on the pathology found in the ewes. It would be important to know whether animals suffered from severe liver damage, which could complicate or contribute to placental lesions. Furthermore, is there a preferential infection of placentomes during pregnancy or did animals suffer predominantly from liver necrosis and placental lesions represent a concurrent but less sever organ manifestation? </p><p>It remains unclear whether abortion is due to placental necrosis, drop in systemic progesterone levels or systemic effects of RVFV infection in the ewe.</p><p>I miss a comment on the vasculature in the affected placentas (e.g. necrosis, vasculitis?). It is stated that&#x02026;&#x0201d;blood vessels were found that stained positively for RVFV in the endothelium and/or smooth muscle cells in the blood vessel wall&#x02026;&#x0201d;.in line 303/304. In addition, the prominent endothelial staining in figure 6 raises the question whether RVFV infection triggered morphologically recognizable or functional cell damage. Did these vessels also display necrosis (caspase 3, TUNEL-positivity?)?</p><p>Line 320: what is meant by &#x02026;endothelial staining&#x02026;(e.g. immunohistochemistry for endothelial cells or RVFV?)?</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>Figure 4: Please indicate (mark) more clearly the fetal and maternal part of the placentome.</p><p>Findings in figure 7 should be depicted at higher magnification for c and d, in addition. </p><p>Blood-tingled number tags should be removed in the supplementary file figure 1 and 2.</p><p>Supplementary file figure 1 and 2: Please provide a more explanatory, descriptive legend.</p><p>Supplementary file figure 3b: Positive maternal vessels are not recognizable at the tip of the arrow. </p><p>Mesenchyme is spelled differently in figure 3 and the text (line 273 and 374).</p><p>Reviewer #2: See my specific comments below regarding figures</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p><p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p><p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p><p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: See my comments regarding speculation with regards to the conclusions</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</p><p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.

Pregnant ewes suffer fetal abortions when infected in nature, and this massive fetal infection has been known since the time that RVF was first described. However, the mechanism by which RVFV infects the ovine placental has not been thoroughly documented in either a natural or experimental setting, and this manuscript addresses this important gap in the field. The authors perform experimental inoculation of pregnant sheep at 2 time points during gestation. The ewes and their fetuses are monitored for RVFV infection and pathology. The authors are to be commended for completion of a difficult study. Given the limitations of a large animal study with a high-containment agricultural pathogen, the data presented here contribute significantly to our understanding of livestock placental infection by RVFV. Comments are mostly minor for clarity of text and data presentation. This reviewer would caution the authors to avoid unnecessary speculation in the discussion. While the histology was limited to H&#x00026;E and basic IHC, this reviewer feels the data largely support the conclusions. </p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Line 54 &#x02013; Please clarify that the severe outcome of RVFV during LIVESTOCK pregnancy is well documented. The effect in human pregnancy is not as clear. </p><p>2. Paragraph beginning at line 89 and ending at 105 describing the ovine placental structure should reference the appropriate citations. </p><p>3. Line 143-44: Please clarify what &#x0201c;right upfront the national breeding season&#x0201d; means.</p><p>4. Line 171: Please clarify what 1% a/a means. </p><p>5. Throughout the manuscript, the term &#x0201c;virus isolation&#x0201d; is used when it appears to refer to infectious virus quantification by TCID50. </p><p>6. Results section beginning on line 235: Please provide information on how the inoculum dose and the gestation time points were chosen. </p><p>7. Line 257: &#x0201c;dpi 7&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;7 dpi&#x0201d;</p><p>8. Line 275-277: The authors refer to hemorrhage of the uterine wall and placentomes of ewe 1764&#x02013; does this refer to macroscopic hemorrhage (as seen in Supp Fig 1) or microscopic hemorrhage visible by histology? </p><p>9. Line 307 &#x02013; remove the comma after Experiment 1.</p><p>10. Line 313-315 &#x02013; Do the authors feel that the 4/8 dead fetuses without vRNA in the liver were not directly infected but rather died due to destruction of the associated placenta?</p><p>11. Lines 348-365 &#x02013; Description of sheep pregnancy development needs the addition of references.</p><p>12. Line 356-365 &#x02013; Since neither progesterone nor cytokine levels were measured in this study, the conclusions from this paragraph are speculative.</p><p>13. Lines 366-376 &#x02013; Description of two routes that RVFV uses to cross the placenta is also largely speculative. The data in Fig 4 clearly show a lot of viral antigen within the placenta at 6 dpi, but without a true serial sacrifice experiment, it is difficult to definitively say what &#x02018;route&#x02019; is used. </p><p>Comments regarding figures:</p><p>1. Fig. 1 &#x02013; please show rectal temperatures of the control group</p><p>2. Fig. 4 &#x02013; What counterstain is used for the IHC staining? How certain are you of the trophoblast cell identification without cell-specific markers or a counterstain? It would be helpful to have a square or box in (a) and (d) indicating the zoomed-in areas shown in b, c, e, and f. It would also be helpful to have uninfected control placentomes stained for IHC visualize any background. In addition, labeling of the structures in Fig 4 (similar to the labeling in Fig 3c,d) would help to orient the reader since most readers are not intimately familiar with placental histology. There does not seem to be an arrow in 4b that is referred to in the legend.</p><p>3. Fig. 5 &#x02013; There is no black asterisk that is referred to in the legend.</p><p>4. Fig. 7 &#x02013; How many human placental donors were tested? How many tissue explants were tested per donor per time point? Is the data in this figure a compilation of replication from different donors or a single donor? What is the counterstain for the IHC? In c and d, are these tissue explants the cross section of a single villus? Please clarify what it is that the reader is looking at. In such a small piece of tissue, how confident are you of the cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts without a specific cell marker? Addition of arrows to indicate the different cell types would be helpful. Is there any background IHC staining in uninfected human placental explants? Control staining images would be helpful. </p><p>5. Supplemental Fig 1 &#x02013; are the negative control placenta and the RVFV-infected placenta from the same day of gestation?</p><p>6. Supplemental Fig 2 &#x02013; same question for the control animals. Are they the same gestational age as the fetuses in c, d or e, f?</p><p>--------------------</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (what does this mean?).
