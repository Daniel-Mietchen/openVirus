<p>The finding that foetal endothelial cells and endothelial cells in the maternal caruncle are target cells of RVFV is notable, as most of our previous studies with juvenile and adult sheep did not reveal endothelial cell infection. However, in one of our studies, RVFV-positive endothelial cells were detected in lymphoid organs of a lamb that peracutely succumbed after developing exceptionally high viremia [
