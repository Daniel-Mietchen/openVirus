<p>RVFV counteracts host innate immunity through several functions of the nonstructural NSs protein [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. One of the major functions of NSs is the downregulation of type I interferon (IFN) responses, which occurs through downregulation of general host gene transcription and the direct inhibition of IFN-β mRNA production [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Whereas in most cell types, type I IFNs play a major role in innate immunity, in cells of epithelial origin, such as the cells of the placenta, innate immunity is regulated by type III IFNs, referred to as IFN-λ [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Importantly, both type I and type III IFNs trigger the JAK/STAT pathway, which was shown to be targeted by NSs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We therefore hypothesize that RVFV NSs facilitates replication in placental tissues by downregulating JAK/STAT signalling. On the other hand, previous studies have demonstrated that RVFV can also cross the ovine placental barrier without NSs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These infections did not result in abortions but instead in stillbirths and congenital malformations, including arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly, resembling pathology in ovine foetuses infected by members of the genus
