<p>In a recently published study by McMillen and co-workers, RVFV infection of human placental explants was shown for the first time, using a strain that was originally isolated from humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our experiments with human placental explants corroborate this research and highlight the potential risks of RVFV infection during human pregnancy. In the same study, the pathogenesis of RVFV infection in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats was described. This work demonstrated that vertical transmission in these rats occurs through direct placental infection and that viral loads in the placenta were higher than in the liver and other maternal organs, similar as observed in the present study. In our study, the ovine placenta was not only found to contain the highest viral loads but was also the only organ still containing high levels of infectious virus at the moment of necropsy. These findings suggest that RVFV efficiently counteracts innate immune responses in placental cells.
