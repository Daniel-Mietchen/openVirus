<p>In conclusion, the present work has revealed how RVFV crosses the ovine placental barrier and has provided novel insights into the pathology that results in abortion in the most susceptible target species. The sheep isolate that was used was shown to replicate efficiently in human placental explants as well, calling for further research on the risk of RVFV infection during human pregnancy.</p>
