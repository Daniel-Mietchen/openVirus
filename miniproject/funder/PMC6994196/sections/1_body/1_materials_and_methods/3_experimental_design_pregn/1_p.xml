<p>At a conventional Dutch sheep farm, 30 Texel-Swifter mix breed ewes that had delivered healthy lambs before, were treated with progesterone sponges to synchronise pregnancies. After removal of the sponges, ewes were naturally mated. Ultrasounds were performed at 6â€“7 weeks after mating to confirm gestation. Pregnant animals to be enrolled in the studies were subsequently transported to WBVR and allowed to acclimatize for one week before the start of the experimental period under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions.</p>
