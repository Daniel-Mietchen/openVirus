<p>At 55 days of pregnancy (experiment 1) or 78 days of pregnancy (experiment 2), animals were inoculated via intravenous (IV) route with 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of RVFV in 1 ml medium, or with 1 ml medium (negative control animals). Following challenge, animals were closely monitored for clinical signs, body temperatures were recorded, and EDTA blood samples were collected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The ewes of experiment 1 were euthanized and necropsied at 6 days post infection and the ewes of experiment 2 were euthanized on day 4 or at abortion (day 7). Ewes and their foetuses were euthanized by intravenous administration of 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (Euthasol, ASTfarma) and subsequent exsanguination. Foetuses were exsanguinated by severing of the umbilical cord after which foetal blood was collected in EDTA tubes. From the ewes, samples were taken from the liver and spleen. From the foetuses, samples were taken from the brain, spleen, leg muscle tissue and liver. Samples were also taken from the amniotic fluid, umbilical cord and the placentomes (3 per foetus). Samples were placed on dry ice and subsequently stored at -80Â°C. Samples for histology and immunohistochemistry were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for at least 48 h followed by routine processing into paraffin blocks.
