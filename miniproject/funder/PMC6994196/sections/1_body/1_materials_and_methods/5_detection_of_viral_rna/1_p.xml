<p>RNA was extracted from ovine plasma and organ samples. Briefly, organ suspensions were prepared by homogenising 0,3–1 g of tissue in an IKA Ultra Turrax Tube DT-20 containing 7 ml CO
 <sub>2</sub>-Independent Medium (CIM) supplemented with 1% a/a. The suspensions were transferred to 15 ml Falcon tubes and cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4952 
 <italic>x g</italic>. Fifty μl Proteinase K (5 μg/ml, Sigma) was added to 200 μl of the plasma samples or organ suspensions. Next, 200 μl AL buffer (Qiagen), supplemented with 2 μl polyadenylic acid A (5 mg/ml, Sigma) was added, the samples were thoroughly mixed and incubated at 56°C for 15 min. Subsequently, 250 μl 99% ethanol was added and RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
