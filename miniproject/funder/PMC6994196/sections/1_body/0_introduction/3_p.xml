<p>The high abortion rates in sheep herds suggest that RVFV crosses the ovine placenta extremely efficiently. The placenta of sheep, and that of other RVFV susceptible ruminant species, is very different from the human placenta. The human placenta has the shape of a single disque whereas the ovine placenta consists of placentomes, varying in number among the different ruminant species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Placentomes are discrete areas of extensive villous interactions between the maternal epithelial cells of the uterus, the caruncle, and the foetal trophoblasts of the allantochorion, the cotelydon, enabling efficient exchange of gases and nutrients between mother and foetus. In sheep and goats, pools of maternal blood are located in the crypts of the foetal villi, directly bordering the foetal trophoblast layer. At these so-called haemophagous zones, maternal erythrocytes are phagocytosed by trophoblasts as a principle source of iron for the developing foetus. Notably, this part of the ovine placenta resembles the haemochorial placenta of humans, in that maternal blood is in direct contact with foetal trophoblasts. However, the blood pools at the haemophagous zones in sheep and goats are filled with stagnant blood and therefore do not contribute significantly to the maternal-foetal exchange of nutrients, whereas in the human haemochorial placenta maternal blood flows along the foetal trophoblasts enabling efficient nutrient exchange.
