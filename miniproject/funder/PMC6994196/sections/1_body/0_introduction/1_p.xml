<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a negative-strand RNA virus of the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> (former family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes, predominantly by species of the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The most typical pathological feature in lambs is severe necrosis of the liver. Specifically, necropsy of fatal cases reveals a swollen, pale liver with focal to widespread necrosis of hepatocytes. Direct and indirect consequences of liver necrosis include icterus, oedema, and hydrops ascites. Other organs, such as the spleen, heart, kidney and intestines may reveal haemorrhages and congested veins. Fatal cases are generally associated with haemorrhages and signs of shock. Susceptibility decreases with age, although mortality rates in adult sheep may be as high as 60% [
