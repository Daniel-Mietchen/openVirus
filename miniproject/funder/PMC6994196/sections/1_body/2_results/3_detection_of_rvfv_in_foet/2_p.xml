<p>All 8 foetuses of the ewes necropsied at 6 dpi were found dead within the uterus (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007898.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The livers of these foetuses were also positive for viral RNA and in 4 out of 8 foetuses viral antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. In these 4 foetuses, the liver showed massive necrosis with only a few viable hepatocytes left (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Brain samples collected from 5 of the 8 foetuses were also found to contain viral RNA. Immunohistochemical staining of brain tissues from these foetuses revealed viral antigen in the blood and the endothelium of the blood vessels throughout the brain and arachnoidea (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). No viral antigen was detected in neurons or glial cells. RVFV antigen was also detected in endothelial cells of blood vessels of the umbilical cord (
