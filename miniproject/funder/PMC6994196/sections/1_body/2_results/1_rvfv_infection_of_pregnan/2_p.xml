<p>To study the pathology at an earlier and later stage than 6 dpi, another group of 6 ewes from the same herd was inoculated with RVFV (experiment 2). Of this group, three ewes were euthanized and necropsied at 4 dpi and the remaining three ewes when abortion was imminent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Of note, these ewes were at the moment of inoculation at mid gestation. As expected, all ewes of this experiment developed similar rises in rectal temperatures and viremia levels as those of experiment 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Necropsy at 4 dpi revealed multifocal necrotizing hepatitis in all ewes but no macroscopic abnormalities in placentas and unaffected, live foetuses. In the morning of day 7 post infection, one ewe had aborted 2 foetuses and a second one was is the process of aborting (2 foetuses already expelled, 1 foetus still in the uterus). Necropsy of the third ewe (#1846) revealed three foetuses that were still inside the uterus but with placentomes showing extensive haemorrhages. One of these foetuses was alive, whereas the remaining two foetuses were found dead (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007898.g002">Fig 2</xref>). It was striking to observe that viral RNA levels increased in placentomes between days 4 and 7 (
