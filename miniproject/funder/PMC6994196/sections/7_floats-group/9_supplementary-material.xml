  <title>Replication of RVFV in caruncles is associated with bleeding and infection of maternal endothelial cells.</title>
  <p>(A) Micrograph of HE-stained caruncle tissue of ewe 1845 euthanized at 7 dpi (experiment 2). Notice the extensive haemorrhages at the base of the caruncle (arrowhead and inset). (B) Immunohistochemical staining of RVFV antigen. Positive staining is only seen in those areas where necrotic maternal epithelium is still present. Some maternal blood vessels are also stained (arrowhead and inset) and show the presence of RVFV antigen in the endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of the tunica media (inset). Bar = 1000 μm (A, B), 100 μm (inset A), or 50 μm (inset B). LP; lamina propria, C; caruncle.</p>
