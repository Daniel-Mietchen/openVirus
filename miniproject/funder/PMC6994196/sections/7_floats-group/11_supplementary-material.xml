  <title>Schematic presentation of the ovine and human placenta.</title>
  <p>A human placenta consists of a single discoid plaque whereas an ovine placenta consists of placentomes (A). A cross section of both placentas is depicted, showing the maternal tissues in shades of pink, and the foetal villi in orange. Blood and arteries are depicted in red, veins are depicted in blue (B). In the synepitheliochorial placenta (C, left panel), the foetal blood is separated from maternal blood by several maternal and foetal cell layers. In the haemophagous zone (C, middle panel) maternal blood is in direct contact with the foetal trophoblasts, which is similar to the human haemochorial placenta (C, right panel).</p>
