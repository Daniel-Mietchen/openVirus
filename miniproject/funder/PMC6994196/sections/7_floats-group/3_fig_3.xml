  <title>The ovine placenta at different stages of gestation.</title>
  <p>(A) Schematic presentation of an ovine foetus, the cotyledons and their blood supply. Only the foetal parts of the placenta (cotyledons) are displayed, the uterus wall and maternal part of the placenta (caruncles) are not depicted. At the right, a cross section of a placentome is depicted, showing the maternal tissues in shades of pink, and the foetal villi in orange. Haemophagous zones at the base of the foetal villi are depicted in red. (B) A schematic overview of the cotyledon (center) with the different cell layers of the synepitheliochorial placenta at the left and the haemophagous zone at the right. In the synepitheliochorial placenta, the foetal blood is separated from maternal blood by several maternal and foetal cell layers. In the haemophagous zone maternal blood is in direct contact with the foetal trophoblasts. (C, D) HE staining of placentomes, the haemophagous zones and synepitheliochorial placenta at 1/3 gestation (C) and 1/2 gestation (D). Red interrupted lines indicate the boundaries between maternal and foetal tissues. F = foetal villus, M = maternal villus, MB = maternal blood. Notice the increase in the foetal/maternal villous interface in the synepitheliochorial placenta and the increase in size and erythrophagous activity of the trophoblasts of the haemophagous zone between 1/3 and 1/2 of the gestation period.</p>
