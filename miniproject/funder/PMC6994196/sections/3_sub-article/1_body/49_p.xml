<p>Line 272: it is stated: “…..observed an increase in mass of the fetal and maternal villi with concomitant decrease in mesenchyme (meaning mesenchymal tissue?)…….”. How was this statement substantiated (e.g. quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis?)? Furthermore, how would authors explain this tissue enlargement and decrease in mesenchymal tissue within such a short time period, especially in experiment 1? What about placental tissue of experiment 2 without macroscopic lesions? </p>
