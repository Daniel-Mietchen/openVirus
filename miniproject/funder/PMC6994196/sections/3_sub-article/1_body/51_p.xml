<p>Overall, I miss a comment on the pathology found in the ewes. It would be important to know whether animals suffered from severe liver damage, which could complicate or contribute to placental lesions. Furthermore, is there a preferential infection of placentomes during pregnancy or did animals suffer predominantly from liver necrosis and placental lesions represent a concurrent but less sever organ manifestation? </p>
