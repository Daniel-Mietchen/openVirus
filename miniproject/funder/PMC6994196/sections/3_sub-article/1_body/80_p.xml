<p>Reviewer #2: Livestock are highly susceptible to infection with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Pregnant ewes suffer fetal abortions when infected in nature, and this massive fetal infection has been known since the time that RVF was first described. However, the mechanism by which RVFV infects the ovine placental has not been thoroughly documented in either a natural or experimental setting, and this manuscript addresses this important gap in the field. The authors perform experimental inoculation of pregnant sheep at 2 time points during gestation. The ewes and their fetuses are monitored for RVFV infection and pathology. The authors are to be commended for completion of a difficult study. Given the limitations of a large animal study with a high-containment agricultural pathogen, the data presented here contribute significantly to our understanding of livestock placental infection by RVFV. Comments are mostly minor for clarity of text and data presentation. This reviewer would caution the authors to avoid unnecessary speculation in the discussion. While the histology was limited to H&amp;E and basic IHC, this reviewer feels the data largely support the conclusions. </p>
