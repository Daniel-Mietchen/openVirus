<p>2. Fig. 4 â€“ What counterstain is used for the IHC staining? How certain are you of the trophoblast cell identification without cell-specific markers or a counterstain? It would be helpful to have a square or box in (a) and (d) indicating the zoomed-in areas shown in b, c, e, and f. It would also be helpful to have uninfected control placentomes stained for IHC visualize any background. In addition, labeling of the structures in Fig 4 (similar to the labeling in Fig 3c,d) would help to orient the reader since most readers are not intimately familiar with placental histology. There does not seem to be an arrow in 4b that is referred to in the legend.</p>
