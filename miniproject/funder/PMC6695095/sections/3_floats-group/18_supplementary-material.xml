  <title>Schematic of M segment mRNAs and gene products.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> The M segment of influenza virus is template for synthesis of mRNA
   <sub>7</sub> (encoding M1), mRNA M
   <sub>10</sub> (encoding M2), and mRNA
   <sub>11</sub> (which encodes a putative but unconfirmed 10 amino acid peptide from a short open reading frame). (
   <bold>B)</bold> Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus M1 and M2 proteins differ from the avian consensus sequences by 9 residues in M1 and 7 residues in M2. The M segments differ by 8.3% at the nucleotide level. (
   <bold>C)</bold> Seasonal H3N2 influenza virus strain A/Panama/2007/99 M1 and M2 proteins differ from the avian consensus sequences by 11 residues in M1 and 14 residues in M2. The M segments differ by 9% at the nucleotide level. (
   <bold>D)</bold> Seasonal H3N2 influenza virus strain A/Bethesda/55/15 M1 and M2 proteins differ from the avian consensus sequences by 11 residues in M1 and 16 residues in M2. The M segments differ by 9.5% at the nucleotide level.
