  <title>Visualization of M2 localization by immunofluorescence microscopy at 12 h post-infection in A549 and 293T cells.</title>
  <p>A549 
   <bold>(A, B)</bold>, or 293T 
   <bold>(C, D)</bold> cells were inoculated with the indicated viruses, encoding avian or human M segments, at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell. Cells were fixed at 12 hpi, permeabilised, and stained with anti-M2 (Mab E10; red) and DAPI (blue) followed by imaging with confocal microscopy. Examples of optical sections are shown, either as merged 2-color images or the red and blue channels alone (in grey scale). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A549 cells with 63x magnification. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> 3x magnification of the same images shown in 
   <bold>A. (C)</bold> 293T cells with 63x magnification. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> 3x magnification of the same images shown in 
   <bold>C.</bold> Brightness was adjusted for optimal clarity, with all images treated equally.
