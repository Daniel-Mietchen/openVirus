  <title>pH1N1 influenza virus M segment increases kinetics of replication of PR8-based viruses among guinea pigs.</title>
  <p>Groups of four guinea pigs were inoculated with 10 PFU of each avian M-encoding virus, or NL09 M-encoding virus, as indicated. Graphs show individual titers obtained from animals used in three independent experiments. 
   <bold>(A-E)</bold> Virus replication in nasal wash of inoculated animals was measured by plaque titration at days 2, 4, 6, and 8 post-infection and the titers at each time point were plotted (dotted lines). The differences between PR8 NL09 M and each avian M-encoding virus were considered significant. Statistical significance in kinetics of growth was determined by assessing the interaction of time and virus using repeated measures, two-way, multiple comparisons ANOVA on mean values, with Bonferroni correction applied to account for comparison of a limited no of means.
