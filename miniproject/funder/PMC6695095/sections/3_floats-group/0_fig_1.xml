  <title>pH1N1 M segment does not confer improved growth relative to avian M segment in avian cells at 37Â°C.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> A panel of PR8-based viruses was rescued by reverse genetics. The viruses differ only in the identity of the M segment, which were derived from A/mallard/MN/99 (H3N8), A/rhea/NC/93 (H7N1), A/duck/Alberta/76 (H1N1), or A/NL/602/09 (H1N1) viruses. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) or (
   <bold>C</bold>) chicken DF-1 cells were infected at low MOI with the indicated viruses. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Quail QT-6 cells or 
   <bold>(E)</bold> DF-1 cells were infected at a high MOI of 5 PFU/cell with the indicated viruses. In all avian systems assessed, the pH1N1 M segment did not confer an increase in magnitude or kinetics of growth, relative to any avian-origin M segment. Multi-cycle and single-cycle growth were assessed in three independent experiments, with three technical replicates per experiment. Graphs show the means with SD for the three experiments. Statistical significance was determined using repeated measures, two-way, multiple ANOVA on log-transformed values, with Bonferroni correction applied to account for comparison of a limited number of means.
