  <title>Activation of LC3B II correlates with high expression of M2 protein in A549 cells regardless of M2 amino acid composition.</title>
  <p>PR8 NL09 M virus and PR8 avian M virus, along with six chimeric variant PR8-based viruses, were inoculated at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell onto A549 cells. Cells were incubated for 8 h, then lysed. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Western immunoblot analysis of virus-infected A549 cells. Vinculin was measured to allow normalization of viral protein levels. NP was measured to assess viral replication. Levels of M1 and M2 protein were assessed using an antibody (Mab E10) to a common epitope at the amino terminus of M1 and M2 proteins, allowing their direct comparison. Levels of LC3B I and II were assessed using an antibody that detects both the precursor and activated forms of LC3B protein. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> M1 protein and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> M2 protein were normalized to vinculin and displayed as a percentage of total protein expressed from the M gene. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> The ratio of M1:M2 protein expression. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> LC3B I protein and 
   <bold>(F)</bold> LC3B II protein were normalized to vinculin and displayed as a percentage of total LC3B protein. Graphs in 
   <bold>B-F</bold> show the means with SD from three independent experiments. For each experiment, two replicate Western immunoblots were performed and quantitated. Statistical significance was assessed using ordinary one-way ANOVA.
