<p>Multi-cycle and single-cycle growth in cell culture was assessed in three independent experiments, with three technical sample replicates per experiment. Overall, statistical significance was determined using repeated measures, two-way, multiple comparisons ANOVA on log-transformed mean values, with Bonferroni correction applied to account for comparison of a limited number of means, as well as by assessing pairwise comparisons of viruses at each time point, except for single-cycle growth in cell culture in the presence of amantadine, which was assessed in four independent experiments, with three technical sample replicates per experiment. Overall statistical significance was determined using repeated measures, two-way, multiple comparisons ANOVA on log-transformed values, with Sidakâ€™s correction applied, as well as by assessing pairwise comparisons of viruses at each time point.</p>
