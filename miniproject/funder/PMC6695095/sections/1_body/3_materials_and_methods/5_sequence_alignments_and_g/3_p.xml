<p>To assess the degree of amino acid variability in the M segment of avian IAV of any subtype, we searched Genbank for full-length M1 or M2 protein sequences derived from avian H1Nx to H16Nx subtype IAV, collected between 1970 and 2000, from any geographical location. These dates were chosen to avoid selecting sequences representing isolates originating from the repeated H5 subtype HPAI incursions into poultry populations which dominate the Genbank database from the early 2000s onwards, and which would likely bias the subsequent analysis.</p>
