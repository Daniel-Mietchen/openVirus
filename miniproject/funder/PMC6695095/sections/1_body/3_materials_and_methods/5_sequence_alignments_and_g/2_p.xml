<p>To obtain a consensus nucleotide sequence and to assess the degree of variability in the M segment of H1N1 subtype avian IAVs, we searched the Genbank nucleotide database for full-length M segment sequences derived from avian H1N1 subtype IAV collected between 1976 and 2008 from any temperate Northern hemisphere location. We obtained 262 sequences, which included sequences with partial 3’ and 5’ UTRs, and manually curated the sequences to (i) remove swine and human lineage derived H1N1 M segments, retaining 247 sequences, and (ii) trim UTR sequences from the retained segments. Alignment of the sequences by Clustal W provided a working consensus sequence and revealed up to 7% variability at the nucleotide level among the selected avian host-derived sequences.</p>
