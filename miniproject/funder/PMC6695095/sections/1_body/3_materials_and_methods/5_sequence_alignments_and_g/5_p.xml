<p>To identify a consensus nucleotide sequence for the 2009 pH1N1 IAV, and compare it to the avian consensus sequence, we searched Genbank for full-length M segments derived from pH1N1 subtype IAV isolated in North America, collected between the 7
 <sup>th</sup> June and the 20
 <sup>th</sup> June 2009, which was shortly after emergence of the pH1N1 lineage into the human population. 189 individual nucleotide sequences were obtained, curated, and aligned, to provide a working consensus sequence for the pH1N1 M segment. The pH1N1 M segments possessed &gt;2% variability at the nucleotide level. The A/NL/602/09 (H1N1) (NL09) M segment is a 100% match to the consensus sequence of the 2009 pH1N1 lineage at the nucleotide level, and the M segment from this strain was adopted for use throughout the current study. Interestingly, comparison of the NL09 M segment to the avian consensus sequence revealed 8.3% difference at the nucleotide level, and 9 and 7 amino acid changes in M1 and M2 proteins, respectively (
