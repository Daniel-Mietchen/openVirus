<p>To date, most publications related to autophagy in IAV-infected cells have used the PR8 or WSN lab-adapted strains, the X31 variant of PR8, or avian IAVs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We found that PR8 virus expresses levels of M2 in mammalian cells that are comparable with avian IAVs. This phenotype may be a result of adaptation to growth in chicken eggs. Owing to the use of viruses carrying lab-adapted M segments, the current literature suggests that IAV infection routinely induces a block in autophagy [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We also see evidence of such a block when using viruses that express high levels of M2, but we propose that this phenotype is a symptom of poor adaptation to the mammalian host cell. Analysis of viruses carrying human M segments in mammalian cells suggests that low levels of M2 and activation, but not blocking, of autophagy are the norm in IAV-infected cells.
