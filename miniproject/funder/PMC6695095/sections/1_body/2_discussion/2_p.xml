<p>Quantification of IAV encoded mRNAs within infected cells indicated that overexpression of M2 from avian IAV M segments stems from over-production of the corresponding mRNA. M2 is encoded by the mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> transcript, which is generated through splicing of the M1 message, mRNA
 <sub>7</sub> [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Thus, regulation of M2 gene expression is intimately linked to the cellular splicing machinery. Our data indicate that this is a finely balanced interaction between IAV and its host cell, which is susceptible to disruption upon transfer to new species. In this regard, it is notable that the M segment splice donor and acceptor sites are identical between the human and avian IAVs examined. M segment sequences outside of these canonical splice sites have, however, been shown to modulate splicing efficiency [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], have been shown to alter the efficiency of splicing. Nucleotide differences in these binding regions exist between human- and avian-adapted M segments. An interesting area of further investigation will be to test whether there are differences in the binding of human and avian mRNA
 <sub>7</sub> molecules to mammalian SF2/ASF, hnRNPK, and NS1-binding proteins.
