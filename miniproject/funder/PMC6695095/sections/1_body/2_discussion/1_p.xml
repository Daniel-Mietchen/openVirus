<p>Our data indicate that dysregulation of gene expression from the IAV M segment contributes to the limited replicative capacity of avian IAVs in mammalian hosts. When transcribed within mammalian cells, avian IAV M segments gave rise to abundant mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> and correspondingly high levels of the encoded M2 proton channel. Comparison to matched virus-host systems indicated that this M2 expression profile was an aberrant feature of avian IAV replication in mammalian cells. When present at high levels, M2 had marked effects on the infected cell, blocking the turnover of autophagic vesicles and redirecting LC3B II, the activated form of a critical autophagy mediator, to the plasma membrane. These effects were found to rely on the proton channel activity of M2 and occurred when either the avian or human M2 protein was overexpressed in infected cells. Importantly, the reduction in viral growth conferred by avian M segments in mammalian systems could be attributed at least in part to disruption of vesicular homeostasis and was fully attributed to the altered expression levels of M1 and M2. Thus, our data identify the regulation of viral gene expression as a novel host-dependent feature of the IAV lifecycle that contributes to the host range restriction of this virus (
