<p>Notably, while an avian M2 protein was sufficient to support robust viral replication in mammalian systems when expressed at low levels, this sufficiency did not extend to transmission. Virus expressing the avian M2 from a human M segment transmitted poorly, indicating that the IAV M2 carries viral determinants of transmission and that these determinants are not well conserved between avian and human strains. This novel observation also supports the notion that high replicative capacity of a virus in a given host species is not necessarily sufficient for transmission between individuals. In this context, it will be interesting to evaluate the impact of avian M2 amino acid signatures on virion stability in the environment.</p>
