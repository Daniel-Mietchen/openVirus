<p>An interaction between the IAV M2 protein and the cellular autophagy pathway has been reported previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To test whether M2 expression from avian vs. human M segments has differential effects on autophagy, we first evaluated the level of LC3B lipidation in PR8 NL09 M- and PR8 avian M-infected cells. Upon activation of the autophagy pathway, LC3B is modified through the addition of phosphotidylethanolamine [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This lipidated form, called LC3B II, remains associated with the membranes of maturing and mature autophagosomes. Thus, increased levels of LC3B II in the cell are indicative of autophagosome formation; however, under normal conditions LC3B I and II are cycled through an autophagic flux which involves autophagosome maturation and degradation via fusion with lysosomes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A block in this fusion event can therefore lead to accumulation of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm and, consequently, accumulation of LC3B II in the cell.
