<p>To assess the contribution of the M segment to host adaptation, we generated a panel of IAVs possessing human- or avian-derived M segments in the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) [PR8] background (

 </bold>). The M segments used were selected with the aims of representing circulating human IAVs and capturing the breadth of diversity of M segment sequences present in wild waterfowl. In addition to three wild-type avian M segments, we included in our panel a mutant of the dk/Alb/76 M segment that carries a uniquely identified mutation in M2 (S89). Reversion of this unique amino acid residue to glycine yields an M2 protein matching the consensus amino acid sequence of IAVs in wild bird reservoirs. The human-adapted M segment analyzed most extensively herein is that of the pandemic A/NL/602/09 (H1N1) strain [NL09].
