 </bold>), Western immunoblot analysis of LC3B revealed decreased LC3B I and increased LC3B II upon infection of A549, 293T or MDCK cells, with avian or human M-encoding IAV, with the effect being stronger for viruses possessing avian M segments. Interestingly, addition of amantadine reversed the intracellular accumulation of LC3B II in both human and avian M-infected A549 cells (
