<p>In A549 cells, the PR8 NL09 M virus showed relatively high abundance of mRNA
 <sub>7</sub> and low abundance of mRNA
 <sub>10</sub>, as was seen in DF-1 cells (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g007">Fig 7A</xref>
 </bold>). By contrast, for viruses carrying avian-adapted M segments, mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> levels exceeded those of mRNA
 <sub>7</sub> in A549 cells (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>
 </bold>). Both decreases in mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> levels and increases in mRNA
 <sub>7</sub> levels contributed to the altered relative abundance. Again, no significant differences in relative mRNA
 <sub>11</sub> levels among the viruses were noted (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g007">Fig 7D</xref>
 </bold>) suggesting that changes in splicing to produce mRNA
 <sub>11</sub> do not contribute to changes in M segment mRNA and protein expression observed in A549 cells. Overall, our data point to increased splicing to produce mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> as the underlying mechanism leading to heightened M2 expression from avian M segments in A549 cells, and suggest that cis-acting signals present on the M segment are responsible for driving the disparate M2 expression levels.
