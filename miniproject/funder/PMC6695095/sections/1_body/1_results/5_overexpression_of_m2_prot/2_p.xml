<p>As expected, based on the levels of the encoded proteins, mRNA

 <sub>7</sub> were ~70–75% and were not significantly different from those of PR8 NL09 M virus (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g006">Fig 6B</xref>

 <sub>10</sub> was expressed at low levels (10–40% of total segment 7 mRNA), and in the case of two avian M segment-containing viruses (PR8 dkAlb76 M; PR8 dkAlb76 M 89G), the levels of mRNA
 <sub>10</sub> were not significantly different from those expressed by the PR8 NL09 M virus (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g006">Fig 6C</xref>

 <sub>11</sub> was expressed in each infection at approximately 20% of the total M segment-derived mRNA, and the relative level did not differ significantly with any virus (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007892.g006">Fig 6D</xref>
 </bold>). Overall, the relative levels of each of the three mRNA species were similar when synthesized from avian- or human-origin encoded M segments in DF-1 cells, correlating with Western immunoblot data on M segment protein expression in these cells.
