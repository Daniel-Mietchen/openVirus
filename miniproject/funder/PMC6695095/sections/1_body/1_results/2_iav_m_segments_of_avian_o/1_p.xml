<p>The relative fitness of PR8-based viruses carrying M segments from the human-adapted NL09 virus or from avian IAVs was evaluated in three avian substrates: embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), chicken origin DF-1 cells, and quail origin QT-6 cells. When grown from low multiplicities of infection (MOI) in either ECE or DF-1 cell substrates, all viruses exhibited similar kinetics and reached comparable titers (

 </bold>). Also, under high MOI growth conditions in DF-1 and QT-6 cells, the growth phenotypes of the PR8 NL09 M and PR8 avian M viruses were similar, although the NL09 M-containing virus trended towards increased growth relative to the avian M-containing viruses in DF-1 cells (

 </bold>. Nonetheless, at no time did the NL09 M-encoding virus grow to significantly higher titers than the avian M-encoding viruses in any avian host substrate. In contrast, in mammalian cells, human-adapted IAV M segments were found to support improved growth relative to avian-adapted M segments. Viral growth was monitored from low and high MOI in human A549 cells and canine MDCK cells (

 </bold>). In each case, PR8-based viruses carrying the NL09 M segment grew with more rapid kinetics and to higher titers than isogenic viruses carrying avian M segments, although the differences in growth from low MOI did not reach statistical significance. To extend our findings to an independent human lineage of IAV, we evaluated the growth from high MOI in A549 cells of PR8 Pan99 M and PR8 Beth15 M viruses, each of which have an M segment derived from the human seasonal H3N2 lineage (

 </bold>). We found that both of these human-adapted M segments supported significantly faster kinetics and higher magnitude of growth than the dkAlb76 89G M segment (

 </bold>). Thus, results from multiple different avian and mammalian culture systems reveal defects in the kinetics and magnitude of viral growth associated with avian IAV M segments specifically in mammalian host cells and provide evidence of the acquisition of adaptive changes in the M segment of pH1N1 and H3N2 human influenza A lineages.
