<p>To gain initial insight into the phenotypic consequences of M2 overexpression, we examined the subcellular localization of M2 in A549 cells infected with PR8 NL09 M virus or one of four PR8-based viruses with avian M segments. At 8 hours-post-infection (hpi) in PR8 NL09 M virus-infected cells, M2 showed mainly dispersed cytoplasmic staining, along with weak cytoplasmic membrane localization and some perinuclear accumulation. By contrast, in cells infected with viruses that encoded any of the four avian origin M segments, we noted more abundant M2 protein staining localized at the plasma membrane, and in large puncta near the cell nucleus (
