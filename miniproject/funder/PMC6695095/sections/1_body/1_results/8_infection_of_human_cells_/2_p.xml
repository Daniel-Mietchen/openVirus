<p>As an additional test designed to differentiate autophagy induction from autophagy block in cells infected with IAV carrying avian M segments, we used chloroquine treatment followed by Western immunoblotting for LC3B I and LC3B II. We hypothesized that, if autophagic flux is blocked in cells infected with PR8 avian M viruses, then treatment with chloroquine would not lead to a further increase in LC3B II levels. Conversely, if virus infection of these cells induces autophagy, then blocking their turnover with chloroquine would result in heightened LC3B II over mock-infected, chloroquine-treated cells. As shown in

 </bold>, we observed a significant difference in the activation of LC3B II following infection with human- or avian M-encoding viruses. This difference in LC3B II activation is lost in the presence of chloroquine. Additionally, as we observed no change in LC3B II levels upon treatment of virus-infected cells with chloroquine, relative to chloroquine-treated, mock-infected cells, we conclude that the high levels of IAV M2 protein expressed from avian M segments, but not human M segments, precipitate a block in the autophagy pathway such that chloroquine treatment cannot bring about further accumulation of autophagosomes.
