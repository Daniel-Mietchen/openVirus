<p>To test for a causal link between the observed block in autophagy and the restriction of growth seen for PR8 avian M-encoding viruses in mammalian cells, we monitored the effect on viral growth of relieving the autophagy block with amantadine treatment. Specifically, we evaluated single-cycle growth in A549 cells using PR8 NL09 M and PR8 dkAlb76 M 89G viruses. Amantadine was again added at 1 hpi to avoid disruption of the earliest steps of the viral life cycle. While amantadine had no effect on growth of the PR8 NL09 M virus (P = 0.271), a modest but consistent increase in the titer of PR8 dkAlb76 M 89G virus was noted throughout the time-course (P = 0.0007) (
