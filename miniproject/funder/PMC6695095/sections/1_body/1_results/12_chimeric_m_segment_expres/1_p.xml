<p>To evaluate whether correcting expression of the avian M2 protein to levels seen for viruses with human-adapted M segments yielded a well-adapted phenotype in a mammalian animal model, we evaluated growth and transmission of PR8 NL09 M 7mut virus in guinea pigs. Titration of nasal wash samples revealed that the PR8 NL09 M 7mut virus (which expresses avian M2 at low levels) had a similar growth phenotype to that of PR8 NL09 M virus: growth kinetics and area under the curve values were not significantly different (

 </bold>). In contrast, analysis of nasal wash samples collected from contact animals indicated that only one of eight inoculated guinea pigs transmitted the PR8 NL09 M 7mut virus to her cage mate. This level of transmission is significantly decreased relative to the PR8 NL09 M virus (P = 0.0339) (
