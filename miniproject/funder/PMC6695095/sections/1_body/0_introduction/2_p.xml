<p>Changes to viral receptor specificity and polymerase function necessary to overcome host species barriers have been well documented [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but it is clear that additional features of avian IAVs restrict their growth in mammalian systems [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Seminal studies, performed in the 1970s, indicated a potential role for the M segment. Avian IAVs were shown to express low levels of M1 protein during abortive infection of mammalian cells, but not avian cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the limited quantity of viral particles formed during such abortive infections correlated with the amount of M1 protein expressed. Significantly, these studies were conducted prior to the identification of a second gene product expressed from a spliced form of the M segment mRNA: the M2 protein [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that low M1 expression during abortive avian IAV infection in mammalian cells was accompanied by increased M2 mRNA and protein expression, relative to productive infection in avian cells, leading to new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms leading to abortive outcomes [
