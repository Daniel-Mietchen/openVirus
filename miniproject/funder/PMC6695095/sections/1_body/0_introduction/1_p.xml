<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) epidemics and pandemics result in widespread and often severe disease [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. IAV lineages endemic in humans are ultimately derived from those circulating in wild waterfowl. Sporadic transmission of IAV from avian reservoirs to humans occurs mainly through domesticated intermediate hosts such as chickens and pigs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, infection of humans with H7N9 and H5N1 subtype IAVs occurs through direct exposure to infected poultry. Although they often cause severe disease, these zoonotic cases have not led to sustained onward transmission to date and have therefore not caused a pandemic. Despite abundant circulation of IAVs at the animal-human interface, pandemics occur only rarely owing to the host specificity of IAV infection. As with all viruses, IAV must exploit host cell functions and overcome antiviral barriers to execute its life cycle. Viral replication in a new host species therefore requires adaptation to re-establish virus-host interactions broken by species-specific features of host cellular processes. IAV can undergo such adaptation through reassortment of intact gene segments between avian IAVs and those already adapted to mammals or through more incremental changes brought about by polymerase error [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007892.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. With the goal of anticipating and mitigating IAV emergence in humans, it is essential to understand the species-specific barriers to infection and the mechanisms by which IAV evolution allows these impediments to be overcome.
