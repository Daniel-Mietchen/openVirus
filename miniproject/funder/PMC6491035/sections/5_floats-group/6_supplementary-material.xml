  <title>Credible intervals of the differences between estimates of genetic variance in susceptibility across host species and viruses.</title>
  <p>The natural virus for each host is in red and bold. Genetic variances are estimated from the among-family variances in viral load. 95% CIs show differences in estimates of genetic variation for different host-virus combinations, intervals that do not cross zero represent statistically significant differences.</p>
