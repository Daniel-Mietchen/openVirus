  <title>Genetic variation in susceptibility to coevolved and non-coevolved viruses.</title>
  <p>The viral load was measured 15 days post infection by quantitative RT-PCR relative to a 
   <italic>Drosophila</italic> reference gene (
   <italic>RpL32</italic>). (
   <bold>A</bold>) The points show model prediction family means from our GLM and are centred on zero. The number of families in each panel was down-sampled so the same number of families is shown for each virus. Coevolved host-virus associations are in red. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The genetic variance in log
   <sub>2 </sub>viral load was estimated from the between family variance assuming that all genetic variance is additive. The bars are 95% credible intervals. Posterior probabilities for significantly different genetic variances are shown in grey (see

    <title>Estimates of genetic variance plotted against mean viral load for each species-virus combination.</title>
    <p>Viral load is measured by qRT-PCR relative to a housekeeping gene (
     <italic>RpL32</italic>). All viral loads were significantly different from one another (
     <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 in all cases).
