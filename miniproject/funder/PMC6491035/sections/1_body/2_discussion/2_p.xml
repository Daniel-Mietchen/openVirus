<p>As the genetic variants in the genes 
 <italic>p62 (ref(2)P)</italic> and 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic> that confer resistance to DMelSV have been identified, this has previously allowed us to use patterns of DNA sequence variation to infer how selection has acted on resistance in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. In both these genes the resistant alleles have arisen relatively recently by mutation and natural selection has pushed them rapidly up in frequency, leaving a characteristic signature of elevated linkage disequilibrium and low genetic diversity around the variant causing resistance (

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Wayne et al., 1996</xref>). There is no indication of negative frequency dependent selection, and these polymorphisms appear to have arisen from partial selective sweeps (
