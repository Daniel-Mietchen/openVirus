<p>A major source of emerging infectious disease is pathogens jumping into novel hosts where they have no co-evolutionary history (

 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Parrish et al., 2008</xref>). Our results suggest that when a pathogen infects a novel host species, there may be far less genetic variation in susceptibility among individuals than is normally the case. This may create a ‘monoculture effect’ (

 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Lively, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Ostfeld and Keesing, 2012</xref>), which could leave populations vulnerable to epidemics of pathogens that have previously circulated in other host species. Longer term, low levels of pre-standing genetic variation may slow down the rate at which the new host can evolve resistance to a new pathogen.
