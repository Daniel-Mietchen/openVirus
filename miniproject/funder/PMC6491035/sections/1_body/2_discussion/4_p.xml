<p>A key question is whether the increased genetic variation that we see in coevolved 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>â€“sigma virus interactions will hold for coevolved pathogens more generally. Theory suggests that a critical factor determining levels of genetic variation is whether resistance is costly to evolve, as this can result in the maintenance of variation by negative frequency dependent selection (

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Boots et al., 2014</xref>). In humans this has been proposed as an explanation of why there is less genetic variation in susceptibility to pathogens that are effectively controlled by the adaptive immune response, as these resistance mechanisms may be less costly (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Baker and Antonovics, 2012</xref>). However, it seems unlikely that virus resistance in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> is costly, as experiments have failed to detect costs of DCV resistance (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al., 2015</xref>) despite costs of parasitoid and bacterial resistance being repeatedly detected (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">McGonigle et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">McKean et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2009</xref>). Sigma viruses are also extreme host specialists, so evolutionary changes in resistance will tend to alter pathogen prevalence and so the strength of selection. These epidemiological feedbacks are predicted to frequently increase genetic diversity (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Best et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Boots and Haraguchi, 1999</xref>). However, in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> we see large amounts of genetic variation in susceptibility to viruses that have a broader host range than sigma viruses (DCV and Kallithea virus that infect 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and 
 <italic>D. simulans</italic> in the wild) (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Palmer et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Christian, 1987</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it seems unlikely that our conclusions will be a quirk of the sigma virus system. In an analogous study of rust resistance in wild flax plants, sympatric (putatively coevolved) populations had fewer partial resistances than allopatric populations, suggesting more major gene effects, even though overall there was somewhat less genetic variation in susceptibility to sympatric fungal pathogens (
