<p>Regardless of its causes, it may be common that susceptibility to infectious disease has a simple genetic basis. In humans, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hill (2012)</xref> advocated the view that susceptibility to infectious disease is qualitatively different from other traits and has a much simpler genetic basis (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Hill, 2012</xref>). In 
 <italic>Drosophila,</italic> resistance to DCV and parasitoid wasps both have a simple genetic basis (

 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Orr and Irving, 1997</xref>). In plants, major-effect polymorphisms in R genes are commonplace (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1997</xref>) and in a plant-fungi system genotype-by-genotype interactions explain a larger proportion of the total variance in sympatric (more coevolved) associations (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Antonovics et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, studies of bacterial resistance in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> have typically used pathogens that are unlikely to have any history of coevolution, and have found a polygenic basis to resistance (

 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In these studies the polymorphism with the largest effect was found against the only natural 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> pathogen tested (a polymorphism in 
 <italic>Diptericin</italic> detected using 
 <italic>Providencia rettgeri</italic> infection), anecdotally supporting the patterns seen here (
