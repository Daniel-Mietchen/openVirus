<p>We have found greater genetic variation in susceptibility to viruses that naturally infect 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> compared to viruses that do not, suggesting that selection by these pathogens has acted to increase the amount of genetic variation in susceptibility. This effect was largely caused by a modest number of major-effect genes that explain over half of the genetic variance in resistance.
