<p>Quantitative traits are typically controlled by a very large number of genetic variants, each of which tends to have a very small effect (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). However, susceptibility to sigma viruses has a simpler genetic basis, with seven polymorphisms explaining over half the genetic variance. This confirms our previous work in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> showing a simple genetic basis of virus resistance (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Cogni et al., 2016</xref>). As these genetic variants mostly only affect the naturally occurring pathogen of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> our results suggest that not only is selection by pathogens increasing the genetic variance but it is also altering the genetic architecture of resistance by introducing major-effect variants into the population. One explanation for this observation is that most quantitative traits are under stabilising selection, so major effect variants will tend to be deleterious and removed by selection (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Gibson, 2018</xref>). In contrast, selection by pathogens likely changes through time and populations may be far from their optimal level of resistance. If this is the case, Fisher’s geometric model predicts that major effect variants will be favoured by directional selection (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Fisher, 1930</xref>). Alternatively, the coevolution of hosts and parasites can favour discrete susceptible and resistant hosts (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Boots et al., 2014</xref>), and at the genetic level this may result in major-effect variants (although this theory does not explicitly address the underlying genetics). The simple genetics may also be driven by mutation—for many traits major-effect mutations that increase fitness may be extremely rare, but this may not be the case for virus resistance. For example a single (loss of function) mutation may prevent a virus binding to a host receptor or utilising other parts of the host cellular machinery, and so confer strong resistance.
