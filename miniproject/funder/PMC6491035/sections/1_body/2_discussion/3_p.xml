<p>The most parsimonious explanation of these observations is that there has been directional selection favouring resistance alleles (although this type of data cannot rule out negative frequency dependent selection as is predicted by models of coevolution). At equilibrium, directional selection on a trait is not expected to affect its genetic variance (relative to a population under mutation-drift balance; 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hill, 1982</xref>). However, the genetic variance will transiently increase if the variants under selection are initially at low frequency (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Barton and Turelli, 1987</xref>), as was the case for both 
 <italic>p62</italic> and 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic> (

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>). A particular feature of pathogens is that the direction of selection is likely to continually change as new pathogens appear in populations or existing pathogens evolve to overcome host defences. For example, in France and Germany in the 1980s, DMelSV evolved to largely overcome the effects of the resistant allele of 
 <italic>p62</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Fleuriet and Periquet, 1993</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Fleuriet and Sperlich, 1992</xref>). Similarly, DImmSV has swept through European populations of 
 <italic>D. immigrans</italic> in the last ~16 years and DObsSV through UK populations of 
 <italic>D. obscura</italic> in the last ~11 years (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Longdon et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Longdon et al., 2011a</xref>). If selection by pathogens continually changes and resistance evolves from new mutations, then this may cause a sustained increase in genetic variance in susceptibility to infection.
