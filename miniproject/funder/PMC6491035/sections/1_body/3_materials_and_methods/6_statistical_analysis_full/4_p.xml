<p>The model was fitted using the MCMCglmm package in R (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hadfield, 2010</xref>). The random effects (and residuals) are assumed to be multivariate normal with zero mean and covariance structure 
 <bold>V</bold> ⊗ 
 <bold>I. I</bold> is an identity matrix, and 
 <bold>V</bold> a matrix of estimated variances and covariances. For the random effects 
 <bold>V</bold> is a 3 × 3 covariance matrix describing the variances for each virus and the covariances between them. The off-diagonal elements of 
 <bold>V</bold> for the residual were set to zero because the covariances between traits at these levels are not estimable by design.
