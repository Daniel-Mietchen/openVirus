<p>Diffuse independent normal priors were placed on the fixed effects (means of zero and variances of 10

 <sub>1, 1</sub>. The exceptions were the residual variances for which an inverse-gamma prior was used with shape and scale equal to 0.001. The MCMC chain was ran for 130 million iterations with a burn-in of 30 million iterations and a thinning interval of 100,000.
