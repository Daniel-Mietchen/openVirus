<p>The number of full-sib families required for estimating genetic variance in susceptibility was determined by simulation using previous estimates of genetic variation to DMelSV in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>). After carrying out the full-sib experiment in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we then down-sampled this data to calculate the minimum number of families required to provide accurate estimates for the other species. Sample sizes for the DSPR experiment were based on previous data (
