<p>We set up a common garden experiment to measure genetic variation in susceptibility to natural and non-natural viruses across four host species. In a fractional factorial experiment each species was infected it with its own virus, as well as two viruses that do not infect that host species (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All of the viruses replicate in all hosts (with the exception of DImmSV in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that showed limited evidence of replication â€“ this combination was not used in the experiment). All fly stocks used (see additional methods for stock details) were tested for existing sigma virus infection using RT-PCR over two generations. For all species we collected flies from the wild and we used a full-sib mating design. The progeny of these crosses were infected by injecting them with 69 nl of the viruses intrathoracically and measuring viral RNA loads 15 days post infection, as in 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Longdon et al. (2011c)</xref>. This time point was selected as RNA viral load tends to plateau from around day 15 post infection and there is no mortality from infection in this period. The specifics for each host species, including sample sizes, are detailed in the additional methods.
