<p>We measured the change in RNA viral load using qRT-PCR. The viral RNA load was expressed relative to the endogenous control housekeeping gene 
 <italic>RpL32</italic> (
 <italic>Rp49</italic>). RNA was extracted from flies homogenised in Trizol and reverse transcribed with GoScript reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer primers, and then diluted 1:10 with nuclease free water. The qRT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus system using Sensifast Hi-Rox Sybr kit (Bioline) with the following PCR cycle: 95°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of: 95°C for 5 s followed by 60°C for 30 s. Two qRT-PCR reactions (technical replicates) were carried out per sample with both the viral and endogenous control primers. Each qRT-PCR plate contained three standard samples, and all experimental samples were split across plates in a blocked design. A linear model was used to correct the cycle threshold (Ct) values for differences between qRT-PCR plates. Primer sequences are in
