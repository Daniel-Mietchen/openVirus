 <italic>D. obscura</italic> were collected in the United Kingdom and France (see above). Males and females were separated, and females were placed in vials to establish isofemale lines. Full-sib families were set up using crosses between 21 isofemale lines of 
 <italic>Drosophila obscura</italic> collected in the UK. Flies were reared on banana food (recipe below) at 18°C. Crosses were between different isofemale lines (i.e. excluding reciprocal crosses) and maximising the number of lines used. Families were established from 6 day old single female and male virgin flies placed in the same vial for 7 days. These crosses were tipped onto fresh food every 7 days to generate replicate vials of each family. Eclosed males were collected 35–42 days after initial egg laying and then injected with DAffSV, DMelSV, or DObsSV 1–3 days post-collection, then maintained and frozen on day 15 post-infection as above.
