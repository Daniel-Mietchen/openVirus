<p>Injections were carried out over 25 overlapping blocks. Each block consisted of a mean of 16 families with a mean of 76 vials being injected each day for 12 days. Each replicate vial contained a mean of 8 flies (range: 1â€“15). In total we assayed 320 families over 913 biological replicates. We aimed to have a minimum of 2 replicates per virus per family (126 virus-family combinations had one replicate, 314 had 2 replicates and 49 had 3 replicates and 3 had four replicates). 94 families had replicates across two different viruses and 39 families had replicates for all three viruses. Blocks were staggered to overlap with at least 10 families being infected on any one day. The order families were injected in was randomised, and the order the different viruses were injected was blocked across days.</p>
