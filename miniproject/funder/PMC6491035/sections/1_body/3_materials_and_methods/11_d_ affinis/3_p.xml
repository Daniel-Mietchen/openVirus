<p>Injections were carried out over 27 overlapping blocks. Each block consisted of an average of 19 families and 28 replicate vials. Each replicate vial contained a mean of 11 flies (range: 3â€“23). In total we assayed 520 families over 1003 biological replicates. We aimed to have a minimum of 2 replicates per virus per family (336 virus-family combinations had one replicate, 286 had 2 replicates and 30 had three replicates). 109 families had replicates across two different viruses and 12 families had replicates for all three viruses. Blocks were staggered to overlap with a mean of 23 families being infected on any one day. The order families were injected in was randomised, and the order the different viruses were injected was blocked across days.</p>
