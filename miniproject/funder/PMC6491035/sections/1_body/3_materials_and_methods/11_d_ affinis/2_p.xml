<p>Full-sib families were set up using crosses between 40 isofemale lines of 
 <italic>Drosophila affinis</italic> (see above for collection details) collected in the U.S. Flies were reared on malt food (recipe below) at 18°C. Crosses were between different isofemale lines (i.e. excluding reciprocal crosses) and maximising the number of lines used. Families were established from 6 day old single female and male virgin flies placed in the same vial for 7 days. These crosses were tipped onto fresh food every 7 days to generate replicate vials of each family. Eclosed males were collected 35–42 days after initial egg laying and then injected with DAffSV, DImmSV or DMelSV 1–3 days post-collection, then maintained and frozen on day 15 post-infection as above.
