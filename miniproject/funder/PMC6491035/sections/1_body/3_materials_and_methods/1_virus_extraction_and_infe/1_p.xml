<p>We extracted the sigma viruses DAffSV, DImmSV, DMelSV and DObsSV from infected stocks of

 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (line: E320 Ex) and

 <italic>D.affinis</italic> which was collected in the USA). Infected fly stocks were checked for infection by exposing the flies to 100% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 12°C for 15mins then paralysed flies were collected 30mins later. The DImmSV infected line does not show CO
 <sub>2</sub> sensitivity and so was confirmed to have a high level of infection using RT-PCR. Infected flies were frozen at −80°C and later homogenised in ringers solution (2.5 μl per fly) and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, 2% v/v FBS was added then virus solutions were aliquoted and stored at −80°C.
