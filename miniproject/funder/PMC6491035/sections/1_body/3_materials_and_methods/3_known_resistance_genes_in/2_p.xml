<p>Another resistance allele has been identified in the gene 
 <italic>Ge-1</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2016</xref>). However, this allele has been found to occur at a low frequency in wild populations. We genotyped 184 parental flies from our experiment (parental flies for some families could not be collected) and found the resistant allele was not present, suggesting it is rare or absent.
