<p>We genotyped parents of each 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> full sib family from the experiment above for two resistance alleles that are known to confer protection against DMelSV; 
 <italic>p62</italic> (
 <italic>Ref(2)P)</italic> and 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic>. We genotyped parental flies using PCR assays that produce different sized products depending on whether flies carry resistant or susceptible alleles. Information on these PCRs and primer sequences can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. We then calculated the number of resistance alleles in each family by summing the number of alleles from both mothers and fathers. We produced genotype information for 230 of the 255 families.
