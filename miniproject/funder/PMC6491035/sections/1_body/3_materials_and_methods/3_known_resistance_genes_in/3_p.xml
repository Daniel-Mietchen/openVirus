<p>We further examined the effect of alleles known to affect susceptibility to DMelSV on all three viruses. Firstly, we infected 32 lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>) that were susceptible for both 
 <italic>p62</italic> and 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic> (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11 lines), were resistant for 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic> only (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13 lines), or were resistant for both genes (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8 lines) with DMelSV, DAffSV and DObsSV. No lines in the panel were resistant for 
 <italic>p62</italic> and susceptible for 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic>. We infected a mean of 18 flies per line (range = 3–22).
