<p>Injections were carried out over 25 overlapping blocks. Each block consisted of 10 families, and each day, two vials per family were injected with two different viruses. Each replicate vial contained a mean of 14 flies (range 3â€“28 flies). In total we measured 255 families over 1567 biological replicates. We aimed to carry out a minimum of 2 replicates of each virus per family, but where possible we carried out 3 or four replicates (92 virus-family combinations had one replicate, 555 had two replicates, 82 had 3 replicates and 25 had four replicates.). 248 families had replicates for all three viruses. Blocks were staggered to overlap with at least 20 families being infected on any one day. The order families were injected in was randomised, and the order the different viruses were injected was blocked across days.</p>
