<p>Virgin flies were collected daily from bottles set up at a controlled egg density. Full-sib families were set up using crosses of single male and female virgins placed in the same vial and aged for 3 days. Each of these families was tipped onto fresh food daily for 5 days to create replicate vials. After 5 days the adult flies were frozen for later genotyping. 12 days after laying, male offspring were collected from each replicate vial and split into two vials of cornmeal medium without any yeast on the surface (‘unyeasted’) and placed at 18°C.</p>
