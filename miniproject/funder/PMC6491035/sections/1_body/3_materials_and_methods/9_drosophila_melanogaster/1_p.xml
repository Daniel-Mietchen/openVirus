<p>We created an outcrossed population by combining 150 isofemale lines of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (collected in Accra, Ghana (5.593,–0.188) in 2014) in a population cage. The population was maintained throughout the experiment with a large population size (~1500–2000 flies), with eggs collected from the population cage used to set up each subsequent generation. All rearing was carried out on cornmeal medium (recipe below) sprinkled with live yeast (‘yeasted’) at 25°C.
