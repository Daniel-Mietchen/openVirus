<p>To estimate the proportion of the genetic variance that is explained by the QTL we identified, we repeated this analysis but included the 7 QTL we identified as fixed effects in the model. Each QTL was included by estimating the probability that each line carried the resistant allele of the QTL and adding this as a fixed effect to the model. The between-RIL variance then allowed us to estimate the genetic variance in viral load after removing the effects of the QTL.</p>
