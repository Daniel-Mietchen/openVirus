<p>Based on genotyping data, the probability that each Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) in the DSPR panel was derived from each of the eight founder lines has been estimated at 10 kB intervals across the genome (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2012</xref>). To identify QTL affecting viral load we first calculated the mean viral load (Î”Ct) across the biological replicates of each RIL. We then regressed the mean viral load against the eight genotype probabilities and calculated logarithm of odds (LOD) scores using the DSPRqtl package in R (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2012</xref>). These LOD scores were calculated separately for DSPR Panel A and Panel B, and then summed at each genomic location. To obtain a significance threshold, we permuted our mean viral load estimates across the RILs within each panel, repeated the analysis above and recorded the highest LOD score across the entire genome. This process was repeated 1000 times to obtain a null distribution of the maximum LOD score.
