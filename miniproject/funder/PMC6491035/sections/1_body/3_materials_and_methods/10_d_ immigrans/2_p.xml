<p>Injections were carried out over 18 overlapping blocks. Each block consisted of an average of 19 families and 46 replicate vials. Each replicate vial contained a mean of 14 flies (range: 4â€“26). In total we assayed 341 families over 812 biological replicates. We aimed to have a minimum of 2 replicates per virus per family (235 virus-family combinations had one replicate, 270 had two replicates, 11 had 3 replicates and 1 had four replicates). 140 families had replicates across two different viruses and 18 families had replicates for all three viruses. Blocks were staggered to overlap with a mean of 39 families being infected on any one day. The order families were injected in was randomised, and the order the different viruses were injected was blocked across days.</p>
