<p>92 
 <italic>D. immigrans</italic> lines were collected from Madingley, Cambridge, UK (52.225, 0.043) in 2012 and 2015. Full-sib families were set up using crosses between the 92 isofemale lines of 
 <italic>Drosophila immigrans</italic>. Flies were reared on malt food (recipe below) at 18°C. Crosses were between different isofemale lines (i.e. excluding reciprocal crosses) and maximising the number of lines used. Families were established from 2 to 4 day old single female and male virgin flies placed in the same vial for 7 days. These crosses were tipped onto fresh food every 7 days to generate replicate vials of each family. Eclosed males were collected 27–34 days after initial egg laying and injected with DImmSV, DMelSV or DObsSV 1–3 days post-collection, then maintained and frozen on day 15 post-infection as above.
