<p>Injections were carried out over 13 weeks. Each day of injection a mean of 47 unique lines (range 20–60) and 51 replicate vials were injected with 1–3 different viruses. In total we assayed 377 DSPR lines (108 lines had two biological replicates). Each replicate vial contained a mean of 12 flies (range 1–22). In total, 15,916 flies were injected across both panels of DSPR lines. We injected 319 lines with all three viruses, 38 with 2 viruses and 20 with one virus. The order of injection of lines and of viruses, was randomised across injection days. Independent biological replicates were injected on different days. Panel A and Panel B lines were assayed in two overlapping blocks.</p>
