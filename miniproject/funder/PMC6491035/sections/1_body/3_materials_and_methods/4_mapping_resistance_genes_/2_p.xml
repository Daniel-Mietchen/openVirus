<p>Three females and three males from each DSPR line were placed into yeasted cornmeal vials and allowed to lay for 3–4 days, at 25°C. Male offspring were collected at 0–4 days post-eclosion, and placed at 18°C for 4–6 days. Flies were then injected with DMelSV, DAffSV or DObsSV as described above. Injected males were maintained on unyeasted cornmeal at 18°C, and frozen on day 15 post-infection as above.</p>
