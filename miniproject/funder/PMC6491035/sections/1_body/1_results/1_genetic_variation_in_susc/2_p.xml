<p>Within populations of all four species, we found significantly greater genetic variance in susceptibility to the sigma virus that naturally infects that species compared to viruses from other species (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). These different variances reflect considerable differences in the mean viral load between families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, when families of

 <sup>nd</sup> and 98
 <sup>th</sup> percentile were compared, there was a 1294 fold difference between the viral loads of the coevolved virus in the families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, for the non-coevolved viruses there was a 27 fold difference in DMelSV loads and a 19 fold difference in DAffSV loads (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for statistics). The data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is zero-centred to allow comparison of the variances, but across the four species, there was no consistent difference between the mean viral load in coevolved versus non-coevolved associations (i.e. the coevolved virus does not always replicate to higher levels suggesting this is not an artefact of simply replicating poorly in a host – see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, there was no correlation between the genetic variance in viral load and the mean viral load (
