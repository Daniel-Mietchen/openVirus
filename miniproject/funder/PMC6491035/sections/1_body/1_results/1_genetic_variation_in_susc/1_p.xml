<p>To test whether selection by viruses has increased genetic variation in susceptibility to infection, we compared endemic host-virus associations with novel associations that have no history of coevolution. We used four different species of 
 <italic>Drosophila,</italic> each of which is naturally host to a different sigma virus (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Longdon et al., 2011a</xref>). We collected four species from the wild and created genetically diverse populations in the laboratory. Using flies from these populations we crossed single males to single females to create full-sib families. The progeny of these crosses were then injected with either the virus isolated from that species, or a virus isolated from one of the other species (

Fifteen days post infection we extracted RNA from the flies and measured viral load by quantitative RT-PCR. The differences between the viral load of different families allowed us to estimate the genetic variance (

In total we infected 52,592 flies and measured the viral load in 4295 biological replicates (a vial containing a mean of 12 flies) across 1436 full-sib families (details of sample sizes in Additional Methods).
