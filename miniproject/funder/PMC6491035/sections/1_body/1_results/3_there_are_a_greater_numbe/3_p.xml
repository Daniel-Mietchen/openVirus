<p>To examine the genetic basis of virus resistance, we looked for associations between genotype and viral load across the genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the coevolved association (DMelSV) we identified seven QTL associated with resistance, compared to one that affects DObsSV and none affecting DAffSV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; this excludes one DMelSV QTL on the X chromosome that did not remain significant after accounting for the other QTL). The QTL affecting DObsSV also has a significant effect on DMelSV. One of the QTL corresponded to 
 <italic>p62</italic> (2L 53 cM). The susceptible allele of
