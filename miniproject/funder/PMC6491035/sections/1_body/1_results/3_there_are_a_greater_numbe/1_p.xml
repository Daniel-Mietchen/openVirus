<p>To investigate how coevolution shapes the genetics of resistance, we mapped loci controlling resistance using a 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> advanced intercross population (the DSPR panel [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">King et al., 2012</xref>]). This population samples genetic variation in a small number of genotypes from around the world (the experiments above sampled many genotypes from a single location). It was founded by allowing two sets of 8 inbred founder lines to interbreed for 50 generations, then creating recombinant inbred lines (RILs) whose genomes are a fine-scale mosaic of the original founder genomes. We used 377 RILs from these populations, which have up to 15 alleles of each gene (one founder line is shared between the two populations). We infected 15,916 flies across 1362 biological replicates (a vial containing a mean of 12 flies) with DMelSV, DAffSV or DObsSV and measured viral load as above (see Materials and methods).
