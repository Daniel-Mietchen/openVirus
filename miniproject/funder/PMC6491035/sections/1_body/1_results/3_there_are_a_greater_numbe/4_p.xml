<p>To examine the effect that the QTL have on viral load, we first split the founder alleles into a resistant class and a susceptible class (see Materials and methods) and then estimated the difference in viral load between the functionally distinct alleles. Six of the seven QTL resulted in greater reductions in the load of the coevolved virus (DMelSV) than the viruses isolated from other species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). There were only two cases where there was substantial cross-resistance to multiple viruses—3R 49 cM confers strong resistance to DMelSV and weak resistance to DObsSV, while 3L 46 cM confers weak resistance to DMelSV and strong resistance to DObsSV.
