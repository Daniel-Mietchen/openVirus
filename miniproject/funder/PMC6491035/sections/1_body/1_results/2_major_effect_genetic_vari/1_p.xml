<p>To examine whether the genetic basis of resistance to coevolved and non-coevolved viruses was different we estimated the genetic correlations (
 <italic>r
  <sub>g</sub>
 </italic>) in their viral loads. These represent the proportion of genetic variance in viral load between pairs of viruses that shares the same genetic causes. In 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> these were 0.40 for DMelSV-DAffSV, (95% CIs: 0.20, 0.61) and 0.25 for DMelSV-DObsSV (95% CIs: âˆ’0.01,0.47). Similar results were obtained using the 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mapping population described below (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In the other species our estimates sometimes had wide credible intervals, but the genetic correlations between coevolved and non-coevolved viruses were mostly below 0.5 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; note correlations are frequently low between pairs of non-endemic viruses too). Therefore if natural selection increases genetic variation in susceptibility to a natural pathogen, there is expected to be a smaller effect on non-coevolved viruses.
