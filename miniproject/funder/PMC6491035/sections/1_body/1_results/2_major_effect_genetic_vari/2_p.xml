<p>In 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> a substantial proportion of the genetic variance in susceptibility to DMelSV is explained by major-effect variants in the genes 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic> and 
 <italic>p62</italic> (also known as 
 <italic>Ref(2)P</italic>) (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bangham et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Wayne et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Contamine et al., 1989</xref>). The resistant allele in each of these genes has arisen recently by mutation and been driven up in frequency by natural selection, presumably due to the presence of DMelSV in natural populations (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bangham et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, if these genetic variants confer resistance to DMelSV but not the other sigma viruses, then this may explain the differences in genetic variance that we observed.
