<p>To examine whether 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic> or 
 <italic>p62</italic> contributed to the differences in genetic variance we observed in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we genotyped the parents of the full sib families for variants that confer resistance (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Assuming the effects of the resistant alleles are additive, we estimated that the load of the coevolved virus DMelSV was more than halved in homozygous 
 <italic>CHKov1</italic> resistant flies compared to susceptible flies (reduction in log
 <sub>2 </sub>viral load = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.6, 1.8). In contrast we found no significant effect of this gene on loads of the non-coevolved viruses (DAffSV = −0.2, 95% CI = 0.2,–0.8; DObsSV = −0.4, 95% CI = −0.04, 1.0). The resistant allele of 
 <italic>p62</italic> was present at such a low frequency (1.5%) in the population that we lacked statistical power to investigate its effects.
