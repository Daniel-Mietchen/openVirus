<p>Sigma viruses offer a novel way to test how coevolution with a pathogen alters the amount of genetic variation in host susceptibility. As sigma viruses are vertically transmitted, we can be certain of which hosts and viruses are naturally coevolving and which are not. In this study we have used four species of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> (
 <italic>D. affinis, D. immigrans, D. melanogaster</italic> and 
 <italic>D. obscura</italic>) that shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million years ago (

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et al., 2004</xref>), and their natural sigma viruses (DAffSV, DImmSV, DMelSV and DObsSV, which have amino acid identities ofÂ &lt;55% in the most conserved gene) (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Longdon et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Longdon et al., 2011b</xref>). Despite their vertical mode of transmission, the phylogenies of the viruses and their hosts are incongruent, suggesting they have jumped between host species during their evolution (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Longdon et al., 2011b</xref>). To test whether selection by viruses increases the amount of genetic variation in host susceptibility we have compared the viral load of endemic viruses that naturally infect each of the four host species to non-endemic viruses. We then examined how selection by these viruses has altered the genetic architecture of resistance by mapping loci that confer resistance to endemic and non-endemic viruses in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.
