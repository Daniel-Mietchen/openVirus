<p>As part of a whole genome association study, we have previously estimated levels of genetic variation in the susceptibility of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to four different viruses (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>). We found that there was more genetic variation in susceptibility to the two viruses that were isolated from 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> than the two viruses from other insect species. Furthermore, in each of these naturally coevolved host-pathogen associations we detected a single major-effect polymorphism affecting resistance. This led us to propose that coevolution had increased genetic variation in susceptibility due to the presence of major-effect resistance polymorphisms. However, this conclusion remains anecdotal. First, aside from two sigma viruses, the viruses we used were mostly very distantly related, so their biology may differ for many reasons. Second, our association study had low statistical power, so conclusions about the genetics were based on just two genes. Finally, and most importantly, the link between coevolutionary history and genetic variation is based on a single host and four viruses, and so could arise by chance. For this reason, here we return to this question and formally test whether a history of coevolution alters the amount and nature of genetic variation.
