<p>As pathogens are harmful, natural selection is expected to favour resistant host genotypes. Directional selection on standing genetic variation will drive alleles to fixation, removing variants from the population (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Blows and Hoffmann, 2005</xref>). However, as directional selection also increases the frequency of new mutations that change the trait in the direction of selection, at equilibrium it is expected to have no effect on levels of standing genetic variation (relative to mutation-drift balance; 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Hill, 1982</xref>). However, selection mediated by pathogens may be different. Coevolution with pathogens can result in the maintenance of both resistant and susceptible alleles by negative frequency dependent selection (

Similarly, when infection prevalence exhibits geographical or temporal variation, selection can maintain genetic variation, especially if pleiotropic costs to resistance provide an advantage to susceptible individuals when infection is rare (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Koskella, 2018</xref>). Even when there is simple directional selection on alleles that increase resistance, the direction of selection by pathogens may frequently change so populations may not be at equilibrium. If selection favours rare alleles – such as new mutations – directional selection can transiently increase genetic variation during their spread through the population (
