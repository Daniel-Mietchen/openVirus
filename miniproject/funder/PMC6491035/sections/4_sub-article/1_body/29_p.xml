<p>The sigma virus system is unusual for an animal pathogen in that we have a strong literature on its genetics and how selection has acted. We have therefore tried to keep our discussion strongly rooted in this. In particular there is a recurrent pattern if selective sweeps, and we have highlighted population genetics theory about how this can affect genetic variation (note that the adaptive dynamics models of Boots are not appropriate to model these processes). Alongside this we have now considerably increased our discussion of the coevolution literature, including the Boots models. The changes are in the two paragraphs quoted at the start of our response to Reviewer 1.</p>
