 <p>As you will note, reviewer's comments were generally positive about your manuscript. Nevertheless, in the course of the discussion between reviewers, two issues arise that justify the decision:</p>
 <p>1) The present paper was judged too similar to a previous study of the authors (see reviewer 2). It was felt that the authors have already shown this result with melanogaster and that the present study is expanding on that previous observation using more host species. Thus the novelty was questioned.</p>
 <p>2) The generality of the result might be overstated. Reviewers felt that the authors over-claim the implication for general host-parasite evolution, and that the pattern they described might only apply to infections for which resistance has a simple genetic architecture and the pathogen is rapidly evolving, although that may capture most specialist viruses.</p>
