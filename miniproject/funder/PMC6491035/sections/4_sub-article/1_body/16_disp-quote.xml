 <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
 <p>The major result of this study is that organisms harbor more genetic variation to deal with their native pathogens than with foreign ones. This is interesting and important because it tells us about the nature of genetic variation for pathogen resistance. It is also informative with respect to predicting how hosts might respond when infected with novel pathogens. The paper is very nicely written, interesting and easy to follow, and the authors have done a very thorough job and used a number of interesting approaches. They start by infecting four species of Drosophila with native and foreign Sigma viruses. All four show the same pattern – significantly more genetic variation in the titer of native virus. The rest of the paper focuses on 
  <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The authors show that variation in two genes previously shown to confer resistance to native Sigma virus don't have a major effect on foreign Sigma viruses. They also perform an additional QTL analysis of resistance, identifying 7 QTL (only one of these had been previously shown to be imprortant in virus resistance, so these new QTLs will be interesting to follow up on). Most of the QTLs did not affect titers of the foreign viruses.

 <p>My main concern is that I am not sure that this study is so different from previous work. The authors performed a similar study, with a similar conclusion, published in PLoS Genetics (Magwire et al., 2012). In that study they assessed genetic variation in 
  <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> resistance to 2 native and 2 foreign viruses (including two viruses used here – DMelSV and DAffSV). It would be useful for the authors to discuss this paper and how it compares with the present one more explicitly. The authors have also done extensive work identifying genetic variants that contribute to resistance to Sigma virus (and other viruses) in 
  <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.
