<p>We could detect viral RNA in all samples, and our previous data (Longdon et al 2011 PLOS Pathogens) suggest the virus must be replicating at some level to persist in the host for 15 days. Note Magwire et al. measured a symptom of sigma virus infection (CO2 sensitivity) that represents whether the infection is over a threshold viral load. The far greater dynamic range of the quantitative PCR assay we used is a considerable improvement over Magwire et al.â€™s approach.</p>
