 <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
 <p>[â€¦] I have one major point of interpretation that may be worth adding to the paper. The authors imply that the results from this study will be generally applicable (e.g., last paragraph of the Introduction), but I suspect they will be most applicable to systems where genetic architecture of resistance is similar to what is seen in this system: variation in resistance explained by few genes of large effect. I am less confident that systems where variation in resistance is determined by a large set of genes with individually small effects will fit the evolutionary model presented here. The authors interchangeably using the words pathogen and parasite to describe the infection, but viruses are a specialized class. This may collapse to being a model for rapidly evolving specialists with less application to generalists or more slowly evolving pathogens and parasites. The authors themselves emphasize the nearly Mendelian architecture of resistance (paragraph one) and the specialist nature of the coevolutionary interaction (paragraph four) in Discussion and at multiple places in Results. In the final paragraph of the Discussion, they conclude that selection by viruses increases genetic diversity and causes a simple genetic architecture of resistance, but I suspect the causality is the other way around: a simple architecture of resistance and rapid evolution of the pathogen facilitates the evolved increase in diversity.</p>
