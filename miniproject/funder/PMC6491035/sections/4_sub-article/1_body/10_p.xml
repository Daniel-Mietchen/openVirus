<p>“A key question is whether the increased genetic variation that we see in coevolved 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>–sigma virus interactions will hold for coevolved pathogens more generally. […] Nonetheless, in an analogous study of wild flax plants, there was less genetic variation in susceptibility to sympatric (coevolved) fungal pathogens [Antonovics et al., 2011].”
