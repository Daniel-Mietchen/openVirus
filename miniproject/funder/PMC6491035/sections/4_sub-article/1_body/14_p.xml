<p>Testing whether resistance to the non-coevolved viruses tends to be ‘non-specific’ is good suggestion which our experimental design and analysis was designed to address. Unfortunately, it was frequently not possible to inject the same family with multiple viruses, so the correlations mostly have broad confidence intervals (Supplementary file 3). Especially now the DSPR results are added; this means we cannot reach any robust conclusion as to whether genes that confer resistance to the non-coevolved viruses tend to be less specific in their action. For this reason we restricted our results to highlighting the one very clear result – different genes control resistance to different viruses. We now draw the reader’s attention to the non-coevolved pairs:</p>
