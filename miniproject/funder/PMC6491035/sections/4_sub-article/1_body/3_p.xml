<p>The first reason for the manuscript being rejected was that the conclusions are similar to one of our earlier papers (Magwire et al., 2012). This was the inspiration for this study, but here we have rigorously tested what were anecdotal conclusions in that study. The number of host-virus associations in the Magwire paper was simply too few to draw robust associations between coevolution and levels of genetic variation. We now have a paragraph in the Introduction discussing the results of Magwire, 2012 and explaining how our new data advances on this. We argue that the Magwire paper dataset generated the hypothesis we are testing, and the ability to build on previous work underpins rigorous and reproducible science.</p>
