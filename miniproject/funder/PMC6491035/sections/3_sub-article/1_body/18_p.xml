<p>My only (somewhat apologetic) gripe is that one of our papers which showed essentially the same results (selection for genes of large effect, increased variance, and increased pathogen infectivity) based on a reanalysis of a large cross-inoculation experiment in the Linum-Melampsora system, is not cited (Antonovics et al., 2011). However, what we bemoaned in that paper (lack of knowledge of the genes involved) is very much made up for in this paper.</p>
