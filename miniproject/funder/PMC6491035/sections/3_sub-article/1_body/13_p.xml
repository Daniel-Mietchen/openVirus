<p>The major result of this study is that organisms harbor more genetic variation to deal with their native pathogens than with foreign ones. This is interesting and important because it tells us about the nature of genetic variation for pathogen resistance. It is also informative with respect to predicting how hosts might respond when infected with novel pathogens. The paper is very nicely written, interesting and easy to follow, and the authors have done a very thorough job and used a number of interesting approaches. They start by infecting four species of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> with native and foreign Sigma viruses. All four show the same pattern â€“ significantly more genetic variation in the titer of native virus. The rest of the paper focuses on 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The authors show that variation in two genes previously shown to confer resistance to native Sigma virus don't have a major effect on foreign Sigma viruses. They also perform an additional QTL analysis of resistance, identifying 7 QTL (only one of these had been previously shown to be imprortant in virus resistance, so these new QTLs will be interesting to follow up on). Most of the QTLs did not affect titers of the foreign viruses.
