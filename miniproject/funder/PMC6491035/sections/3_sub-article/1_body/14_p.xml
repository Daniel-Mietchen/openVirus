<p>My main concern is that I am not sure that this study is so different from previous work. The authors performed a similar study, with a similar conclusion, published in PLoS Genetics (Magwire et al., 2012). In that study they assessed genetic variation in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> resistance to 2 native and 2 foreign viruses (including two viruses used here â€“ DMelSV and DAffSV). It would be useful for the authors to discuss this paper and how it compares with the present one more explicitly. The authors have also done extensive work identifying genetic variants that contribute to resistance to Sigma virus (and other viruses) in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.
