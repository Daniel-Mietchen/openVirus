<p>Upon reading Figure 2, I wondered if there are some host families that are universally susceptible and others that are universally resistant to the non-coevolved viruses. This would be evident in the correlation among families in viral load of the two non-coevolved viruses for each species. Those correlations are given in Supplementary file 3 but they are never discussed in the main text. I would add a few sentences describing these correlations and their implication, perhaps in subsection “Major-effect genetic variants that are known to provide resistance to DMelSV do not protect against other viruses” where the correlation in resistance between coevolved and non-coevolved viruses is presented. This could also be evaluated by looking at the correlation in resistance to DAffSV and DObsSV across the DSPR, which is not presented. In Supplementary file 3, the correlation in resistance to non-coevolved viruses is stronger in 
 <italic>D. immigrans</italic> and 
 <italic>D. subobscura</italic> and is also fairly strong in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. This would appear to support variation for generalized resistance in the absence of specific coevolution.
