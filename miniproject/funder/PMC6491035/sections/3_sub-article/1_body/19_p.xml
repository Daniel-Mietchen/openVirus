<p>I also think it would be useful to have clear discussion of the previous theoretical work by the Boots group showing that there are conditions under which co-evolution would indeed result in increased variance in resistance, yet that there are equally other conditions under which the opposite result of reduced variance is expected. An application of this theory to levels of genetic variation in susceptibility to different human diseases is in Baker and Antonovics, 2012. Basically, it would be nice to strengthen the Discussion, paragraph two, and get a better sense of whether the authors think that the inference that changing selection pressures, paragraph four, result in increased variance is sound and parsimonious â€“ or if it is just guessing.</p>
