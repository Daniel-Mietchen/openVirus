<p>Duxbury, Day and colleagues present a clever test of whether specialist coevolution between a virus and its host increases the genetic variance for resistance in the host population. The paper is conceptually and methodologically sound. It is interesting and well written and could be published without modification. I offer only a few suggestions for improvement, and these are largely discretionary.</p>
