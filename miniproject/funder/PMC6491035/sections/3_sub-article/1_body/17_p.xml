<p>This is a very nice paper showing that pathogens select for not just resistance per se but specifically that they can select for increased genetic variation in resistance in host populations. Moreover, they can select for genes/gene-action of major effect. The analysis is carried out using large cross inoculations studies, inoculations on lineages with known resistance genes in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and by a QTL study of a composite inbred populationâ€¦and the results are congruent among all approaches.
