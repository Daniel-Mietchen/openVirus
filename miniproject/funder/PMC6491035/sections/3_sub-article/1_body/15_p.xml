<p>It would also be useful for the authors to include some more information and details about Sigma virus. How does Sigma virus affect host fitness (the authors don't say much about this except that there was no mortality after 15 days)? It is also a bit hard to tell how successful novel infections are. What percent of individuals/families are not infected at all? (It looks like the infection rate of DAffSV in 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is quite low in the Magwire et al. paper.) What is known about genetic variation in tolerance to Sigma viruses?
