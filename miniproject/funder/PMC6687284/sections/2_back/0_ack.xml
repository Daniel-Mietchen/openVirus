 <p>We particularly want to acknowledge the patients in this study for their participation and the HIV BioBank integrated in the Spanish AIDS Research Network and collaborating centers for the generous donation of clinical samples used in this work. This study would not have been possible without the collaboration of all the patients, medical and nursery staff and data managers who have taken part in the project. The authors would like to thank the Laboratory of Molecular Biology staff from Hospital Gregorio Marañón (Madrid, Spain), for providing patient’s specimens, and the Blood Transfusion Centre of the Community of Madrid (Spain), for providing HLA typed healthy bone marrow donor samples.</p>
