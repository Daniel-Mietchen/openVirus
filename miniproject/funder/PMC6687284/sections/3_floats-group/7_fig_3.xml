  <title>Individuals with a minimum of one protective or one risk factor for maintaining LTNP status: Frequency comparison between HD and LTNP.</title>
  <p>From top to bottom, the percentage of healthy controls and LTNP patients is indicated that have at least one protective HLA allele, at least one protective HLA allele or SNP factor, or at least one HLA risk allele, as listed in 
   <xref rid="pone.0220459.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. ****, p&lt; 0.0001. OR (95% confidence interval): 0.19 (0.12–0.30); 0.17 (0.09–0.31); 3.8 (2.4–6.1), respectively, from top to bottom. Stratification into LTNP subcategories did not provide additional information, as they were very homogeneous; p value was also &lt;0.0001 for all comparisons between HD and each subcategory.
