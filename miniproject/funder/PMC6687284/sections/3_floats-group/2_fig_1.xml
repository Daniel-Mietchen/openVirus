  <title>Genotype frequencies among subpopulations of LTNP as a function of viral load.</title>
  <p>The frequencies of the indicated SNP or 
   <italic>CCR5</italic>-Δ32 genotypes (B) or HLA genotypes (C) relative to the total number of individuals are plotted for the LTNP subcategories that are graphically depicted (A): ExLTNP, patients who were LTNP for 10 years but thereafter failed to fulfill any of the inclusion criteria; LTNP-N, viremic non controller LTNP, VL&gt;50–10,000; LTNP-C, controllers, VL&lt;2,000 copies/mL; EC, elite controllers, undetectable VL. Displayed are relevant SNP and HLA genotypes with a frequency in the LTNP subcategories above 15%, indicating those that are more frequent (filled symbols) or less frequent (open symbols) in the overall LTNP population than in HD, according to
