<p>The host genetic determinants influencing progression of HIV infection to disease and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been extensively studied in several cohorts of LTNP individuals of Caucasian ancestry. This is the case of several allelic variants in genes encoding the HIV-1 co-receptors and their ligands, such as CCR2 and CCR5, certain cytokines such as IL10, co-factors and interferon-induced proteins [

 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among these host factors, the human major histocompatibility HLA class I complex has the strongest influence on HIV-1 progression. Thus, the HLA-B*57 and HLA-B*27 alleles are strongly associated with delayed HIV disease progression [

 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] whereas HLA-B*35 is associated with accelerated progression to AIDS [

 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, control of viremia and protection from AIDS is associated with HLA bw4 allelic grouping homozygosity [
