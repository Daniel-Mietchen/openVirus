<p>These data suggest that disease progression and HIV-1 replication is controlled by several loci of the human genome. However, known genes affecting disease progression and their variants do not fully explain the highly variable course of HIV-1 infection or its pathogenic mechanisms. The aim of the present study is to characterize genetically the large Spanish HIV LTNP cohort and to identify novel associations with disease control, employing a multicenter cohort of 398 Spanish HIV-1 positive patients compared with a control population of 448 healthy Spaniards. By comparing the genotype distribution of several SNPs as well as the frequency of HLA-A and HLA-B alleles, the present work proposes 5 novel HLA class I alleles related to maintenance of the LTNP status [defined as HIV-infected patients that maintain CD4-lymphocytic counts above 500 cells/uL for at least ten years in the absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Viral load is usually low in this group of patients (&lt;10.000 RNA copies/ml, as defined in the Spanish LTNP-Cohort)]and confirms the role of known genetic markers associated with control of HIV-1 replication. The analysis of these genetic traits stratified by different phenotypes within LTNP patients, showed a differential effect according to the LTNP subcategory, evidencing the necessity to clearly define the LTNP condition in case/control association studies. In addition to supporting the category of EC with undetectable viral load (VL), we propose the use of a regularly maintained VL below the limit of 2,000 copies/mL as a new marker of profound and stable LTNP status.</p>
