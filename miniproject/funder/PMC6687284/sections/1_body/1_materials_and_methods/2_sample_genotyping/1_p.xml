<p>Genomic DNA was used for genotyping. Most SNP tested were typed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay following manufacturer’s procedures and standardized protocols (Applied Biosystems), except for rs333 (
 <italic>CCR5</italic>-Δ32) and rs1801157 (SDF-1), which were determined by real time PCR employing the primers and probes described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220459.s001">S1 Table</xref>. The TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and standard thermocycling conditions were employed for all polymorphisms on an ABI PRISM 7000 system, and allele calling was performed using AutoCaller SDS Software v 1.2.3. (Applied Biosystems).
