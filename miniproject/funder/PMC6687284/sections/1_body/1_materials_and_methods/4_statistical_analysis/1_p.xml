<p>Genotype frequency comparisons between groups were performed by two-tailed Fisher's exact test in R package for each SNP (p-values of 2x3 tables). The frequency of HLA alleles was also analyzed by two-tailed Fisher's exact test in R package (p-values of 2x2 tables). The results were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing to control the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) at a significant threshold of 0.1 to compare LTNP with different control populations (q-value). A similar correction was made to compare different subcategories of LTNP individuals with control populations, using a significant threshold of 0.05 (q-value).</p>
