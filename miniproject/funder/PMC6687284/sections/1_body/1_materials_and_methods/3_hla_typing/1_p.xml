<p>Two-digit HLA-A and HLA-B typing was carried out using sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) hybridization following manufacturerâ€™s procedure and standardized protocol (RELI SSO HLA Typing Kit, Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was amplified using locus-specific primers flanking exons 2 and 3 of the HLA class I genes. The PCR products were hybridized to an array of immobilized sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. The probe-bound amplified product was detected by a color formation assay. All assays were automated using the AutoRELI 48 Instrument (Dynal Biotech). The HLA-B alleles were grouped into HLA bw4 and HLA bw6 epitopes according to the official page of HLA nomenclature [
