<p>Based on specific clinical data, including VL and time after seroconversion, we defined several LTNP subcategories. Thus, three mutually exclusive subcategories of LTNP have been analyzed, including ExLTNP, who are patients that lost LTNP status after at least 10 years after HIV-1 diagnosis; viremic non-controller LTNP (LTNP-N), who are LTNP maintaining detectable VL &gt; 50 up to 10,000 copies/mL throughout the follow-up; and EC, defined as HIV-1 infected individuals with undetectable VL during follow-up. In addition, LTNP-C controllers includes a subgroup of LTNP-N maintaining VL &lt;2,000 copies/mL throughout the follow-up; this subcategory includes all EC but also those LTNP-N with low VL. Blood samples were processed following standard procedures [
