<p>LTNP and HD were typed for HLA class I. Most HLA alleles were not significantly different between the LTNP and the control group. From those with significant differences, several alleles seemed to favor the LTNP condition, as their allelic frequencies were significantly higher in LTNP than in HD (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220459.g002">Fig 2</xref>); these included HLA-B57, followed by HLA-B27, -B52, -A03 and -B39. In contrast, HLA-B18 was markedly less frequent in the LTNP population, as well as HLA-A24, -B08 and -A29, and thus appeared to be detrimental for LTNP status. Stratification of the LTNP into subcategories was undertaken for most relevant alleles. Given the high number of alleles for these two HLA loci, a very low number of patients was left in most subcategories and precluded statistical analysis. Still, the strongest favorable factor HLA-B57, together with -B52, -B27 and -A03, as well as the strongest unfavorable factor HLA-B18, together with -A24 and -B08, were significantly enriched in LTNP subcategories (
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, when the frequency of the HLA allele in the LTNP subcategories was above 10% and amenable to analysis, it showed again an inverse correlation of HLA-B57 and HLA-A03 protective alleles with VL (
