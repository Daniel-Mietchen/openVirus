<p>When the HLA-B alleles were classified according to their mutually exclusive bw4 or bw6 public epitopes [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], a highly significantly greater percentage of bw4 in homozygosity was observed in the LTNP compared with HD (
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), confirming these alleles as protective factors for the LTNP status. The converse association of bw6/bw6 homozygosity with risk for the LTNP condition was also as strong, and both extended to most LTNP subcategories (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). As before, favorable bw4/bw4 showed a mild inverse correlation with VL while unfavorable bw6/bw6 genotype showed a mild direct correlation with VL within Spanish LTNP subcategories (
