<p>As described in Methods section LTNP were stratified according to VL into 4 subcategories, ExLTNP, viremic non controllers LTNP-N, controllers LTNP-C and elite controllers EC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220459.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and the genotype frequencies of the relevant genetic factors were determined (i.e. 
 <italic>HCP5</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> and 5â€™
 <italic>HLA-C</italic> SNPs). The results confirmed the protective nature of the 
 <italic>HCP5</italic> and 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> genotypes, as they were more frequent in most subcategories of LTNP, especially in those subcategories with the lowest VL, the LTNP-C and the EC, than in the other HIV-infected or HD populations (

 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Actually, 
 <italic>HCP5</italic> and 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> SNP frequencies were gradually increased within LTNP subcategories in an inverse correlation with VL (framed data in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), with percentages of 
 <italic>HCP5</italic> and 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> favorable genotypes peaking at the EC population with undetectable VL (
