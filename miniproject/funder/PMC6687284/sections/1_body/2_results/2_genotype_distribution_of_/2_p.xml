<p>The enrichment of the 
 <italic>HCP5</italic> and 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> favorable genotypes in EC-LTNP with undetectable VL was somehow expected. However, it is very noticeable that the LTNP-C controllers, whose VL are always maintained below 2,000 copies/mL, are also very significantly endowed with these protective genotypes (p-values in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This suggests that viral replication limited to this threshold value for many years may also be a marker of a profound and stable LTNP status.
