<p>However, a significant difference in the genotype distribution was identified in 3 SNP (
 <italic>HCP5</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> and 5’
 <italic>HLA-C</italic>) (
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the case of 
 <italic>HCP5</italic>, a clearly higher frequency of the genotype TG was found in LTNP compared with HD and TP groups, and less significant with AIDS patients (
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The differences in the GA/AA genotype distribution of the SNP causing the V64I mutation in 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> (HIV-1 co-receptor that is associated with protection [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) were highly significant when comparing LTNP with HD. Regarding the Δ32 deletion of the 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> HIV-1 co-receptor locus that is associated with delayed HIV disease progression [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a higher frequency of the protective WT/Δ32 genotype was observed in LTNP than in the AIDS group, but these differences did not reach statistical significance after FDR correction. The variant -35C/T located 35 kb upstream of the 
 <italic>HLA-C</italic> locus has been associated with delayed HIV disease progression in infected patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Accordingly, a significantly higher frequency of the CC and CT genotypes was found in Spanish LTNP compared with TP (
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, our data confirm the association of 
 <italic>HCP5</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> and 5’
 <italic>HLA-C</italic> SNPs to LTNP phenotype.
