<p>The 9 genotypes and alleles that are associated with LTNP status as well as those 5 unfavorable ones are listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and roughly ranked according to the intensity of the effect and the statistical significance. Interestingly, when analyzed as individuals concerning protective and risk factors, Spanish LTNP patients clearly stood up in comparison with HD. Almost 70% of LTNP patients had at least one HLA protective allele, and this rose to 87% when protective SNP were also considered. In contrast, only 22% of the LTNP had a detrimental allele (
