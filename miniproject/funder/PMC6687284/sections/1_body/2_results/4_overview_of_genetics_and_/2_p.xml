<p>Notably, the mean number of protective minus risk HLA alleles and SNPs in individual Spanish healthy donors was balanced (0.74 protective– 0.62 risk to give a 0.12 balance per person, or an average of 0.12 protective HLA alleles and SNPs per healthy person). In sharp contrast, the mean was 12 times more marked for individual Spanish LTNP patients (1.66 protective– 0.23 risk to give an average of 1.43 protective HLA alleles and SNPs per LTNP patient), clearly indicating that LTNP is a population that has successfully undergone selection under the selective pressure of the HIV epidemics.</p>
