<p>Two out of the 14 factors reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> are described for the first time to our knowledge in firm association with any type of HIV susceptibility to infection or disease progression and, specifically, in association with the LTNP condition. Both are unfavorable HLA alleles, HLA-B08 and -A29. In addition, another 3 factors that have been found associated with other HIV conditions are described here for the first time in association with LTNP, including the protective HLA-B39 and the risk factors HLA-B18 and -A24. Furthermore, the positive association with LTNP of two more alleles, HLA-A03 and HLA-B52, for which very limited evidence is published, is confirmed with the Spanish LTNP cohort. In the natural history of HIV infection, several HLA class I alleles have been associated consistently with HIV progression, especially HLA-B alleles [

 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] stresses the importance of assembling and studying such cohorts of patients that control HIV infection, in spite of the scarcity of such patients. It also reveals the importance of thorough studies on novel cohorts such as the Spanish one reported here. Among other factors, one possible reason for the novelty of our data may relate to the high proportion of intravenous drug users among the Spanish LTNP compared with the majority of men who have sex with men (MSM) included in the French LTNP cohort.
