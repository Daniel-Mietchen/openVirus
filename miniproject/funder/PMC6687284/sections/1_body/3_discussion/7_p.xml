<p>Out of the 14 factors identified here in positive or negative association with Spanish LTNP, the remaining 7 factors were previously established, and our data are confirmatory. Previous studies have associated low HIV-1 viremia and prolonged survival with HLA-B57 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and HLA-B27 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] in HIV LTNP patients, and it is assumed that this is due to the antigen presentation by these alleles of conserved viral epitopes contributing to viral fitness. LTNP are also characterized by the SNP rs2395029 located at 
 <italic>HCP5</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which is in tight linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-B*5701 allele [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The fact that these HLA-B alleles display the public HLA epitope bw4 is thought to underlie the previously described and here confirmed positive role of bw4/bw4 homozygosity [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the converse negative role of the bw6/bw6 genotype. Interestingly, when considering HLA supertypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the LTNP-associated protective HLA alleles described here clustered together in some HLA supertypes (A03, B7, B27, B58 and B62 supertypes), and segregated away from the supertypes of risk alleles (A1, A24 and B44 supertypes). As the supertypes are based on HLA antigen presentation function to cytotoxic CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, this could possibly underlie the functional mechanism for their selective association in HIV-1 infection.
