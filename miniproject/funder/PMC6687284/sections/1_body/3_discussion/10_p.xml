<p>The classification of HIV-1 infected patients based on clinical data includes LTNP, typical progressors and rapid progressors. However, this classification can be enriched incorporating the VL measurement to define a more realistic description of the LTNP status with the subcategories included in the present study, i.e. EC-LTNP, LTNP-C, LTNP-N and ExLTNP. The genetic factors influencing the LTNP status have widely been studied, even from a genome-wide perspective [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the control of HIV-1 replication and the delayed disease progression simultaneously observed in EC-LTNP and LTNP-C have been poorly characterized. In this regard, the present study provides new clues about the effect of known factors influencing control and resistance to HIV-1 such as 
 <italic>HCP5</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR2</italic>, HLA-B57 and -A03 in EC-LTNP and LTNP-C compared with the rest of LTNP. On the other hand, well-documented genetic factors associated to LTNP status such as 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> rs333 or 5’
 <italic>HLA-C</italic> do not seem to have any additive effect in the EC-LTNP or LTNP-C condition with respect to the rest of LTNP. Further studies are required to discern whether the EC-LTNP and LTNP-C statuses can be considered as an accumulation of several factors previously associated with EC or LTNP or as the presence of specific unknown associations with the simultaneous observation of both phenotypes.
