<p>Further, HLA-A03 has been described in one report in association with French LTNP [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This early observation of positive association of HLA-A03 with LTNP is now confirmed with our larger and stricter Spanish LTNP cohort. Otherwise, A03 has also occasionally been associated with populations of HIV-infected patients other than LTNP [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As for HLA-A03, we also describe a significant association of the HLA-B52 allele with delayed disease progression in the Spanish cohort of LTNP patients, confirming an international HIV controllers study [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and a single earlier report weakly associating HLA-B52 with non-progression in a small Brazilian cohort of HIV-1 infected individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].
