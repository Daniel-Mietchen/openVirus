<p>When LTNP were stratified, gradual increases of the frequencies of favorable 
 <italic>HCP5</italic>, HLA-B57, HLA-A03, 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> and bw4/bw4 alleles and genotypes were concomitantly observed with increasing HIV-1 control capacity, peaking at LTNP-C and EC populations, confirming a trend previously assumed for some of them in other studies that analyzed a very limited number of LTNP patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Conversely, the strongly unfavorable bw6/bw6 genotype shows a mild inverse correlation with control of VL. However, this study shows that there is no such correlation of low VL with protective 
 <italic>5’HLA-C</italic>, as published [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], nor with CCR5 Δ32 deletion, and questions including these two SNP as markers for reduced VL [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. While the 
 <italic>CCR5 Δ32</italic> deletion has extensively been confirmed to contribute to preventing initial HIV infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], these data may suggest that, once infection is established in patients, it does not contribute to maintaining a profound LTNP status as strongly as HCP5, HLA-B57, -A03, CCR2, or bw4/bw4 genotypes may do.
