<p>Several host genetic factors have been associated with HIV-1 disease progression in different cohorts of LTNP, typical progressors or rapid progressors, when compared with HIV seronegative individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The present study aims to investigate the role of genetic factors in a large (n = 130) Spanish cohort of LTNP. However, the LTNP are a heterogeneous population consisting of HIV-1 infected individuals showing different phenotypes regarding their capacity to control viral replication. In this regard, the analysis has been extended to a conscientious stratification of LTNP, according to their VL, into elite controllers (EC), controllers (LTNP-C), viremic non-controller LTNP (LTNP-N) and individuals losing the LTNP status over time (ExLTNP).
