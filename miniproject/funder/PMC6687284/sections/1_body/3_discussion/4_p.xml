<p>The novel detrimental associations of HLA-B08 and HLA-A29 with maintenance of the LTNP status have little precedent in the literature. HLA-B08 within a common Western haplotype is frequently associated with fast progression of HIV disease, rapid CD4 T lymphocyte decline in adults and with increased mother to infant transmission [

 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but the association has rarely been individually ascribed to HLA-B08. For HLA-A29 only a non-significant trend has been reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This negative association may interestingly be related to the poor recognition by A29-restricted T lymphocyte clones of viral sequence variants [
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The large Spanish LTNP cohort data thus presents solid evidence for the first time on the negative association of these two HLA alleles with the LTNP status.
