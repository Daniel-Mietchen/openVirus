<p>The fact that with new cohorts like the large multicentric and stratified Spanish ones it is still possible to identify significant associations of the LTNP with 5 new HLA alleles (one protective and 4 detrimental for the LTNP condition) underscores the strong influence of HLA on viral control. It is still open whether especially the most significant unfavorable HLA-B18 allele could play a direct functional effect on control of HIV and in long-term stability of infected LTNP patients.</p>
