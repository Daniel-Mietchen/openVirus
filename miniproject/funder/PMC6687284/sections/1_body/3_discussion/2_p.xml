<p>Our analysis of the Spanish HIV-1 LTNP cohort and control healthy and infected populations, altogether representing 846 individuals, reveals 14 significant genetic factors. Nine of them are more frequent in the LTNP population, and thus qualify as factors that contribute to disease control and to LTNP status; in rough order of decreasing protective potency and statistical power these are the following alleles or genotypes: HLA-B57, 
 <italic>HCP5</italic> TG rs2395029 SNP, HLA bw4/bw4 (p&lt;0.0001, see individual details and summary in 
 <xref rid="pone.0220459.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), HLA-B52, HLA-B27, 
 <italic>CCR2</italic> GA/AA rs1799864 SNP (p&lt;0.01,), 
 <italic>5â€™HLA-C</italic> CC/CT rs9264942 SNP, HLA-A03 and HLA-B39 (0.01&lt;p&lt;0.05). Protective alleles/genotypes range each in frequency among the LTNP population from 7% to 30%, supporting the notion that a large proportion of the LTNP phenotype may be determined by accumulation of favorable genetic traits, rather by a single strongly protective factor. Conversely, 5 genetic factors are less frequently found in LTNP and appear to represent factors favoring disease progression; in rough order of decreasing risk and statistical power these are the following alleles or genotypes: HLA bw6/bw6, HLA-B18 (p&lt;0.001), HLA-A24, HLA-B08, (p&lt;0.01) and HLA-A29(p&lt;0.05).
