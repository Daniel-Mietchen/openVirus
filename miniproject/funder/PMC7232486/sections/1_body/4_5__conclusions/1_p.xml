<p>In conclusion, we identify a potential mechanism explaining how ZIKV resulted in large epidemics in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico but did not result in widespread transmission in the LRGV of South Texas. The population of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in South Texas fed on humans only 31% of the time, which is likely due to the abundance of non-human hosts in the residential neighborhood, the low human density, and social practices of minimizing risk of exposure to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The high rate of non-human blood meals of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> occurring in the LRGV is likely reducing the risk of human-amplified urban arboviruses such as DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV. However, the high number of blood meals from dogs and cats is concerning for zoonotic agents such as dog heartworm transmission and the potential for bridge transmission to human populations [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The population of 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> in the LRGV was ornithophilic, which likely contributes to the local transmission of WNV observed in the region. This study revealed high non-human host utilization in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, which warrants further research to determine factors driving the variation in mosquitoâ€“human contact.
