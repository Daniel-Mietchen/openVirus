<p>Mosquito-borne viruses driven principally by

 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Globalization and other anthropogenic factors have allowed this mosquito to thrive in diverse landscapes and facilitate urban transmission cycles of dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and others [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the Americas, all four serotypes of DENV have re-emerged causing consistent epidemics from South America to Mexico and the Caribbean [
