<p>We compiled all the published data on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> host feeding patterns from around the world. To systematically review the literature, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for published literature using keywords “
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> host feeding”, and a second search of “
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> blood meal analysis”. These queries in Web of Science yielded 50 and seven results, respectively, in PubMed yielded 13 and four results, respectively, and in Google Scholar yielded 1970 and 450 results, respectively. We also tracked references from key review papers and other primary literature. Inclusion criteria included blood meal results from wild-caught mosquitoes. Studies using laboratory-raised mosquitoes, as well as studies which indicated samples were likely from the form 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti formosus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], were excluded. The form 
 <italic>formosus</italic> was excluded to allow a focus on the urban form of 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic>, which is globally distributed.
