<p>Blood-engorged mosquitoes were collected from several neighborhoods in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) on the U.S. side of the U.S.–Mexico border (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00453-f001">Figure 1</xref>) from September, 2016 through December, 2018. The climate of Weslaco, Texas, which was used as a representation of the general climate for the LRGV, includes an average annual high and low temperature of Weslaco (28.7 and 17.4 °C) and Reynosa, Mexico (29.2 and 17.3 °C; climate-data.org). Average annual precipitation (in mm) is 609 for Weslaco and 532 for Reynosa. We sampled mosquitoes from eight lower-income (15,000–29,999 USD annual household income) neighborhoods (Mercedes, Mesquite (MM); Donna, Figueroa (DF); Mercedes, Chapa (MCH); Progreso Fresno/Progreso Encino (PF/PE); Indian Hills East (IHE); Indian Hills West (IHW); La Piñata (LP); Tierra Bella (TB)) and four middle-income (30,000–40,000 USD annual household income) neighborhoods (La Feria, La Bonita (LF); Mercedes, Rio Rico (MRR); McAllen, La Vista (MLV); Weslaco, Christian Court (WCT)) as described by Martin et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We used Biogents Sentinel 2 traps (BGS2; Biogents, Germany) with BG lures at IHE, IHW, LP, TB, and DF neighborhoods, placing one trap outside homes once per week for a 24-h trapping period. We also used Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGO) at PF/PE, DF, LF, MCH, MLV, MM, and MCH. One AGO was placed inside the home and an additional trap was placed outside the home, serviced weekly. More details about AGO preparation and deployment are described in Martin et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The selection of homes was largely dictated by obtaining permission from the homeowners to place traps in and around the property. Upon collection, mosquitoes were identified morphologically based upon illustrations and dichotomous keys found in

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While processing mosquitoes to identify species and sex, all bloodfed mosquitoes were placed individually into nuclease-free, 1.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes, labeled with species, sex, date and house identification number and stored at −20 or −80 °C until further processing.
