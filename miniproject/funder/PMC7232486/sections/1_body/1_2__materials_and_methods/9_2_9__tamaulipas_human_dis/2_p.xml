<p>Nucleic acid extraction was performed using a MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit in a MagNA Pure LC 2.0 Instrument (Roche Applied Science, Germany). The extracted viral RNA was stored at −70 °C. We used RT-PCR to detect the presence of arboviruses using protocols previously described [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We used the SuperScript III Platinum
 <sup>®</sup> One-Step qRT-PCR System enzyme (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 7500 Fast Real-Time Thermocycler from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) was used, and reportable positive values were below a
