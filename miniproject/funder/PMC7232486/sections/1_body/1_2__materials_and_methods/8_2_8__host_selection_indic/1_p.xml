<p>We estimated the Forage Ratio (FR), the frequency at which a mosquito selects a vertebrate host over other available vertebrate hosts, by dividing the observed frequency of bloodmeals divided by the expected frequency of bloodmeals of a given species [

 <disp-formula>FR = 
  <italic>s</italic>/
  <italic>a</italic>,
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>s</italic> = the percent of female mosquitoes containing blood of a particular host, and 
 <italic>a</italic> = percent of the total available host population represented by that particular host [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A forage ratio of 1.0 indicates mosquitoes are feeding on hosts in equal proportion to availability, whereas values &gt;1.0 indicate over-utilization and values &lt;1.0 indicate under-utilization. We used the Wilson/Brown statistical method to calculate 95% confidence intervals [
