<p>Populations of human, dog, cat, chicken, pig, and opossum were estimated by extrapolating the vertebrates documented from survey homes to create estimates of the number of each vertebrate per unit area in the entire community. To achieve this, the average number of vertebrates in the surveyed homes was multiplied by the total number of homes in the defined community to arrive at an estimated density of each vertebrate per unit area. This number was divided by the total estimated number of all potential hosts to obtain relative abundance. Population estimates of wild birds and wild mammals (rodents, meso-predators, etc.) were not obtained. </p>
