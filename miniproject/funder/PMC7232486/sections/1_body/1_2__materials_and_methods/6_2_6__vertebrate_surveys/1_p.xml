<p>In order to estimate mosquito host selection, a questionnaire related to vertebrate availability was developed and conducted in the four primary communities where blood-fed mosquitoes were collected. Project personnel visited all the homes containing BG Sentinel 2 traps in these communities: 14 (out of 307 total homes present) in Indian Hills East, 10 (96) in Indian Hills West, 13 (160) in La Piñata, and seven (49) in Tierra Bella. An adult from each home was asked for the number of persons living at each residence (further categorized by age group &lt; 5; 5–17; 18–65; &gt; 65), the number of dogs, cats, pet birds, chickens, pigs, horses, and other animals. Of the dogs and cats, the number of them roaming outside of the property was also noted. From previous observations, we suspected that a large number of stray dogs and cats live in some of these neighborhoods, therefore a final question regarding the number of strays that the adult resident is aware of was also asked. Results from the surveys were tabulated and relative abundance calculated with 95% confidence intervals for selected vertebrates, using the Wilson/Brown method (
