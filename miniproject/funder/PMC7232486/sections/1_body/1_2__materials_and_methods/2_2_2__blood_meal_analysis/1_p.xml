<p>Mosquito samples were identified under microscope, photographed, and given a Sella score (stages of blood digestion and ovary development) based upon observation of the engorged abdomen [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The Sella score was used to identify the engorged mosquitoes that had the highest likelihood of yielding a DNA sequence. To minimize exogenous DNA on the mosquito exoskeleton, each whole mosquito was washed in 10% bleach followed by two rinses with nuclease-free water [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On a clean, chilled microscope slide, the abdomen was carefully separated from the rest of the mosquito body, and the abdominal contents were expressed into a new, labeled, DNA-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. A homogenizing bead and 200 µL of lysis solution were added to the tube with blood and shaken for 1 min at 30 Hz in the Qiagen Tissue Lyser (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). DNA was extracted using the Thermo Scientific™ Kingfisher™ Flex Purification System, along with the MagMAX Core Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
