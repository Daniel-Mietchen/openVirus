<p>We followed the protocol of Medeiros et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for the vertebrate cocktail reaction, but modified the thermal cycling conditions as follows: after denaturation we ran nine cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, a gradient from 45 to 54 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The remaining thermal cycling conditions were identical to the Medeiros protocol. For the BM and ‘Herp’ reactions, we followed the protocol of Hamer et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] with the following modification: we lowered the annealing temperature for the ‘Herp’ reaction from 50 to 47 °C. The vertebrate cocktail, BM1:BM2, and ‘herp’ PCR reactions used the following reagents and quantities per reaction: 8.59 µL Nuclease-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 12.5 µL FailSafe™ PCR 2X Premix E (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA), 0.83 µL forward primer, 0.83 µL reverse primer, 0.25 µL FailSafe™ PCR Enzyme Mix (Lucigen), and 2 µL DNA template.
