<p>The protocol was tested using lab-raised, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes fed on defibrinated sheep blood (HemoStat Laboratories, Dixon, CA, USA). Adult female mosquitoes were offered artificial blood meals using a Hemotek membrane feeder (Hemotek Ltd., Blackburn, UK). Each specimen was observed under a dissecting light microscope to confirm species, give a Sella score, and capture a digital photograph. We also extracted DNA directly from the blood of several controls including iguana (
 <italic>Iguana iguana</italic>), white-tailed deer (
 <italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>), tiger (
 <italic>Panthera tigris</italic>), sandhill crane (
 <italic>Grus canadensis</italic>), and sheep (
 <italic>Ovis aries</italic>). These vertebrate species were selected because they are unlikely to be found in mosquito blood meals from this region and would thus minimize the risk of downstream amplicon contamination.
