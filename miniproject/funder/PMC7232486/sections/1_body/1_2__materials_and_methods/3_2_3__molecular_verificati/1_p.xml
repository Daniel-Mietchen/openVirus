<p>While most mosquitoes captured via BGS2 traps could be taxonomically classified from morphological features, those collected from the glue boards of the AGO traps are often damaged and more difficult to identify morphologically. Therefore, molecular identification of mosquito species was confirmed using a modified version of the protocol designed by Folmer et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, a primer pair that amplifies a 710-bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (LCO 1490 and HCO 2198; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00453">Table S2</xref>) was used with the following reagents and quantities per reaction: 8 µL Nuclease-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 12.5 µL FailSafe™ PCR 2X Premix E (Lucigen), 1 µL forward primer (LCO 1490), 1 µL reverse primer (HCO 2198), 0.5 µL FailSafe™ PCR Enzyme Mix (Lucigen), and 2 µL DNA template. The PCR thermal cycling profile included initial denaturation for three minutes at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified PCR products were purified using Exo-SAP-IT™ (ThermoFisher Scientific) and sent to Eton Bioscience (San Diego) for Sanger sequencing.
