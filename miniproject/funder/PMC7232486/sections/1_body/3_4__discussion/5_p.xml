<p>With 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> feeding on non-human hosts about 70% of the time, this study highlights the potential role of 
 <italic>Ae. aeygyti</italic> in contributing to enzootic transmission among animals or even bridge transmission of zoonotic agents to humans. Of the non-human bloodmeals, 50% were from domestic dogs. A recent study testing dogs from animal shelters in the LRGV (Edinburg, TX, USA) identified 20.9% of the dogs to be infected with dog heartworm, 
 <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Several studies suggest 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> as an efficient vector of 
 <italic>D. immitis</italic> in dogs [

 <xref rid="B81-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and a study in Florida found 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> infected with 
 <italic>D. immitis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Given that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is the dominant mammalophilic mosquito species in low- and middle-income LRGV residential communities [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], these observations suggest that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> may play a role in 
 <italic>D. immitis</italic> transmission, which warrants further research. Prior studies have also documented the potential spill-over of human-amplified urban arboviruses into wild or domestic animals [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], suggesting that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> could play the role of a bridge vector in this context.
