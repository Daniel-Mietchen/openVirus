 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> feeding on humans only 31% of the time in the sampled communities in South Texas; instead, the majority of bloodmeals (50%) were from domestic dogs. This is an unexpectedly low rate of human feeding given that this species is ubiquitously classified as an anthropophilic species [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The quantitative synthesis of 18 published blood meal analysis studies on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> shows that the average percent of human blood-feeding was 83.8%. In 1967, MacDonald pointed out that “Although 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been the study of a very large number of papers, there are only a few records of its host preference [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].” A half century later, this observation remains the same, given that only 21 studies have published 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> host feeding patterns, three of which concerned the subspecies 
 <italic>formosus</italic>, while our review of the published literature identified 86 primary publications that have reported host feeding patterns for members of the 
 <italic>Cx. pipiens</italic> complex. The less attention to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> host feeding is likely due to the assumption that this species is largely anthropophilic and reluctance to conduct the expensive bloodmeal analysis for confirmation. Zooprophylaxis is the concept that the presence of incompetent hosts can ‘waste’ bites from vector species and reduce the transmission of an infectious agent [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Furthermore, prior studies have identified that arboviral transmission potential is impacted by host community composition and competence [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For human-amplified urban arboviruses like ZIKV, less feeding on humans and more feeding on non-competent hosts (vertebrates with a low duration and magnitude of viremia unable to re-infect 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>), will have a zooprophylactic effect on transmission, as originally observed with cattle when describing zooprophylaxis in malaria transmission [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This has principally been considered an important phenomenon in human malaria transmission with 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. wasting bites on cattle, something that protects humans from malaria infectious bites [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, Hess and Hayes [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] determined that potential for zooprophylaxis exists in 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis, Cx. pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Moreover, in East Africa the observation of non-human host feeding by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> led to the conclusion that these were likely to be poor vectors of yellow fever virus [
