<p>Collection technique and location can influence the apparent host feeding patterns. While only 2% of the collections in this study were from inside homes, all of the specimens were collected within the residential yard. While our previous study documented 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> inside homes of the LRGV [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00453" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we did not target indoor collections with aspirators, given the unique socio-demographics and political climate of the LRGV, which makes indoor access challenging. Prior studies on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> host feeding patterns are limited, with only ten studies (56%) with indoor collections, seven (39%) with collections from residential yards, and two studies (11%) with collections in non-residential locations (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of the published studies reporting 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> blood meal results, most (69%) have been conducted in regions of the world where dengue is endemic (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00453-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This identifies a research gap, with a few studies such as this one reporting 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> host feeding patterns in areas where the environment may be suitable for arboviral transmission, but risk appears to be diminished by limited access to humans, and, possibly easier access to non-human vertebrates. We also did not process blood-engorged mosquitoes collected in Reynosa in the same laboratory as the current study, which is a priority for future research.
