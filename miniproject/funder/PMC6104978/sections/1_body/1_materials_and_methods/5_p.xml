<p>The Data was analysed with Stata 14.2 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Differences between proportions were compared using the Pearson´s 
 <italic>chi-squared</italic> test or Fisher’s exact test depending on type of variables. For continuous variables, Student’s T-tests were used to compare the groups. To calculate incidence of symptoms, accumulated incidence or rate incidence was used, defined as number of cases in a given period adding all periods of observation. The incidence rate has been expressed in persons-day units. We consider a result as statistical significance when we have obtained a p-value below 0.05. Secondary objectives were to estimate the potential risk of spreading of Zika in Spain after the Games taking into account the number of participants that fulfill Zika definition and potentially carrying the disease. Participants presenting symptoms compatible with arboviral diseases would be identified and contacted upon return to establish measures to control the introduction of the disease.
