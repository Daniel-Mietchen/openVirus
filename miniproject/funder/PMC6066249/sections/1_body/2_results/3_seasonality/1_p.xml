Although influenza A predominated earlier in the year, by March, influenza B was more common (present in 9% [15/171] of patients, versus 6% [11/171] of those with A/H1pdm09 and 2% [3/171] of those with A/H3). The most commonly identified pathogen in SARI patients was RSV in March (31%, 37/86) through May (24%, 6/25) and rhinovirus in June (28%, 13/46) through November (30%, 26/88). By December, influenza A/H3 was the most commonly identified pathogen, present in 30% (75/250) of patients. Patients with no identifiable pathogen, e.g. who were not positive for influenza or any of the pathogens in the multiplex test, were relatively common in the summer and early fall, comprising the majority of patients in August (69%, 11/16) and September (52%, 15/29).
