<p>Fever, cough, and breathing difficulty were the most common symptoms in SARI cases; fever and cough are included in the SARI case definition (
 <xref rid="pone.0201497.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, 75% (1,213/1,624) of SARI cases had breathing difficulty, especially in those with human metapneumovirus (93%, 37/40), adenovirus (80%, 67/82), rhinovirus (80%, 156/193), and influenza A/H3 (80%, 107/133) infections. Clinical outcomes associated with disease severity, including hospitalization in an ICU and artificial ventilation, followed similar patterns: hospitalization in an ICU was highest among those with human metapneumovirus (50%, 20/40) and influenza A/H1pdm09 (44%, 144/327); it was relatively low among those with adenovirus (26%, 22/82). Artificial ventilation was more common in those with influenza A/H1pdm09 (18%, 58/328), human metapneumovirus (15%, 6/40), influenza A/H3 (13%, 18/133), and parainfluenzavirus (12%, 9/72), and less than 10% for those with other infections.
