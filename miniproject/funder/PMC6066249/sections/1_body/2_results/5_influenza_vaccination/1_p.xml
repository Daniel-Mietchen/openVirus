<p>A very small proportion of SARI cases reported influenza vaccination (1%; 20/1624) for the given season and 12% (206/1624) of cases reported unknown vaccination status. No individual with influenza B infection reported prior vaccination. The odds of being an influenza case compared to being a SARI case that did not have influenza varied by influenza strain and by how those with unknown vaccination status were categorized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201497.g002">Fig 2</xref>). For influenza A/H3, vaccination was associated with higher odds of influenza when excluding SARI cases with unknown vaccination status (OR: 5.47, 95% CI: 2.11, 14.18) or by combining those who were vaccinated with the unknown vaccination status group (OR: 7.11, 95% CI: 2.76, 18.29). The opposite trend, a protective association between vaccination and disease status was observed when cases with unknown vaccination status were combined with those who were known to be unvaccinated (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.97).
