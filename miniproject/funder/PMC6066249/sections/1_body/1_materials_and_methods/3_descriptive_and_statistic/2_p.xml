<p>We used a case-test negative design to estimate the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination within the past year.[
 <xref rid="pone.0201497.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] An odds ratio (OR) was calculated comparing the odds of being positive for influenza among those with and without a prior seasonal influenza vaccination. This odds ratio was calculated separately for the A/H1pdm09 and A/H3 strains, along with any influenza virus strain. The reference controls (“test negatives”) were those SARI cases who were not positive for any influenza virus. Many patients had an unknown vaccination status. As a sensitivity analysis, the OR was calculated three separate ways: not including any patient with unknown vaccination status, and then including vaccination unknowns into either the vaccinated or unvaccinated group. The OR was estimated using a logistic regression model that also controlled for sex and age and was limited to individuals ≥1 year of age.
