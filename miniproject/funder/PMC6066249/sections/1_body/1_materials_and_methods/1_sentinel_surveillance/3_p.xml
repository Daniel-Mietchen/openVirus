<p>Hospitalized patients with SARI provided demographic information, including age, sex, and residence through questionnaires. The surveillance system also collects patients’ self-reported history of seasonal influenza vaccination within the past year in response to the question, “Are you vaccinated against influenza?” Participants who responded affirmatively were subsequently questioned about when they were vaccinated, and were only recorded as having received the vaccine if it was received specifically for the on-going season. Based on date of sampling and enrollment into the study, cases of SARI captured in the sentinel surveillance system between September 29, 2015, and March 15, 2017, were included in this present manuscript.</p>
