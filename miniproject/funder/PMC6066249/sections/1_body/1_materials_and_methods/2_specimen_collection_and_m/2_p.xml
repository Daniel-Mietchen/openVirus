<p>The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used for viral RNA and DNA extraction. To guarantee RNA integrity, samples were lysed under highly denaturing conditions to inactivate RNases. Alcohol was added and lysates loaded onto the QIAamp spin column. Viral RNA and DNA bind specifically to the QIAamp silica membrane while contaminants pass through. Pure viral RNA/DNA were eluted in a 60 μl buffer. Wash buffers removed impurities and pure, ready-to-use RNA/DNA was then eluted in water or low-salt buffer. Total nucleic acid extracts were stored at -80°C until further processing by PCR.</p>
