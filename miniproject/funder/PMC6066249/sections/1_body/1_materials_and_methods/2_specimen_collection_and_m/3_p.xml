<p>FTD Respiratory Pathogens 21 (Fast Track Diagnostics) multiplex Real-Time PCR diagnostic strategy was used to detect influenza A, pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (A/H1N1pdm09 or A/H1pdm09), influenza B, rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43, HKU1, parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus A/B, bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, adenovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>. The CFX96â„¢ Real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) that detects five different fluorescent dyes simultaneously was used for multi-pathogen detection in one clinical sample. To identify A/H3 virus, we used a real-time RT-PCR Influenza A subtyping kit donated by the US CDC.
