<p>Only a few of the SARI cases reported during the 2015–2017 period had received the influenza vaccine. A study of pediatric influenza cases from the 2010–11 influenza season in Georgia also found low vaccination coverage–there being no case with a prior vaccination.[
 <xref rid="pone.0201497.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The lack of strong physician recommendations for influenza vaccination to the general population or even high risk groups are likely responsible for poor vaccine uptake. For example, a recent study found that only 43% of obstetrician-gynecologists in Georgia have recommended influenza vaccine to pregnant women, and only 18% reported vaccinating pregnant patients in the last influenza season.[
 <xref rid="pone.0201497.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Misinformation or knowledge gaps may also be at the root of hesitant recommendations from the healthcare worker community. For instance, one study of hospital-based physicians and nurses found that few were able to correctly identify influenza as the virus associated with H5N1 outbreaks in neighboring countries.[
 <xref rid="pone.0201497.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Analysis of risk factors associated with severe outcomes and continued monitoring of the etiologic nature of SARI occurrence in Georgia should provide an important evidence basis to help healthcare workers target high-risk groups and bolster seasonal influenza vaccine uptake in the population.
