<p>During 2015–2017 in Georgia, the predominant causes of SARI varied seasonally and depending on the month were influenza A/B, RSV and rhinovirus, although other viruses–coronavirus, parainfluenzavirus, adenovirus–were also present. The most serious clinical symptoms were found in those infected with influenza A and human metapneumovirus. A cross-country risk assessment of SARI activity among European countries during the 2015–2016 found a predominance of influenza A circulation in the region, with an uptick in severe disease in the earliest parts of the season,[

While the distribution of infectious etiologies could change within and between seasons due to increased uptake of PCV, Hib and seasonal influenza vaccination, there was no evidence that circulating influenza viruses changed antigenically compared to the influenza vaccine virus for the same season.[
