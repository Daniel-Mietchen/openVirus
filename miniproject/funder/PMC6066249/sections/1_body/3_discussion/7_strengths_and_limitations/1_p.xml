<p>Although we had a case definition of SARI established by the WHO, physicians reporting cases into the surveillance system did include a small number of cases who did not meet all symptom criteria. It is not clear how representative these findings are of SARI for the whole of Georgia. A longitudinal study in England estimated that only 5% of symptomatic influenza cases are medically attended and reported into the surveillance system.[

Additionally, we attempted to model the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine through a case-test negative design, however, we did not have the statistical power to test this by year. Overall, this study employed a rigorous sampling methodology and was able to enroll individuals throughout Georgia to describe the characteristics of SARI patients within the country.
