<p>Sentinel surveillance has generated timely information on the etiologic and clinical patterns associated with SARI over the past two years in the country of Georgia. Routine monitoring of infectious etiologies associated with SARI at the local-level is critical for signaling epidemiologic and etiologic trends that may differ from one country to another. For example, a study of SARI patients in a number of countries of eastern Europe and western and central Asia found that the proportion of cases positive for influenza varied widely between country and season, from 2.1% in Armenia in 2011–2012 to 100% in Albania in 2009–2010.[

The early detection of unusual or divergent activity from one country to another via the sentinel surveillance system can better prepare a country for emergency response needs and inform routine programmatic actions.
