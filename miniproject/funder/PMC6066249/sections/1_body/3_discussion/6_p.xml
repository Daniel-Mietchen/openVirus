<p>This study was not powered to detect an association between influenza vaccination status and laboratory-confirmed influenza. However, the test-negative study design presented in this analysis could provide a useful framework for annual evaluation of the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccination efforts in the country of Georgia. Importantly, revisions to the existing data collection instruments for defining vaccination status to clearly identify those who received the current season vaccine could better assess the vaccineâ€™s effectiveness from season to season.</p>
