<p>The seasonality of viral respiratory SARI observed in the 2015–2017 period in Georgia was similar to patterns observed in other temperate climate settings, where influenza circulation peaks in winter;[

 <xref rid="pone.0201497.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Observed trends in seasonality during the 2015–2017 season in Georgia are consistent with previously reported seasonality and age-distribution of disease among children.[
 <xref rid="pone.0201497.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although we did not present detailed clinical characteristics of SARI which may be associated with specific pathogens, our findings provide evidence for the association between infection with specific respiratory viruses and severe clinical outcomes. Such information is helpful to clinicians in making more rapid diagnoses for the administration of treatment and patient management.
