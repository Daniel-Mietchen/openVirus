<p id="Par28">The high proportion of participants with measured hypertension on the interview day without a previous diagnosis of hypertension also indicates under diagnosis of comorbidity, and suggests that data reporting hypertension diagnoses are likely to be an underestimate of true prevalence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. White coat hypertension may contribute to the higher prevalence of measured hypertension, although research suggests that the presence of white coat hypertension may be associated with sustained hypertension in the future [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However the prevalences of diabetes, CRD, and epilepsy found in this study were lower in comparison to another study surveying the SA adult population presenting to primary health care in 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This may be due to the fact that the majority of participants in that study were HIV uninfected. A study on HIV-infected persons over 50 years old in rural South Africa reported better functional ability, quality of life and overall health state (measured using three instruments: disability index, quality of life and composite health score) than HIV-affected participants. This suggests that enhanced healthcare received as part of HIV care could benefit overall wellbeing of HIV-infected older people [
