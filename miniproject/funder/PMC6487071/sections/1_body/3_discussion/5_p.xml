<p id="Par30">Comparing the comorbidity measurement between the HIV clinic folders and self-report, a lower level of comorbidity was found in the HIV clinic folders than was self-reported on interview. Inaccuracy in self-report may be a factor. For example, self-reported diagnoses of CRD were very few; possibly due to low levels of awareness of the diagnosis, or about CRD symptoms. It may also be a reflection of the absence of screening for NCDs in the HIV-infected population. The lack of integration between HIV and NCD healthcare systems at the time of this study is also a significant barrier to this ascertainment of NCD co-morbidity in this population group. Past studies have recognised this likely under-diagnosis of NCD alongside the paucity of data on NCD in HIV-infected individuals in LMICs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This is particularly relevant as research suggests that HIV-infected individuals have a greater burden of NCDs than non-infected adults of the same age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This contrasts with the separation of healthcare services into distinct biomedical categories. The implications of the fragmented vertical systems are seen at Ubuntu clinic: separate folders for HIV and other primary healthcare service means treatment-related decisions, diagnoses, and measures of HIV control from one clinic may not be communicated to and recorded by all. Strengthening of health systems through integration of care is therefore needed, for example through sharing of clinic folders and data information systems, as well as implementation of routine active screening for common NCDs in HIV-infected persons. These strategies would serve to provide improved holistic chronic care for these patients, as well as enabling future research on the interaction between these co-occurring diseases [
