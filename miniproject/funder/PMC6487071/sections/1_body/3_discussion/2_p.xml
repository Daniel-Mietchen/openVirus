<p id="Par27">We found no statistically significant association between a detectable HIV viral load and the presence of any comorbidity (comorbidity indicator iv). This is consistent with a study conducted between 2004 and 2009 which found no association between a detectable HIV viral load and hypertension in HIV-infected adults on ART in SA [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Neither study described the period of time participants were on ART and in one study all participants were treated for diabetes, hypertension, or both [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Notably these studies had different definitions for viraemia. Two recent papers noted an association between low level viremia (&gt; 50–1000 copies/ml) and increased risk of virological failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. While 8 % of our sample had a viral load of greater than 1000 copies/ml, due to insufficient statistical power, we did not sub-categorise viral load, and this may have contributed to our differing results. A second possible explanation is selection bias. Given that non-attendance is associated with a detectable HIV viral load, and all participants in our study were attending their clinic appointment, this could be a source of bias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] as those within the study may be more likely than the general population to be virologically suppressed.
