<p id="Par29">Our results indicate that age &lt; 35 years, female gender, ever smoking, and low CD4 count were associated with a detectable HIV viral load. Whilst this study had 75% female participants, this gender ratio is typical for ART clinics in this [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and other settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In addition, in Khayelitsha, this gender ratio persists in the NCD clinics due to the overall predominance of females attending primary care services [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The significant gender differences seen in BMI, smoking, and CD4 (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) may play a role. However, this study was not powered to stratify analyses by gender.
