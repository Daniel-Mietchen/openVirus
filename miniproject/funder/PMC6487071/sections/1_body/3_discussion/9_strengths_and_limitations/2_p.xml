<p id="Par35">Our final sample had a slightly lower prevalence of comorbidity than hypothesised (43% vs 50%) and was smaller than the target number (298 vs 330), which may have reduced our ability to observe a statistically significant association between presence of comorbidity and detectable viral load. Some reduction in our final sample for analysis was because we were unable to measure blood pressure in all participants due to a lack of a sufficiently large cuff size for the most obese participants. Given the known link between hypertension and obesity, a greater proportion of this group may have been hypertensive. Thus, our estimate of hypertension prevalence may underrepresent the true level in this population. Furthermore, SA guidelines require multiple readings to make a diagnosis of hypertension. Although this was not feasible in this study, we did record previous diagnoses, in addition to measured elevated blood pressure. We did not measure adherence to medication. This may have been a confounder as past studies have suggested that those with poor adherence to ART, for a variety of reasons including substance abuse, a common risk factor in South Africa, may have poor adherence to medication for comorbidity resulting in a detectable viral load alongside higher blood pressure [

Research suggesting that HIV-infected men have poorer health-seeking behaviour compared to women and hence a higher AIDS mortality rate highlight the importance of further research exploring the effect of gender on the association between viral load and multimorbidity; and the need for gender-specific strategies to encourage earlier enrolment into HIV care [

Given the vertical nature of the health system and absence of routine screening for NCDs in this HIV clinic, under-diagnosis of NCDs may have limited our ability to detect a significant association between NCD co-morbidity and viral load. Finally, the unknown timing of comorbidity diagnoses and the cross-sectional nature of our study meant we were unable to investigate causality in exploring comorbidity risk factor associations.
