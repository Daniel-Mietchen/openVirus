<p id="Par31">Examining risk factors for comorbidity, our results highlight the importance of smoking and BMI as significant risk factors for comorbidity. Higher levels of smoking in HIV-infected compared to non-infected populations have been reported and previous studies have found that both HIV infection and smoking independently impact T-cell function and together significantly worsen the immune profile [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and merits further investigation given evidence that suggests tobacco smoking increases the immune activation in HIV-infected adults and is a known risk factor for NCD [
