 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It should however be noted that even in a vertical system, the CD4 count and viral load, important markers of disease control, were not always recorded in HIV clinic folders of the participants in this study. Given that these markers are an important aspect of HIV care, interventions to integrate inclusion of data on comorbidity risk factors and coexisting NCD should aim to also improve disease monitoring for HIV to avoid treatment failure and drug resistance [
