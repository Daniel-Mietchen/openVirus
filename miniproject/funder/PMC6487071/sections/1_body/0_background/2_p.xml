<p id="Par14">To ensure optimal care for aging HIV-infected individuals, there is a need to recognize the association between comorbidity and HIV. Studies on ART patients have demonstrated the association between a detectable HIV viral load and a greater risk of developing comorbidities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, these studies were based in high-income settings where the HIV epidemic is not generalised. The rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in SSA, combined with high levels of chronic infectious diseases such as HIV is resulting in a different pattern of multimorbidity than is seen in high-income countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Low-income groups in South Africa (SA) have seen a dramatic increase in prevalence of NCDs and have the highest burden of HIV, a chronic infectious disease resulting in concurrent epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The new ART initiation guidelines in SA will increase the numbers of patients on ART [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, little is known about the impact of comorbid chronic diseases on long-term HIV management and care necessitating further research to better understand the association between NCD comorbidity and HIV control. In SA, NCD management is largely in primary care clinics, with treatment freely available. In the Western Cape province, primary care clinics are organised into disease-specific clubs, with a focus on four diseases (based on prevalence and importance as determined by contribution to disability adjusted life years, and the need for specialist expertise input in the primary care setting): diabetes, hypertension, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and epilepsy. The province-wide annual chronic disease audit conducted by the provincial government department of health, focuses on these diseases with the aim of improving management and disease outcomes. Yet, despite the increasing co-morbidity of NCDs with HIV in SA and an increasing body of research in high-income countries on the association between a detectable HIV load and NCDs, there is little known about the association between HIV and these diseases in low and middle-income settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the association between prevalent NCDs of importance in this setting (hypertension, diabetes, epilepsy or chronic respiratory disease (CRD)) and a current detectable HIV viral load.
