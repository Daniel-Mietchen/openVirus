<p id="Par25">In univariable regression models, none of the four comorbidity indicators, or the ordinal variable measuring number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a detectable HIV viral load (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In contrast, ever smoking, being normal/underweight (BMI ≤ 24·9), and having a low CD4 count (CD4 &lt; 300 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) were associated with higher odds of having a detectable viral load. The final multivariable model included age, sex, having ever smoked, BMI, CD4 count, and comorbidity indicator (iv) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Significantly higher odds of a detectable HIV viral load were associated with being female (OR 3·26; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0·02), and having ever smoked compared to never smoked (OR 3.95; p = 0· &lt; 001). Individuals aged ≥35 years had significantly lower odds of having a detectable HIV viral load compared to those aged &lt; 35 years (OR 0·40; p = 0·02). Higher CD4 counts were also associated with significantly lower odds of a detectable viral load: compared to a referent of CD4 &lt; 300 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, CD4 300–449 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (OR 0·28; p = &lt; 0·001), CD4 450–599 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (OR 0·12; p = &lt; 0·001) and, CD4 ≥ 600 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (OR 0·12; p = &lt; 0·001). BMI remained significant at the 10% level (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0·1) in the final model but effect estimates remained similar to the size of those in the univariate model suggesting normal / underweight was associated with higher odds of a detectable HIV viral load compared to being obese. The interactions between sex and smoking, and sex and BMI were in turn added to the final model, however neither interaction made a statistically significant contribution to the model and they were not retained. Sensitivity analyses were conducted excluding 52 individuals whose most recent viral load measurement was not within 12 months of interview. Excluding these individuals did not significantly change the model results (data not shown).
