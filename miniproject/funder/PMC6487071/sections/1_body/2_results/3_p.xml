<p id="Par24">Overall the majority of participants had only one comorbidity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> illustrates the reported prevalence of comorbidities according to the source of diagnoses. Using indicator iii) (comorbidity on self-report or folder-review), the prevalence of comorbidity was 20% (95% CI 0.15–0.25), which was higher compared to using indicator i) (14% (95% CI 0.10–0.18)) or ii) (19% (95% CI 0.14–0.23)). While there was overlap between the two sources, additional reports came from each source individually. Overall, 69% of indicator ii) diagnoses had also been detected by indicator i), with 70, 92, 13, 57% of hypertension, diabetes, CRD, and epilepsy indicator ii) diagnoses also detected in indicator i) respectively. Of the 307 participants who had blood pressure measured on the day of interview (11 participants did not have blood pressure measured due to unavailability of an appropriate cuff size), 36% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 109) were found to be hypertensive. Of these, less than a third (28% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 31; 95% CI 0.21–0.38) had a previous diagnosis of hypertension. Including this diagnosis of hypertension on the day of interview in the definition of comorbidity (indicator iv)) increased the overall prevalence of comorbidities to 43% (95% CI 0.38–0.48).
