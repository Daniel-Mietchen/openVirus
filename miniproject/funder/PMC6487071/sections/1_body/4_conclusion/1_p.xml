<p id="Par36">We found no association between a detectable HIV viral load and comorbidity. Lower NCD prevalence in clinic records than self-report and a higher level of hypertension on the day than self-reported or recorded in clinic folders suggest under-diagnosis of NCDs in this population. This potential under-detection of NCDs may differ from a high-income setting and have contributed to our finding of a null association. This suggests the need for further research and better detection of, and screening for NCDs. An integrated chronic care system would allow enhanced detection, and dual management of HIV and NCDs and their risk factors, in addition to promoting an integrated approach to chronic infectious and NCD prevention.</p>
