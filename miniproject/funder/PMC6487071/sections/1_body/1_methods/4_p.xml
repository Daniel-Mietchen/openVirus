<p id="Par18">Four indicators of comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, CRD and/or epilepsy) were created: i) comorbidity reported in clinic folder; ii) self-reported comorbidity during interview; iii) comorbidity reported in clinic folder OR on self-report during interview, and iv) a composite indicator consisting of comorbidity indicator (iii) (comorbidity reported in clinic folder OR self-report during interview) plus measured hypertension (diastolic ≥90 mmHg or a systolic ≥140 mmHg in line with SAGE, NIDS and SANHANES-1 studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]) on the day of interview. These definitions of comorbidity are referred to throughout the rest of the manuscript as comorbidity indicators i, ii, iii, and iv. Comorbidity indicator iii was also used to generate a variable representing the number of diagnosed comorbidities recorded for each individual. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the height and weight data and categorised according to the WHO classification [
