<p id="Par17">Including diabetes and hypertension enabled comparisons to be made with multimorbidity studies conducted in this setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Measurements (height, weight, and blood pressure using an electronic blood pressure machine) were taken once at the end of the interview by SG. The same technique and electronic blood pressure machine was used throughout the data collection period. After interview, the following data were extracted from the patient’s clinic folder and any missing data was extracted from the national health electronic laboratory service database: most recent viral load and CD4 count and date of ART initiation. This electronic database is an established national centralised service for the public healthcare system, with standard operating procedures for all tests, within which each patient, irrespective of what clinic they are seen, is identified via a unique identifier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The primary outcome was a detectable viral load at the most recent viral load measurement, defined as &gt; 40 copies/ml. We calculated that a sample size of 330 participants was sufficient to detect a two-fold higher proportion of patients with a detectable viral load among those with comorbidity compared to those with no comorbidity, with a power of 0·8 and an alpha level of 0·05, while assuming that half of the HIV population in the clinic would have at least one comorbidity listed above.
