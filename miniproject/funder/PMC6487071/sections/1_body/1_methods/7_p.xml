For the final multivariable model, we explored interactions between sex and smoking, and sex and BMI given the known gender differences in smoking and BMI patterns in this population. All analyses were conducted using STATA SE 13 statistical package. Sensitivity analyses were also performed using data only for participants with a viral load measurement within 12 months of the interview date and re-running the final multivariable model.
