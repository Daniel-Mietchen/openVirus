While Ubuntu clinic is located in a healthcare delivery complex that provides outpatient primary care services for NCDs, these facilities have separate buildings, staff and separate pharmacies; and represent non-integrated health systems. As a result, each HIV-infected patient at Ubuntu clinic has a clinic folder for ART only and (if diagnosis known) a separate folder for other primary health care services, including NCDs. There was no routine screening for NCDs in the ART clinic. Any recording of NCDs or attempt at screening was entirely based on the clinicianâ€™s decision at the time of consultation. As a result, there were no NCD data in many of the HIV clinic folders regardless of on-going care for NCDs in the primary healthcare clinic. The NCDs routinely managed in the primary care outpatient clinic and in routine NCD adherence clubs are diabetes, hypertension, CRD and epilepsy, in line with Western Cape Department of Health policy which annually audits these specific conditions [
