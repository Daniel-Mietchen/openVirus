<p>While WNV antigen distribution is frequently described in both natural infection in humans and animals and animal experimental infection, immunohistochemical antigen distribution and staining may indicate sites of replication but do not always correlate to pathology or organ dysfunction; therefore, extensive lists of IHC and PCR results will not be included in this review [
 <xref rid="B76-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B153-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>,
 <xref rid="B154-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Additionally, IHC does not always align with well-documented sites of virus replication [
 <xref rid="B155-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Antigen can be focal and sparse and is typically visible in only 50% of fatal WNV neuroinvasive disease cases, making this modality relatively insensitive [
