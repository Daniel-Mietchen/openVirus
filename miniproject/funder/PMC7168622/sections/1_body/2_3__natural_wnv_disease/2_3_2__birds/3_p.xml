<p>The severe systemic infection and mortality observed in avian species have the potential to significantly alter bird populations. Recent literature has demonstrated massive losses in avian biodiversity in North America, with estimates of 29% loss of abundance since 1970 [
 <xref rid="B124-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. WNV likely contributes to some avian losses as it has been estimated to negatively affect populations of between one–fifth and one–half of examined North American avian species, with some (but not all) never recovering to pre-WNV levels [
