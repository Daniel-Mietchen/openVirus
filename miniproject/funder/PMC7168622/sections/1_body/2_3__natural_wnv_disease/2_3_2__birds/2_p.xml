<p>In contrast to humans and other affected species, most major organ systems have been shown to be affected in natural avian WNV infections. Neurological manifestations are indicative of viral encephalitis and are similar to findings seen in humans and other non-host vertebrate species. This encephalitis is characterized as a lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis with an occasional heterophilic component, heterophils being the avian functional equivalent to the neutrophil. Histologically, there is perivascular cuffing, glial nodules and gliosis, neuronal necrosis and occasional hemorrhage. Frequently affected regions of the nervous system include the brain stem and gray matter of the spinal cord, cerebellum and thalamus. In addition to the nervous system, myocarditis is a common lesion in birds [

Ocular lesions are seen in raptors (red-tailed hawks, Cooper′s hawks, bald eagles, golden eagles, goshawks) and owls (great horned owls, barred owls) and range from lymphoplasmacytic pectenitis and chorioretinal inflammation and scarring to generalized endophthalmitis [

Age and a developed immune system likely contribute to this refractory nature of adult chickens as young chicks are susceptible and histologic lesions include myocardial necrosis, necrosis, nephritis and pneumonitis, and rare encephalitis [
