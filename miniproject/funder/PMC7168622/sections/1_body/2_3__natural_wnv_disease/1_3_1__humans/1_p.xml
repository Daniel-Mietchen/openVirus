<p>While approximately 80% of people infected with WNV are asymptomatic, the majority of symptomatic patients experience a mild febrile disease lasting up to a week, a syndrome known as West Nile fever (WNF) [
 <xref rid="B64-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In addition to fever, mild disease is characterized by headache, gastrointestinal problems, rash, myalgia, arthralgia and malaise. West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) occurs in less than 1% of infected people and is manifested as multiple syndromes including West Nile meningitis (WNM), West Nile encephalitis (WNE) and West Nile poliomyelitis (WNP) [
 <xref rid="B65-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. WNM describes inflammation which is primarily restricted to the meninges, the connective tissue coverings of the brain and spinal cord. WNM is typically associated with more favorable outcomes and is the most common manifestation of neuroinvasive disease in younger patients [
 <xref rid="B66-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. WNE is a more invasive disease process, in which the brain parenchyma is infected and inflamed. This is more commonly seen in older adults and the immunosuppressed [
 <xref rid="B10-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clinical signs associated with WNE range in severity and can include tremors, cerebellar ataxia, and general Parkinsonism [
 <xref rid="B66-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. WNP is associated with infection of the anterior horn cells (lower motor neurons) of the spinal cord, resulting in a polio-like flaccid paralysis, which at its most severe can cause quadriplegia and respiratory impairment [
 <xref rid="B67-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B69-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. WNP is distinct from a rarer Guillain-Barre syndrome which has been reported in association with WNV infection [
 <xref rid="B65-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. While these classifications are important, clinical presentation of WNV infection may present as any mixture of these syndromes.
