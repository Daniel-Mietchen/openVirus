<p>A vast body of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis has resulted from experimental infections using animal models. Interestingly, wild-type mice are resistant to WNV infection, but all classical laboratory mice strains are susceptible to infections administered by the intracerebral and intraperitoneal routes [
 <xref rid="B156-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. This susceptibility has been mapped to a mutation in the 
 <italic>OAS1b</italic> gene, which is regulated by interferon and contributes to viral RNA degradation [

 <xref rid="B158-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>,
 <xref rid="B159-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Histopathology in the laboratory mouse is characterized by neuronal necrosis, lymphohistiocytic perivascular infiltrates, glial nodules, neuronal satellitosis and neuronophagia in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus and spinal cord [

 <xref rid="B160-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>,
 <xref rid="B161-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Commonly used strains of mice include C57BL/6 mice, mice on a C57BL/6 background and C3H/HeN mice. Disease is not limited to the brain in mice. Thymic atrophy has been described in affected mice, and similarly, the thymus has been affected in ducklings and other birds [

 <xref rid="B162-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Gastrointestinal lesions in mice including dilation of the stomach and small intestine and villus blunting (shortening) have been seen in association with degeneration and necrosis of intestinal myenteric ganglia [
 <xref rid="B155-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>,
 <xref rid="B163-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. This may serve as a model for gastrointestinal dysmotility seen in humans after flavivirus infection [
 <xref rid="B164-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. Gastrointestinal disease is also frequently seen in birds.
