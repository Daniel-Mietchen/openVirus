<p>An abundance of information about WNV pathogenesis has been yielded from mouse models of infection. After inoculation, initial viral replication is thought to occur in Langerhans dendritic cells of the skin [
 <xref rid="B165-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. These infected Langerhans cells then migrate to draining lymph nodes where virus can be transported to the systemic circulation after return through the thoracic and lymphatic ducts [

 <xref rid="B167-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. At that point a primary viremia allows for viral dissemination to the visceral organs for additional viral replication [

 <xref rid="B169-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Virus must then traverse the bloodâ€“brain barrier before replication in nervous tissue to cause encephalitis disease. The lesions of encephalitis and poliomyelitis seen in WNV infection cannot be attributed solely to viral replication or the immune response, but rather are the result of both direct viral injury and immune-mediated pathogenesis. Specific work examines the immunologic mechanisms by which lymphocytes, the primary responding cell type, are recruited into the central nervous system where inflammatory mediators exacerbate viral-induced damage [
