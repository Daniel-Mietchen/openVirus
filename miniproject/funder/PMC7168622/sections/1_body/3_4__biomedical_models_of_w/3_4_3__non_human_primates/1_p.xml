<p>In addition to mice, some early experimental work examining WNV encephalitis was performed in non-human primates. Depending on the viral strain, intracerebral inoculation resulted in disease ranging from asymptomatic infection to febrile disease to overt encephalitis [

 <xref rid="B183-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Histopathology in acute WNV encephalitis includes severe perivascular and diffuse lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, neuronal degeneration and necrosis and glial nodules in the gray matter. Lesions were most frequent in the cerebellum, brainstem and anterior horns of the spinal cord. Chronic lesions also include loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and spinal motor neurons. In contrast, more recent experimental infections examining antibody response to WNV infection in immunocompetent rhesus macaques and marmosets resulted in low to absent viremia and minimal to absent infectious virus detection in the CNS [
