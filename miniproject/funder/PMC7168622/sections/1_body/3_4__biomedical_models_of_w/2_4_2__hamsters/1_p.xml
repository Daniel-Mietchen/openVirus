<p>Golden hamsters are excellent models for WNV encephalitis because they mimic human disease in regards to length of viremia, muscle weakness, gastrointestinal signs, respiratory symptoms and clinical signs including tremors [

 <xref rid="B178-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Hamsters infected with WNV develop neurologic symptoms including tremors and hind limb paralysis associated with progressive pathology in the cerebellum and spinal cord [
