<p>Multiple other species have been used in WNV biomedical research and contributed to varying aspects of the field. Rats were used in some of the earliest experimental work studying WNV and while older rats were resistant to fatal disease, newborn rats were susceptible [

Histologically these infections were relatively mild and characterized by meningitis and mild inflammatory infiltrates and perivascular cuffs. The most severe lesions were seen in the hippocampus. In contemporary work, the use of rats is primarily related to toxicology studies which assess for the safety of WNV vaccines [
