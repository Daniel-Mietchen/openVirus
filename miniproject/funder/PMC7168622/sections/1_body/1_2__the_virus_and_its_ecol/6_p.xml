<p>Experimental animal models have been used to examine the factors that affect WNV transmission. Some of that work has used wild birds, allowing for direct investigation of the most relevant virus ecology [

 <xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Reports also demonstrate that additional species including Eastern cottontail rabbits, fox squirrels and alligators have the potential to infect mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B63-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], indicating that continued investigation into possible non-avian contributions to WNV maintenance is warranted. While WNV is primarily transmitted and maintained between birds and mosquitoes, it can infect and cause pathology and disease in a wide range of vertebrates. This plasticity is relatively unique amongst arboviruses and has been demonstrated in both natural and experimental infections. When it comes to the viral and immune factors leading to pathology, much has been examined in mouse models and is briefly described below. The pathology seen in natural and experimental infections will be discussed in detail in this review.
