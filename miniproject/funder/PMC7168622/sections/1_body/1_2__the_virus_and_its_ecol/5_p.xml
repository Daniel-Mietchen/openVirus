<p>Much of the research surrounding West Nile virus focuses on (a) viral and ecological factors which affect viral transmission and (b) viral and immune factors which determine pathology and disease. A distinction must be made between the ability for transmission and pathology. While numerous species can be infected and experience pathology and disease, birds are well-established as the primary species which develop the high viral titers required to infect mosquitoes and contribute to virus perpetuation.</p>
