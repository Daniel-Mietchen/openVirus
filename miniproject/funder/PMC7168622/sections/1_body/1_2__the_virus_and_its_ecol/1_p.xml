<p>WNV is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> within the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. The WNV genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 11,000 nucleotides. Within host cells, viral RNA is translated and processed into 10 proteins: three structural (envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) and seven nonstructural (NS) (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [

 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Lineage 1 is widely distributed and contains isolates from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, India and North America [

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lineage 2 viruses have been isolated in Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East and Europe [

 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Initially, lineage 1 viruses were considered to be more virulent than lineage 2 viruses; however, it has been shown that both lineages can cause neuroinvasive disease in humans and animals and lineage 2 has now displaced lineage 1 as the primary cause of WNV disease in Europe [
