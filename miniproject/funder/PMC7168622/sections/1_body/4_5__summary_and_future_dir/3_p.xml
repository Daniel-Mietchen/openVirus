<p>The detection of persistent infection in the kidneys of people and birds raises another important common feature of WNV pathogenesis that is conserved across several vertebrates and has been previously underappreciated. This is the extent to which WNV can persist within vertebrates despite the induction of a strong antibody and cell-mediated immune response. Monkeys, mice, birds and people have all been demonstrated to develop long-term persistent infections after acute WNV. This has also been noted in a human case of Russian springâ€“summer encephalitis (caused by tick-borne encephalitis virus) that resulted in progressive neurological disease approximately thirteen years after acute infection [
 <xref rid="B217-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. Chronic lesions of prior viral and immune-mediated injury may manifest as the human populations previously affected by WNV continue to age. An important question that remains to be answered is whether persistent, chronic infection by WNV and other flaviviruses, years after acute infection, is an underrecognized aspect of viral pathogenesis.
