<p>One of the more interesting features of the emergence of WNV is its somewhat unique ecological generalism. Whereas most flaviviruses productively infect a relatively restricted subset of animal species, WNV can infect an extraordinarily wide array of vertebrate taxa. This generalism has produced opportunities to learn about viral pathogenesis across taxa and increase knowledge regarding the extent to which pathogenic mechanisms may be conserved. For example, the most notable feature of WNV disease in humans is neurotropism resulting most frequently in encephalitis and, more uncommonly, meningitis and other neurologic syndromes. This set of clinical presentations is largely conserved in horses, birds and mice. The significance of this broad conservation is that human and avian neurological disease can be modeled with an uncommonly high degree of fidelity using mice, which has facilitated improved understanding of mechanisms of neuroinvasion and subsequent immune-mediated injury.</p>
