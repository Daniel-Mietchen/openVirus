<p>Other clinical syndromes are also present across broadly divergent vertebrate taxa. Renal tropism is a feature of WNV infection in birds that facilitated early surveillance efforts. Several human studies have demonstrated that renal failure may contribute to poor long-term outcomes among WNV survivors [

 <xref rid="B216-pathogens-09-00048" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. In some of these patients, WNV was detected up to nine years after acute infection. Similarly, avian kidneys have been found to persistently harbor WNV after natural and experimental infection. WNV, though typically considered a neurotropic virus, also has significant renal tropism that contributes to pathogenesis in humans, and possibly avian hosts. The degree to which renal infection impacts the health of naturally infected hosts, including humans and birds remains to be fully described.
