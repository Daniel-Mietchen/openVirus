<p>Blood samples collected from patients, students, and primates were centrifuged and stored at −20°C until tested for antibody. Samples were tested for CHIKV by immunoglobulin (Ig)M antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). A differential diagnosis of CHIKV infection among other arboviruses such as yellow fever virus, dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which are endemic in the study area, was also performed by IgM antibody-capture ELISA. Monkey serum samples were analyzed for specific CHIKV-neutralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) as described by De Madrid and Porterfield [
