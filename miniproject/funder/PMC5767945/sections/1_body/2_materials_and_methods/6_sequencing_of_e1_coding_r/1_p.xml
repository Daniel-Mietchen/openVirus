<p>The whole genome of CHIKV strains was initially amplified using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), following the strategy reported by Volk et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Due to the extremely low level of variation in initially assessed genome sequence (data not shown), only the region that corresponded to the E1 envelope glycoprotein gene was subjected to further sequencing and analyses [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Primer sequences and specific PCR and sequencing protocols are available from the authors.
