<p>The study focused on 3 species of monkeys in the Kedougou area that are considered potential reservoirs of arboviruses: African green monkeys ([AGMs] 
 <italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic>), Patas monkeys (
 <italic>Erythrocebus patas</italic> [EP]), and Guinea baboons (
 <italic>Papio papio</italic> [PP]). Monkey blood sampling was conducted during the dry season (January–May 2010) around temporary ponds around the villages of Silling, Bafoundou, and Ngari-Sekoto (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The monkeys were trapped in large cages baited with peanuts and anaesthetized with ketamine. Five milliliters of blood was collected and centrifuged, and the serum fraction was collected and stored at −20°C or −80°C until tested for antibody as described below. The capture date, location, age, sex, and weight for each captured monkey were systematically recorded.
