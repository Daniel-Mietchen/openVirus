<p>Four primary schools in Kedougou Department were selected for active surveillance including the Ninefesha, Bandafassi, and Ngari primary schools and the Catholic Mission School with some boarding residents as well as daily attendees (students from villages around Kedougou city). Serum samples were obtained from students each year before and after the rainy season (May and November) and tested for arboviruses of interest in the region including CHIKV antibody testing. In addition, schools were visited twice a week to identify students reaching criteria for the “suspect case” definition. Students not attending during the weekly visit at school were visited in their household to check whether they even met the “suspect case” definition. Suspect students cases were sent to the health center involved in the study to perform a blood sample for CHIKV virological diagnostic testing.</p>
