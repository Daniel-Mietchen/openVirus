<p>Genome sequences representing the spatiotemporal distribution of CHIKV were downloaded from GenBank and aligned using MUSCLE [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and manually adjusted in Se-Al (available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seal/</ext-link>) according to amino acid sequence homology. The E1 region was then excised and combined with the 34 newly generated CHIKV E1 sequences, leading to a final data set containing 103 sequences and 1317 nucleotides. A maximum likelihood tree was then inferred using the PAUP v4.0b package [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], based on the best-fit nucleotide substitution model determined by MODELTEST [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The database and operation script is available upon request from the authors.
