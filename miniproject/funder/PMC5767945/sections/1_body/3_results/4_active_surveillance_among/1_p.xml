<p>A total of 866 students were investigated for CHIKV circulation in May and November 2009 in 4 schools. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgM was performed on all sera collected. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> shows that no evidence of recent CHIKV infection was detected in May. However, ELISA IgM performed on sera collected from the same children in November 2009 showed that 25 were positive for CHIKV in Bandafassi, Ninefesha, and Catholic Mission schools with infection rates of 4% (7 of 171), 8% (15 of 180), and 0.6% (3 of 464), respectively. The infection rates were significantly different among the schools (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .000003; Fisher’s exact test). However, in Bandafassi and Ninefesha schools, the infection rate was statistically similar (
 <italic>P</italic> = .12; Fisher’s exact test). Between November 2009 and May 2010, a total of 65 suspected students were followed. However, none was positive for CHIKV test.
