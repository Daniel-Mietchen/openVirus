<p>The median age of infected patients was 24 years (7â€“55), the sex ratio male/female was 1. Adult individuals, especially those between 31 and 45 years old, were significantly more affected than others. However, there was no significant difference between sexes (

Among the CHIKV-infected confirmed cases, 20% (4 of 20) were diagnosed with malaria coinfection and presented with all the previously described symptoms except rash. Diarrhea and vomiting were more common in malaria coinfection (33% and 50%, respectively) than in the sole CHIKV infection with no evidence of active malaria (6% and 25%) (
