<p>One thousand four hundred nine suspect cases of CHIKV were evaluated from 5 healthcare facilities in Kedougou between May 2009 and March 2010 and tested for evidence of acute CHIKV infection using virus isolation, viral genome, or IgM antibody detection. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the distribution of findings relating to human sera collected, 50.4% of which were negative for active malaria parasitemia. Overall, evidence for CHIKV infection was observed in 1.4% (20 of 1409) of patients including 6 patients who tested positive for CHIKV-specific IgM antibody (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Among the 1409 human sera sampled, 144 were referred to acute stage injury (&lt;5 days of illness) and subsequently tested for CHIKV detection or for viral genetic material evidence. Hence, CHIKV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected by rPCR in 9.7% (14 of 144) of patients. Of note, the majority of CHIKV-confirmed cases based on the detection of virus or viral RNA from acute sera (9 of 14; 64 %) were recruited from the Kedougou healthcare center (
