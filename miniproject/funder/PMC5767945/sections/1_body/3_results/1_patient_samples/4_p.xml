In November 2009, the number of CHIKV-infected confirmed cases peaked in the first week 1 (6 cases), and then declined gradually by half (3 cases per week) at weeks 2 and 3, and finally dropped to 1 case at week 4 of November 2009. No case was detected between December 2009 and February 2010. In March 2010, 1 more confirmed CHIKV case was detected during the relating second week (
