<p>One hundred seventeen monkeys including 77 PP, 33 
 <italic>Chlorocebus sabaeus</italic> (AGM), and 7 EP were sampled from March to May 2010 in Silly, Ngari, and Bafoundou (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). No IgM antibody-positive animals were detected, but CHIKV-neutralizing antibodies were found by PRNT in 87% (66 of 76) of PP, 75% (25 of 33) of AGM, and 71% (5 of 7) of EP; 34% of infant and juvenile primates had neutralizing antibodies. Chikungunya virus seroprevalences did not differ significantly among the 3 primates species (
