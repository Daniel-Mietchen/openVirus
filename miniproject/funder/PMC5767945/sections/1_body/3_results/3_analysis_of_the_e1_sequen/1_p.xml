<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, all of our samples from 2009, including those from both mosquitoes and patients, were closely related to each other. All were within the West-Africa lineage, with a closest neighbor from Senegal in 2005. All of the CHIKV strains had an alanine residue at E1 position 226, consistent with enzootic strains rather than the recent strains responsible of Asian or South American epidemics.
