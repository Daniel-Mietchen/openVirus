<p>Our finding of equal prevalence of CHIKV infection between the genders and the age groups is also consistent with a rural outbreak of CHIKV that occurred in Cameroon [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast to studies carried out in Nigeria in the 1960sâ€“1970s, where children from 1 to 4 years of age were significantly more infected [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], all age groups were found to be to be susceptible for infection with CHIKV. Distinctly, an exception for children under 4 years was noteworthy, suggesting that little or no domestic transmission of CHIKV occurred during this outbreak. Indeed, children younger than 4 years of age tend to remain in the household, unlike adults and schoolchildren (7 years old and older) whose activities (agriculture, traditional gold extraction) and daily school attendance from remote villages expose them to forests and forest-living mosquitoes.
