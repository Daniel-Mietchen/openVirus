<p>As shown in our phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), the CHIKV strains isolated from patients in Kedougou in 2009 clustered in the West African genotype and were closely related to previous isolates from Senegal, suggesting continuous circulation of CHIKV in rural or sporadic local transmission of the virus. The isolates sequenced exhibited an alanine at amino acid residue 226 of the E1 envelope glycoprotein. Previous studies have demonstrated that a substitution of valine (A226V) provides a selective advantage for the replication and transmission of CHIKV by 
 <italic>A albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, no 
 <italic>A albopictus</italic> was detected so far in the study area, in Senegal and in turn in West Africa. Our phylogenetic data supported by the sylvatic amplification of CHIKV described by Diallo et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], are similar to previously studies based on DENV, which suggest that sylvatic cycle is a natural source of emergence [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
