<p>Our data also showed low CHIKV incidence rates (0.55–9.38/1000), in comparison with those reported from Kaffrine (with an incidence rate of 35.3%), Senegal in 1996–1997 [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and on the Maldive islands (65.2/1000) [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This observation may be explained by the low density of the human population in Kedougou, which is 8 people/km
 <sup>2</sup> and probably not sufficient for human-mosquito-human CHIKV transmission. Previous studies showed that human population densities of approximately 3000–7000/km
 <sup>2</sup> are needed to produce CHIKV outbreaks [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is also likely that only severe cases attend healthcare centers and clinics, and the asymptomatic forms of the disease—which is believed to be a vast majority of cases—were missed by the recruitment process used in this investigation.
