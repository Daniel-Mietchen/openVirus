<p>Chikungunya virus is a re-emerging mosquito-borne viral infection. In the Kedougou region, Southeastern Senegal, several epizootics of CHIKV have been reported at intervals of approximately 5 years since 1972, but little information is available on the impact of CHIKV among human populations and mechanisms involved in its emergence. In the present study, we reported a sylvatic outbreak of CHIKV in the Kedougou region that was evidenced from patients recruited in 5 health facilities and among a prospective cohort of living locally students.</p>
