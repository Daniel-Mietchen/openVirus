<p>The sylvatic CHIKV cycle in Senegal is believed to be maintained through the nonhuman primates. We found evidence for past CHIKV infection in 3 monkey species collected between March and May 2010. Although sampling of primates occurred after our studies of humans and mosquitoes (May 2009 to March 2010), the detection of CHIKV-neutralizing antibodies among infant primates strongly suggest that they were probably infected recently during the sylvatic amplification between May and November 2009. Previous studies have shown that the turnover of monkey populations is necessary for the emergence of arboviruses [
