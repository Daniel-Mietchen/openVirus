<p>Among the cohort of schoolchildren, 25 seroconverted for CHIKV IgM antibody in Bandafassi, Ninefesha, and Catholic Mission schools between May and November 2009, suggesting that CHIKV circulated during the rainy season. The infection rate was observed in students of Ninefecha and Bandafassi schools, which are located in the forest area. In addition, the confirmed CHIKV cases belonging to the Catholic Mission School (located in Kedougou city) were students who returned to their villages during week ends and holidays. Overall, the exposure of these students to CHIKV could be explained by their proximity to the forest environment, which could facilitate contact with CHIKV-infected mosquito vectors. This explanation is further strengthened by the level of difference for infection rates between the student cohort (2.88%) and the framework of the local healthcare facilities (1.42%). Furthermore, up to 36% of the CHIKV patients found in the Kedougou area were evidenced with a history of recent travel to forested areas.</p>
