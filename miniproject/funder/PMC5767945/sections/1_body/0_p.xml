<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the Semliki Forest virus antigenic group of the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> (family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) and was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This arthtrogenic virus is composed of 2 lineages: African and Asiatic. When symptomatic, cute CHIKV infection in human can cause a flu-like syndrome with rash, but joint pains are the dominant complaint and might evolve to persistent and incapacitating manifestations. In Africa, CHIKV is maintained in nature among nonhuman primates and forest-dwelling 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> sp. In rural areas, these sylvatic vectors can be responsible for sporadic cases or small outbreaks [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In urban areas, CHIKV is transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several studies have reported CHIKV circulation in West Africa, especially in Nigeria between 1963 and 1977 [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Major CHIKV epidemics were recently reported in Africa and Asia [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A significant outbreak occurred in Italy in 2007, and numerous imported cases have been detected elsewhere in Europe and the United States of America [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9â€“13</xref>], emphasizing CHIKV as a re-emerging public health threat worldwide.
