<p>In conclusion, the present study highlights the importance of surveillance including clinical observations, laboratory diagnosis, and cohort serosurveillance to detect outbreaks caused by CHIKV and other arboviruses in the Kedougou region. The combination of serological and molecular tests identified an epidemic of CHIKV in Kedougou after an amplification from the sylvatic cycle that would otherwise have been overlooked. Our results support the hypothesis that sylvatic enzootic circulation can be a source of emergence of CHIKV into domestic or urban transmission cycles and underscore the value of effective, real-time surveillance to improve the detection and prevention of arboviral diseases.</p>
