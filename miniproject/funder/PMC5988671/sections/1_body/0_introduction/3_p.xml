 </sup>. Unfortunately, immunogenicity in maternal sera and the pattern of immune responses against EV-D68 have not been well studied in mainland China. Further study is necessary to understand the distribution of immunogenicity against EV-D68 infection. To investigate the seroprevalence of EV-D68 infection in Jiangsu province, China, we conducted a cross-sectional study. Trans-placental serum from prenatal women and serum from their neonates were collected and analyzed to identify the age-specific seroprevalence rate of EV-D68 infections in infants/children (ages 1 month to 15 years). All serum samples were collected in August 2010 in Donghai County in Jiangsu Province, China
