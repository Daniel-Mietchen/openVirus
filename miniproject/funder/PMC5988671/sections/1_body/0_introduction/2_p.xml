<p id="Par3">EV-D68 was first isolated in California from children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in 1962

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Since then, EV-D68 infections have been identified only sporadically around the world. For example, there were only 26 cases of documented EV-D68 respiratory disease in the United States from 1970 to 2005

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>, resulting in strong public attention toward this virus. During August 2006–April 2010 in Beijing, China, coxsackievirus A21 and enterovirus 68 were detected in enterovirus-positive adults with acute respiratory tract infections, and the EV-D68 positive rate was 10% (13/130)

 </sup>. EV-D68 was also reported in other areas of China
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. EV-D68 infection was predominantly found in pediatric patients and caused a wide range of symptoms: fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough, skin rash, and body/muscle aches. It could lead to severe acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), pneumonia, neurological illness, acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), or even death
