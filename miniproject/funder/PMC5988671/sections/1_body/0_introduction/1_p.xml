 </sup>. EV-D68 belongs to enterovirus D. As a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, EV-D68 has a genome that contains a single open reading frame coding for a poly-protein (P1), the precursor of four viral capsid proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, and seven non-structural proteins, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D. VP1 and VP3 are the major antigenic epitopes
