<p id="Par16">As the neonates grew (from 0 to 8 months), the NtAbs seroprevalence and GMT decreased gradually. For the 8-month-old to 12-month-old infants, the GMT increased slowly while the seroprevalence decreased further. This inverse pattern of GMT and seroprevalence was caused by the decrease of maternally derived antibodies being partially offset by the acquired antibodies from infection. Our research showed that early infection might begin at 8 months in infants. The same pattern was also reported in another EV-D68 NtAb study for 6-month-old to 35-month-old infants, who were previously enrolled in a clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity of an enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) vaccine in Jiangsu Province (clinical trial No. NCT01508247) and who were included in a two-year follow-up study (January 2012â€“January 2014) in our laboratory. The lowest GMT was also found among 4-month-old to 8-month-old infants
