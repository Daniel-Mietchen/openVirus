 </sup>. The weakened rate in neonates was different in different regions because of the different levels of infection rates and titers. For example, based on epidemiology and the weakened rates of maternal antibodies, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that 2, 9, and 12 months are the appropriate prime time-points for immunizations of polio, measles, and hepatitis A virus vaccines, respectively. For HEV-A species, the maternal anti-EV71 and anti-CVA16 antibodies were evaluated

However, there have been no studies on mothers and their neonates regarding anti-EV-D68 antibodies. In our study, we described the maternally derived EV-D68 NtAbs in mothers and neonates. The GMT results demonstrated that newborn babies could obtain a high proportion and titer of EV-D68 NtAbs from their mothers. The situation was different for EV71 and CVA16. The GMTs of anti-EV-D68, anti-EV71, and anti-CVA16 were 162.3, 20.0, and 4.6 in neonates, respectively
