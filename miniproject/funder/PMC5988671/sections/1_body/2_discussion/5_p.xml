<p id="Par17">The titer distribution of these infants showed that the lowest NtAb titers were 80% negative and 100% lower than 1:64 in 6-month-old to 12-month-old infants. For children 1 year old and older, the NtAb indexes increased as the children grew older. Therefore, infants 6 months old and older should be treated as a susceptible population. Because of the declining protection from maternally derived antibodies, the risk of infection increases at this age with increasing exposure to crowds. A study in mainland China also showed that the infection primarily occurred among pre-school and school-aged children. In that study, GMTs were higher in the group aged 6.1–15 years old than in the group aged 0.5–6 years

 </sup>. Our study had similar results. Most 2-year-old to 5-year-old children received pre-school education in kindergarten and showed a high seroprevalence rate of 44% and GMTs of 24.7. This finding was further supported by the high incidence of EV-D68 in pre-school children who were younger than 5 years. Hence, strengthening health improvement measures in kindergartens is necessary to effectively prevent infection. As the children grew, the seroprevalence rate increased to 83% and the GMT increased to 71.9 for 6-year-old to 15-year-old children (school-aged children). Such data demonstrate that immunity against EV-D68 was relatively high in children at this age, suggesting that EV-D68 infection was highly prevalent in this age group. The above results show that EV-D68 infection was age-dependent and that there might be multiple infections during the period of 6-year-old to 15-year-old.
