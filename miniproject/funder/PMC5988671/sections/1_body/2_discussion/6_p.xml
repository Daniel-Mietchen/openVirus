<p id="Par18">In summary, this study demonstrated that a high level of maternal antibodies against EV-D68 was common in infants in China. From neonates to juveniles, the maternal antibodies decreased, but acquired antibodies from infection increased gradually. The lowest NtAb level of EV-D68 was found in 6-month-old to 12-month-old infants. Therefore, an early infection might occur in infants older than 8 months. A prime immunization course for vaccination must be established that can help protect this susceptible population. Because research on EV-D68 is limited in mainland China, surveillance on EV-D68 must be strengthened, and further study on EV-D68 virological characteristics, diagnostic method and vaccine development are necessary.</p>
