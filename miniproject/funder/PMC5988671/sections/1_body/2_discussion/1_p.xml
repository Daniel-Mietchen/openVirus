 </sup>.To analyze EV-D68 NtAbs for mothers, infants and children in China, the epidemic strain of China (KP240936, Beijing-R0132) was developed via reverse genetics, and the prototype strain (AY426531, Fermon) was purchased from ATCC. Our research showed that adult serum had higher NtAb GMTs against the synthetic strain than against the Fermon strain (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0378), although there was a high correlation between the two strains (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.444,). Therefore, the synthetic strain was chosen as the challenge strain for the NtAb assay in this study.
