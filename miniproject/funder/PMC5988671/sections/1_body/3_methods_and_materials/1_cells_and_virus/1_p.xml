<p id="Par19">The EV-D68 prototype strain, Fermon (GenBank accession no.AY426531), was purchased from ATCC. The complete genome (GenBank accession no.KP240936, Beijing-R0132) was constructed under the pBluescriptII SK-vector (Tai he gene, Beijing, China). 5′UTR and 3′UTR were added to the T7 promoter of the ribozyme and the T7 terminator, respectively. The RNA polymerase gene sequence was constructed under the CMV promoter (pcDNA6.1 vector). The virus was grown in the monolayer Rhuman Embryonic Kidney (293T cells) and loaded in a 6-well plate (Corning) with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Lipo 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) was used to co-transfect 293T cells with a plasmid of the synthetic genome and the RNA polymerase gene according to the manufacturer’s procedure. The resulting cells were cultured for 3–4 days before the cell suspensions were harvested. The collected cells were frozen and thawed 3 times, and the genomes were collected with centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting viral genomes were mixed with a monolayer of human rhabdomyoma cells (RD cells) with DMEM in 2% FBS. The synthetic virus was harvested, and the tissue culture infective dose of 50% (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined.
