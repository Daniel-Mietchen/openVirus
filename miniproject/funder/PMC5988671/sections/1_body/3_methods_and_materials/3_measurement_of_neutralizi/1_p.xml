 </sup>. EV-D68 NtAbs were detected in this study based on this previously reported method. Briefly, blood samples were diluted to a ratio of 1:8 and then inactivated at 56 ℃ for 30 min. The inactivated serum was serially diluted from 1:8 to 1:1024 and placed in a 96-microtiter plate. After 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of EV-D68 was added to the above plate, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 33 °C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator to allow the antibodies to bind to the virus. After the incubation, the RD cell suspension (2–3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>cells/ml) was added. The cell control, serum control, virus control and virus back titration (if the result of the back drop was 32~320 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/well, the test was considered a success) were included in each plate, and the plate was placed in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 33 °C for 7 days. Cytopathogenicity was observed using microscopy to identify the titers of NtAbs, defined as the inhibition of 50% CPE.
