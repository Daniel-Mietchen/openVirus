<p id="Par12">The overall seroprevalence rate of anti-EV-D68 antibodies was 59% (228/385, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For the four age groups in this study (1 to 5 months old, 6 months to 1 year old, 2 to 5 years old, and 6 to 11 years old), the seroprevalence rates were 79% (96/121), 20% (33/109), 44% (34/77), and 83% (65/78), respectively, whereas the GMTs were 25.2 (21.0–30.2), 15.0 (12.0–19.0), 24.7(17.15–35.6), and 71.9(50.8–101.8), respectively. The seroprevalence rates and GMTs of anti-EV-D68 antibodies were lower in the 6-month-old to 12-month-old infants than in the other age groups. The seroprevalence rates and GMTs of anti-EV-D68 antibodies in the 6-year-old to 15-year-old children were higher than those in 1-year-old to 5-year-old children.
