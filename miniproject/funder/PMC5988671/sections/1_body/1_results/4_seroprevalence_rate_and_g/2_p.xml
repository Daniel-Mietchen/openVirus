<p id="Par11">To further understand the NtAbs against EV-D68 in those newborns and children, the seroprevalence rates and GMTs (positive serum) were calculated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). The seroprevalence rates of EV-D68 (NtAb ≥ 1:8) gradually decreased from 100% for newborns to 10% for infants younger than 1 year old (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The seroprevalence rates gradually increased from 10% for children 1 year old to 92% for children 11 to 15 years old (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Similar to the seroprevalence rates, the GMTs also followed the same trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), with 8-month-old infants having the lowest GMT. The GMTs decreased gradually from 162.3 for newborns (95 CI: 89.9–293.1) to 10.1 for 8-month-old infants (95 CI: 8.3–12.3). Then, the GMTs increased gradually from 10.1 for 8-month-old infants (95 CI: 8.3–12.3) to 126.0 for 11-year-old to 15-year-old children (95 CI: 78.0–203.6). Since the NtAb trend was slightly different for 8-month-old to 12-month-old infants, EV-D68 infection might occur in infants older than 8 months.
