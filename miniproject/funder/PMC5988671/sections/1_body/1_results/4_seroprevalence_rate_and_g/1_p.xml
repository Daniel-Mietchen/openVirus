<p id="Par10">To understand the EV-D68 NtAbs distribution among newborns and juveniles, 16 cross-sectional serum samples from children ranging in age from 1 month to 11 to 15 years old were collected and detected against the synthetic viruses. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows that the titers were negatively correlated with age among neonates younger than 1 year old. The titers were positively correlated with age among children 1 to 15 years old, reaching a peak for 11-year-old to 15-year-old children, although that value remained lower than that of the neonates. The NtAbs titer was below 1:64 for all infants 6 months to 1 year old, making those infants susceptible to EV-D68 infection. For the 11-year-old to 15-year-old children, the NtAbs titers were even higher than 1:512, which may be caused by super-infection in this age group.
