<p id="Par7">The difference between NtAbs assays using the synthetic virus strain and the Fermon strain was investigated. The EV-D68 NtAbs for 50 healthy adult sera were measured using both the synthetic virus strain and the Fermon strain. The results showed that a 100% seroprevalence rate (50/50) was found for both challenge viruses. The NtAbs GMTs were 166.3 (95% CI 126.8–218.0) and 88.6 (95% CI 61.9–128.3) against the synthetic virus strain and the Fermon strain, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The synthetic virus strain from China showed higher NtAbs GMTs than the Fermon strain from America (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0378), which was in accordance with the epidemiology. The statistical analysis showed that there was good correlation between NtAb titers against the synthetic virus strain and against the Fermon strain (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.444) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Therefore, the synthetic virus was chosen as the challenge strain in the subsequent research.
