<p id="Par5">Reverse genetics was used to produce the EV-D68 virus. Two plasmids were transfected into 293T cells with Lipo 2000. After 3–4 days of incubation, the cells were frozen and thawed. The supernatant was harvested and used to infect the RD cells. The infected RD cells were cultured for five to seven days and periodically examined for viral cytopathogenic effect (CPE) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, b). The viruses were harvested from the cultured cells, and the tissue culture infective dose of 50% (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined. The virus titers of the synthetic virus and the Fermon strain were 10
 <sup>8</sup> and 10
 <sup>7.5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml, respectively. Western blotting showed that the prepared virus contained a special band of EV-D68 VP1 with the Fermon strain as the positive control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), indicating that the synthetic virus produced by the reverse genetics method could cause CPE in RD cells with high titers and could be used as a challenge virus in the EV-D68 NtAb assay.
