<p id="Par9">To further analyze the relationship of antibody titers between prenatal women and their neonates, we classified NtAbs titers into four groups: negative (&lt;8), low (8–64), moderate (96–512) and high (&gt;512). The percentages of infants in each group are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The results showed that the NtAbs titers of eight pairs (20%) of mothers and their neonates were in the range of 1:8 to 1:64, the NtAbs titers of 20 pairs (50%) were in the range of 1:96 to 1:512, and the NtAbs titers of four pairs (10%) were above 1:512. There was a positive correlation between EV-D68 NtAbs in neonates and those in their mothers (
