<p id="Par8">To determine the maternal antibodies, serum samples from 20 pairs of women and their neonates were collected. The EV-D68 NtAbs were tested using the synthetic viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The results showed that the seroprevalence rates of EV-D68 NtAbs were 100% (20/20) in both prenatal women and their neonates. The GMTs of EV-D68 NtAbs were 168.0 and 162.3 in prenatal women and their neonates, respectively. The GMT difference between prenatal women and their neonates was not statistically significant (
