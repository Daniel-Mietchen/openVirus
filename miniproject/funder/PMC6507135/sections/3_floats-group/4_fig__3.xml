  <p>Global network of ZIKAV research involving LAC-based authors. Country links were mapped based on the authors’ affiliations. Each node represents one country, and two countries were considered connected if their researchers shared the authorship of a paper. The thickness of links indicates the frequency of collaboration between two nodes. For visualization purposes, only LAC countries collaborations, among themselves or with other countries, are shown. Nodes are color-coded according to the authors’ continent</p>
