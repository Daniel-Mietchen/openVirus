  <p>Term map of ZIKAV research. The map shows 1219 terms extracted from titles and abstracts of all ZIKAV publications (Global dataset). The closer two terms are located to each other, the stronger their relation. Each term is represented by a circle. The diameter and label size are proportional to their frequency in titles or abstracts. Each term displayed occurred in at least five publications. 
   <bold>a</bold>) Colors indicate clusters of terms that have co-occurred more frequently in the dataset.
