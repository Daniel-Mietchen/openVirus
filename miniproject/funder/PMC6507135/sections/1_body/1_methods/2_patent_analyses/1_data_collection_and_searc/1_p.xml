<p id="Par24">Patent searches were carried out using Orbit Intelligence (Questel) and Derwent Innovation (Clarivate) commercial databases, between March and August 2018. The search strategy focused on patent applications that had the earliest priority date up to 12/31/2017 filed anywhere in the world. The search included all documents containing “zika OR zikav OR zikv” in their title, abstract or claims. Results from Derwent Innovation were integrated into Orbit Intelligence. An additional file provides the raw dataset retrieved (see Additional file
