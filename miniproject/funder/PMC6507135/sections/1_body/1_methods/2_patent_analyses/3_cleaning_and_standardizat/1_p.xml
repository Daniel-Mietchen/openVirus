<p id="Par26">Patent families were manually reviewed to exclude inventions outside the search scope or not showing experimental evidence related to ZIKAV. Patent assignee names were standardized using Orbit Intelligence grouping functionality. Alternative spellings and subsidiaries were grouped under a single name. Further manual cleaning was conducted to include the research institution’s name when other bodies (i.e., the university’s funding agency, the board of regents or technology transfer office) appeared as the patent assignee.</p>
