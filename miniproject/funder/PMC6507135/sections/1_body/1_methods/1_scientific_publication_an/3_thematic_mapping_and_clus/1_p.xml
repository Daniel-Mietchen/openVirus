<p id="Par21">A combined approach of mapping and clustering was used to provide an overview of research themes present in the Global dataset. Term maps were constructed using the visualization of similarities mapping technique available on the VOSviewer software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], using the “association strength” measure as proposed by Van Eck and Waltman [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In summary, two terms are deemed to be strongly related if they frequently co-occur in publications. In the map, each term is represented by a circle, and the closer they are positioned, the more related they are. The diameter and label size of each circle indicate the number of occurrences of the corresponding term in the title or abstract of publications. A weighted and parameterized variant of modularity-based clustering is used by the software to identify clusters of related terms [
