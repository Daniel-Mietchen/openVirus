<p id="Par55">The markedly collaborative context in which ZIKAV scientific knowledge was generated was evidenced by the co-authorship network analyses. Indeed, several incentives to facilitate multidisciplinary research collaborations were set after the LAC epidemics, such as virtual databases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], among others. The multidisciplinary collaborative work was crucial to characterize the ZIKAV syndrome, in one of the most rapid and coordinated research responses against an emerging disease to date [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In opposition, limited collaboration was evidenced in the patent analyses. However, given the lag time prior to the publication of patent applications, it is possible that the influence of research collaboration will only be observed in the next years.
