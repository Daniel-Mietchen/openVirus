<p id="Par58">This study focused on publications and patents, and it may not include all contributions of LAC countries towards ZIKAV prevention, treatment, and control. However, the S&amp;T indicators described herein are considered valuable tools in policy studies as they objectively assess the diffusion and impact of research, and disclose the geographic origin of the contribution. The use of co-authorship data as an indicator of scientific collaboration has limitations, but, in most cases, it indicates active cooperation in addition to the simple exchange of material or information. We recognize that reviewing only patents with experimental evidence could have resulted in an underestimation of the number of ZIKAV patents filed. We believe that the inclusion of all patent documents regardless of experimental evidence would have produced disputed results.</p>
