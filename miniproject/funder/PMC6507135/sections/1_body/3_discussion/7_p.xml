<p id="Par54">Brazil also stands out as the main country of protection for the patent families filed in national offices, a natural reflection of the 2015â€“2016 outbreak. Assignees usually file patents in strategic countries for their inventions, such as the most promising markets, economically important regions, the assignee home country or the home country of potential licensors. Still, almost half of ZIKAV patents were filed via simplified patent systems (the Patent Cooperation Treaty system or the European Patent Office), which offer additional time for assignees to decide in which countries to protect their inventions. Given that most of these patents were filed from 2016 onwards, it is still unknown where protection will be sought for this share of patent families.</p>
