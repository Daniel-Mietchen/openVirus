<p id="Par48">This study presents a comprehensive review of ZIKAV’s scientific knowledge production and potential technological development by combining the analyses of scientific publications, research networks, and patents. It gives an overview of the global S&amp;T response to ZIKAV infection with special emphasis on LAC countries. The LAC region was the most affected area in the last outbreak and the region is expected to face the greatest public health impacts from ZIKAV disease. The analysis of regional contributions is relevant not only to inform future research and guide investments, but also to assess LAC countries’ potential role in tackling global health threats imposed by emerging diseases [
