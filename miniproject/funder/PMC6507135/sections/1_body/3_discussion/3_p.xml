<p id="Par50">A reliable assessment of the LAC regionâ€™s scientific contributions in any given area is usually hindered by the use of international databases as unique sources of information [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The impact of excluding regional databases is exacerbated by the trend of LAC authors to publish in regional and local journals due to languages barriers and costs of international journals [

This indicated that an eventual bias due to low representation of regional articles was potentially reduced in this study. It seems that the global importance given to ZIKAV along with the high incidence of cases in LAC countries urged that knowledge produced regionally was made noticeable globally. Such global interest might also have influenced editorial decisions of international journals [
