<p id="Par59">We reviewed scientific publications, patent records, and co-authorship networks to provide a broad scenario of LAC engagement in research and technological development towards ZIKAV prevention, treatment, and control. The information presented herein has value in informing the global health community and policymakers that (i) LAC countries had a key role in generating and disseminating scientific knowledge on ZIKAV, suggesting a strong research capacity; (ii) LAC countries have expressively contributed to research on ZIKAV clinical manifestations, especially the ones related to effects on newborns; (iii) the Brazilian scientific community was potentially very effective in knowledge sharing and diffusion in the ZIKAV research network, indicating a solid capacity to incentivize and coordinate future LAC collaboration; (iv) Brazil was the single LAC country filing patents, mostly represented by independent inventors and low-tech patents, indicating the need to invest in more technologically advanced areas.</p>
