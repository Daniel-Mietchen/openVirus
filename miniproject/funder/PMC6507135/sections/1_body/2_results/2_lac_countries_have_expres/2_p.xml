<p id="Par36">Research areas targeted in LAC publications (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) and research areas of other countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) are depicted as overlay visualizations of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a. In these maps, blue represents a lower score, green an average, and red a higher score of occurrence of a term in publications in relation to the global average. LAC-based scientists have contributed more than the world average to research on “clinical manifestations”, particularly the ones related to effects on newborns. Researchers from other countries mostly contributed to “basic biomedical science” research, particularly cell biology and immunology. “Vector control” was of common interest for both LAC countries and the rest of the world, although their collaboration focused on ZIKAV clinical manifestations (data not shown).
