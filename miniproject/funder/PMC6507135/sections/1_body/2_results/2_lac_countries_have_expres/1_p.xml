<p id="Par35">To identify the research areas in which LAC countries mostly contributed, a term map of all publications in the Global dataset was built (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Frequent terms appearing on titles and abstracts were automatically grouped and color-coded into five broad research areas/clusters. Each cluster represents a research area, identified by ZIKAV-related terms. Starting from the bottom left (yellow cluster) and moving clockwise, these were: i) clinical manifestations (microcephaly, pregnancy, congenital zika syndrome, malformation, abnormality, rash); ii) public health control (pregnant woman, emergency, zika virus disease, community, travel); iii) vector control (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, species, agent, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>); iv) basic biomedical science (cell, mouse, protein, antibody, structure, gene); v) diagnostics (assay, urine, serum, saliva, sensitivity, PCR).
