<p id="Par46">To characterize the inventions contemplated by ZIKAV patents, patent families were classified by technological area. Most patent families focused on diagnostic methods (30%), antiviral products (27%), and vaccine development (25%). A lower proportion of inventions (13%) focused on the disease vector. Further classification showed that most of these inventions were insecticides/repellents (53%) and devices for vector control (42%). The category “Other” (5%) included strategies for ZIKAV protein expression or antibody production, drug screening platforms, among others (Fig.
