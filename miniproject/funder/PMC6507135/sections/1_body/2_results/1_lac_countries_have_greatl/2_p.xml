<p id="Par32">To evaluate the international coverage of regionally indexed ZIKAV-related publications and control for potential biases in the assessment of LAC contributions, searches were also carried out in regional LAC databases. The search in the regional databases retrieved 193 records from SciELO and 157 from LILACS. After treatment and processing, 237 unique publications were identified (Regional dataset). There was an overlap of 48% between the two databases; 70% of the publications were also indexed in the international databases (see Additional file
