<p id="Par45">Assignees with four or more patent families are listed in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The best-ranked assignees were American (50%), Chinese (44%) and French (6%) institutions. Most of them (81%) were academic organizations. Brazilian assignees filed one patent family each and, therefore, did not appear in the rank.
