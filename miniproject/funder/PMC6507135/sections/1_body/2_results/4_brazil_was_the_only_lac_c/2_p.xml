<p id="Par40">To obtain a general portrait of the inventive activity related to ZIKAV, the number of patent families was plotted by their earliest priority year. In accordance with OECD’s recommendations, the earliest priority year (closest date to the invention) was selected as best indicator of inventive performance [

As patents are usually published 18 months after the earliest priority claimed, it is possible that data for 2017 is not complete. The number of patent families first filed in 2017 should grow considerably when patents filed during and immediately after the 2015–2016 outbreak are published.
