 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, not much is known about the potential S&amp;T contributions of LAC countries. It has been suggested that expanding the science, technology and innovation base in developing countries, as well as their insertion in research networks, would improve their response and preparedness to emerging health threats of global concern [
