  <title>Box 1. Open Science</title>
  <p>Various definitions of 
   <bold>open science</bold> converge on the concept of unlimited access to all aspects of research, to allow anyone to follow, use, and participate in science. 
   <bold>Open science</bold> comprises a growing list of other “opens,” such as 
   <bold>open access</bold> (scholarly literature not only is freely available online but may be reproduced, distributed, and otherwise reused by others, typically according to the terms of a public copyright license that accompanies the article); 
   <bold>open data</bold> (data, including data underlying publications, are freely available online and may be used and shared); and 
   <bold>open source</bold> (software is freely available and may be modified and distributed) [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sometimes, scientific products meet criteria for open access, open data, or open source after some time has elapsed since their production (e.g., “delayed open access” journals make content available only to subscribers initially and then make it open access later, typically after 1–2 years). An expansive version of open science is 
   <bold>open notebook science</bold>, in which the entire primary record of research, including the researcher’s personal or laboratory notebook, is freely available online as it is recorded [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 
   <bold>Open government</bold> aims to improve citizens’ access to government data and proceedings [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and advances open science, especially for government-funded research.
