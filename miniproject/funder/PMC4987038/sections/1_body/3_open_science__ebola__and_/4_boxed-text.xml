  <title>Box 2. Examples of Increasing Openness in Health Sciences</title>
  <p>Funding agencies: Major research sponsors have implemented policies that encourage or require data sharing. In 2003, the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) began requiring a data-sharing plan for grant applications with annual costs over US$500,000; a 2013 national survey found that 65% of life science researchers thought the NIH policies had been influential in increasing data sharing [

   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], more recently requiring grantees to include a data release plan [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, beginning in 2017, will require peer-reviewed publications and underlying data to be open immediately on publication [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Open government initiatives [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] are increasing public access to government-held data, including data collected in scientific research.

  <p>Scientific journals: The proportion of articles indexed in PubMed that were freely available online within about a year of publication nearly doubled from 2006 to 2010, from 26% to 50% [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A search of the Scopus database in April 2014 estimated that 71% of biomedical research papers published during 2011â€“2013 were freely available online (though only about a quarter of these were made available immediately on publication by the publisher or author) [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At the same time, several prominent journals now encourage data sharing and require a statement about data accessibility [
   <xref rid="pmed.1002109.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; PLOS, beginning in 2014, required authors to make all underlying data publicly available on publication for its family of journals. In 2016, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) proposed the requirement that authors submitting clinical trial reports to ICMJE member journals make the deidentified individual patient data underlying the study available within 6 months of publication [

  </p>
  <p>Scientists: Some individual researchers and institutions have adopted nearly comprehensive openness. For example, to accelerate discovery in neuroscience, the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital of McGill University is beginning an unprecedented 5-year experiment in openness during which it will make all data and results freely available and will not seek patents [
