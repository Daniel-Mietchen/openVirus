<p>We describe the use of phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of BTV-8 virus samples, collected during the first and second European outbreaks, to gain insights into the mechanisms that allowed BTV-8 to re-emerge in France in 2015. For this, we generated a novel dataset of full genome sequences for more than 150 viruses sampled throughout both outbreaks.</p>
