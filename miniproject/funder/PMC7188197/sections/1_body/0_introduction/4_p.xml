<p>The source and mechanism of BTV-8 re-emergence in France remains obscure. Initial genetic data from one isolate suggested the re-emerging virus in France to be a close relative of the lineage causing the 2006â€“2010 outbreak [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The prevailing theory was that the virus had continued to be transmitted subclinically but remained unrecorded in livestock or wild ruminants after it had been declared absent from Europe in 2011 [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similarly, serological testing of cattle sampled in 2014 indicated a rapid decline of seropositivity after vaccination ceased in France in 2010, consistent with a new (re-)introduction of the virus in, or just before, 2015 [
