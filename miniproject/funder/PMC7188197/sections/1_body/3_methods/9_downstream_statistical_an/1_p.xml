<p>Observed genetic distances from the full ML tree and sampling date were combined in R. When the exact sampling date was unknown, if the day within the sampling month was unknown, the date was fixed to the 16th of the month, and when the month was unknown, the date was fixed to the midpoint of the year. General linear models in base R (glm function) were fitted to test if the evolutionary rate of the virus was the same between two outbreaks. The models used a gamma distribution with an identity link. The regression equation for the first model was as follows: Genetic distance from root ~ Date + Outbreak. The regression equation for the second model was as follows: Genetic distance from root ~ Date + Outbreak + Date:Outbreak. After no evidence was found of differential rates between the two outbreaks, the general linear model without the interaction was run in brms v. 2.10.0 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. A normal (0, 10) prior was placed over the intercept, standard normal priors were placed over all regression coefficients, and a gamma (0.01, 0.01) prior was placed over the shape parameter. The normalised rank of the evolutionary rate of the long branch was calculated as follows: for each tree in the posterior, ranking the estimated evolutionary rate of each branch from slowest to fastest, extracting the rank for the long branch, subtracting 1 so that the minimum was 0, then dividing by the number of branches minus 1, so that a number between 0 and 1 was generated.
