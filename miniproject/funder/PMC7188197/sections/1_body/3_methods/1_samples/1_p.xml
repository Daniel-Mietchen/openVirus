 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000673.s006">S1 Table</xref> provides the metadata related to the dataset used in this study. These include virus strain names, animal species of origin, geographical location, and date of sampling. In addition, metadata include whether the viral genome sequence was obtained directly from clinical material (blood) or from an isolate in tissue culture, sequencing methods, and GenBank accession numbers.
