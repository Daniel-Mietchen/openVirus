<p>A sequence showing evidence of mixed infection or contamination was discarded. Potential contamination and/or mixed infection were detected by finding sequences that met the following two criteria: (i) visible numbers of reads mapping to serotypes other than BTV-8 or the closely related BTV-18 in segments 2 and 6; and (ii) the presence of regions that, when aligned, showed large numbers of unique SNPs and ambiguous nucleotides. In total, 8 samples were discarded due to mixed infection with different BTV strains and/or contamination (7 samples form the first outbreak and 1 from the second). During quality control, segment 7 from the sample FRA2008-28 was also removed, as it represented an obvious reassortment from a distinct BTV strain, but the rest of the sample was preserved. We used GiRaF v. 1.02 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and MrBayes v 3.2.7a [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] on all the samples to test for the presence of less obvious reassortments between serotypes. Within the GiRaF algorithm, per-segment trees were run for 1,000,000 iterations, with 500,000 iterations discarded as burn-in. All other parameters were left at their default values. No reassortment was detected, so we opted to use all segments in a single concatenated phylogenetic tree. However, it should be noted that, as there is little variation in many segments, our ability to detect reassortment between two distinct but phylogenetically related strains is correspondingly low.
