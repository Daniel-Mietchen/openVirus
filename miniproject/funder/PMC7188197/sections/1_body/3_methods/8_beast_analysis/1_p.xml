<p>Using known break points, the sequence for each segment was split into the UTR and the first, second, and third codon positions of the coding sequence. In the ninth and tenth segments, there are regions with overlapping open reading frames; these were also placed together in their own partition. Separate evolutionary models, linked across segments, were applied to each of these partitions. The segments shared a lognormal relaxed molecular clock [

Given the difficulty, caused by combinatorial explosion, of model selection when there are multiple partitions, we performed a pre-analysis model selection protocol. Each segment was concatenated and a model was chosen for each partition using jModelTest v 2.1.10 [

The best model that was implemented in BEAST v. 1.10 was selected based on Akaike’s Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc). This was a GTR model for the first codon position, an HKY for the second, GTR+G with 4 gamma categories for the third, K80 for the UTR, and JC for the regions with overlapping ORFs. We used a GRMF skyride model for the tree prior [

When the sampling date was not exactly known, the age of the tip was estimated in the MCMC with a uniform prior over the period of uncertainty. This meant that the sampling date was correctly controlled for despite the observed discontinuity [

All priors were left at their default values except for the mean of the lognormal distribution for the relaxed molecular clock, which was given a lognormal (−7.6, 3) prior. In all cases, ambiguous nucleotides were used in the tree likelihood. Two trees were run, one containing only the sequences from the 2015 outbreak and one containing all sequences. The tree containing all sequences was used to reconstruct the sequence of the ancestor of all the viruses in the second outbreak. BEAST will reconstruct the sequence even in locations where the majority of sequences show gaps in the alignment. As such, there were three nucleotides that we removed from the final reconstructed sequence, corresponding to locations in the original multiple sequence alignment where all sequences but one had gaps. The BEAST XMLs for the two analyses described above are available as
