<p>Variants from the BTV-8 reference were then called from the Tanoti alignment with lofreq* v. 2.1.2 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], with the minimum coverage of the filtering step set to 5 and all other parameters at their default values. Any variants from the reference with an allele frequency of greater than 0.5 were replaced into their positions in the reference to build a new reference sequence. Reads were then remapped to this new reference. This process was then repeated either 5 times or until the reference generated after the process was identical to the reference at the start of the last round of mapping. Reads were then mapped again against this new reference, and ambiguities were called. A base was called unambiguously if the allele frequency of the dominant allele was greater than 0.75; otherwise, the base was called ambiguously over all alleles with a frequency of greater than 0.05 using a bespoke script in R (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000673.s001">S1 Data</xref>). For both of these consensus sequences, positions were masked with “N”s if the coverage at the site was less than 5 separate paired-end reads.
