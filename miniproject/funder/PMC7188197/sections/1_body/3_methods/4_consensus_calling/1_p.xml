<p>All consensus calling was performed on a cluster running Ubuntu v. 14.04.5 LTS. In all cases, BAM and SAM files were handled using samtools v. 1.3 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The R packages ggplot2 v. 3.2.1 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], seqinr v. 3.6â€“1 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], stringr v.1.4.0 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], and vcfR v. 1.8.0 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] were all used in scripts at various points in the following section. Paired-end raw reads were trimmed with Trim Galore! v. 0.4.0 (

Any reads below 50 bp were discarded. Following this, any reads that were unpaired were discarded if they were under 100 bp. Overlapping reads were combined using FLASH v. 1.2.11 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Reads were mapped using bowtie2 v. 2.3.4.2 [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] to a reference database containing all the segments of all the described strains of BTV in order to manually check for mixed infections. Reads were allowed to have as many valid maps as could be found. Mapping statistics were generated with weeSAM v. 1.5 (

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Separately, for the consensus generation, reads were mapped using Tanoti v. 9 July 2018 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vbsreenu/Tanoti/tree/master/src" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/vbsreenu/Tanoti/tree/master/src</ext-link>) against a reference BTV-8 genome from the European BTV-8 outbreak (GenBank accession numbers: JX680447-JX680456). Different software was used for the quality control and consensus building steps, as bowtie2 generates metadata required for the downstream quality control steps that Tanoti does not.
