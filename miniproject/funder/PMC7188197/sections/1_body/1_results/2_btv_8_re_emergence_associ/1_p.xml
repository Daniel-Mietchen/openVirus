<p>To test if the lower amount of divergence along the branch separating the two outbreaks was unusual, we estimated the evolutionary rate of BTV-8 from the set of 164 genomes. For this, we applied a lognormal relaxed clock model that allows for branch-specific heterogeneity in clock rates, implemented in the Bayesian phylogenetic software BEAST (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000673.g003">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000673.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). The mean evolutionary rate estimate was 4.04 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 3.37 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, 4.72 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), corresponding to an expected 7.76 substitutions per year (95% HPD: 6.47, 9.06) across the entire BTV-8 genome. In contrast, the emerging branch had an estimated mean evolutionary rate that was nearly an order of magnitude slower, at 8.24 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% HPD: 3.93 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, 1.32 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). Indeed, of the branches within the presented maximum clade credibility tree, this branch had the lowest median rate across the posterior distribution of trees.
