<p>Next, we included the reconstructed ancestral sequence in our dataset and re-estimated the ML tree to get measures of genetic distance from the root of the tree. Consistent with clock-like evolution, the genetic distance between virus sample and the root increased linearly with time during both the first (TempEst: slope = 7.2708 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> subs/site/year, r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8113) and the second outbreak (TempEst: slope = 6.9291 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9605). There was no evidence that the evolutionary rate of the virus differed between the two outbreaks (
 <italic>p</italic>-value for Date:Outbreak interaction = 0.194). However, there is a clear discontinuity in the accumulation of mutations between the two outbreaks, consistent with a period during which clock-like evolution had essentially ceased. Consequently, the reconstructed sequence of the ancestor of the second outbreak, when included in the ML tree, has an inferred distance from the tree root that is consistent with a virus from late March 2008, according to the root-to-tip regression (
