<p>We showed a large discontinuity in the number of mutations accumulated by BTV-8 between 2010 and 2015, even though the evolutionary rates of the virus during the first and second outbreak were indistinguishable and of the same order as rates reported in previous BTV studies [

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. If the virus had been replicating consistently in an undetected population from 2010 to 2015, we would expect the genetic distance of the isolates from the second European outbreak to continue the trend of increased divergence after the first outbreak. However, the sequences from the second outbreak exhibit genetic divergences that fall considerably below what would be expected if the trend line from the first outbreak was extended, illustrating a paucity of mutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000673.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Indeed, the divergence of the reconstructed ancestor of the second bluetongue outbreak is consistent with the virus stopping replication in March 2008. The lack of divergence is also illustrated by the fact that the reconstructed ancestor of the BTV-8 outbreak has only 7 mutations separating it from its closest relative in the analysed dataset, a French sample collected in August 2007 (BTV-8
 <sub>FRA2007-3673</sub>), despite putatively having been replicating for at least half a decade after that sample’s collection. In comparison, BTV-8
 <sub>FRA2007-3673</sub> showed 23 mutations compared to the genome of the earliest BTV-8 sample obtained from the Netherlands in August 2006, only a year earlier. The corresponding rate of evolution estimated for the emerging branch was almost an order of magnitude slower than the mean clock rate, highlighting it as exceptionally low (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000673.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Moreover, we hypothesise that some or all of the estimated seven mutations on this branch might have accumulated during the first outbreak, given that the emerging branch connects to an internal node in the timescaled phylogeny with a date of early 2007, at the height of the first outbreak. The subsequent accumulation of seven mutations is consistent with the idea that this virus continued to circulate until early 2008 (the inferred date from the root-to-tip regression) and then ceased to change altogether until its re-emergence in 2015. While previous studies have found apparent evolutionary stasis to be the result of mislabelling [
 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], this can be ruled out in our case due to the discontinuity applying to all samples from the second outbreak, not just a single isolate. Another hypothetical scenario could be envisaged if BTV-8 was to remain “latent” in midges’ eggs for a number of years. However, there is no evidence of vertical transmission in BTV-infected

 <xref rid="pbio.3000673.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This, in conjunction with the need for infected midge eggs to survive for years, rather than a single overwintering season, makes this scenario highly unlikely.
