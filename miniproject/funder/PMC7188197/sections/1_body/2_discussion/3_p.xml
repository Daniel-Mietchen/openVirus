<p>Given the unexpectedly low number of mutations observed between the two outbreaks, our data indicate that the common ancestor of the second European outbreak either ceased or dramatically slowed its replication in early 2008. This is inconsistent with current knowledge and paradigms of the biology of BTV and RNA viruses in general. For example, a potential explanation could be that BTV persistently infected a host for several (5 to 8) years, with little or no replication, before being reactivated and starting the second outbreak. While this may be possible with DNA viruses, or RNA viruses with a DNA intermediate [
