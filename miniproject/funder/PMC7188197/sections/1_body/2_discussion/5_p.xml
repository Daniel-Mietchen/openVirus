<p>Overall, we judge the possibility of persistence of BTV-8 in a mammalian or invertebrate host for longer than five years, in the absence of viral replication, followed by viral reactivation and subsequent onwards spread, to be unlikely given the current understanding of RNA virus biology. We hypothesise that accidental release of frozen material contaminated with BTV-8 could be the cause of the virus re-emergence in France in 2015. Anthropogenic causes of virus outbreaks have been described before. Accidental virus release is thought to have been responsible for the 1977 influenza A H1N1 outbreak, caused by a virus that closely matched a variant circulating in the 1950s [
