  <title>Emergence and re-emergence of BTV-8 in Europe.</title>
  <p>Location and number of premises housing livestock infected with BTV-8 collected from “immediate reports” to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health). Data were accessed from the WAHIS database on 12 July 2019. Immediate report data were provided by the OIE. Each point corresponds to one infected premise, with total counts for each year (
   <italic>n</italic>), with the first outbreak shown in purple and the second outbreak shown in orange. Please note that points on the maps reflect only immediate notification to the OIE, resulting in a smaller number than the totality of affected premises during the outbreaks. In addition, France is shaded in 2009 and 2018 as France stopped providing immediate reporting, requiring location data, to the OIE during those years. As such, the counts of infected premises from 2009 and 2018 are not comparable to previous years as they exclude France, where the virus was widespread. Data are available from the WAHIS database at
