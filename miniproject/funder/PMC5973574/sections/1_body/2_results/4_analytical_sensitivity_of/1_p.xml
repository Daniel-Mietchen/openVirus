<p>DENV1-4 RNA samples, previously quantified by qRT-PCR, were used to analyse the sensitivity of the developed RT-LAMP assays. RT-LAMP protocols for DENV1, DENV2 and DENV4 detected as few as 10 molecules per reaction, although this amount was only obtained in 3, 5 and 2 of 8 repetitions, respectively, with the following mean times: 28.8 ± 6.3 min (DENV1), 78.2 ± 5.8 min (DENV2) and 44.6 ± 3.3 min (DENV4). RT-LAMP for DENV3 detected as few as 10
 <sup>2</sup> molecules, but only in 4 of 8 reactions, at 44.9 ± 18.6 min. The lowest amount of molecules detected in the 8 reactions, showing 100% reproducibility, were 10
 <sup>2</sup> (DENV1, mean time of 25.3 ± 2.6 min), and 10
 <sup>3</sup> (DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4, mean times of 69.2 ± 11.6 min, 37.2 ± 11.6 min and 26.8 ± 2.7 min, respectively) (

Considering 8 independent reactions per protocol developed, the probit analysis revealed that the limit of detection at 95% probability for each RT-LAMP was 22 RNA molecules (DENV1), 542 RNA molecules with a confidence interval from 92 to 3.2x10
 <sup>13</sup> RNA molecules (DENV2), 197 RNA molecules (DENV3) and 641 RNA molecules with a confidence interval from 172 to 1.2x10
 <sup>5</sup> RNA molecules (DENV4).
