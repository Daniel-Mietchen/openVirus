 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006381.g003">Fig 3</xref> show the results of the cross-specificity and cross-detection tests. All DENV cell culture RNA extracts were detected and no amplification was observed in the NTC. The RT-LAMP protocols for DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4 were specific for each respective serotype. The RT-LAMP protocol for DENV1 detected all DENV1 RNA strains, but also scored positive in RNA extracts KDH0010A and VIMFH4 containing RNA extracts from DENV3 and DENV4 isolates, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006381.t001">Table 1</xref>). Additional testing of samples KDH0010A and VIMFH4 by nested RT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006381.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) indicated contamination of the cell cultures samples with DENV1 confirming the RT-LAMP results.
