<p>The 2015 DENV EQA panel analysis confirmed that the RT-LAMP assays developed passed 8 core and the 2 educational samples of that panel. Concerning the core samples, 5 positive samples were scored 3/3, and 1 positive sample was detected once (the other 2 samples were negative). Results obtained from the educational samples indicated that 1 sample was detected in the 3 repetitions whilst the other sample was detected in 1/3 repetitions.</p>
