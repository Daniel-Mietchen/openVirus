<p>When combining the amplicon primer sets for each RT-LAMP assay, amplification was not observed when using published standard LAMP primer concentrations for each primer set: 0.2 μM F3, 0.2 μM B3, 1.6 μM FIP, 1.6 μM BIP, 0.8 μM FLOOP and 0.8 μM BLOOP. To determine the concentration window of the complicated primer mix, a 2-fold dilution series of the above primer mix was used. Amplification yielding the best possible detection without amplification in the NTC was achieved at a dilution of 1:4 (50 nM F3, 50 nM B3, 400 nM FIP, 400 nM BIP, 200 nM FLOOP and 200 nM BLOOP,
