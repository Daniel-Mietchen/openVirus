 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006381.t003">Table 3</xref> summarises the results obtained with samples collected by the IPD and IPC. All 11 RNA samples from IPD used in this study were analysed in parallel by qRT-PCR and with DENV1 and DENV2 RT-LAMP assays. All scored positive in qRT-PCR (C
 <sub>T</sub> 25.89–38.48), 4 samples scored positive in the DENV1 RT-LAMP, and 7 scored positive in the DENV2 RT- LAMP (T
 <sub>T</sub> values 20–45 min). Samples 267175, 267197 and 267174 were serotyped as DENV1 with the developed RT-LAMP.
