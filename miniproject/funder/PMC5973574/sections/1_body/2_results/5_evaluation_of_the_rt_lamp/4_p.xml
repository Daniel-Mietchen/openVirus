<p>Five samples with initial T
 <sub>T</sub> values from 81–89 min, now tested positive with T
 <sub>T</sub> values from 55–77 min. Six samples initially negative by RT-LAMP became positive with T
 <sub>T</sub> values of 61.7–72.2 min. Three samples, 1 of which had scored positive in qRT-PCR, remained negative in RT-LAMP. Most RNA samples extracted with the optimized method scored positive in all 3 replicates. One sample was detected 2/3 times, and 2 were detected only once. All negative samples included in these analyses scored negative.
