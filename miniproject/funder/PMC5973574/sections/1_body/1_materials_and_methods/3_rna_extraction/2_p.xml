<p>RNA extraction of the clinical samples from Tanzania was initially performed from 50 μL whole blood using a trial version of a nucleic acid isolation system equivalent to the protocol established for the MagSi-gDNA blood kit (MagnaMedics, Geleen, The Netherlands). RNA was eluted in 190 μL elution buffer, and 5 μL per sample were used for each RT-LAMP reaction. Additionally, an improved trial version of the MagnaMedics system for nucleic acid isolation, starting from 100 μL whole blood and eluting the RNA in 100 μL elution buffer, using 5 μL per sample for each RT-LAMP reaction, was used. RNA was extracted from the clinical samples from Senegal using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit.</p>
