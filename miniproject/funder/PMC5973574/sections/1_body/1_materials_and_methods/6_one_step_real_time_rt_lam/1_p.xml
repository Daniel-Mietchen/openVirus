<p>RT-LAMP reactions were run at 64°C using either an ESE-Quant TubeScanner (QIAGEN Lake Constance GmbH, Stockach, Germany) or Genie II (Optigene, Horsham, UK), in a final reaction volume of 25 μL. The Genie II device displays the annealing curve for specificity after the reaction has finished, by melting curve analysis from 98°C to 80°C (0.05°C/s).</p>
