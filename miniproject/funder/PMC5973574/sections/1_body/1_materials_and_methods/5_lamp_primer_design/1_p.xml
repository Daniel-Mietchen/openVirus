<p>A two-step approach was used. First, all available sequences of DENV1 to 4 were downloaded from the NCBI database. Searches were limited to the samples collected between 2004 and 2014. All sequences were then aligned (for each serotype) using GramAlign v3.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and diversity was assessed using the 
 <italic>glPCA</italic> module of R/adegenet v1.4.1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Finally, based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and phylogenetic tree (Neighbor-Joining tree using the R/ape 3.2 package), the sequences were manually split into different clusters in order to maximise the region of sequence identity. LAMP DNA signatures for each cluster (and all combinations to minimise the number of primer sets) were designed using a modified version [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] applying the 
 <italic>loose</italic> parameters set for DENV1-3 and the 
 <italic>standard</italic> parameter set for DENV4. Full scripts and methods are available on GitHub at
