<p>Sensitivity analysis was performed in the ESE-Quant TubeScanner (QIAGEN). Ten-fold dilutions of viral DENV RNA samples (ATCC VR-344 (DENV1), ATCC VR-345 (DENV2), ATCC VR-1256 (DENV3) and ATCC VR-1257 (DENV4)), quantified by qRT-PCR, were used to analyse the sensitivity of the developed RT-LAMP assays (range from 10
 <sup>4</sup>−10
 <sup>5</sup> to 10 molecules/μL) and 1 μL per dilution was added to the RT-LAMP reaction. The complete RNA standard was tested in eight separate runs. The values obtained were subjected to probit analysis (Statgraphics plus v5.1, Statistical Graphics Corp., Princeton, NJ) and the limit of detection at 95% probability for each RT-LAMP assay was obtained.
