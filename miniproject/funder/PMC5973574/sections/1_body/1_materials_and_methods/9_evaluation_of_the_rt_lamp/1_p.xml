 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006381.t002">Table 2</xref>). Twenty-six samples had been confirmed as DENV2 positive by the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Basel, Switzerland) (2 of them were not tested by qRT-PCR). Aliquots of these blood samples were sent to MAST Diagnostica GmbH and stored at -20°C until RNA extraction was performed using the Magnamedics kit trial version. RNA samples were stored at -80°C. RT-LAMP reactions were run in the TubeScanner TS2 (QIAGEN), using 5 μL RNA of each sample per reaction.
