<p>Patient samples: We used RNA extracts of 31 blood samples collected during a fever study in Tanzania, 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006381.t002">Table 2</xref>) provided by the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, Switzerland. These samples included 24 DENV qRT-PCR positive, 2 DENV positive (not characterized by qRT-PCR) and 5 negative samples. In addition, a negative sample from MAST Diagnostica GmbH (Reinfeld, Germany) was included. RNA extracts of 11 DENV qRT-PCR serum samples from Senegal, Sudan and Mauritania collected in November-December 2014 by the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD), Senegal (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006381.t003">Table 3</xref>) were tested by qRT-PCR and LAMP in Dakar. Additionally serum samples from Cambodia collected through the National Dengue Surveillance System [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] were tested. RNA was extracted and air-dried using pre-dried RNAstable 1.5 mL microfuge tubes (Biomatrica, USA) from 13 DENV3 and 12 DENV4 samples, collected by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) in 2004–2006 and between 2008 and 2014, respectively. Samples were shipped at ambient temperature. Moreover, samples were tested by qRT-PCR before shipment and after receipt and reconstitution in molecular grade water. Overall the qRT-PCR C
 <sub>T</sub> deviation was in a range of 0.8 C
 <sub>T</sub>. Five μL RNA of each sample were used per reaction.
