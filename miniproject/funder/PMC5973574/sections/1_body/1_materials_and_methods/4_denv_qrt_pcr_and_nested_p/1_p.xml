<p>A DENV RNA standard was transcribed from the DENV 3’ UTR region, ligated into pCRII and evaluated as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. DEN FP and DEN P were as described with the probe now tagged 5’-FAM / BBQ-3’ but an adapted reverse primer DEN RP2 (5’-CTGHRGAGACAGCAGGATCTCTG-3’) as described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. DENV qRT-PCR was performed using the Light Cycler 480 Master Hydrolysis Probes (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in a 20-μL reaction volume containing 1x LightCycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis Probes, 3.25 mM activator Mn(OAc)
 <sub>2</sub>, 500 nM primers DEN FP and DEN RP2, 200 nM probe DEN P, and 1 μL RNA template on the LightCycler 2.0 (Roche), as follows: reverse transcription for 3 min at 63°C, activation for 30 s at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles consisting of amplification for 5 s at 95°C and 15 s at 60°C and a final cooling step of 40 s at 40°C. Analysis of the reactions was conducted using LightCycler software version 4.1.1.21 (Roche).
