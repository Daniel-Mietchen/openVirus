<p>To conclude, we have shown a novel approach to designing LAMP primers that makes use of fast growing sequence databases. During the study time the number of complete DENV genome entries grew by 932 genomes deposited. To be able to cover all of the diversity documented, our approach devised 4 complicated mixes of oligonucleotides for the detection of the individual DENV1-4 serotypes. The DENV1 and DENV2 assays were validated with viral RNA extracted clinical samples and showed very good performance parameters. Finally the combination of PCA analysis and molecular detection assays design should also be considered for other molecular assay formats since the available sequence dataset of several pathogens has increased beyond what can be handled by traditional design based on simple alignments.</p>
