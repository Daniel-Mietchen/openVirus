<p>We used predried tubes of RNAstable for shipment of DENV4 and DENV3 RNA extracts from Institut Pasteur du Cambodge. The efficiency of this type of shipment at ambient temperature was disappointing. Surprisingly DENV3 sample RNA extracts suffered most from this type of shipment and this could not be improved in altogether three shipment trials. The results for DENV4 samples indicate specific detection which does not quite match the qRT-PCR sensitivity. DENV3 samples were detectable but sensitivity could not be assessed.</p>
