<p>In some cases, there were disparate results between RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. Sample 1232, negative by RT-LAMP, had a C
 <sub>T</sub> value of 28.78, and samples 1241 and 1473, with C
 <sub>T</sub> values of 24.27 and 29.13, showed current mean T
 <sub>T</sub> values of 70 and 73.9 min, respectively. These differences in results observed may not be related to the sensitivity levels of the individual assay and we suggest that the performance of isothermal amplification reactions could be compromised when not using fresh samples, as previously described [
