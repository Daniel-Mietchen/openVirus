<p>All 11 serum samples collected by Institut Pasteur in Dakar (2014), tested positive by qRT-PCR and the DENV1 and DENV2 RT-LAMP assays. While 3 of the samples could not be characterised with the qRT-PCR protocol, they were successfully amplified by the DENV1 RT-LAMP, providing evidence that determination of serotype is possible when handling samples that have not been serotyped yet.</p>
