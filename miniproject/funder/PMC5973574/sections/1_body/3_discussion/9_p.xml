<p>The assays developed were serotype-specific, and no cross-detection of other flaviviruses was observed. Surprisingly, 2 viral preparations tested—KDH0010A (DENV3) and VIMFH4 (DENV4)—were also found positive for DENV1. Subsequent analysis by serotype-specific nested PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] confirmed the presence of DENV1 RNA probably due to contamination during RNA extraction or virus culture, and indicating that the DENV RT-LAMP assays had picked up the contamination correctly.
