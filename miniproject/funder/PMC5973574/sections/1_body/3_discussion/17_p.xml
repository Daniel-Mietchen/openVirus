<p>The scores obtained for PPV and NPV estimate the probability that the disease is present or absent depending of the result is positive or negative. Since the samples were collected in a fever study, the results obtained with the RT-LAMP (PPV = 100% and NPV = 85.7%) highlight a good performance of the method in determining true positive cases while excluding negative cases. PPV and NPV are very dependent of the number of positive and negative samples used, providing valuable information during naturally occurring infections in prospective trials. The values obtained in our study may not reflect this as only thirty samples were analysed and a larger number of both positive and negative samples would be needed to refine these results.</p>
