<p>Therefore, results were in the range observed for previously described RT-LAMP methods detecting all four serotypes in a single reaction [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with sensitivities between 10 and 100 RNA molecules detected, and RT-LAMP assays distinguishing the serotypes in individual reactions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For the latter assays the analytical sensitivities determined were 10 to 100 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL and 10 RNA molecules detected respectively. Our RT-LAMP assay for DENV1 showed a limit of detection as per probit analysis of 102 PFU/mL with a confidence interval from 20 to 7.8x10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/mL (data non-shown).
