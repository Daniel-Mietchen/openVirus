<p>Thus currently reaction times range from 45 (DENV1) to 90 minutes (DENV2). This was not correlated with the number of oligonucleotides in the mixture but may reflect the efficiency of the individual primer sets in the mixture detecting the respective standard strains we used for the validation, and the low oligonucleotide concentration. Alternative approaches to evaluate the sensitivity of each RT-LAMP would consist of having either a pool of RNA samples representative for each amplicon included or specific primer sets for each particular DENV strain that would be compared with the primer mixtures included in the developed assays.</p>
