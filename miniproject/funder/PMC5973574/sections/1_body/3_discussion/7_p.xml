<p>We used an RNA standard evaluated by qRT-PCR to quantify viral RNA of DENV1-4. These quantified RNA were then used to test the analytical sensitivity of the 4 individual specific RT-LAMP assays for the detection of each serotype. The analytical sensitivities of the DENV1-4 RT-LAMP assays, as estimated per probit analysis, ranged from 22 to 641 RNA molecules detected, and 100% reproducibility after 8 independent runs was achieved for 10
