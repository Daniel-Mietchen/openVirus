<p>Worldwide monitoring and the use of Next Generation Sequencing methods have increased the number of complete DENV genomes sequenced and deposited in GenBank to 2,988 (as of June 2016). It is virtually impossible to use this amount of sequence information to manually align and design amplicons for molecular detection methods. There have been several attempts to create algorithms to derive signature sequences for PCR techniques from sequence datasets or alignments [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. LAMP amplicons are inherently more challenging to design as they require a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 signature sequences. LAVA software was developed to facilitate the determination of signature sequences for LAMP primer design using a set of aligned sequences [
