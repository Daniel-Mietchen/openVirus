<p>For evaluation with clinical material, RNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected in Tanzania, confirmed as DENV2 positive by qRT-PCR. A bead-based extraction protocol was improved and, in addition, instead of using 50 μL whole blood and eluting in 200 μL RNA, the extraction commenced from 100 μL whole blood and RNA was eluted into 100 μL. Due to this improved extraction protocol, time to positivity reduced from 81–89 min to 55–77 min.</p>
