<p>Traditional virus isolation is time-consuming, requires experienced staff, costly facilities and equipment and needs more than seven days to complete the assay [

IgM- and IgG-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are most widely used but some degree of cross-reactivity against other flaviviruses is usually observed and this method is not useful when antibody titers are not sufficiently high (febrile viremic phase) [
