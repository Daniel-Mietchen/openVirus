<p>Previously reported reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assays for DENV target the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], whilst other detect a fragment of the C-prM region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], a conserved region of the NS1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], or regions of NS2A (DENV1), NS4A (DENV3), NS4A (DENV2) and the 3’ UTR (DENV4) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In all cases information about the primer design is limited as only one sequence per serotype or reference sequences were considered or it is not clearly detailed how the sequence alignment was carried out or how many sequences were included in the design. An initial screen of all published DENV RT-LAMP detection amplicons quickly revealed that all of them fail to cover the documented sequence variation. To improve DENV RT-LAMP design we used the LAMP Assay Versatile Analysis (LAVA) algorithm [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006381.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] which solves the limitations of existing LAMP primer-designing programs by allowing designs based on large multiple sequence alignments. Our LAMP design is based on 2,056 whole-genome DENV sequences covering DENV strains from 2004 to 2014 and yielded 4 one-step, real-time RT-LAMP assays to specifically detect each DENV serotype.
