<p>Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has the potential to substitute PCR-based methods because of its simplicity, rapidity, specificity, sensitivity and cost-effectiveness, as no special equipment is needed (just a heating block or water bath capable to maintain a constant temperature between 60°C to 65°C) [
