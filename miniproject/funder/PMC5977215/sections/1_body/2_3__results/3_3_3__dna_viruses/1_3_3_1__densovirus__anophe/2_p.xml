<p>AgDNV was discovered in the 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> cell line, Sua5B, during an experiment to infect the cells with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. It was maintained between different generations by vertical and horizontal transmission and has no detectable effect on mortality of 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> larvae. Virus purification was done from crude cell lysates on a density gradient, and icosahedral, non-enveloped particles of 20 nm were observed by transmission electron microscopy [
