<p>The densoviruses belong to the 
 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> family, characterized by a non-enveloped virion containing a linear single-stranded DNA genome. AgDNV has a genome size of 4139 nt and is organized as two overlapping reading frames that encode the viral proteins (VP) of which activity is fundamental for virus infectivity and two non-structural (NS) proteins involved in the DNA replication. The NS1 portion displays 87% homology with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> densovirus (AeDNV) [
