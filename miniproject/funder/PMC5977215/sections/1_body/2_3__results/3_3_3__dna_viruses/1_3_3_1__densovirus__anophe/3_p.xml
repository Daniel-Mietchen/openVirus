<p>The use of DNVs as expression vectors was demonstrated by the transfection of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cell line with a plasmid containing an infectious sequence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> DNV. This infection yielded the same quantity of the monomeric replicative form as infection with wild type virions [
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A recombinant AgDNV carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under control of actin5C promoter has been produced [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. EGFP transducing virions infected 50% of adults and were able to disseminate to the fat body, midgut, hindgut, malpighian tubules, and ovaries, and were vertically transmitted to subsequent generations. These results indicate that recombinant AgDNV could be a candidate for paratransgenesis, for example by carrying an anti-
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> peptide for reducing the vector competence of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> to 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. In addition, the AgDNV titer is higher in older 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> adults compare to the larvae and pupae stages, suggesting that it could have potential as an adult stage bio-insecticide [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Tested DNVs are innocuous to mammals [
