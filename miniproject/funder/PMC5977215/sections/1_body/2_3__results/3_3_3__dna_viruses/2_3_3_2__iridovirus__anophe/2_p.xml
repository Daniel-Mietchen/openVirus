<p>AMIV was isolated from wild adult 
 <italic>Anopheles minimus</italic>, a major Southeast Asian malaria vector, after inoculation of C6/36 cells with mosquito extract [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. BHK21 and Vero-E6 cells can also be infected with AMIV, with a significant cytopathic effect [
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. AMIV is the first iridovirus isolated from 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species. An 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> iridovirus (IIV-6) causes cytopathic damage leading to the reduction of body size, fecundity and longevity. Horizontal transmission by cannibalism and vertical transmission of IIV-3 were observed in 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Iridovirus infection leads to an apoptotic response in invertebrate and vertebrate cells [
