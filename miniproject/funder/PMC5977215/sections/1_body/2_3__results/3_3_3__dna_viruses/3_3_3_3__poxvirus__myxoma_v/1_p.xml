<p>The myxoma virus genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing in wild caught 
 <italic>An. maculipennis</italic> that fed on wild rabbits [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The 
 <italic>An. maculipennis</italic> group includes major historic vectors of human malaria in North African and Europe [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Myxoma virus is in the 
 <italic>Leporipoxvirus</italic> genus and 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> family. This family includes the subfamilies 
 <italic>Chordopoxvirinae</italic> and 
 <italic>Entomopoxvirinae</italic>. The latter infects insects and comprises 
 <italic>Alphaentomopoxvirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betaentomopoxvirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Gammaentomopoxvirus</italic> genera. Myxoma virus can be mechanically transmitted by mosquitoes and fleas but does not replicate in them, and thus is not an arbovirus. The 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> genome is comprised of linear dsDNA, and is enveloped. Poxviruses share features with other DNA viruses such as the asfarviruses, iridoviruses, and phycodnaviruses [
