<p>Batai virus (BATV) was first isolated from 
 <italic>Culex gelidus</italic> in Malaysia [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. More recently, two different entomological surveys in Germany and Italy identified and isolated BATV from 
 <italic>Anopheles maculipennis</italic> complex mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The Italian and German strains were related to strains isolated in Slovakia [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. BATV causes hemorrhagic disease, with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. BATV was also identified in Sudan from sera of febrile patients [
 <xref rid="B90-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Cattle are a potential host of BATV, and in a survey in Germany, the serological prevalence in cattle was 0.55%, while a 2.1% positivity rate was detected by RT-PCR in cattle from Mongolia [

 <italic>An. maculipennis</italic> complex is an important historical European vector of
