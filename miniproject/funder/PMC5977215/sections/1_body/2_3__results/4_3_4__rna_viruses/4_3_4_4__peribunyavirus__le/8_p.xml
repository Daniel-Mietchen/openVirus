<p>Tahyna virus (TAHV) was isolated from pools of 
 <italic>Anopheles hyrcanus</italic> females collected in South Moravia [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], although it has been more often found in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. 
 <italic>An. hyrcanus</italic> extract was inoculated intracerebrally into mice and the virus was identified by neutralization tests on Vero E6 cells and confirmation by RT-PCR. The virus was generally fatal to inoculated mice. TAHV infection causes human fever, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, malaise, arthralgia, headache, and drowsiness, and anti-TAHV IgM antibodies were detected by IFA in asymptomatic patients in China, but no human deaths have been attributed to this virus [
