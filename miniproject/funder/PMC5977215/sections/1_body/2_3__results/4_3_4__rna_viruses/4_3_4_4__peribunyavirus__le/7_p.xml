<p>Mapputta virus (MAPV) was isolated in 1960 from 
 <italic>An. meraukensis</italic> in Australia. MAPV antibodies react with other viruses of Mapputta group such as Maprik virus (MPKV), Trubanaman virus (TRUV), and Gan Gan virus (GGV), indicating that a serological test is not sufficient to distinguish them [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. There is at least 60% nucleotide identity of S and L segments between MAPV and MPKV [

 <italic>An. meraukensis</italic> bites humans and other vertebrates, but it has not been incriminated as a malaria vector [
