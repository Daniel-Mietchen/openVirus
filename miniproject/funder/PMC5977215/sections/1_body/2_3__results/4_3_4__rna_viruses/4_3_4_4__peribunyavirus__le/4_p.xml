<p>Recombination events between BATV and Bunyamwera virus generated Ngari virus (NRIV), which has mainly been reported in Africa. The first isolation of NRIV was done from 
 <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> in Senegal in 1979. It was also isolated from 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>An. pharoensis</italic>, and cytopathic effects were observed in Vero cells [

 <italic>An. funestus</italic> collected in Kenya between 2007 and 2012 were positive for NRIV RNA by RT-PCR and sequencing. The full genome sequence of NRIV was obtained from mosquito and human samples [
