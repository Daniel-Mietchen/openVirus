<p>Leanyer virus (LEAV) was isolated from 
 <italic>An. meraukensis</italic> pools in a suburb of Darwin, Australia in 1974, and was cultivable on BHK-2I and Vero cells [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Peptide sequence analysis indicated that LEAV is related to Oropouche virus with 59% similarity in the polymerase sequence. LEAV does not cross-react serologically with other orthobunyaviruses and the L and S segment peptide sequences display divergence from other orthobunyaviruses, and therefore LEAV could be considered as a new antigenic complex [
