 <italic>Anopheles</italic> A virus (ANAV) and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> B virus (ANBV) were first isolated from female 
 <italic>An. boliviensis</italic> in Colombia. Mice injected with ANAV and ANBV displayed central nervous system pathologies [

 <italic>An. boliviensis</italic> is a minor malaria vector in Colombia [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. ANAV and ANBV are distinct from other Bunyamwera viruses because the S segment encodes only the nucleocapsid protein N, and therefore the nonstructural protein (NSs) involved in replication and pathogenesis is absent [
