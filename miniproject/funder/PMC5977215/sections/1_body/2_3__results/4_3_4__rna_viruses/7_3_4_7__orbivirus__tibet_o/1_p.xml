<p>Viruses of the 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic> genus, in the 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family, infect plants and vertebrates, and are characterized by a dsRNA genome of 10â€“12 segments. Tibet orbivirus (TIBOV) was isolated from 
 <italic>Anopheles maculatus</italic> collected in China [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. TIBOV was cultured from mosquito extract inoculated on C6/36 and BHK-21 cells. Cytopathic effects characterized by cell rounding, lysis, and floating cells were observed only in the BHK-21 cells after 3 d of infection, but viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR in both cell types. Gel electrophoresis revealed ten dsRNA genome segments, which were sequenced [

 <italic>An. maculatus</italic> species are important vectors of human malaria in Asia [
