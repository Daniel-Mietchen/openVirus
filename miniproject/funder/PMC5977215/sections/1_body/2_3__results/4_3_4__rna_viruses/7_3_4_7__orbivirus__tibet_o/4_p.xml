<p>Orungo Virus was isolated in Uganda from 
 <italic>An. funestus</italic> after inoculation on Vero and BHK-21 cells [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Viral replication was detected in the brains of inoculated mice and hamsters. Antibodies against ORUV were detected in human sera from Nigeria. The human symptoms of ORUV are fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting, and ORUV also infects other vertebrates such as sheep, monkeys and cows [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. On the basis of nucleotide G + C content and amino acid composition of the T2 protein, ORUV appears closer to 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>-borne than mosquito-borne orbiviruses [
