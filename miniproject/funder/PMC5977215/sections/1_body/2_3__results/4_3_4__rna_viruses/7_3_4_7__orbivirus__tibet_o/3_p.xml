<p>Tilligerry virus (TILV) was isolated in 1971 from 
 <italic>An. annulipes</italic> in Australia, and the complete genome sequence was determined [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The G + C content of the full genome of TILV is 45% and its 10 segments are visible on agarose and acrylamide gels [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. TILV leads to cytopathic effects in BHK and BSR cells 2â€“3 d post inoculation [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. TILV cross-reacts with bluetongue virus in complement fixation tests [
