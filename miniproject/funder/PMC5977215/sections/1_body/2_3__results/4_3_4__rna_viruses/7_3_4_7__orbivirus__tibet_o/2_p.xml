<p>Orbivirus sequences detected in 
 <italic>Anopheles annulipes</italic> and 
 <italic>An. hinesorum</italic> from Australia were named 
 <italic>Anopheles annulipes</italic> orbivirus (AAOV) and 
 <italic>Anopheles hinesorum orbivirus</italic> (AHOV) [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The viruses could not be cultured on C6/36 cells, but virus sequences were present in the mosquito 21-nucleotide viral RNA fraction, indicative of active replication and dicing of dsRNA replication intermediates.
