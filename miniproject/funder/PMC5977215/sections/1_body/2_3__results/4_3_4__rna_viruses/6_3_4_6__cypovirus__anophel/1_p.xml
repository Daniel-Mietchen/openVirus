<p>Viruses in the genus 
 <italic>Cypovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, are characterized by a genome of 9 to 12 segments of linear dsRNA within a single capsid shell [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Cypoviruses, or cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses, are so named because the infectious forms are occlusion bodies in crystalline polyhedral form within the cytoplasm of infected cells. The protein polyhedra protect the virus against harsh environmental conditions such as high pH. Cypoviruses are only known to infect insects. The first 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> cypovirus was detected in adult 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> by microscopy after staining with ammonium molybdate [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, culture and transmission experiments did not succeed, the virus disappeared from the colony after nine months, and was not sequenced or named. This cypovirus was observed within the cytoplasm of 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> or 
 <italic>P. yoelii</italic> rodent malaria oocysts in co-infected mosquitoes, and observations suggested it might have reduced the numbers of developing oocysts.
