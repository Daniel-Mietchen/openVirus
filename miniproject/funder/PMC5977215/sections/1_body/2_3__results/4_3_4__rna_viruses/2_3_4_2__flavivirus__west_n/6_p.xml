<p>Stratford virus (STRV) RNA was detected in an isolate of 
 <italic>Anopheles annulipes</italic> collected in Australia from 1995–2013 [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Sequence analysis based on part of the NS5 gene sequence displayed 95–99% homology among the different isolates of STRV, and 2% divergence was detected between the isolates collected in 1995–2013 and the first isolates of 1961. The main vector of STRV is thought to be 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., without important contribution by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. [
