<p>A study of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> samples collected in Australia identified multiple insect-specific viruses that do not infect vertebrate cells, and display fine species-specific host restriction for the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> host in which they were identified [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The genome of Karumba virus (KRBV) was obtained from single and pooled mosquitoes collected in two different sites in Australia. In addition, the same authors also discovered Haslams Creek virus (HaCV), Dairy Swamp virus (DSwV), and Mac Peak virus (McPV) in pools of 
 <italic>An. annulipes, An. bancrofti</italic>, and 
 <italic>An. farauti</italic>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. HaCV, DSwV, and McPV failed to replicate in vitro on cell lines C6/36 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, MOS55 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, ISE6 tick, or S2 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> No replication of KRBV was observed on the following vertebrate cells: BSR 
 <italic>Mesocricetus auratus,</italic> Vero 
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops,</italic> or DF-1 
 <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The complete genome sequences were assembled by deep sequencing of mosquito RNA. Viral sequences were detected in the 21-nucleotide small RNA fraction, which suggested that double stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates produced during viral replication were cleaved by the siRNA pathway into viral RNAs (viRNAs). Presence of viRNAs is evidence of active virus replication. The prevalence of KRBV found in 
 <italic>Anopheles meraukensis</italic> was 91.7% and 100% in Wyndham and Karumba, respectively. The prevalence of KRBV in wild type mosquitoes is quite high and highlights the need to study its impact on 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species. Specific RT-PCR assays detected HaCV and McPV RNA in wild 
 <italic>An. annulipes</italic>, 
 <italic>An. bancrofti</italic>, and 
 <italic>An. farauti</italic>.
