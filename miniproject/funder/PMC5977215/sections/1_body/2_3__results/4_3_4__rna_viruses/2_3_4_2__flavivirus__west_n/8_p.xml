<p>Long Pine key virus (LPKV) was isolated in the United States from a pool of 50

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Both viruses were cultured on C6/36 cells and cytopathic effects were observed at 7 d post-inoculation. Inoculation of BHK-21 and Vero cells with LPKV and KPKV produced neither replication nor cytopathic effects, and these viruses did not display pathology in mice [

Despite being insect-specific, LPKV and KPKV reacted serologically with antibodies directed against some dual-host flaviviruses such as WNV, JEV, and Dengue virus [
