 <italic>Anopheles</italic> flavivirus (AnFV), the first flavivirus discovered in 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, was identified in a population virome survey in Liberia and Senegal [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. An RT-PCR diagnostic assay confirmed the presence of AnFV RNA in wild 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, with a prevalence of 12%. 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> flavivirus (AngFV) and 
 <italic>An. squamosus</italic> flavivirus (AnsFV) were detected in 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>An. squamosus</italic> respectively by a nucleic acid melting-curve analysis from mosquitoes collected in Kenya [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. AngFVs and AnsFV share 77% of nucleotide identity.
