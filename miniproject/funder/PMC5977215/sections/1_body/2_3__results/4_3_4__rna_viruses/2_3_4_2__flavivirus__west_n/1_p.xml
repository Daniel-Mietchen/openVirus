<p>Members of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus in the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> are generally thought to be transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. However, a number studies have detected flaviviruses in 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species, suggesting that anophelines could also be involved in transmission [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Flaviviruses are characterized by an enveloped virion carrying a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The linear genome of 10 to 11 kb is flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) that encode for a single open-reading frame. Translation produces a single polyprotein cleaved in 10 proteins: three structural (C, prM, E), and seven non-structural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins [
