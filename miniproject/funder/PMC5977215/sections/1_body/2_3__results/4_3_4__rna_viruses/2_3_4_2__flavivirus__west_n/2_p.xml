<p>The main reported vectors of West Nile virus (WNV) are 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. Transmission is mainly zoonotic but with significant levels of human infection, including occasional mortality [

 <italic>An. pauliani</italic> wild unfed females was found to be positive for WNV RNA by RT-PCR in Madagascar [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A pool of 
 <italic>An. maculipennis</italic> collected in Italy between 2008 and 2012 was also found positive for WNV RNA by RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A pool of 
 <italic>An. maculipennis</italic> collected in Serbia after the 2012 WNV outbreak was also positive for WNV RNA by RT-PCR, which suggested a potential important role for this species in transmission [
