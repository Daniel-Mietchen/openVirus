<p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is an endemic causative agent of encephalitis in Asia and India. JEV infects humans and other vertebrates such as horses, dogs, and reptiles. Based on envelope protein gene sequences, JEV strains can be classified into five different genotypes, I–V, with specific geographic distributions [
