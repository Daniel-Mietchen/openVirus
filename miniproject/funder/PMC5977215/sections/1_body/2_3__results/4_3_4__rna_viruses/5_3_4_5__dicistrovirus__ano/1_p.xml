<p>Two 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> dicistroviruses were identified by deep sequencing and de novo assembly. Anopheles associated C virus (AACV) [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Anopheles C virus (AnCV) [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] belong to the genus 
 <italic>Cripavirus</italic> in the 
 <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> family, non-enveloped viruses with a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The dicistrovirus genome is comprised of two open reading frames (ORF). ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins necessary for virus replication, and ORF2 the viral proteins VPO to VP4. In the C-terminal region of ORF1, there is an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain that is highly conserved among dicistroviruses [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Dicistroviruses are only known to infect insects.
