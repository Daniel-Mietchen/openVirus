<p>AnCV is distinct from but related to Drosophila C virus, and was discovered in wild-caught human host-seeking 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> in Senegal, and in laboratory colonies of 
 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> in France and 
 <italic>An. dirus</italic> in Cambodia [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both horizontal and vertical modes of transmission were demonstrated in the Ngousso colony of 
 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>, while a colony of 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> maintained in the same laboratory as the 
 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> colony was not infected by AnCV [
