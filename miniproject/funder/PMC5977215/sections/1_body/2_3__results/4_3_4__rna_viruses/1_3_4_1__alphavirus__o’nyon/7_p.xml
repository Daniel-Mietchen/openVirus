<p>Eilat virus (EILV) was isolated from a pool of 
 <italic>An. coustani</italic> mosquitoes and displays inability to replicate in the vertebrate cellular environment [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. EILV was transmitted by bloodfeeding to 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> but not to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>
 <bold>,</bold> and may be vertically transmitted in the infected species, but the virus was not detected in the ovaries [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. EILV did not display cytopathic effect in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> C6/36 and or C7/10 cells despite high replication at 12 h post infection. One proposed hypothesis is that EILV may have secondarily lost the ability to infect vertebrate cells, rather than being insect-specific as an ancestral character.
