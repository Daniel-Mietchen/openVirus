<p>The important African malaria vectors,

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is necessary for protection of 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> against ONNV infection [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the RNAi pathway displays ONNV antiviral activity in 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> only during the disseminated systemic infection, and not in the primary midgut infection by bloodmeal [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The immune pathways Janus kinases/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) and Immune Deficiency (Imd) display a reciprocal effect, as ONNV antiviral mechanisms in the primary midgut infection but not against the disseminated infection in the hemocoel.
