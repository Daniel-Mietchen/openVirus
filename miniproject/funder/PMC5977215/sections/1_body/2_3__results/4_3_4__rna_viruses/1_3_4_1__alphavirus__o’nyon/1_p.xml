<p>The 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus in the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family is frequently associated with 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV) is generally regarded as the only arbovirus transmitted by 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Alphaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA of positive sense and a genome size of around 10,000 nucleotides. The 5′ end is capped and the 3′ end is polyadenylated. The linear RNA genome encodes nonstructural proteins (nsP1 to nsP-4), and structural proteins, although only the nsPs are translated from the genome, while the structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic RNA transcribed after infection. The nonstructural protein nsP1 is necessary for infectivity, nsP2 is necessary for replication and transcription of viral RNAs, nsP3 forms cytoplasmic complexes with different host factors, and nsP4 is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A domain-swap experiment replacing part of the CHIKV nsP3 with the ONNV sequence allowed the chimeric virus to infect

The capsid protein, the glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and the small peptides, E3 and 6K are structural proteins. A single mutation of E1 glycoprotein (E1-A226V) increases CHIKV transmission by the mosquito
