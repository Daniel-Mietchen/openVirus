<p>Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an arbovirus in the Americas, where numerous outbreaks have been reported with equine and human deaths [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. A large epidemic of VEEV in Colombia in 1995 caused more than 70,000 human cases and 300 deaths [

Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is a recombinant virus that can infect humans and other vertebrates, with a capsid protein related to Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) whereas the glycoprotein sequences are closer to Sindbis virus [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. An epizootic occurred in Argentina in 1982, and more than 150,000 mosquitoes of different genera were collected by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps between 1982 and 1983 [
