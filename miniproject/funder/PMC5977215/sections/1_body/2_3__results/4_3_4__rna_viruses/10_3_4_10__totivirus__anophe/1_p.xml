<p>A virus of the genus 
 <italic>Totivirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Totiviridae, Anopheles</italic> totivirus (AToV) was discovered in 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> from Liberia, with an infection prevalence of 1.3% [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Another totivirus, Australian 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> totivirus (AATV), was detected in 
 <italic>An. annulipes</italic> and 
 <italic>An. hinesorum</italic> collected in Australia [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Despite the lack of AATV replication in C6/36 cells, the presence of 21-nt viral RNA sequences was regarded as diagnostic of active virus replication in mosquitoes. AATV and AToV share ~25% identity at both nucleotide and peptide sequence levels. The genus 
 <italic>Totivirus</italic> also includes protozoa-infecting members such as Trichomonasvirus, Victorivirus, Giardiavirus, and Leishmaniavirus [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. This genus also commonly infects plants. A maize-associated totivirus was identified in China [
