<p>The order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> are non-segmented and negative-sense single stranded RNA viruses encoding 5â€“10 ORFs. Sequences of two mononegaviruses were detected in 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. in Liberia, Senegal, and Burkina Faso [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The two viruses, Bolahun virus (BOAV) and Gambiae virus (GAMV), have similar genome organization with six non-overlapping ORFs.
