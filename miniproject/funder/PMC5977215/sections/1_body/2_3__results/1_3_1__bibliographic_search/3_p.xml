<p>The Lissa database of scientific literature written in French returned a single article using the above English search terms. However, this article in French (with English keywords) was written in 1957, and was not included in any of the three other databases. In addition, when using French language search terms, the Lissa database identified 13 additional articles (for a total of 14), all in French, that were uniquely identified by Lissa and not by the other three databases. Nevertheless, some of the search terms such as “virus” and “Anopheles” are spelled the same in French and English, and further work would be required to determine whether the different search results are due to search term language, or distinct database contents.</p>
