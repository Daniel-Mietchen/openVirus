<p>The incidence of co-infection of malaria and arboviruses is probably underestimated in endemic areas. In a recent survey in Senegal, the frequency of human co-infection by

It is unknown whether members of the natural virome can influence malaria parasite or arbovirus infection and transmission by the vector, for example by stimulating or diverting mosquito basal immunity, or otherwise either promoting or diminishing superinfection.
