<p>It is likely that the main evolutionary pressure shaping mosquito antiviral mechanisms in general is their persistent exposure in nature to members of the natural virome, rather than the probably less frequent exposure to vertebrate-pathogenic arboviruses. Despite the apparently abundant presence of viruses in 
 <italic>Anopheles,</italic> there is debate as to whether 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes serve as merely occasional hosts of pathogenic arboviruses, or to what extent they help mediate transmission as vectors. The distinction between host and vector will require evaluation of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vector competence in the laboratory and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectorial capacity in the field. Vector competence is the ability to acquire, maintain, disseminate, and transmit a virus, whereas vectorial capacity or vector efficiency is the rate at which a putative vector population generates new inoculations from an infectious case.
