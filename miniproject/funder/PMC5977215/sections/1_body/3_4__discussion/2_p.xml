<p>We found published evidence of at least 51 viruses associated with 
 <italic>Anopheles.</italic> This number is likely an underestimate, because it does not include publications in journals not indexed by the databases searched. The 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> virome appears to be dominated by RNA viruses. RNA viruses are also dominant in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (Yellow fever virus, Zika virus, dengue virus, chikungunya virus) and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Rift Valley fever virus, West Nile virus). RNA viruses evolve rapidly because of high mutation and recombination rates [
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], and can potentially adapt rapidly to new hosts. There could also be an ascertainment bias favoring the detection of RNA as compared to DNA viruses, because sequencing of small viral-derived RNAs is a powerful tool to identify actively replicating RNA viruses [
