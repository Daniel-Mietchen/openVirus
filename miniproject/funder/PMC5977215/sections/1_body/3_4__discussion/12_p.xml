<p>Finally, it should be noted that a systematic automated search profile can only reveal reports that are indexed using informative combinations of terms. A limiting factor is thus the quality of index terms in the records. The search parameters presented here could perhaps be modified with additional systematic terms. However, search terms that might appear to be more precise may in fact generate less informative results and lead to diminishing returns. For example, searching of databases with [virus name + Anopheles], can generate large numbers of often low-quality results (e.g., [West Nile virus] + Anopheles generates 140 records). Such searches require increased levels of labor-intensive manual curation to identify on-target records. Systematic automated searches can be easily re-run. Moreover, the most important biological observation is made when a virus is first reliably reported in at least one 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species. After that, finding the virus in other 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> is useful, but hardly surprising, while studies of the biology of host range restriction and mode of transmission of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> viruses are sorely lacking.
