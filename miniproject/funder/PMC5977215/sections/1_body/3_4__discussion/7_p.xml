<p>Finally, known pathogenic arboviruses with evidence of presence in 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> include Oâ€™nyong nyong virus (ONNV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, Rift Valley fever virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Wesselsbron virus, Tataguine virus, Batai virus, Cache Valley virus, Tahyna virus, and Tensaw virus. Myxoma virus can be mechanically transmitted by mosquitoes and fleas but does not replicate in them, and thus is not an arbovirus. Of these, transmission by 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> has been demonstrated for ONNV, but additional work is required to determine the vector competence and capacity of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> for the other arboviruses.
