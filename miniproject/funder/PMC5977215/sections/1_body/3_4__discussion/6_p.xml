<p>A different group of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> viruses possesses likely vertebrate transmission potential, because studies have detected presence in vertebrates and/or replication in vertebrate cells. Further work will be required to confirm and characterize transmission between 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species and vertebrates and evaluate their risk. This group of potential arboviruses includes 
 <italic>Anopheles minimus</italic> virus, Leanyer virus, Tilligerry virus, Stratford virus, Ngari virus, Bangui virus, Mapputta virus, Nyando virus, Ilesha virus, Bwamba virus, Orungo virus, and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> B virus.
