<p>Genetically encoded differences between mosquito species can interact with viral factors to influence host permissiveness and restriction. The protein nsP3 of ONNV influences host specificity of this virus to 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> as compared to 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, because substitution of chikungunya virus nsP3 by ONNV nsP3 in the chikungunya backbone allows chikungunya infection of 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> [

 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> may also play a role in restricting host range [
