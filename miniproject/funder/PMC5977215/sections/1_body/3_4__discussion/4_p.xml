<p>The potential of the majority of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>-associated viruses for transmission to humans or other vertebrates is currently unknown, because few studies of host range and transmission have been done. Some viruses may have a host range restricted to only 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> and other insects. For example, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> cypovirus and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> C virus were found to replicate and be maintained by vertical transmission in 
 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>, but were not able to infect 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in exposure experiments [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Both of these viruses were able to replicate in 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> after exposure, but 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> C virus was not stably maintained and disappeared after several generations. Thus, these two viruses may be 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific, but possibly not adapted to all 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species.
