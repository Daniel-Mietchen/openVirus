<p>One conclusion of this study is that the databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Lissa can yield different results for the same specific area of research. The four bibliographic databases are complementary. PubMed and Lissa are free to access without registration, which is not the case for Scopus and Web of Science. Web of Science yielded the most results (58 articles), because it includes articles from many countries. However, PubMed contains the most recent articles. In contrast, the articles found in Lissa are in French and include older works, which can fill gaps not covered by other databases. The Arbocat Arbovirus Catalog indexes arboviruses or potential arboviruses harbored by arthropods, but for some of these viruses, the support is unpublished or no longer available.</p>
