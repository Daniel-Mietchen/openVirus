<p>The above grouping of viruses is likely to be porous and is expected to change with the addition of data from new studies. The interesting question remains, nevertheless, whether 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> are less efficient arbovirus vectors than 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, or are simply under-recognized as virus vectors. If the first case were true, that is, lower vector competence of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> for arboviruses, then understanding the biological mechanisms leading to their general resistance to virus transmission would be important and could lead to novel tools to control arbovirus transmission by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> vectors. As the current systematic review indicates, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> are not inherently resistant to virus replication. Although the natural virome data do not yet exist to make a numerical comparison with 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, there is no evidence that rates of natural carriage of viruses are substantially different between these mosquito genera.
