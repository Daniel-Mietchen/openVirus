<p>This study is the first, to our knowledge, to present an overview of the published literature on the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> virome. At least 51 viruses have been reported in 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> in almost all continents. The quantification and identification of the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> virome is important for general understanding of microbiome diversity, for surveillance and prevention of emergence of unknown viruses, to understand the phenomenon of human malaria and arbovirus co-infection, and to study the antiviral and immune responses of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. The availability of next-generation sequencing and de novo assembly will likely continue to augment knowledge of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> viruses, and more effort will be required to characterize their biology and public health risk.
