<p>Studies to date have not provided evidence that 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> can contribute to the transmission and maintenance of any of these arboviruses, other than ONNV. However, anthropophilic 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors of malaria are also constantly exposed to arboviruses in infected human bloodmeals. It is possible that in malaria-endemic zones, febrile symptoms of malaria may mask symptoms of arbovirus infection and cause misdiagnosis. It is also possible that, for an unknown reason, anophelines are less competent arbovirus vectors than culicines, but if true, this would be biologically interesting, and would warrant further study. Mechanisms of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> anti-viral immunity have been little examined [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The relative lack of virus transmission by 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, if true, is puzzling because 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, especially highly anthropophilic taxa, would seem well-placed to serve as intermediaries for virus spillover from other vertebrates to humans [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00222" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as vectors for maintenance of transmission.
