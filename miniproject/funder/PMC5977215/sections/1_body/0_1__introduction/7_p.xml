<p>The characteristics of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> viruses that comprise the natural virome flora are also poorly characterized, thereby creating little appreciation of their number and significance. Examination of the literature suggests that the number of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> viruses is underestimated, including potentially pathogenic arboviruses. Here, we carry out a systematic literature search in order to summarize as comprehensively as possible the known viruses of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes.
