<p>However, the research focus on 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> as vectors of malaria has led to a relative lack of study about 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> viruses. In addition to malaria parasites, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes also harbor viruses, collectively termed the virome. The 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> virome is poorly studied, and the number and function of viruses are unknown. Some of them are confirmed arthropod-borne pathogenic viruses (arboviruses), which multiply in the mosquito vector before transmission to a vertebrate host. Others are thought to be insect-specific viruses that may replicate only in the insect host [
