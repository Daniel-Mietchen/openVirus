<p id="Par26">Goderich ETC was built during the outbreak, in the framework of a project to build seven Ebola treatment centres funded by DFID (Department for International Development—GOV.UK). In accordance with treatment criteria and based on the previous 3 months’ experience, the Centre was co-designed by EMERGENCY’s technical/engineering staff. Fitting it out for intensive care delivery resulted in additional costs, borne by the NGO, in the amount of approximately €450,000. The Istituto di Malattie Infettive “Lazzaro Spallanzani”, which ran the virological laboratory, was supported by a “Ricerca Corrente IRCCS” grant; Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italy (See Supplementary material S2 for more details). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p>
