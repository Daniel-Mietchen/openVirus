<p id="Par14">Demographic information including age, gender, symptoms, and possible time of Ebola exposure were collected on standardised clinical case report forms. LVL was recorded from the first diagnostic blood sample at admission. Other risk factors at admission, including markers of organ damage (renal, liver, coagulation etc.), were not systematically collected in the early months and cannot therefore be included in the analysis.</p>
