<p id="Par11">The plasma concentration of Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA (viral load) was measured using a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay (RealStar Filovirus Screen. RT-PCR 1.0 kit, Altona Diagnostics), with a limit of detection of 10
 <sup>3</sup> cp/ml of EBOV RNA. Viral RNA quantification was based on a standard reference curve provided by the kit manufacturer, spanning up to 10
 <sup>9</sup> cp/ml of EBOV RNA. For the sake of simplicity, further analyses were performed using the base 10 logarithm of the viral load (LVL) measured in cp/ml.
