<p id="Par19">Descriptive analyses were presented as frequencies, proportions, means and standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), where appropriate to characterize patients and their clinical outcomes. Proportions were compared using the 
 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> test or Fisher Test, whereas comparisons between continuous variables were expressed through the 
 <italic>t</italic> test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. The number of hospital-free days within 28 days was calculated to compare the burden of EVD in terms of hospitalization in the two ETCs, avoiding bias due to mortality rate differences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. During the 28-day follow-up period most, but not all, EVD patients either died or recovered. The number of hospital-free days for a patient with 
 <italic>x</italic> days of hospitalisation was 28 − 
 <italic>x,</italic> if the patient recovered within 28 days, and 0 if the patient recovered after 28 days or died. Hence, the higher the value of this indicator the lower the burden of hospitalization (as the patient recovered earlier), while deceased patients were considered equivalent to alive patients with a long recovery time.
