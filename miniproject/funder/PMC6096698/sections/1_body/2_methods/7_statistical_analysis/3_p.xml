<p id="Par21">The odds ratio (OR) of the two ETCs, i.e., the exponential of the difference 
 <italic>d</italic> between the logit of the two ETCs (
 <italic>d</italic> = logit
 <sub>Lakka</sub> – logit
 <sub>Goderich</sub>), was plotted as a function of viral load, with the bootstrap-based confidence band. Hence, mortality in Lakka was higher than in Goderich when OR was larger than one. The OR was statistically significant for those viral load values for which the confidence band was above the line OR = 1. To identify the range of clinically relevant phenomena, two confidence bands were constructed at the 95 and 80% levels, respectively.
