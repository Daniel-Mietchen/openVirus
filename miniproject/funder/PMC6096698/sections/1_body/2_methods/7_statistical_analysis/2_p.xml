<p id="Par20">Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine independent factors associated with EVD patient mortality. ETC was forced in the model to explore the secondary endpoint of association of intensive care availability on mortality. To test any relationship between the logit and the LVL, the former was modelled as a continuous piecewise linear function of the latter. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] was minimised with respect to the cut-off values of LVL where the slope of the piecewise linear function changed. Interactions between ETC and the other variables were only included when they significantly reduced the AIC. The interaction between ETC and the above-described transformation of the viral load was also tested in this step. This allowed different piecewise linear transformations (parametrised by the number and values of the cut-offs) of the LVL for the two ETCs. Missing records were excluded from the analysis.
