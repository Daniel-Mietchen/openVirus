<p id="Par23">The role played by viral load at admission as a predictor of mortality within 20 days of hospitalisation, was also described using Kaplan–Meier curves in strata of LVL, overall and for each ETC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The cut-offs separating the strata were determined as the LVL values at which mortality in one ETC becomes higher or lower than in the other ETC at the 80% confidence level (as described in the previous paragraph). Graphically, these values correspond to the points where the 80% confidence band of the logit difference

 <italic>d </italic>=0. Differences between Kaplan–Meier curves in these strata were assessed by the log-rank test.
