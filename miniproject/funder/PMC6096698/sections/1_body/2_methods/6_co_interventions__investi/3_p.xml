<p id="Par18">While awaiting clinical trial initiation, and after approval by two Italian Ethics Committees, given the pre-existing high mortality rate and lack of known effective therapies, amiodarone was administered on a compassionate basis to 100 patients. Compassionate use was stopped between December 2014 and February 2015 by request of the Sierra Leonean Government, pending the opinion of the specific Ethics Committee (definitive approval granted April 23, 2015). Further information on the treatment with amiodarone is reported in the Supplementary material S4.</p>
