<p id="Par36">After the tend-based ETC in Lakka, the Goderich ETC-ICU has been active since December 2014. It was built by the British government and run by EMERGENCY (Supplementary material, S2). The organisation recruited intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and expert nurses from various nations (Supplementary material, S1), coordinating their expertise with the experience of its own staff, specialised in intensive care medicine. Despite a long track record in hospital management in very difficult, dangerous areas and conditions, setting up a multinational ICU compliant with rigorous biosafety requirements and subject to obvious communication barriers among team members and with patients, proved to be a very challenging experience, highlighting the importance of organization, communication and cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural training.</p>
