<p id="Par38">Despite supportive treatment very close to the new guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] plus IC support, mortality at the ICU-ETC was 50% overall and still 30% in patients with LVL &lt; 7.5 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Our fatality rate is therefore much higher than the rate of 18.5% reported for patients with EVD treated outside of West Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While it is not possible to make a direct comparison between those two groups of patients and their treatment, there remains undoubtedly an important gap which needs to be investigated. Relevant differences between the two patient populations and the treatments are: 81% of patients treated outside West Africa were Western healthcare workers (vs 1% in our population) with shorter time from symptom onset to diagnosis (3 vs 4 days), lower viral load at admission (mean values of LVL of 7.3 vs 7.8 copies/ml), and earlier treatment onset (4 vs 4.9 days). Moreover, 85% of patients treated in North America and Europe received at least one antiviral drug, and 70% received two or more such treatments. Although the various clinical trials have not demonstrated the efficacy of the investigational treatments, some have exhibited promising findings that could not be adequately investigated [
