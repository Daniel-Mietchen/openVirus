<p id="Par37">We found that the setup of an ETC-ICU was feasible in a very short time and at relatively limited costs. Intensive supportive treatment shows shorter time to discharge in survivors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and survival advantage in patients with intermediate-severe infection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Different factors, like delay in admission, organ failure, comorbidities, complications, factors not changed by the availability of intensive care, contribute to the mortality in patients with “low” Ebola viral load (LVL &lt; 7.5). Patients with very high viral load (LVL &gt; 8.5) may have a very limited benefit from intensive care support without effective antiviral treatment, because of the rapid progression of EVD to fatal multiple organ failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Only exceptionally it was possible to buy enough time for the immune system to clear the virus and reverse organ failure. Only 10% of the patients who needed mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy and vasopressors recovered. In the supplementary material S6 we report two case histories, demonstrating how rapid both, worsening and improving, may occur according the clearance/persistence of the viral load.
