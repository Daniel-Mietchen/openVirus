<p id="Par8">EMERGENCY, an Italian NGO (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emergency.it" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.emergency.it</ext-link>), was founded in 1994 with the primary mission of delivering care to civilian war victims worldwide. Since 2001 it has also been running a Surgical and Paediatric Centre on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone. At the start of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone invited EMERGENCY to contribute to the fight against Ebola. The NGO rapidly built a patient assessment centre in Lakka to provide clinical triage, assessment and Ebola diagnostic testing, which soon became a patient Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). A second ETC, in Goderich Sierra Leone was subsequently constructed, incorporating a well-equipped intensive care unit (ICU), capable of providing 24Â h nursing and medical assessment/support, mechanical ventilation, intravenous vasoactive medications, and renal replacement therapy (Supplementary information, S2). To our knowledge, this was the first ever, dedicated ICU-ETC in Africa.
