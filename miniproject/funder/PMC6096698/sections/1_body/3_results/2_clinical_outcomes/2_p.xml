<p id="Par32">The overall crude case fatality rate (CFR) was 54.1% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). No statistical differences were observed between patients who survived and who died of EVD in terms of gender, age and time from symptom onset to hospital admission. CFR differed substantially according viral load at admission, ranging from approximately 30% for patients with LVL &lt; 7.5 (low) to over 80% for patients with LVL ≥ 8.5 (high) (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.0001). Crude analysis showed a non-statistically significant difference in CFR between Lakka-ETC and Goderich-ETC-ICU patient admissions (57.7 vs 50.0%; 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.19) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age and viral load were independently associated with an increase in EVD mortality. The best model (according to the lowest AIC) for predicting the probability of death included age, LVL, ETC, and the interaction between LVL and ETC. As known, an interaction involving a continuous variable (like LVL) is difficult to represent. Hence, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> we plotted, as a function of LVL, both the OR for mortality of Lakka vs Goderich (left panel) and the probability of death at each ETC (right panel). In the left panel, the 95% confidence band of the OR (light grey) never exceeds one, while the 80% confidence band (dark grey) exceeds one for medium–high viral loads (LVL between 7.5 and 8.5).
