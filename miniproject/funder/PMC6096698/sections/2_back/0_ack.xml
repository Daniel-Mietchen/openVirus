 <p>Goderich ETC was built by the Royal Engineers as a proxy for the Department for International Development, UK Government (DFID), in cooperation with EMERGENCY’s Technical Division. The ETC’s operations were cofounded by DFID and private donations to EMERGENCY. The virology laboratory was upgraded with the support of a grant from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs–Direzione General per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo (DGCS). INMI’s research activities were performed thanks to grants from the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca Corrente IRCCS and Ricerca Finalizzata). Deployment of laboratory personnel was made possible by a grant from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs–DGCS. We thank the EMLab European consortium (IFS/2011/272–372;

SF was supported by Fondazione Cariplo through Grant [2014–1962]. The authors thank Joanne Fleming for her help with the English editing of the text and Alessandro Soave for his help with figures editing.
