    <td align="left" colspan="2">An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as part of an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) was run by the NGO EMERGENCY and the Istituto Malattie Infettive “Spallanzani” in Goderich, Sierra Leone during the last 5 months in the 2013-16 outbreak. Building and running an ICU with western standard in an ETC was possible also in this very difficult setting. This allowed also some research activity, essential to evaluate the interventions directly on the field in real life conditions during an epidemic and with the pressure of large numbers of cases.
     <break/>The outcome of the 106 patients treated in the ICU-ETC was compared in a before-after study to the outcome of the previous cohort of 123 patients treated by the same NGO in Lakka without an ICU facility. Patient risk factors, mainly the viral load at admission were adjusted as potential confounders. The availability of the ICU in the ETC led to a lower mortality in Goderich (p=0.055). This difference was observed with 80% confidence for patients with an intermediate range of viral load, indicating an intermediate probability of death (50-70%). Relatively small numbers in each subgroup and other possible risk factors limit this analysis.
     <break/>The already high level of care in Lakka, the first ETC, corresponding essentially to the recently published guidelines, can be improved with the availability of an Intensive Care Unit. However also the maximal supportive effort without effective antivirals seems not able to lower mortality to an acceptable level. Intensive care and effective antiviral seem both necessary in the fight against Ebola.
