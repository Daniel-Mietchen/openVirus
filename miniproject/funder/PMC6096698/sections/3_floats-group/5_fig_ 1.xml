  <p>Left panel: 95% (light gray) and 80% (dark gray) confidence bands of the OR of Lakka ETC vs Goderich ETC by LVL at admission. Right panel: confidence bands of probability of death by LVL at admission, stratified by ETC: The two 80% confidence bands of the probability of death (dark grey for ETC Lakka, dark blue for ETC-ICU Goderich) do not overlap at LVL values between 7.4 and 8.5, whereas the two 95% confidence bands (light grey, light blue) are not separate. The plot shows that mortality at Lakka steadily increased with the rise in viral load, even for low-medium LVL levels. Conversely, in the medium viral load range, i.e. for LVL up to around 8.3, mortality at Goderich increased less substantially with the increase in LVL. Mortality at the two ETCs was similar at higher viral loads</p>
