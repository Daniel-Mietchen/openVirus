  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.</title>
  <p>Monophyletic clusters are shown in greyed boxes, defined as clusters with a branch support (aLRT-SH) &gt;0.9 and with &gt;80% sequences obtained from Gondar. Tips are coloured according to collection place. The colour code is indicated in the top of the left panel. A red square at a tip indicates a DRM sequence. (Left panel) The C-SA and Câ€™-ET clades. The branch separating the two clades are indicated with an asterisk and is represented by a branch support of &gt;0.9. (Right panel) The C-EA clade phylogeny.</p>
