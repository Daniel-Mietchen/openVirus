<p>To study the timing of introductions and differences between the different subtype C clades clusters, we performed Bayesian coalescent analysis using BEAST with sequences obtained from Gondar only (n = 301). Since the Maximum likelihood phylogeny showed that the strains of the different clades in Gondar were dispersed among sequences of other origins and most likely represented multiple introductions, the estimated root tMRCAs of each subtype C clade represent the date of the origin of the circulating subtype C clades in the region (although only Gondar sequences were used in the date estimations) while the estimated tMRCA of the transmission clusters should approximate introductions and local spread of the viral strains in Gondar, cf references [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The age of the transmission clusters ranged from estimated dates of 1980–2009. The oldest clusters were estimated to 1980, 1983 and 1990 for C-EA, C-SA and C’-ET, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Fifteen of the 28 clusters had estimated tMRCAs before year 2000. The 15 C-EA and two C-SA transmission clusters had the oldest estimated median tMRCAs (median dates: 1986 and 1991, respectively), while the 11 C’-ET clusters were younger (median date: 2001). Two C’-ET clusters were young (≤5 years) whereas the large C-EA and network C-SA clusters were estimated to be 28 and 30 years with estimated median tMRCAs of 1985 and 1983, respectively. Taken together, this indicated that the C-EA and C-SA was introduced earlier into Gondar compared to the C’-ET strain. The median population evolutionary rate of C-EA was higher than for C’-ET and C-SA (2.29 x10
 <sup>-3</sup> and 1.85x10
 <sup>-3</sup> versus 1.70x10
 <sup>-3</sup> substitutions/site/year, respectively), however the 95% credible intervals overlapped (
