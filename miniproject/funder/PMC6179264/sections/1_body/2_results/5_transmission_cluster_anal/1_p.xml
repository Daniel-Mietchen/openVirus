<p>Transmission cluster analysis was performed separately for the C-EA and C-SA/C’-ET sequences by constructing new ML trees of the two data sets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205446.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The C-EA phylogeny indicated that the sequences from Gondar as well as sequences from other cities in Ethiopia intermixed with the global dataset (mostly with sequences from other East African countries and Europe). The C-SA/C’-ET phylogeny showed a clear separation of the two clades similar to that seen for the subtyping phylogeny of the whole data set (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). While the C-SA clade mostly contained sequences of southern African countries, sequences of Gondar were intermixed in the phylogeny. The C’-ET clade consisted mostly of Ethiopian, followed by sequences obtained in Europe and North America. Gondar transmission clusters were defined as statistically supported phylogenetic clusters dominated by Gondar sequences (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s004">S3 Table</xref>). In total, we identified 28 clusters (which together contained 35% [105 of 301] of the sequences from Gondar) which was indicative for multiple introductions of HIV into Gondar followed by local spread (21 dyads, six medium sized clusters/networks and one large clusters;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s004">S3 Table</xref>). The Gondar C-EA sequences were found more frequently in transmission clusters compared to the C’-ET sequences (38% [68 of 177 sequences] in 15 local transmission clusters versus 23% [22 out of 97 sequences] in 11 clusters); p = 0.010, FET). Likewise, C-SA sequences were found more frequently in clusters (56% [15 of 27]) compared to C’-ET (p = 0.002, FET) while there were no difference between the number of C-EA and C-SA sequences in cluster (p = 0.098, FET). The mean cluster size for C-EA was five Gondar sequences/cluster (range: 2–28). Nine C-EA clusters had two sequences/cluster (dyads), five had ≥3–8 sequences/cluster while one cluster was large and contained 32 sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205446.g002">Fig 2</xref>). All C’-ET clusters were represented as dyads while the C-SA clusters was represented by one dyad and one cluster with 13 members. Among C-EA, six of 15 clusters contained &gt;2 sequences which was higher than for C’-ET (none of the 11 clusters had more than two sequences; p = 0.020, FET) but this difference was not apparent between C-EA and C-SA (one cluster contained &gt;2 sequences; p = 1.000, FET). Nine of the 15 C-EA clusters, seven of the 12 C’-ET clusters and one of the two C-SA clusters contained sequences of participants obtained in more than one of the surveys conducted in Gondar 2003–2013 indicated that clusters were populated over time in Gondar (
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, eight of the 28 clusters (three C-EA clusters, three C’-ET and both of the C-SA clusters) had members from the last survey conducted 2011–2013, indicating recent transmissions within these clusters.
