<p>Analysis of HIV DRMs of two previous studies from Gondar after ART roll out in 2009 and 2010 as described in Methods, revealed levels comparable to our threshold study (4.4–8.2% versus 6.0%;

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These estimates were higher than the levels reported in the study performed before ART roll-out in Gondar 2003 (3.3%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the confidence intervals of the levels of DRMs were largely overlapping between the studies and the proportion of DRMs before and after ART roll out were not different (p = 0.584, FET; 
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). DRMs of the previous three studies were as in the present study, most often associated with NNRTIs. Taken together, the G190A/S/E mutations were most prominent (seven of the 12 NNRTI mutations), followed by the K103N, Y181I/C and K101E substitutions (two, two and one, respectively). Mutations conferring resistance to NRTIs and PIs were found in earlier studies at low levels (1.0–1.9%) but were not identified in the present study (
