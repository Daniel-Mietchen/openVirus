<p>Sequences with DRMs were found more frequently in clusters among the C-EA compared to the C’-ET sequences (57% versus 25%; p&lt;0.001, FET). The C-EA Cluster 12 represented the largest cluster and contained several sub-clusters indicating a large transmission network in Gondar over an extended time period. In subcluster 12a, four of nine sequences carried the G190A mutation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205446.g002">Fig 2</xref>) which suggested cluster-associated transmission of this resistance mutation in Gondar. To verify the age estimate of cluster 12 we obtained dated phylogenies using the Bayesian MCMC method by using sequences of this cluster only in the analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s004">S3 Table</xref>). The median estimated evolutionary rate of the cluster was 1.34×10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year, slower than the median rate estimate of the entire C-EA cluster but with overlapping credible intervals (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Moreover, the median tMRCA of cluster 12 was estimated to 1980 (95% HPD: 1969–1989) which was similar to the estimate (1985; 95% HPD: 1967–1985) obtained from the analysis of all Gondar sequences (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Since the internode intervals in the MCMC tree represent the maximum transmission time intervals, we estimated the time between transmissions events. Analysis of the internode intervals (from the MCMC tree; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s006">S2 Fig</xref>) revealed that the maximum median transmission intervals for cluster 12 were 1.58 years (IQR: 1.24–2.31). The median parametric estimate of the population growth rate also indicated frequent transmissions associated with sequences of cluster 12 at approximately 0.5 new infections/individual/year which correspond to a median doubling time of infections every 1.34 years (16 months). The demographic plot analysis indicated that this cluster increased in size and the number of effective infections, N
 <sub>e</sub>, reached its peak in 2003, but declined thereafter (from 4990 in 2003 to 2404 in 2013; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>). However, the four sequences that had the G190A mutation were collected during three of the four surveillance studies in Gondar 2003–2013 (
