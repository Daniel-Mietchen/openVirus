<p>Phylogenetic subtyping revealed that 94% (63 of 67) of study participants enrolled 2011–2013 were infected with HIV-1 subtype C, while the remaining four study participants had subtype A, B or A/C recombinant sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Since previous observations have suggested more rapid expansion of the C’-ET strains than the C-EA strains in Ethiopia, we further investigated the distribution of our sequences into different subtype C clades [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Detailed analysis indicated that 59 of 63 sequences represented the three major subtype C clades: C-EA (n = 30), C’-ET (n = 16) and C-SA (n = 13), while four sequences were putative C-EA/C’-ET recombinants (

For in-depth phylogenetic analysis, we next constructed a new data set that represented non-recombinant subtype C sequences of the current study (n = 59), the three previous studies from Gondar in 2003–2010 (n = 242) and a Genbank reference data set (n = 190), resulting in a final data set of 491 sequences collected 1986–2013 (n = 301 from Gondar; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Phylogenetic subtyping using all 491 sequences revealed that sequences fell into one of the three subtype C clades (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). Among the 301 sequences from Gondar, 59% (n = 177) were classified as C-EA, 32% (n = 97) as C’-ET and 9% (n = 27) as C-SA. Notably, sequences of the C-SA clade have not been described in Ethiopia previously and the proportion of this clade in Gondar increased from 2% in 2003 to 23% in 2012 (p&lt;0.001, two-tailed linear-by-linear test for association) while there was a modest decline of the two major clades (C-EA: 60%-51%; C’-ET: 38%-26%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205446.g001">Fig 1</xref>) during the same time period. However, the proportion of C-EA remained higher than C’-ET and C-SA at each time point 2003–2013. Further analysis of the temporal changes revealed that there was no changes of the proportions of the C-EA and C’-ET clades in Gondar during the same time period (p = 0.146 and p = 0.173, respectively, two-tailed linear-by-linear test for association). Among the sequences with DRMs identified in Gondar (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s003">S2 Table</xref>), 13 were classified as belonging to the C-EA clade, two to the each of the C’-ET and C-SA clades, however, there were no association of DRMs to either of the clades (C-EA vs C’-ET, p = 0.095; C-EA vs C-SA, p = 1.000; and C’-ET vs C-SA, p = 0.210; FET for all comparisons).
