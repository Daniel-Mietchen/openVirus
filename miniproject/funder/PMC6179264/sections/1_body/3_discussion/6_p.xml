<p>In conclusion, our study showed a moderate prevalence of TDR in Gondar. We could also demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized diversity of the HIV-1 epidemic in the area, and confirm pervious reports that the two subtype C clades, C-EA and C’-ET, are dominant in Ethiopia but our study showed an increased diversity in the epidemic since we showed multiple introductions and that viral strains of the C-SA clade, prevalent in southern Africa, has been introduced and increased in prevalence in Gondar 2003–2013. We also show differences in transmission clusters sizes of the different subtype C clades and association with DRMs. These findings provide epidemiological insights not available using standard surveillance approaches and may inform the improvement of public health strategies in HIV prevention in Ethiopia and similar LMIC settings.</p>
