<p>Besides being associated with more sequences and larger clusters, the CEA clade was also associated with clustering of DRM sequences. The role of DRMs in clustered transmission has been addressed in a number of studies. Previous studies of the Swiss HIV cohort, indicated that TDR viruses were more associated with clustering compared to non-TDR viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. An association between clustering and increased transmission of viruses harbouring NNRTI DRMs, including the G190A DRM found here, has been described in Quebec, Canada. Transmission clustering were also associated with sexual behaviour, mainly that of MSM [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the present study, we identified one cluster with the G190A mutation with onward transmissions of this DRM for at least 8 years (2003–2010). The G190A mutation represents a slowly reverting HIVDR mutation and when such mutations are present in a population with frequent transmission it might persist and expand [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. We estimated that the entire large cluster and the G190A cluster had transmission intervals at least every year. Since not all members of a given transmission cluster have been sampled, the average time between transmissions is overestimated since the transmission chain is incomplete, suggesting that transmissions have taken place at a much higher rate [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In fact, many molecular epidemiology studies suffer from low sampling, representing only a fraction of all infected individuals at the time of the study. The 301 sequences from Gondar (population: ~207,000) 2003–2013 were estimated to roughly represent 1.3% of the infected population during the study period (considering a mean prevalence of 10.6% 2003–2014; [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Methods). Using a linear projection the cluster could be up to 75 times larger, i.e cluster 12 with 32 individual specimens may represent 2400 individual or more in the cluster (which could be compared with the estimated number of effective infections in 2013 of 2400 of the demographic plot analysis; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>) and the G190A associated subcluster 12a of about 450 individuals. Although these numbers represent a rough estimate it illustrates the impact of fast onward transmission that is commonly seen among groups with recent infections and/or with high risk of HIV acquisitions. Fast transmission times may favour the accumulation of TDR mutations especially when transmission times are faster than the average time of reversions of the mutations.
