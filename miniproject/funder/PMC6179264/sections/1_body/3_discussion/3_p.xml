<p>The DRMs detected in this study were all associated with the NNRTIs efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP). This finding is not unexpected considering the low genetic barrier of these drugs to the development of resistance and their wide use as part of first line ART regimen [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, strains with NNRTIs mutations may persist for a long time before being replaced by wild type making the likelihood of persistence after transmission higher [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In line with this, previous studies have reported significant global increases of NNRTI TDR over time since ART rollout, especially in East Africa, with an estimated 36% per year increases after ART roll out [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Compared to the previous studies conducted in Gondar we did not find DRMs associated with PIs and NRTIs, which could be attributed to a generally low sample size often seen in threshold studies. Thus, NNRTIs are associated with both acquired and transmitted resistance in Ethiopia, as is the case in many other LMICs, and represents an obstacle to the long-term success of ART and control of HIV transmission. As more individuals initiate ART, these observations advocate that more robust and durable first line regimens and/or improved ART monitoring are required [
