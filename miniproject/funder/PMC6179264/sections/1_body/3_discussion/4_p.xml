<p>Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple introductions of HIV in Gondar, followed by local transmission, a phenomenon that has been described previously for other local HIV epidemics [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Our study confirms previous observations and argues against the hypothesis that a single initial lineage was introduced and became responsible for the subtype C epidemic in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our study also confirms pervious reports that the two subtype C clades, C-EA and C’-ET, are dominant in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found that the C-EA clade has been the most prevalent HIV clade in Gondar 2003–2013 since it represented the major circulating strain in Gondar at the end of the study period, as we found no evidence of significant temporal changes during this time period. However, we also show that the HIV strains of the C-SA clades, the most prevalent HIV subtype C strains prevalent in Southern Africa, have been introduced in Ethiopia, and became increasingly prevalent in Gondar 2003–2013. Sequences belonging to the C-EA clade were found to be more prevalent in clusters and were also associated with larger clusters compared to the sequences of the C’-ET clade indicating a variable intensity of the C-EA and C’-ET epidemics in Gondar. The C-EA and C’-ET strains were introduced from East Africa and Southern Africa respectively, at approximately the same time into Ethiopia (1978–1981)[
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our evolutionary estimates were in the range of previous estimates of subtype C and the oldest Gondar transmission clusters dated back to 1980 (C-EA), 1983 (C-SA) and 1990 (C’-ET) supporting the presence of strains of different subtype C clades at about the same time point in Gondar [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We were able to identify old transmission clusters, since our definition of clusters followed an approach, which omitted the use of a distance cut-off, and thereby not excluding long lasting transmission chains [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our finding showed that some clusters were long-lived and could have played an important impact in fuelling the local HIV epidemic. The larger old clusters (C-SA cluster 1 and C-EA cluster 12) had been populated until recently since the initial introduction in Gondar in the 1980s. Long-lived, large clusters have been shown to be associated with transmission of HIV in groups with high risk behaviour [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This finding was further supported by the observation that the majority of clusters contained sequences isolated in two or more of the surveys conducted in Gondar 2003–2013. The propensity of CEA sequences to be part of clusters compared to the C’-ET could be associated with sociodemographic factors and/or underling biological differences of the CEA and C’-ET viruses. Recent infection, age, gender, drug resistance and unawareness of infection status of sexually active individuals have been shown to represent risk factors associated with transmission potential and cluster size [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Transmission cluster of populations with high risk of HIV acquisition are larger compared to that populations with lower risk behaviour, for example between men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual networks in Europe and USA, and among recently infected individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that all transmission clusters among the C’-ET sequences represented dyads, that is, a pattern associated with less onward transmission that may represent sporadic transmission among couples and/or individuals with lower number of partners [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Since we had no data regarding risk behaviours of the study participants, further studies are needed to establish any association between risk behaviours and gender as well as other sociodemographic factors with clustering of the different subtype C strains in Ethiopia. Moreover, it has previously been suggested that biological differences between the two Ethiopian strains may be coupled to transmissibility due to a generally higher viral load among patients infected with C’-ET which has been suggested as an explanation for an observed abundance of the C’-ET strain in Ethiopia in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, our results indicated a higher prevalence of C-EA in Gondar 2003–2013 and further studies are needed to establish any association between biological properties, replicative capacity, disease progression, risk behaviours and transmission rates among the strains of the Ethiopian subtype C clades [
