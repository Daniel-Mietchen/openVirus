<p>This study represents the first threshold survey for DRM performed among young ART-naïve HIV-1 positive individuals in Gondar, Northern Ethiopia, using the WHO threshold methodology. We also used the sequence data obtained from drug resistance analysis together with sequence data obtained from previous studies for a detailed molecular epidemiological investigation of the HIV epidemic in Gondar. Detailed analysis stratified on the three subtype C clades identified transmission clusters in Gondar 2003–2013, which comprised 35% of all available sequences during this time. This finding indicated that HIV-1 has been introduced on multiple occasions, followed by local transmissions. Dated phylogenies revealed that about half of the local clusters originated before 2000. However, several of the clusters were long lasting and in some cases ongoing active transmission chains were detected. Importantly, we show that the G190A mutation has spread in Gondar by rapid transmission within local clusters. Even though DRM transmission within clusters has been described in other parts of the world, this is, to our knowledge, the first example of cluster-associated DRM transmission in sub Saharan Africa.</p>
