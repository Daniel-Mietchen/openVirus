<p>For the purpose of a comprehensive analysis of temporal changes of subtype C clades over time in Gondar, subtype C clades were identified using ML phylogenetic tree analysis. For the purpose of transmission cluster analysis, we followed a methodology described previously and included a data set of similar sequences from GenBank by identifying the ten best scoring GenBank sequences with BLAST for each of the Gondar sequences in the study [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The final data set contained 491 sequences (n = 299 from Gondar and n = 192 GenBank reference sequences; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s003">S2 Table</xref>) which were used to define local (Gondar) transmission clusters. Transmission clusters were defined as described previously [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, a transmission cluster was defined as a cluster in the ML phylogeny from root to tips. A cluster with an aLRT SH-support of ≥0.9 that had a majority (at least 80%) of sequences from Gondar was considered as a Gondar (local) transmission cluster. Transmission clusters were defined based on their sizes (number of sequences/cluster), into dyads (two sequences), medium sized clusters/networks (3–14 sequences) and large clusters (≥15 sequences) [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Clusters sharing &gt;33% of the same DRM were defined as a putative drug resistance transmission clusters [
