<p>To estimate an evolutionary rate for each of the three clades which were needed to perform dated cluster analysis using phylodynamic analyses, three data sets were assembled, containing both global and Ethiopian sequences which were considered to be representative for the different clades. This approach has been used previously for HIV-1 subtype B [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The analysis was performed using the sequences shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Fig</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s003">S2 Table</xref>, by randomly selecting a subset of sequences from each clade (N = 86, N = 65 and N = 70 for C-EA, C’-ET and C-SA, respectively). A maximum of one sequence of each transmission cluster was allowed in the final data set. For the data set containing the southern African clade (C-SA) sequences, the temporal signal was weak (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.03), as assessed by root-to-tip analysis using TempEst, indicating that the data set was not optimal for estimating reliable substitution rates, while the R
 <sup>2</sup> was higher for the C-EA and C’-ET clades (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.35 and 0.22, respectively), indicating a better temporal signal in the datasets [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We therefore estimated the substitution rates for the C-EA and C’-ET sequences only and relied on previous estimates for the C-SA clades (see below). For these analyses we centered the prior mean rate at 0.001 substitutions/site/year and specified the standard deviation to 0.33 on a lognormal distribution such that the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the distribution contained the rates obtained previously of HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> of subtype C [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The evolutionary rate was estimated by employing the Bayesian Markov Chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) clock method implemented in the BEAST software package v1.8.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We estimated the evolutionary rate using both a strict and relaxed Bayesian MCMC clock, in both cases with a flexible demographic model (the Bayesian skyline plot) as a tree prior. This analysis estimated posterior distribution of median rates for the C-EA and C’-ET clades to 1.26 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> (95% HPD: 8.80x10
 <sup>-4</sup>–1.64x10
 <sup>-3</sup>) and 1.44x10
 <sup>-3</sup> (95% HPD: 9.70x10
 <sup>-4</sup>–1.91x10
 <sup>-3</sup>) substitutions/site/year, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Using these rates as priors, subsequent BEAST analysis was performed on the C-EA and C’-ET sequences obtained from Gondar only while a previous evolutionary rate of 2.15x10-3 (1.79x10
 <sup>-3</sup>–2.60x10
 <sup>-3</sup>, 95% HPD) substitutions/site/year was used as a prior for the C-SA sequences of Gondar [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In all cases, a lognormal distribution on the rate prior was employed, as described above, such that the prior mean rate was centered at each clade-specific mean rate and that the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the distribution contained the rates obtained from the above analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>). For all analyses we used both strict and relaxed clock models and specified a codon position partitioning model (the SRD06 model) for all data sets [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We also employed different demographic tree priors on each data set, the skyride, the logistic and exponential demographic models implemented in BEAST (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Model comparisons were done by Bayes factor (BF) analysis of marginal likelihoods [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. BF values larger than 3 and 5 were considered to represent strong and very strong evidence respectively, against H
 <sub>0</sub> [
