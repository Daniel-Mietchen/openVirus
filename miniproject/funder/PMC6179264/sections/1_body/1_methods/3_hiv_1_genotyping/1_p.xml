 <italic>pol</italic> (corresponding to the position: 2243–3326 of HXB2, Genbank Accession Number: K03455) comprising amino acids 6–99 of the protease (PR) and 1–251 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified using an in-house genotyping assay as described in [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s001">S1 Text</xref>. PCR products were directly sequenced using six primers (three on each strand) on an ABI 3100 or an ABI 3500xl DNA Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence assembly and editing were performed using RECall V 2.0 HIV-1 sequencing analysis tool [
