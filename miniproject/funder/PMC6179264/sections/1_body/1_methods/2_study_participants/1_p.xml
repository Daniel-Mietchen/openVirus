<p>Individuals with new diagnosed HIV infection, among VCT clients at the two survey sites were asked to participate in the study. By adopting the WHO recommended inclusion criterion, participants 18–25 years old, who had no prior history of HIV/AIDS-related illness and no history of ART, resident of Gondar for more than a year, and had no history of previous pregnancy were consecutively enrolled. After obtaining written informed consent, 10 ml of blood was collected by venepuncture. Screening for HIV was done using point of care rapid testing format employed for HIV diagnosis in Ethiopia. This algorithm uses HIV (1 + 2) Antibody Colloidal Gold (KHB, Shanghai Kehua Bio-engineering Co Ltd, China) as a screening test, followed by HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK (Chembio Diagnostics, USA) if positive. In cases with negative STAT-PAK results following a positive KHB test, a third test, Unigold HIV (Trinity Biotech, Ireland), was used as confirmation. Specimens were transported to Ethiopia Public Health Institute, National HIV laboratory, Addis Ababa (a WHO accredited laboratory for genotyping) on dry ice for long term storage at -80°C until genotyping. At the time of blood sampling basic demographic and clinical information, including age, gender, and history of HIV test was collected using a standardized questionnaire.</p>
