<p>To further dissect the subtype C distribution in Gondar, sub-subtyping into subtype C clades and detection of putative intra-subtype C recombinants were performed using sequences obtained from this study population and all previously reported HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Gondar [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, reference sequences of the three subtype C clades were obtained as described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Putative intra-subtype recombinant subtype C sequences were identified by jpHMM [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] using parameters as outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205446.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The final subtyping ML tree is shown in
