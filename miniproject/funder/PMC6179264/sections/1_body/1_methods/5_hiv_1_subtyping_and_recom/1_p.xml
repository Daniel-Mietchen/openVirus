<p>Sequence quality control was performed using the online Quality Control program of the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (hiv.lanl.gov). The REGA and Comet online subtyping tools were used for initial classification into subtypes and inter-subtype recombinants [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Putative intra-subtype recombinants were verified using Simplot ver. 3.5.1[
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All sequences were also screened for recombination using RDP ver. 3.44 [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and then edited to a final length of 1044 bases using BioEdit v4.0.6 (

A Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed using the online version of PhyML with the GTR+I+Γ nucleotide substitution model (using estimated proportion of invariable sites and four gamma categories) and NNI plus SPR to estimate the tree topology. Branch support was determined with aLRT-SH (approximate likelihood ratio test Shimodaira-Hasegawa like) implemented in PhyML. A branch in the phylogeny with an aLRT-SH value ≥0.9 was considered significant [
