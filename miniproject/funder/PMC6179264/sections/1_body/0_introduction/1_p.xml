<p>The global scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in decline in HIV related morbidity, mortality and HIV transmission. In most low and middle income countries (LMIC) standardized first line antiretroviral regimens are used, consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)] [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR), particularly towards drugs with low genetic barriers, eg. NNRTIs, has been shown to increase with time after introduction of ART programs [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One explanation for this is likely to be the lack of routine monitoring of plasma viral load, which has not been scaled up at the same rate as ART service expansion (ART roll-out) [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This leads to delayed identification of patients with treatment failure, with risk of accumulation of drug resistance mutations (DRM) in such individuals. Furthermore, individuals with unrecognized virological treatment failure are potential reservoirs for onwards transmission of viruses with DRM (commonly referred to as transmitted drug resistance; TDR) [

 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. If this occurs in populations with high incidence and at high risk of onward transmissions, the prevalence of drug resistant HIV strains may increase and be further amplified in the population [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, the emergence of drug resistant viral strains constitutes a threat to the outcome of ART programs [
