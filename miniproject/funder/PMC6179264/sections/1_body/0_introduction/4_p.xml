<p>The Ethiopian HIV epidemic is dominated by HIV subtype C, similar to the countries of Southern Africa, and although Ethiopia shares borders with countries were subtypes A and D are common, these subtypes have rarely been identified in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that two distinct subtype C strains are co-circulating in Ethiopia, designated C and C’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and recombinant forms of the C and C’ strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Ten distinct subtype C clades (termed C1-C10) have been defined based on phylogenetic relationship. Clades C1-C9 were mainly represented by sequences obtained from countries in southern Africa while the C10 clade represented sequences from East and Central Africa[
 <xref rid="pone.0205446.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further molecular characterization revealed that the Ethiopian C strain were similar to strains circulating in other East African countries while the C’ strain were shown to represented a distinct subclade of a southern African clade. Thus, based on previous phylogenetic studies, the African subtype C stains can be divided into three major groups: the southern African subtype C clades (C-SA), the Ethiopian C’ clade (C’-ET), and the central and east African subtype C clade (C-EA) [
