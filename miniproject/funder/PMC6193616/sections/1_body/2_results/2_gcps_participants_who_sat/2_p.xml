<p>There was a substantial overlap of risk practices. In particular, gay men who reported crystal methamphetamine use, or a recent STI diagnosis were very likely to also report receptive CLAI, and therefore adding crystal use and STIs, as criteria did not substantially increase the proportion of men eligible for PrEP. Thus, a total of 9.7% (95%CI: 9.0%-10.4%) of the selected subsample of gay men in GCPS were classified as at high risk for HIV and eligible for PrEP under the conservative scenario and 28.4% (95%CI: 27.4%-29.5%) under the relaxed scenario.</p>
