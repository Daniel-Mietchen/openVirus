<p>In 2015, 6,676 participants of the GCPS were 16â€“69 year old, sexually active gay men of HIV negative or unknown status. 
 <xref rid="pone.0204138.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents the proportions of men who satisfied the behavioural eligibility criteria for PrEP according to the lowest and highest plausible scenarios described above. Notably, only 0.02% of gay men in this sample were classified as eligible for PrEP based on having CLAI with an HIV positive regular male partner who had a detectable HIV viral load. The most common risk factor in both conservative and highest plausible estimation scenarios was receptive CLAI with any casual male partner in the last six months (6.1% (95% Confidence Interval (95%CI):5.6%-6.7%) and 15.5% (95%CI: 14.6%-16.4%) of GCPS participants, respectively).
