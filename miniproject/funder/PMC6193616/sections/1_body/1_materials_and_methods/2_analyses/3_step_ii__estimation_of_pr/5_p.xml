<p>For the lowest plausible (conservative) estimate of gay men eligible for PrEP, to meet the “high and ongoing risk” guideline requirement, we required men to: 1) have more than 10 sex partners in the last six months (except for men whose risk was from a regular partner); 2) have receptive CLAI frequently in the last six months. and/or 3) use crystal methamphetamine at least monthly in the last 6 months.</p>
