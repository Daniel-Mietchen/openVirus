<p>We assumed that the selected GCPS participants were representative of all adult sexually active gay men in Australia and applied the proportions calculated in Step II to the number of Australian gay men at risk for HIV derived in Step I, to estimate the number of gay men eligible for PrEP based on each of the scenarios. Uncertainty was accounted for by computing the 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for proportions for each of the upper and lower estimates.</p>
