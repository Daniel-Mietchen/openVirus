<p>One of the determinants of PrEP cost-effectiveness is how well it is targeted to those at high HIV risk. So far, there has been no universal approach to PrEP targeting. Current WHO guidelines recommend prescribing PrEP to populations with an estimated HIV incidence of at least 3 per 100 person years [
