<p>Co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, (TDF/FTC, marketed as TruvadaÂ® [
 <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) has been widely used for HIV treatment. It has now been approved with an HIV prevention indication as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), first in the US [
 <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and recently in several other countries including Australia [
 <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], where tenofovir disoproxil maleate and tenofovir disoproxil phosphate, both co-formulated with emtricitabine, have been approved also. PrEP use is supported by evidence from at least fifteen clinical trials and three observational studies which demonstrated that daily oral TDF/FTC is safe and effective in preventing HIV infection in adherent men who have sex with men, heterosexual men and women in HIV-discordant couples or recruited as individuals, and people who inject drugs [
 <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2015, two landmark European trials, IPERGAY and PROUD, each reported an 86% HIV-risk reduction due to the use of TDF/FTC as PrEP in men who have sex with men at high risk for HIV infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Results from these two studies alleviated concerns about possible poor PrEP adherence among high HIV-risk people and brought about a turning point in PrEP implementation.
