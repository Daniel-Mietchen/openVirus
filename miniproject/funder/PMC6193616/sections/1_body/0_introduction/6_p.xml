<p>Submissions to have medicines made available through the PBS at subsidised cost require sponsors to demonstrate that the proposed listing is cost-effective. An essential part of this assessment is to have reliable estimates of the size of the population likely to use the medication. This paper presents the estimate of potential PrEP users to inform consideration of submissions for PBS listing of PrEP and also to inform planning of PrEP access studies in various Australian States/Territories referred to earlier.</p>
