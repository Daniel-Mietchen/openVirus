<p>We estimated that approximately 10,000 to 31,000 (9.7% to 28.4%) of gay men in Australia would be eligible for PrEP depending on the interpretation of behavioural eligibility criteria. Corrected for the uncertainty associated with the use of sample proportions, the range of gay men eligible for PrEP ranged from 9,500 to 32,000. The higher estimate included men who might only occasionally be at high-risk of HIV and men with fewer partners.</p>
