<p>Our analysis was limited to gay men. While certain sub-groups of heterosexual adults at high risk of acquiring HIV and people who inject drugs are also eligible for PrEP under the Australian PrEP guidelines, there are no specific indicators readily available to calculate the size of these groups. For men who have sex with men, we restricted our calculations to only those identifying as gay. Sexual practices of gay men, particularly those who engage in gay community life, have been studied in detail in Australia, because this is the population group that is most affected by HIV. Indeed, the large majority of men who have sex with men recruited by Australian studies represent gay men. Men who do not identify as gay were not included in analyses because less is known about their sexual practices and they would be substantially less likely to disclose them to a medical practitioner to obtain PrEP. We also note the limitations in our estimates associated with our input indicators from GCPS. These surveys assess practices of gay men in the preceding 6â€“12 months while behavioural eligibility criteria in the Australian PrEP guidelines recommend assessing practices in the last 3 months (as is more common in clinical settings). It is also important to acknowledge the uncertainty of all behavioural indicators which are self-reported and can be prone to recall and reporting biases.</p>
