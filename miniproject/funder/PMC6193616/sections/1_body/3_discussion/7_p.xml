<p>Some local governments in Australia have already made steps towards PrEP implementation and subsidized limited PrEP access programs. The two largest PrEP access trials—Expanded PrEP Implementation in Communities in NSW (EPIC-NSW) and PrEPX in Victoria—are already actively providing PrEP to over 11,000 high-risk individuals by the end of October 2017. Both trials were informed by our estimates of PrEP eligibility at the state level.</p>
