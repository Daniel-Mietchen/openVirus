Using input indicators from the <italic>Australian Bureau of Statistics</italic>, the national representative survey <italic>Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships</italic>, <italic>and</italic> national HIV- behavioural surveillance, we calculated the size of the population of sexually active gay men and estimated a range for the number eligible for PrEP using different scenarios based on the guidelines. In 2015, an estimated 108,850 sexually-active 16-69-year-old gay men were classified as at risk of acquiring HIV in Australia. Of these men, 10,558 to 30,913 (9.7%-28.4%) were classified as being at high risk and therefore eligible for PrEP, most commonly due to recent receptive condomless intercourse with casual partners (6.1% to 15.5%), STI infections (5.4% to 10.6%) or the use of crystal methamphetamine (1.4% to 9.4%). The higher estimates included men who may have been at HIV risk for shorter time periods or with fewer partners. Australian PrEP guidelines recommend targeting PrEP to people at high HIV risk. Our estimation of potential PrEP users informed PrEP implementation in Australia. The choice of PrEP eligibility criteria, and interpretation of the guidelines, strongly affects the population estimates. In the future, higher numbers of gay men may become eligible for PrEP, because the estimates are largely defined by and follow trends in condomless anal intercourse. Our estimation methods can be adapted to other settings.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The Kirby Institute receives funding from the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing.</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>IBZ has received funding from Gilead Sciences.

It has now been approved with an HIV prevention indication as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), first in the US [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and recently in several other countries including Australia [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], where tenofovir disoproxil maleate and tenofovir disoproxil phosphate, both co-formulated with emtricitabine, have been approved also. PrEP use is supported by evidence from at least fifteen clinical trials and three observational studies which demonstrated that daily oral TDF/FTC is safe and effective in preventing HIV infection in adherent men who have sex with men, heterosexual men and women in HIV-discordant couples or recruited as individuals, and people who inject drugs [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2015, two landmark European trials, IPERGAY and PROUD, each reported an 86% HIV-risk reduction due to the use of TDF/FTC as PrEP in men who have sex with men at high risk for HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Results from these two studies alleviated concerns about possible poor PrEP adherence among high HIV-risk people and brought about a turning point in PrEP implementation.</p><p>Although PrEP for high-risk populations is now recommended by national or regional guidelines in the US [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], Australia [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and a number of other countries [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as well as in international WHO guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], access to PrEP remains limited. In the US, universal PrEP access has not yet been achieved; only some locations (e.g., San Francisco, New York City and Seattle) have reported significant progress [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While PrEP is expected to have a substantial impact on HIV epidemics worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the uptake of PrEP remains limited, partly due to the high cost of TDF/FTC [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in settings where cheaper generics are not yet available.</p><p>One of the determinants of PrEP cost-effectiveness is how well it is targeted to those at high HIV risk. So far, there has been no universal approach to PrEP targeting. Current WHO guidelines recommend prescribing PrEP to populations with an estimated HIV incidence of at least 3 per 100 person years [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, country-specific PrEP guidelines differ in their recommendations about how to target PrEP [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

When restrictive criteria were relaxed, the estimated number of gay men eligible for PrEP increased to 30,913 (range: 29,825&#x02013;32,111).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Discussion</title><p>We estimated that approximately 10,000 to 31,000 (9.7% to 28.4%) of gay men in Australia would be eligible for PrEP depending on the interpretation of behavioural eligibility criteria. Corrected for the uncertainty associated with the use of sample proportions, the range of gay men eligible for PrEP ranged from 9,500 to 32,000. The higher estimate included men who might only occasionally be at high-risk of HIV and men with fewer partners.</p><p>The most common behavioural eligibility criterion that was met was engaging in receptive CLAI with casual partners (6.1% to 15.5% of the estimated gay men population), and the second most common criterion was a diagnosis of an anal bacterial STI or syphilis in the last 12 months (4.9% to 10.6%). Depending on frequency of use, only 1.4% to 9.4% of gay men were eligible for PrEP based on crystal use. The prevalence of all these practices in men not on PrEP has been increasing in the past years and may increase in the future, particularly if PrEP use is associated with increasing CLAI with casual partners [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Based on our estimates, it appears that only a small number of men would be eligible for PrEP because they only have CLAI with an HIV-positive regular male partner who is not on treatment or has a detectable viral load. This is not surprising, as the number of HIV-positive people not on treatment and having detectable viral load is low and declining in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and very few of them are in serodiscordant relationships.</p><p>HIV prevention programs among men who have sex with men commonly experience lack of data about the size of population for targeting&#x02014;this group is difficult to quantify. Our estimates were enabled by 1) data from a nationally representative survey about sexual identity among men as well as their sexually active status [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; 2) pragmatic PrEP guidelines and eligibility criteria which are based on evidence from local observational studies about factors that have contributed to HIV transmission among Australian gay men [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and 3) the availability of national behavioural surveillance data from gay men [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Estimations of potential PrEP users have previously been undertaken in San Francisco [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and nationally in the US [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about 24.7% of sexually active adult men who have sex with men in the US were estimated to be eligible for PrEP based on the 2014 US Public Health Service's PrEP clinical practice guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0204138.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This proportion falls within the range we estimated for the proportion of men who have sex with men who would be eligible for PrEP in Australia.</p><p>Our calculation of the plausible range of men eligible for PrEP will assist in estimating the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the Australian context, and should assist in public health decision making about subsidizing PrEP.</p><p>Some local governments in Australia have already made steps towards PrEP implementation and subsidized limited PrEP access programs. The two largest PrEP access trials&#x02014;Expanded PrEP Implementation in Communities in NSW (EPIC-NSW) and PrEPX in Victoria&#x02014;are already actively providing PrEP to over 11,000 high-risk individuals by the end of October 2017. Both trials were informed by our estimates of PrEP eligibility at the state level.</p><p>Our analysis was limited to gay men. While certain sub-groups of heterosexual adults at high risk of acquiring HIV and people who inject drugs are also eligible for PrEP under the Australian PrEP guidelines, there are no specific indicators readily available to calculate the size of these groups. For men who have sex with men, we restricted our calculations to only those identifying as gay. Sexual practices of gay men, particularly those who engage in gay community life, have been studied in detail in Australia, because this is the population group that is most affected by HIV. Indeed, the large majority of men who have sex with men recruited by Australian studies represent gay men. Men who do not identify as gay were not included in analyses because less is known about their sexual practices and they would be substantially less likely to disclose them to a medical practitioner to obtain PrEP. We also note the limitations in our estimates associated with our input indicators from GCPS. These surveys assess practices of gay men in the preceding 6&#x02013;12 months while behavioural eligibility criteria in the Australian PrEP guidelines recommend assessing practices in the last 3 months (as is more common in clinical settings). It is also important to acknowledge the uncertainty of all behavioural indicators which are self-reported and can be prone to recall and reporting biases.</p><p>The Australian approach to PrEP eligibility, and our estimation of the size of the population eligible for PrEP, was focused on individuals at high risk of HIV. The proportions eligible for PrEP (about 30% in 2015 under the relaxed scenario) appear to be close to the levels of interest and willingness to use PrEP among the Australian gay men <xref rid="pone.0204138.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. If the cost of PrEP declines and access to TDF/FTC improves, interest in PrEP is likely to increase and PrEP targeting could be expanded to also cover people at medium-risk of HIV.</p><p>In conclusion, our relatively simple and straightforward calculation enabled evidence-based decision making about PrEP implementation in Australia and could be used to inform PrEP roll-out in settings with similar HIV transmission patterns, health services and PrEP access.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0204138.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Gilead Sciences.
