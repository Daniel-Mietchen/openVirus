<p>Our study was explorative in nature, and we did not have a formal prespecified analysis plan. First, we determined the spatial distribution in HIV prevalence among adults and young adults by interpolating logit-transformed DHS sample location-level HIV prevalence data using ordinary kriging [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Kriging is an interpolation method based on the spatial autocorrelation of variables [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Spatial autocorrelation was measured by means of Moranâ€™s 
 <italic>I</italic>, using the inverse distance between sample locations as weights. Spatial autocorrelation structures were obtained through semivariogram modelling, in which the average squared difference in HIV prevalence between each pair of data points (on the y-axis) is plotted against the corresponding distance between the point-pairs (on the x-axis). The overall relation between HIV prevalence and distance was estimated by fitting an exponential curve through these points. We used this to create continuous surface maps of HIV prevalence, in which the HIV prevalence at each 5 km
 <sup>2</sup> grid cell was estimated using the aforementioned method. The equations and model estimates are provided in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). We compared the sex-specific surfaces of HIV prevalence by means of mapping the square root of the squared difference in HIV prevalence (per 5 km
 <sup>2</sup> grid cell), to illustrate the absolute differences in HIV prevalence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s012">S10 Fig</xref> panel A), and by plotting the predicted HIV prevalence (per 5 km
 <sup>2</sup> grid cell) of women against the predicted HIV prevalence of men (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s012">S10 Fig</xref> panel C). Both comparisons show that there are only minor differences in terms of the locations of high HIV prevalence for both sexes.
