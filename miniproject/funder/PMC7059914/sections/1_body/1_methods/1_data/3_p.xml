 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]: age, sex, HIV status, educational level, wealth index, primary occupation, whether the person is a de jure household member (usual resident) or de facto household member (slept in the household last night) as a proxy for mobility, number of lifetime sexual partners, number of sexual partners during the past 12 months, having had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or signs of an STI during the past 12 months, condom use during last intercourse, male circumcision, and being paid for sexual intercourse during the past 12 months (only men). HIV status is determined by testing a blood sample from a finger prick with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
