<p>Although mapping overall HIV prevalence in the adult population gives an adequate indication of treatment service needs [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it is not straightforward to use such data to inform policy makers on areas with high levels of transmission, because many, especially older, adults were infected many years prior to any survey and possibly at other locations. Mapping heterogeneity of HIV prevalence in young adults, who are most likely to have been recently infected, will more directly pinpoint areas of high HIV transmission [
