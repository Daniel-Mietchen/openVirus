<p>Our results have important implications for the planning of prevention and treatment programs. High HIV prevalence areas in young adults are likely areas of high transmission [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], requiring prioritization of tailored prevention interventions. Our key findings that (i) high HIV prevalence areas among young adults are located at economically active or developing areas and (ii) that HIV among young adults is driven by risky sexual behaviour; indicate that preventive interventions targeted at young adults at these specific locations could strongly impact HIV transmission. Prevention programs aimed at improving exposure and uptake of effective prevention interventions for young adults [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]–such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], condoms [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]–should be prioritized in these areas. Also, intervention programs for young adults should aim at early diagnosis and treatment initiation of those who get infected with HIV, by creating accessible, affordable and youth-friendly HIV testing and counselling services [

Improving the resilience of affected populations against the associated health risks, might be considered an integral part of such development. Moreover, as the population in these areas is likely to be highly mobile [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], effective prevention for young adults in high-prevalence areas may not only affect the local HIV epidemics, but also the wider epidemic. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that the decade-old mantra of “know your epidemic, know your response” [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] is still highly relevant for SSA. Our study found important common denominators that are associated with increased HIV risk in areas with high levels of transmission, but it will be essential for policy makers to specifically evaluate the behavioural and socioeconomic context, and the interventions already in place at a specific high-risk setting to tailor interventions appropriately.
