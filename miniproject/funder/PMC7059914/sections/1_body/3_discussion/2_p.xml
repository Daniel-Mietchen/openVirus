<p>The geospatial patterns of HIV prevalence heterogeneity among adults shown in our study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) are very comparable to patterns shown in other recent studies in which other methods for spatial interpolation were used [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], confirming that our approach was suitable for creating reliable estimates. As an external validation for our geospatial patterns of HIV prevalence in young adults, we compared our estimates to the estimates from multiple small-scale surveillance sites from the ALPHA network [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We found that most estimates are comparable, but our estimates were lower for the Rakai (Uganda) and Manicaland (Zimbabwe) areas (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003042.s016">S14 Fig</xref>). Both areas are characterised by well-known high levels of HIV transmission and relatively low numbers of sample locations in the utilised data with varying prevalence levels, leading to underestimation of the HIV prevalence. This indicates that our approach of kriging, in which prevalence at a specific location is estimated by the prevalence in surrounding clusters as a function of the distance between the location and surrounding clusters, may have resulted in an underestimation (i.e. smoothing) of HIV prevalence estimates, especially in high-prevalence areas.
