<p>Our results have limitations. First, DHSs produce cross-sectional data intended to provide a measure of HIV prevalence and behaviour among the general population; and thus, high-risk subpopulations such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and mobile populations such as truck drivers and seasonal workers, are thought to be underrepresented in these surveys. Therefore, we cannot make definitive conclusions on economic activity and key populations driving HIV transmission in at these locations. Nevertheless, our analyses showed that high HIV prevalence areas in DHS data, especially among young adults, were almost invariably located near economically active areas suggesting that these key-population dynamics are still visible through general population-based surveys. Extending DHSs with other data sources that allow for mapping of key populations or performing incidence essays on HIV samples will allow for more accurate identification of HIV transmission areas and can further enhance our understanding of the epidemic. Second, DHS sampling locations are randomly selected, based on the underlying population density within a country. Consequently, very few locations were sampled from areas with large nature and wildlife conservation reserves, such as in Northern Kenya, Central Tanzania, and Northern and South-western Mozambique, and our interpolated prevalence estimates for such areas should be interpreted with caution. Designing alternative sampling techniques that over-sample areas with low densities could increase reliability of interpolated survey results. Third, we used survey data from a relatively wide range of years; 2008–2009 to 2015–2016. This time period in the study coincides with major initiatives to curb the pandemic, in particular the scale-up of antiretroviral treatment, as well as voluntary male circumcision campaigns and other HIV prevention interventions. Although these initiatives were potentially disproportionally targeted at high transmission areas, we expect that the disproportionate impact would not be so extreme that it completely alter the locations of high transmission areas. Furthermore, although the scale-up of these interventions may have reduced HIV incidence, the associations between HIV and the hypothesised main drivers of HIV transmission–the (sexual) behavioural, socioeconomic and environmental factors explored in this study–likely did not change substantially by these interventions. Fourth, explorative statistical analyses always run the risk of identifying patterns of random noise [

Reassuringly we found that, despite the differences in underlying epidemic and scale-up of interventions across countries, the conditional R
 <sup>2</sup> of the model was strikingly similar for six out of the eight countries in our analysis, ranging between 23.5% and 36.0% (compared to 29.6% in the main analysis). Only the conditional R
 <sup>2</sup> for Kenya (45.0%) and Zimbabwe (17.6%) deviated a little bit more from the combined model, yet not to an alarming extend (
