<p>Our study included 112,785 adults, of which there were 53,234 young adults (25,536 women, 27,698 men) from 3,665 different sample locations throughout the 7 countries. The number of individuals included in the study as well as location-level HIV prevalence in the study population for adults and young adults are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Among adults, the mean country-level HIV prevalence ranges from 5.4% (Tanzania) to 14.4% (Zimbabwe). Among young adults, mean country-level HIV prevalences are generally lower, ranging from 2.2% (Tanzania) to 7.7% (Mozambique), while the median HIV prevalences are (close to) zero. This reflects the fact that most sample locations have very low HIV prevalence, and only a minority of sample locations have high prevalence. HIV prevalence among adults and young adults is strongly spatially clustered (
