<p>According to the resulting best-fitting multiple multilevel logistic regression model on the association between HIV status and sexual behavioural variables in young adults, the following variables were strongly associated with being infected with HIV: 10 or more reported lifetime sex partners, an STI or STI symptoms over the past 12 months, condom use during last intercourse, and not being circumcised (men only). Educational level, wealth index, and occupation were variables associated with HIV in the final socioeconomic model. The highest level of education was most protective (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.52 [0.26–0.78], 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), whereas being from asset quintile 4—the second wealthiest quintile—was associated with the highest risk of HIV (aOR 1.46 [1.31–1.62], 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Several variables were significantly associated with HIV in the environmental model. Young adults living in rural sample locations were less likely to be infected with HIV than those with urban residence: in cities, the overall HIV prevalence among adults was over 7%, compared to below 4% in rural settings. Also, population density, proximity to nearest major city, EVI, and GHF at location of a DHS cluster showed a significant association with HIV. HIV prevalence levels were highest (about 6%) in areas with the highest population density (more than 500 people per km
 <sup>2</sup>) but was also relatively high (about 5%) in areas with the lowest population density (less than 25 people per km
 <sup>2</sup>). HIV prevalence levels did not differ considerably between sample locations with different levels of greenness (indicated by the EVI). Living in an area with a relatively high GHF, as a proxy for economic activity, was associated with a high HIV risk (aOR 1.68 [1.41–1.94], 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001): HIV prevalence levels for the highest two levels of GHF were almost 7%, compared to around 4% at the lower levels. The best-fitting combined ‘full’ model contains both behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental variables: lifetime number of sex partners, STIs, male circumcision, education, type of residence, EVI, and GHF. A complete overview of the bivariate models, nested model (only adjusted for age and sex), best-fitting models, and final model can be found in
