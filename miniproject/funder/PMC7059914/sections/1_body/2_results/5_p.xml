<p>The maps in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003042.g003">Fig 3</xref> show the interpolated random effects estimates—i.e., the unexplained heterogeneity in HIV prevalence—for the 5 models. The white areas represent locations where relatively most heterogeneity is explained by the model. The red and purple areas represent locations where relatively the least heterogeneity is explained. As expected, random effect estimates in the nested model were highest in high-prevalence areas (panel A) and decline as fixed effects are added to the models (panels B–E). Interpolated random effects estimates from the combined model (panel B) are substantially reduced. However, the geospatial heterogeneity in many areas with a high prevalence remains unexplained, for example, around Lake Victoria (1), at the major ports of Mozambique (2–4), at Plumtree (5), around Mongu (6) and the Copperbelt (7) and Nchelenge (8) districts in Zambia. In most of these locations, environmental variables were better at explaining heterogeneity (panel E) than sexual behavioural or socioeconomic variables (panels C and D, respectively).
