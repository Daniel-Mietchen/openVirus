<p>The second big thing is the model formation. The authors did bivariate screening followed by stepwise methods. Both of these are problematic. All of the output from such methods is wrong: Parameter estimates are biased away fro 0, p values are too small, standard errors are too small (see Harrell **Regression Modeling Strategies* for lots of details). It would be better to use substantive knowledge to build a model. If the authors insist on not using their knowledge and want an automatic method, the LASSO is probably the best of the readily available methods.</p>
