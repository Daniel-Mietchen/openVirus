<p>This well-organized study uses geospatial methods to identify areas of high HIV prevalence among young adults within 7 countries in Eastern and sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the authors present a regression model that relates epidemiological predictors to HIV prevalence. While the approach is sound, the significance of is more of an incremental contribution rather than a major advance from published geospatial modeling studies of HIV prevalence, such as the works by Cuadros et al and Dwyer-Lindgren et al that are cited in the introduction of the paper. The focus on HIV prevalence among young adults is interesting and could be developed further. </p>
