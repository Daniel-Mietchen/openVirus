<p>3) For the risk factor analysis/modelling I can understand not using the original sampling weights from the DHS/AIS. However when estimating prevalence and generating a smoothed prevalence surface I would suspect that these weights be more important and allow uncertainty intervals (e.g. Figure 1 etc). Did the authors perform a sensitivity analysis to confirm that the surface without weights would be fairly similar to a surface utilising the survey weights? The weights would also be useful if you were to add additional visualisations projecting absolute counts of HIV positive young adults by high versus lower risk clusters. Prevalence without weighted correction may mask underlying population size differences within and across countries.</p>
