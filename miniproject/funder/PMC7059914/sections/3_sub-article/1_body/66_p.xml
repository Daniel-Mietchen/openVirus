<p>1. The paper focuses on HIV prevalence among young adults, with the claim that young adults represent more recent infection and that high prevalence locations can be prioritized for prevention interventions.

How do areas of high prevalence among young adults compare with variation in the underlying population age structure? More can be said in the discussion about efforts to prevent HIV infection specifically in this age group.</p>
