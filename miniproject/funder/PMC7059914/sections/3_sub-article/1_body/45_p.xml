<p>Line 158 I don't understan how random effects were translated into MOR. First, random effects are usually nuisance variables that you are not particularly interested in. Second, the standard errors for random effects are very poorly estimated (so much that some programs don't even print them) so I think the authors mean fixed effects. Third, I don't know how the translation was done.</p>
