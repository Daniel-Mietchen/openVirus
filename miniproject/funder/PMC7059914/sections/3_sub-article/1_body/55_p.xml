<p>2) Did the authors consider a Bayesian spatial approach/implementation in R-INLA as opposed to ordinary kriging? A spatial Bayesian multivariable formulation including the covariates might then be able to produce uncertaintiy around predictions at unsampled locations and more efficiently adjust for spatial correlation in nearby sampled clusters as per DHS design. I suspect that a Bayesian approach in INLA (which would be computationally tractable) would perform better than the approaches currently employed in the paper.</p>
