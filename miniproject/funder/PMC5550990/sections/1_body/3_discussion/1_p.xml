<p id="Par39">Model results suggest that, as ART coverage increases in Uganda, people on ART and people who have dropped out of ART will be responsible for an increasingly large proportion of all HIV transmission. In 2015, we estimate that these two groups were responsible for 7.8% (3.5%–13%) and 22% (15%–33%) of all transmission occurring during heterosexual sex respectively. With no change in ART policy or implementation, this may increase to 14% (7.0%–24%) and 40% (29–51%) respectively by 2030. With a universal test and treat (UTT) policy, the proportions may increase to 20% (9.3%–32%) and 56% (43%–70%), and with a (successfully implemented) universal test, treat, and keep (UTTK) policy, the proportions may increase to 38% (21–55%) and 35% (24%–53%).</p>
