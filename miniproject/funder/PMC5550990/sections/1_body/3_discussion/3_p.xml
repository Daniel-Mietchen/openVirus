<p id="Par41">The relative contribution of different stages of the ART care pathway to overall transmission will vary by country, depending on details of the country’s ART programme. In general, at higher ART coverages, a higher proportion of transmission will be by people on ART. At the same ART coverage, the proportion of transmission by ART drop-outs will be higher when retention is lower. Estimated ART coverage of all HIV+ adults in Uganda in 2015 was 57% [

Estimated coverage varies greatly by country however, ranging from 29% in Angola to 78% in Botswana, and overall coverage is lower in West and Central Africa, at 28%. Representative data on ART retention in sub-Saharan African countries is sparser; however, estimates available from East and Southern Africa range from 66% retention at 12 months in Mozambique, to 93% in Zambia. In Uganda, 12-month retention in 2015 was estimated to be 78%. The proportion of transmission by people on ART and ART drop-outs will therefore vary by country. Nevertheless, these groups are likely to be responsible for an increasing proportion of transmission as ART programmes are scaled-up across sub-Saharan Africa.
