<p id="Par42">In our model, being on ART (with no resistance to the drug regimen) reduced HIV transmission probabilities by 79–96%. This plausible range was equal to the 95% confidence interval from an empirical study of transmission in discordant couples in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The point estimate from this study was a 92% reduction in transmission probabilities. A second study estimated that ART reduced transmission probabilities by 96% (95% CI: 73–99%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These reductions are slightly higher than the mean reduction of 88% in our 100 model runs. Adherence is likely to be higher in research study cohorts than in the general population however [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and therefore our lower simulated mean reduction may be more realistic for Uganda as a whole.
