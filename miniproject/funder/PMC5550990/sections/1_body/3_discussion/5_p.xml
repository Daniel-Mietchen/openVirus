<p id="Par43">A number of mathematical modelling studies have estimated the proportion of transmission that occurs during primary infection in a wide range of different populations and settings, with estimates ranging from &lt;1% to 93% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our median estimate of 8.1% of transmission occurring during primary infection in 2015 is low compared to the majority of studies. This is most likely because HIV incidence was declining in 2015 in our model, whereas most previous models have simulated increasing or stable epidemics. All else being equal, when incidence is falling, a lower proportion of HIV positive people will have primary infections, and they will therefore contribute less to overall incidence. Our 90% plausible range was wide (1.5% to 24%), reflecting the large amount of uncertainty that still exists in the duration and relative infectiousness of primary infection. It also demonstrates the importance of fully incorporating levels of uncertainty in input parameters into model projections, something that is often neglected in infectious disease modelling.
