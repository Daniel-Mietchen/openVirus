<p id="Par40">Our findings have important implications for HIV control. As ART coverage increases in Uganda and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, people who are currently or previously on ART are likely to play an increasingly large role in overall HIV transmission. For this reason, the focus of ‘treatment as prevention’ will increasingly need to shift from finding treatment-naïve HIV positive people and starting them on ART, to also improving treatment adherence and retention on ART, and ensuring that people are promptly switched to 2nd line ART when necessary. Changes in ART regimens and scale-up of viral load testing may also have an important and increasing role in reducing HIV transmission.</p>
