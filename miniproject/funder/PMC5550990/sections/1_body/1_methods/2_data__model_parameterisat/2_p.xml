 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Twenty-seven fitted outputs were used to ensure that the model accurately represented HIV care and ART scale-up in Uganda. These included, in a number of different years, the proportion of men and women ever tested for HIV, the proportion of HIV positive people on ART, the proportion of people in HIV care on ART, the proportion of people starting ART with a CD4 count &lt;250 cells/Î¼l (cut-off chosen based on empirical data availability), the proportion of people starting ART who were women, and the proportion of people on second line ART. In addition, the model was fitted to data on rates of dropping out of and restarting ART in men and women, and 12-month retention on ART.
