<p id="Par16">Six parameters controlled HIV transmission probabilities in the model, with an additional parameter determining the mean duration of primary infection. One parameter, 
 <italic>baseline_transmission</italic>, determined the mean per sex act transmission probability for a person with a CD4 count between 200 and 350 cells/μl (unweighted average of male to female and female to male transmission probabilities). All other transmission probabilities in the model were calculated relative to this. No limits were placed on the value of 
 <italic>baseline_transmission</italic>, to allow the model to be simultaneously fitted to the sexual behaviour and HIV prevalence data. A second parameter controlled the ratio of male to female and female to male transmission probabilities. The plausible range for this parameter was set to 1.1–4.8, in line with empirical data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As viral loads are correlated with CD4 counts, transmission probabilities are likely to be lower at higher CD4 counts (for post-primary infections), and higher at lower CD4 counts. The plausible range for relative transmission probabilites for people with CD4 counts &lt;200 cells/μl and ≥350 cells/μl were considered to be 1.5–6.7 and 0.42–0.95 respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Transmission probabilities may be much higher for people with primary infections. A two-dimensional joint plausible range was placed on input parameters determining the mean duration of primary infection, and the relative transmission probability during primary infection, based on analysis of empirical data by Bellan et al. [
