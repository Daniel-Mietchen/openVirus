<p id="Par17">Transmission probabilities for people on established ART in the model varied according to their level of drug resistance to the regimen that they were receiving (first or second line ART). With the maximum number of active drugs, the plausible range for relative transmission probabilities was assumed to be 0.04â€“0.21 [

With intermediate numbers of active drugs, transmission probabilities increased exponentially as the number of active drugs declined.
