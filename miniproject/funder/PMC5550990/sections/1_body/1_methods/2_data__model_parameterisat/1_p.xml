<p id="Par14">The model was fitted to data on the estimated adult (15–49 year-old) male and female population size in Uganda in 2015, and the growth in population between 1950 and 2015. As no detailed, representative data on sexual behaviour were available from Uganda as a whole, the model was fitted to data on sexual behaviour from a rural open general population cohort in South-West Uganda [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This included data on the prevalence and incidence of sexual partnerships, and the prevalence of partnership concurrency. Two sexual behaviour risk groups (high and low partnership incidence) and two concurrency groups (high and low concurrency) were simulated. All partnerships in the model had the same duration.
