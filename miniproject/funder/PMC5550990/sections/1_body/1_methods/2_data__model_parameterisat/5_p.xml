<p id="Par18">The model was fitted to the empirical data using history matching with model emulation, a calibration method for complex models which iteratively removes areas of the input space where fits to the data are unlikely to be found [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Overall, 96 input parameters were varied during the fitting process, and the model was fitted to 51 outputs. A total of 100 model fits, all consistent with empirical data, were generated using history matching. This approach allowed us to comprehensively incorporate a large number of the potential sources of uncertainty in our results, allowing realistic estimates of uncertainty in model results to be obtained. Full details are given in McCreesh et al. [
