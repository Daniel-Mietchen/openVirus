<p id="Par19">A total of nine ART scale-up scenarios were simulated from 2016, making different assumptions about how ART will be scaled-up in Uganda:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par20">Baseline. No changes to ART policy or implementation after 2014.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par21">Increased HIV testing. The rate of HIV testing was doubled.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par22">No CD4 threshold. The CD4 threshold for ART initiation was removed.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par23">Improved retention on ART. The rate of dropping out of ART was halved.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par24">Increased ART restart rates. The rate of restarting ART after dropping out was doubled.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par25">Improved pre-ART care. The rate of dropping out of pre-ART care was halved, the probability of linking to care following a positive HIV test was doubled, and the rate of starting ART from pre-ART (when eligible) was doubled.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par26">Improved linkage to care. The probability of linking to care following a positive HIV test was doubled.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par27">Universal test and treat (UTT). Combines increased HIV testing rates, no CD4 threshold, and improved linkage to care.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par28">Universal test, treat and keep (UTTK). Combines increased HIV testing rates, no CD4 threshold, improved linkage to care, improved retention on ART, and increased ART restart rates.</p>
