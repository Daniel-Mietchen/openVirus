<p id="Par13">A dynamic, individual-based model of HIV transmission and ART scale-up was developed in NetLogo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The model simulates births, deaths, and population growth; the formation and dissolution of sexual partnerships; HIV transmission; pre-ART care and first and second line ART; and the development and transmission of drug resistance. The model was designed to accurately represent the key features of major routes into and through pre-ART care and ART in Uganda, as well as attrition and re-entry at different stages. A full description of the model structure is given in McCreesh et al. [
