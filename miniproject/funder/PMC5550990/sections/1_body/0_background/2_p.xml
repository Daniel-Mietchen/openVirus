<p id="Par11">We currently have a limited understanding of who is transmitting HIV, and how this varies by setting. A range of studies have attempted to estimate the proportion of transmission that occurs during primary infection, but a large amount of uncertainty remains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and it is likely that the proportion varies between different settings. We have even less understanding of the contribution to overall transmission of people at different stages of the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) care pathway, and how this will change as treatment coverage increases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While ART greatly reduces transmission risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], transmission has been observed to occur from people receiving ART, albeit at a low rate, and it is plausible that the rate of transmission will be higher among people not part of research cohorts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An intriguing molecular study conducted in Switzerland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] suggests that, in that setting, nearly half of transmission by people with post-primary infections may occur after they have first initiated ART, with much occurring during treatment interruptions. The approach used in the study can only give very rough estimates however, due to the difficulties in determining the exact date of transmission. In addition, it can only be used in countries that have routine viral sequencing.
