<p id="Par12">Treatment-as-prevention is a key component of the UNAIDS strategy to reduce HIV incidence. To meet the ambitious goals of the strategy, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the relative contribution to overall HIV transmission of people at different stages of the care pathway. This will assist policy makers to focus intervention services at populations where they are likely to have the greatest effect. We investigate this using a mathematical model of HIV transmission and ART scale-up, using Uganda as a case study.</p>
