<p id="Par33">The projected HIV prevalence in 2030 in adults aged between 15 and 49 years ranged between 4.9% (median; 90% plausible range 3.9%–7.5%) in the baseline scenario to 3.7% (3.0%–5.4%) in the universal test, treat, and keep (UTTK) scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The projected proportion of HIV positive people who were ART-naïve in 2030 ranged from 26% (21%–32%) in the baseline scenario to 7.6% (5.0%–12%) in the UTTK scenario, with &lt;6% of HIV positive people having primary stage infections in all scenarios and model fits (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). ART coverage of all HIV positive people in 2030 ranged from 55% (51%–60%) in the baseline scenario, up to 82% (76%–85%) in the UTTK scenario. Finally, the proportion of HIV positive people who had dropped out of ART ranged from 11% (9.1%–13%) in the UTTK scenario to 24% (21%–27%) in the universal test and treat (UTT) scenario.
