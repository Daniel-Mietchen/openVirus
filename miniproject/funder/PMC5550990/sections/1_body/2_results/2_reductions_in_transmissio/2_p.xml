<p id="Par32">The scatter graphs in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show the joint distribution of pairs of input parameters. While the distribution of most pairs was uncorrelated, there were negative correlations in the final fitted runs between 
 <italic>baseline_transmission</italic> and the increase in transmission probabilities in people with CD4 counts &lt;250 cells/μl (
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.63), and between 
 <italic>baseline_transmission</italic> and the decrease in transmission probabilities in people with CD4 counts &gt;350 cells/μl (
