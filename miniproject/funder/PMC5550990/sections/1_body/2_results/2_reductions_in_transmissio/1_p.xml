<p id="Par31">The histograms in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> show the distribution of values in the 100 fitted runs for the seven input parameters that control transmission. The red lines show the initial plausible ranges, before model fitting. The ranges of five of the seven transmission input parameters were not reduced during model fitting. In other words, fits were found throughout the whole of the plausible range. The two exceptions were 
 <italic>baseline_transmission</italic> and the ratio of male → female to female → male transmission probabilities, where model fits were limited to within the ranges 0.00083–0.0023 (initial plausible range 0–1) and 1.1–2.7 (initial plausible range 1.1–4.8) respectively.
