<p id="Par37">In 2015, ART-naïve people were responsible for the majority of new infections (70%, 90% plausible range 61%–79%), with people on ART, and ART dropouts, contributing 7.8% (3.5%–13%) and 22% (15%–33%) of new infections respectively. In all scenarios, the proportion of transmission by people with post-primary, ART-naïve infections fell greatly between 2015 and 2030, and the proportion of transmission by people on ART and people who have dropped out of ART increased.</p>
