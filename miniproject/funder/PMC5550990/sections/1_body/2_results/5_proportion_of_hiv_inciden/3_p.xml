<p id="Par38">The relative importance of transmission by people with post-primary ART-naïve infections, people on ART, and people who had dropped out of ART in 2030 varied greatly between scenarios. People with post-primary ART-naïve infections were responsible for between 14% (UTT, 7.9%–23%) and 37% (improved retention, 27%–48%) of new infections, people on ART were responsible for between 14% (baseline, 7.0%–24%) and 38% (UTTK, 21%–55%) of new infections, and ART drop-outs were responsible for between 31% (improved retention, 23%–43%) and 56% (UTT, 43%–70%) of new infections.</p>
