<p id="Par35">The overall annual incidence of HIV infection in 2015 in the model was 0.61% (90% plausible range: 0.47–0.83%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Incidence fell between 2015 and 2030, falling to 0.39% (0.26–0.73%) in 2030 in the baseline scenario, and 0.18% (0.10%–0.35%) in the UTTK scenario. In all scenarios, the biggest reductions in incidence occurred as a result of lower transmission from people with post-primary, ART-naïve infections, with the annual incidence of infection by this group falling from 0.37% (0.025%–0.52%) in 2015 to 0.14% (0.079%–0.27%) in 2030 in the baseline scenario and 0.025% (0.0012%–0.066%) in 2030 in the UTTK scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). In all scenarios, the incidence of infection caused by transmission from people with primary infections fell between 2015 and 2030, and the incidence of infection from people on ART increased slightly. Finally, the incidence of infection due to transmission by people who had dropped out of ART fell in scenarios that included interventions to reduce loss to follow up (improved ART retention, increased ART restart rates, and UTTK), and increased in all other scenarios.
