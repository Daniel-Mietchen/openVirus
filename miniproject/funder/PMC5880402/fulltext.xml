Ideally, new sampling strategies should be simple to implement, technologically uncomplicated, and applicable to areas where emergence events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals that often exist in sizable populations. As well, many domestic or peridomestic species of mosquitoes will preferentially take blood-meals from humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir to collect human blood.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology/Principal findings</title><p>We sought to take advantage of this phenomenon by systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trail in Northern Liberia to determine whether pathogen sequences from blood engorged mosquitoes accurately mirror those obtained directly from humans. Specifically, blood was collected from humans via finger-stick and by aspirating bloodfed mosquitoes from the inside of houses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these specimens was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from xenosurveillance and from finger-stick blood collection produced a similar number and quality of reads aligning to two human viruses, GB virus C and hepatitis B virus.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study represents the first systematic comparison between xenosurveillance and more traditional sampling methodologies, while also demonstrating the viability of xenosurveillance as a tool to sample human blood for circulating pathogens.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Infectious diseases continue to be a burden on mankind, particularly in the developing countries of the tropics. Recognition of pathogen transmission in humans is a crucial step to thwarting epidemics of these pathogens. However, sampling human blood or tissue is invasive and logistically difficult. Xenosurveillance takes advantage of the blood-feeding behavior of mosquitoes to sample human blood for the presence of infectious disease agents. In this study, we aimed to compare xenosurveillance to a more traditional sampling method to assess the usefulness of this technique in field settings where it could potentially be beneficial. DNA and RNA next generation sequencing followed by an in-house bioinformatic pipeline identified viruses and parasites of human origin in blood collected by either mosquitoes or finger-stick. Xenosurveillance produces samples of comparable quality to finger-stick blood collections while alleviating many of the difficulties of direct human sampling. This study suggests xenosurveillance can be a complimentary strategy for infectious disease surveillance in low-resource areas.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007235</institution-id><institution>Colorado State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Internal</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebel</surname><given-names>Gregory D.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The projected was supported in part by the CSU Infectious Disease Supercluster Grant &#x0201c;Xenosurveillance: A novel approach for interrogating the human-pathogen landscape in sub-Saharan Africa&#x0201d; awarded to DEB, BDF, and GDE.

The burden of infectious disease, from persistent infections [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to intermittent outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is especially high in developing countries of the tropics [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The amount of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost (YLL) due to infectious diseases has decreased globally in the last decade, however in areas of the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), infectious diseases still account for the majority of DALYs and YLL [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite this, the burden of infectious disease in SSA is likely underestimated due to misdiagnoses stemming from inadequate healthcare infrastructure with limited availability of diagnostic tests, procedures, and surveillance [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These factors contribute to an environment conducive for EIDs to go unrecognized until they have caused substantial morbidity and mortality in a human population. This is highlighted by the recent outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and demonstrates the need for an improved diagnostic and surveillance framework in SSA.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of all infectious diseases of humans are of zoonotic origin [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Of these, 60% are EIDs [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pathogen emergence has been described as a step-wise process consisting of three parts; pre-emergence, localized emergence, and pandemic emergence [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pre-emergence describes pathogen transmission in natural reservoir populations where some disturbance results in pathogen expansion within natural populations, an increase in pathogen host range (non-human), and/or pathogen spread to a new geographical area. Localized emergence is characterized as pathogen spillover into human populations with restricted animal-human and/or human-human transmission. Finally, pandemic emergence refers to global spread of the pathogen through human-human transmission, or sustained transmission through the appropriate vector [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Due to the threat of pandemic emergence, global surveillance programs that are aimed, in some capacity, at detecting zoonotic pathogens have increased in the last decade [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Active sampling of wildlife and domestic animals has identified pathogens that may be capable of causing pandemics (i.e. pre-emergence) [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, substantial physiological, ecological, and evolutionary barriers exist to pathogen host switching, and the majority of animal pathogens cannot become zoonotic [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In order to recognize pathogens prior to pandemic emergence, it would be helpful to sample pathogens that are circulating in human populations at the stage of localized emergence. Active sampling of human blood and/or tissue is the ideal strategy to detect localized emergence, however, human sample acquisition can be invasive, costly, logistically challenging, and requires institutional review board (IRB) approval. Consequently, developing non-invasive and cost effective strategies to collect human samples for pathogen screening are necessary.</p><p>Mosquitoes are efficient samplers of human blood. We have previously described xenosurveillance, a surveillance technique that makes use of the hematophagous behavior of some arthropods to survey vertebrates for the presence of pathogens [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that blood meals from <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes are sufficient samples from which to detect viruses, bacteria, and parasites using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) along with next generation sequencing (NGS) in laboratory and field experiments.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether xenosurveillance is directly comparable to traditional sampling techniques (e.g. finger-sticks or venous blood draws) under field conditions. Accordingly, we compared xenosurveillance with blood collected via finger-stick in two villages in northern Liberia to determine whether these methods detect the same pathogens. Pathogens were detected by NGS in pooled xenosurveillance samples and finger-stick blood samples and then confirmed with qPCR and qRT-PCR to make prevalence estimates in the two sample types. Moreover, composition and count of NGS reads aligning the detected pathogens were compared between the two methods. Our results confirm that xenosurveillance and finger-stick methods for surveillance detect the same pathogens from a field setting in rural West Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Human subject sampling was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Colorado State University (CSU) (protocol 15-5896H) and by the National Research Ethics Board of Liberia (NREB-0017-15) in partnership with the Liberian Institute for Biomedical Research (LIBR). A local public health worker explained the details of the study and acquired signatures or thumb prints from individuals providing consent.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to assess H/M-DBS samples for the presence of pathogen-derived nucleic acid. RNA NGS was performed on H/M-DBS samples from a single household in Village A. The remaining samples from Village A were subject to DNA NGS. RNA NGS samples were separated into two pools by location and sample type. Total nucleic acid extraction on H/M-DBS was performed using the Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, USA) and eluted into 50&#x003bc;L of water. Due to low RNA yield from H/M-DBS, samples were pooled by volume for both RNA and DNA NGS. The H-DBS pool was composed of 25&#x003bc;L of total RNA from each H-DBS, whereas the M-DBS pool was composed of 10&#x003bc;L of total RNA from each M-DBS. Each pool was DNAse treated using DNA-<italic>free</italic> DNA Removal Kit (Invitrogen, USA). Pools were purified using a 2x ratio of RNA clean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA) and eluted into 30&#x003bc;L of water. In order to increase reads of potential pathogen nucleic acid, an in-house protocol that uses gene specific primers and RNAse H to deplete pools of rRNA was employed. Following rRNA depletion, double-stranded DNA (cDNA) was created from the remaining RNA.

Individual libraries were quantified using the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, USA). If necessary, libraries were re-amplified using the Kapa Library Amplification Kit for Illumina in order to achieve the necessary quantity for sequencing. Libraries were diluted to equal concentrations and pooled by volume for denaturing and loading. DNA NGS samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using a 600 cycle (2x300 reads) MiSeq v3 reagent kit at the CSU NGS facility.

This highlights the need for vigilant infectious disease surveillance using cost effective, efficient methods for sample acquisition. Hematophagous arthropods have been used to survey wildlife populations for pathogen circulation [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and human pathogens have been detected in blood meals of these arthropods [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Using hematophagous arthropods as a sampling method in lieu of direct sampling techniques can be advantageous, but a comparison between the two has never been made. Accordingly, in this study, we sought to improve on existing xenosurveillance methodology while comparing this method to more traditional human blood collection approach, finger-stick blood.</p><p>Over 40 households from two villages in northern Liberia were enrolled, resulting in a total of 185 participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t001">Table 1</xref>). From these households, we aspirated a total of 253 mosquitoes, the majority being blood fed <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic>. <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> mosquitoes are highly anthropophilic [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and can often be found resting inside houses following the acquisition of a bloodmeal [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], therefore are ideal for xenosurveillance. Moreover, <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> mosquitoes transmit comparably few pathogens, specifically <italic>Plasmodium sp</italic>., <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic>, and O&#x02019;nyong nyong virus. This limited number increases the likelihood that pathogen nucleic acids detected by xenosurveillance are derived from the recently fed upon host.</p><p>Capturing blood fed mosquitoes from inside houses is less burdensome to the occupants as compared to other direct techniques (e.g. finger-stick blood collection), and presents less of a risk for health workers and researchers. While specialized equipment is necessary (e.g. Insectazookas) and training is required for xenosurveillance, needles, sharps containers, antiseptics, and bandages are not needed, the occupants can continue with their regular activities, and residents do not need to be present when sampling occurs. The non-invasive nature of this technique also facilitates more frequent sampling, resulting in more blood samples collected, thus increasing the possibility of sampling pathogens that occur transiently in the blood. Additionally, no specific training is required to collect and process the mosquitoes and IRB approval is not required, as human blood is not being sampled directly. Furthermore, storing blood spots on FTA cards with RNA Later allows for bypassing cold chain, ensures deactivation of potential pathogens in samples [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and results in nucleic acid that is a high enough quality to sequence.</p><p>To determine if samples collected by xenosurveillance produced data similar to samples collected by finger-stick, we subjected both to NGS on Illumina platforms. A large number of reads were produced in both our RNA and DNA NGS datasets, however, we observed a considerable reduction in reads following quality control and host filtering. Greater than 99% of reads were removed in all sequencing libraries. This is likely due to multiple factors. The RNA NGS pools saw a greater than 90% reduction in reads following removal of PCR duplicates. Because a very low quantity of RNA is recovered from individual DBS, a substantial amount of amplification is required to bring libraries to a usable quantity of nucleic acid. For RNA NGS, increasing the number of DBS per pool would reduce duplicate reads. For DNA NGS, less amplification was required as more DNA is eluted off of individual DBS. This indicated that DNA from mosquito blood-meals was more stable on FTA cards compared to RNA, which allowed us to pool more individual DBS per pool. Predictably, more unique reads were produced from DNA sequencing libraries than RNA sequencing libraries. Substantial losses of reads were observed following filtering of host nucleic acid, indicating most of the sequenced nucleic acid was derived from either humans or mosquitoes, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These reads are not informative for pathogen identification, however they indicate mosquito blood meals were likely taken from humans. Although our in-house depletion strategy worked at clearing our M-DBS RNA sequencing samples of mosquito rRNA, the remainder of the samples would benefit from improved host depletion or pathogen nucleic acid enrichment strategies.</p><p>Following quality control and host filtering, an adequate number of reads remained to detect genetic signatures of viruses and parasites. Following further analysis, reads aligning to parasitic worms proved to be largely spurious based on additional bioinformatics scrutiny. This is likely the result of bacterial sequences from our samples aligning to misassemblies in the published genomes. The incorporation of contaminating bacterial sequences into whole genome assemblies is not uncommon [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As well, Liberia is endemic for lymphatic filariasis and <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> is a primary vector of <italic>W</italic>. <italic>bancrofti</italic> in West Africa, therefore any reads aligning to this parasite in xenosurveillance samples must be from an infected host or and infected vector [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Similarly, multiple reads aligning to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> were identified in all sequencing pools, which is expected, however we cannot say with confidence from xenosurveillance samples whether the reads are host or vector derived. Reads aligning to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> do highlight the fact that while xenosurveillance is intended to identify any human pathogens present in peripheral blood, not just those transmitted by mosquitoes, these samples can also contribute to routine vector surveillance efforts (e.g. identifying the malaria parasite in local <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes). While we did not quantify the prevalence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> from individual DBS in this study, the sample collection and storage method would allow for such testing. Furthermore, xenosurveillance can be conducted using other hematophagous arthropods, although a clear understanding of the natural history of the chosen organism and their ability to vector pathogens is crucial when conducting downstream analysis.</p><p>Reads from two viruses, GBV-C and HBV, were identified using bioinformatics and molecular methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Interestingly, although GBV-C, an RNA virus closely related to hepatitis C virus, is not known to be pathogenic, infection with this virus is associated with an increased rate of survival in patients co-infected with either HIV or Ebola virus [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. As this virus infects and replicates in CD4-positive T cells, we would expect to be able to detect GBV-C RNA in blood [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. GBV-C has an estimated prevalence between 10&#x02013;28% in West African countries, which is similar to our findings, albeit derived from a small sample size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t003">Table 3</xref>) [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Both H and M-DBS, collected from the same household, produced a similar number of reads that aligned with high confidence to GBV-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) from pooled samples. HBV reads were identified in DNA NGS pools [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is responsible for up for up to 30% of liver cirrhosis cases globally [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Prevalence is highly variable across Africa, but is estimated to be between 4&#x02013;8% in Liberia as determined by HBV surface antigen, which is congruent with our data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t003">Table 3</xref>) [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis clearly indicates both viruses are of human origin and from West Africa (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g005">5</xref>). Fewer reads from H and M-DBS aligned to HBV compared to GBV, however substantially more DBS made up the sequencing pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). As well, the DNA NGS was performed on an Illumina MiSeq, producing substantially fewer overall reads than RNA NGS pools sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006348.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Nevertheless, these results indicate that NGS can be a sensitive enough technique to detect a pathogen &#x0201c;signal&#x0201d; through host &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; in complex pooled samples of blood collected by either method. GBV-C and HBV nucleic acid was amplified using qRT-PCR and qPCR, respectively, from individual DBS, showing alternative methods can be used to detect the presence of pathogens in lieu of NGS. Due to similarity in read quality and composition collected from by each method, our data suggest xenosurveillance is a viable alternative for collecting human blood samples used in pathogen surveillance.</p><p>Xenosurveillance can be a useful strategy to supplement existing public health efforts in developing regions of the world. As mosquitoes constantly take blood meals from humans, especially in the tropics, the availability of samples is enormous. Xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods. Sample storage is simple and cost effective. As well, sample quality does not appear to suffer from being collected by a mosquito, as there are no substantial differences between samples collected via xenosurveillance or finger-stick. However it remains to be determined if samples collected by xenosurveillance are useful for other means of disease surveillance (e.g. serology). Xenosurveillance is capable of detecting a wide array of pathogens [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although this study did not reliably detect parasites and bacteria infecting humans. However, zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately likely to reach pandemic emergence, as compared to parasites or bacteria [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent pandemics of zoonotic viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika virus support this notion [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In theory, routine xenosurveillance could provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations. As well, xenosurveillance can be targeted to support epidemiological services by collecting engorged mosquitoes in areas where suspected pathogen transmission is occurring [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Species specific PCR can be used to identify known or suspected pathogens from xenosurveillance samples, although the use of NGS provides an unbiased detection approach. As the cost of high throughput NGS continues to decrease, large scale sequencing projects are becoming more universal [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Furthermore, as field applicable sequencing tools are being further developed and optimized, the use of real-time NGS for surveillance and diagnosis of pathogens is being realized [<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].
