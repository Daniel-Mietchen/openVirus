  <title>H and M-DBS showed reads aligning to human viruses at similar levels.</title>
  <p>A) RNA sequencing revealed multiple reads from pools of both H and M-DBS spanning the GB virus C genome. B) Hepatitis B virus reads were discovered from DNA sequencing pools of both H and M-DBS. For both viruses, reads from M-DBS were comparable in quantity and quality to reads from H-DBS.</p>
