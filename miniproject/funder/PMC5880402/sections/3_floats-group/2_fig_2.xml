  <title>The majority of reads from M-DBS and H-DBS, for both RNA and DNA NGS pools, align to host nucleic acid.</title>
  <p>The taxonomic makeup of each sequencing pool was determined using the Blastn -Megablast tool with individual sequencing reads as input. Blue circles show taxonomic make up at the level of kingdom for all reads in each pool. Red circles show taxonomic makeup from a subset of reads aligning to eukaryotes. While the most reads in H-DBS aligned to human nucleic acid, reads from M-DBS aligned to both human and mosquito nucleic acid. Reads to human pathogens were detected in both H/M-DBS in the remaining reads.</p>
