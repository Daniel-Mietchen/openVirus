<p>To determine if samples collected by xenosurveillance produced data similar to samples collected by finger-stick, we subjected both to NGS on Illumina platforms. A large number of reads were produced in both our RNA and DNA NGS datasets, however, we observed a considerable reduction in reads following quality control and host filtering. Greater than 99% of reads were removed in all sequencing libraries. This is likely due to multiple factors. The RNA NGS pools saw a greater than 90% reduction in reads following removal of PCR duplicates. Because a very low quantity of RNA is recovered from individual DBS, a substantial amount of amplification is required to bring libraries to a usable quantity of nucleic acid. For RNA NGS, increasing the number of DBS per pool would reduce duplicate reads. For DNA NGS, less amplification was required as more DNA is eluted off of individual DBS. This indicated that DNA from mosquito blood-meals was more stable on FTA cards compared to RNA, which allowed us to pool more individual DBS per pool. Predictably, more unique reads were produced from DNA sequencing libraries than RNA sequencing libraries. Substantial losses of reads were observed following filtering of host nucleic acid, indicating most of the sequenced nucleic acid was derived from either humans or mosquitoes, as expected (

Although our in-house depletion strategy worked at clearing our M-DBS RNA sequencing samples of mosquito rRNA, the remainder of the samples would benefit from improved host depletion or pathogen nucleic acid enrichment strategies.
