<p>Reads from two viruses, GBV-C and HBV, were identified using bioinformatics and molecular methods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Interestingly, although GBV-C, an RNA virus closely related to hepatitis C virus, is not known to be pathogenic, infection with this virus is associated with an increased rate of survival in patients co-infected with either HIV or Ebola virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. As this virus infects and replicates in CD4-positive T cells, we would expect to be able to detect GBV-C RNA in blood [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. GBV-C has an estimated prevalence between 10–28% in West African countries, which is similar to our findings, albeit derived from a small sample size (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Both H and M-DBS, collected from the same household, produced a similar number of reads that aligned with high confidence to GBV-C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) from pooled samples. HBV reads were identified in DNA NGS pools [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is responsible for up for up to 30% of liver cirrhosis cases globally [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Prevalence is highly variable across Africa, but is estimated to be between 4–8% in Liberia as determined by HBV surface antigen, which is congruent with our data (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t003">Table 3</xref>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis clearly indicates both viruses are of human origin and from West Africa (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g005">5</xref>). Fewer reads from H and M-DBS aligned to HBV compared to GBV, however substantially more DBS made up the sequencing pool (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). As well, the DNA NGS was performed on an Illumina MiSeq, producing substantially fewer overall reads than RNA NGS pools sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006348.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Nevertheless, these results indicate that NGS can be a sensitive enough technique to detect a pathogen “signal” through host “noise” in complex pooled samples of blood collected by either method. GBV-C and HBV nucleic acid was amplified using qRT-PCR and qPCR, respectively, from individual DBS, showing alternative methods can be used to detect the presence of pathogens in lieu of NGS. Due to similarity in read quality and composition collected from by each method, our data suggest xenosurveillance is a viable alternative for collecting human blood samples used in pathogen surveillance.
