<p>While efforts to predict pathogen emergence in human populations have improved and become more robust, pathogen emergence remains unpredictable [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Using hematophagous arthropods as a sampling method in lieu of direct sampling techniques can be advantageous, but a comparison between the two has never been made. Accordingly, in this study, we sought to improve on existing xenosurveillance methodology while comparing this method to more traditional human blood collection approach, finger-stick blood.
