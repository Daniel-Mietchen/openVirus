<p>Xenosurveillance can be a useful strategy to supplement existing public health efforts in developing regions of the world. As mosquitoes constantly take blood meals from humans, especially in the tropics, the availability of samples is enormous. Xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods. Sample storage is simple and cost effective. As well, sample quality does not appear to suffer from being collected by a mosquito, as there are no substantial differences between samples collected via xenosurveillance or finger-stick. However it remains to be determined if samples collected by xenosurveillance are useful for other means of disease surveillance (e.g. serology). Xenosurveillance is capable of detecting a wide array of pathogens [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although this study did not reliably detect parasites and bacteria infecting humans. However, zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately likely to reach pandemic emergence, as compared to parasites or bacteria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent pandemics of zoonotic viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika virus support this notion [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In theory, routine xenosurveillance could provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations. As well, xenosurveillance can be targeted to support epidemiological services by collecting engorged mosquitoes in areas where suspected pathogen transmission is occurring [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Species specific PCR can be used to identify known or suspected pathogens from xenosurveillance samples, although the use of NGS provides an unbiased detection approach. As the cost of high throughput NGS continues to decrease, large scale sequencing projects are becoming more universal [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Furthermore, as field applicable sequencing tools are being further developed and optimized, the use of real-time NGS for surveillance and diagnosis of pathogens is being realized [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The combination of xenosurveillance and novel sequencing strategies has the potential to bring active, real-time, disease surveillance to resource-poor areas of the world.
