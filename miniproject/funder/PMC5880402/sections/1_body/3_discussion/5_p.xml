<p>Following quality control and host filtering, an adequate number of reads remained to detect genetic signatures of viruses and parasites. Following further analysis, reads aligning to parasitic worms proved to be largely spurious based on additional bioinformatics scrutiny. This is likely the result of bacterial sequences from our samples aligning to misassemblies in the published genomes. The incorporation of contaminating bacterial sequences into whole genome assemblies is not uncommon [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As well, Liberia is endemic for lymphatic filariasis and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> is a primary vector of 
 <italic>W</italic>. 
 <italic>bancrofti</italic> in West Africa, therefore any reads aligning to this parasite in xenosurveillance samples must be from an infected host or and infected vector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Similarly, multiple reads aligning to 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> were identified in all sequencing pools, which is expected, however we cannot say with confidence from xenosurveillance samples whether the reads are host or vector derived. Reads aligning to 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> do highlight the fact that while xenosurveillance is intended to identify any human pathogens present in peripheral blood, not just those transmitted by mosquitoes, these samples can also contribute to routine vector surveillance efforts (e.g. identifying the malaria parasite in local 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes). While we did not quantify the prevalence of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> from individual DBS in this study, the sample collection and storage method would allow for such testing. Furthermore, xenosurveillance can be conducted using other hematophagous arthropods, although a clear understanding of the natural history of the chosen organism and their ability to vector pathogens is crucial when conducting downstream analysis.
