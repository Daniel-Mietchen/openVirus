<p>It remains to be determined whether xenosurveillance is directly comparable to traditional sampling techniques (e.g. finger-sticks or venous blood draws) under field conditions. Accordingly, we compared xenosurveillance with blood collected via finger-stick in two villages in northern Liberia to determine whether these methods detect the same pathogens. Pathogens were detected by NGS in pooled xenosurveillance samples and finger-stick blood samples and then confirmed with qPCR and qRT-PCR to make prevalence estimates in the two sample types. Moreover, composition and count of NGS reads aligning the detected pathogens were compared between the two methods. Our results confirm that xenosurveillance and finger-stick methods for surveillance detect the same pathogens from a field setting in rural West Africa.</p>
