<p>Almost two-thirds of all infectious diseases of humans are of zoonotic origin [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pathogen emergence has been described as a step-wise process consisting of three parts; pre-emergence, localized emergence, and pandemic emergence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pre-emergence describes pathogen transmission in natural reservoir populations where some disturbance results in pathogen expansion within natural populations, an increase in pathogen host range (non-human), and/or pathogen spread to a new geographical area. Localized emergence is characterized as pathogen spillover into human populations with restricted animal-human and/or human-human transmission. Finally, pandemic emergence refers to global spread of the pathogen through human-human transmission, or sustained transmission through the appropriate vector [
