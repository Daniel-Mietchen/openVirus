<p>Due to the threat of pandemic emergence, global surveillance programs that are aimed, in some capacity, at detecting zoonotic pathogens have increased in the last decade [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Active sampling of wildlife and domestic animals has identified pathogens that may be capable of causing pandemics (i.e. pre-emergence) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, substantial physiological, ecological, and evolutionary barriers exist to pathogen host switching, and the majority of animal pathogens cannot become zoonotic [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In order to recognize pathogens prior to pandemic emergence, it would be helpful to sample pathogens that are circulating in human populations at the stage of localized emergence. Active sampling of human blood and/or tissue is the ideal strategy to detect localized emergence, however, human sample acquisition can be invasive, costly, logistically challenging, and requires institutional review board (IRB) approval. Consequently, developing non-invasive and cost effective strategies to collect human samples for pathogen screening are necessary.
