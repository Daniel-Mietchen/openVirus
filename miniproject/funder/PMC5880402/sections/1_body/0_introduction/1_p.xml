<p>Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (EID) pose a major public health threat throughout the world [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The burden of infectious disease, from persistent infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to intermittent outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], is especially high in developing countries of the tropics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The amount of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost (YLL) due to infectious diseases has decreased globally in the last decade, however in areas of the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), infectious diseases still account for the majority of DALYs and YLL [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite this, the burden of infectious disease in SSA is likely underestimated due to misdiagnoses stemming from inadequate healthcare infrastructure with limited availability of diagnostic tests, procedures, and surveillance [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These factors contribute to an environment conducive for EIDs to go unrecognized until they have caused substantial morbidity and mortality in a human population. This is highlighted by the recent outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and demonstrates the need for an improved diagnostic and surveillance framework in SSA.
