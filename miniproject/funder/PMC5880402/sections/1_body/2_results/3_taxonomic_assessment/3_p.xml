<p>A single contig from our H-DBS DNA sequencing dataset produced an alignment to an African strain of HBV. This genome was then used to make an indexed reference, and reads from both H-DBS and M-DBS were aligned (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). A total of 6 and 2 reads aligned from the H-DBS and M-DBS DNA sequencing dataset, respectively. Reads from both datasets aligned with up to 99% percent pairwise nucleotide identify and combined to cover ~25% of the genome (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t002">Table 2</xref>). The overlapping reads/contigs from M-DBS and H-DBS shared 100% pairwise nt identity. The mean read length was 142 nucleotides. HBV segregates into 8 distinct genotypes that generally can be distinguished by geographical location [

A phylogenetic analysis using the 542 n.t. sequence from over 150 HBV sequences correctly placed each virus in their appropriate phenotypic group as laid out by Kramvis et al. [
