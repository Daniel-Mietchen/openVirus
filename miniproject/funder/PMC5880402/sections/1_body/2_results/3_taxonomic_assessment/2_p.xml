<p>Individual contigs aligning to a West African strain of GBV-C were produced from both H-DBS and M-DBS from our RNA sequencing datasets [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], indicating the virus was detected in human and mosquito samples collected from the same household. This genome was then used to make a reference index and individual reads from both H-DBS and M-DBS sequencing dataset were aligned (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In total, 15 and 28 individual reads aligned to GBV-C from H-DBS and M-DBS, respectively. On average, these reads aligned with over 90% pairwise nucleotide similarity. Mean individual read length was 128 nucleotides, and these reads spanned ~40% of the genome (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t002">Table 2</xref>). The overlapping reads/contigs from M-DBS and H-DBS shared 99% pairwise nt identity. A phylogenetic analysis using over 50 partial GBV-C sequences resulted in two major clades that grouped by geographic origin of virus sequences (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006348.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). The sequences identified in this study grouped most closely with GBV-C sequences identified from humans in West Africa [
