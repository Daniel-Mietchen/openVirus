<p>Our initial taxonomic assessment identified multiple contigs aligning to 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> and various species of parasitic nematodes in both RNA and DNA datasets. Following removal of mosquito and human sequences, &gt;400 reads aligned to 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> and over 5,000 individual reads produced an alignment to worm genomes. The following criteria was used to remove spurious alignments: 1) Parasite did not produce top hit in Blastn search, 2) low complexity reads (e.g. ATAT repeats), or 3) reads aligned to conserved ribosomal RNA sequences. Following these criteria, 426 reads produced a quality alignment to multiple genes across all chromosomes of the 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> genome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006348.s007">S2 File</xref>), and no nematode parasite reads/contigs were deemed legitimate. The vast majority of reads/contigs that were aligned to the worm index file were removed following a Blastn search, as the top hit produced was to bacterial sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006348.s008">S3 File</xref>).
