<p>RNA sequencing was performed on a subset of samples on an Illumina NextSeq instrument. This subset was made up from samples collected from an individual household in Village A. This location was selected because it had a higher than average number of individuals enrolled (7) and it produced the highest number of M-DBS (34). Prior to quality control and host filtering, each DBS produced over 1.8 million reads on average (

The greatest reduction in reads was seen after the dataset was collapsed to unique reads, removing PCR duplicates (
