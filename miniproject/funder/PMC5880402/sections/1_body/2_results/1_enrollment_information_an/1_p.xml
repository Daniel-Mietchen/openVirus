<p>Two villages in Northern Liberia were enrolled in our study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Village A was sampled on 6 occasions, while Village B was sampled on 3 occasions. Upon enrollment, no individuals presented as febrile. Throughout the course of sampling, two individuals presented as febrile based on a body temperature ≥ 38°C. Both individuals were positive for 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> infection based on the results of a SD Bioline Malaria Antigen rapid diagnostic test and were provided artemisinin-based combination therapy. 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> sensu lato was the most commonly collected species of mosquito from within households in both villages, making up over 80% of mosquitoes collected during the study (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t001">Table 1</xref>). Few other taxa of mosquitoes were collected from inside households. Of the other taxa, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes were the most common genera, with 9 and 3 females, respectively. The vast majority of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> mosquitoes collected contained a full blood meal, indicating they fed the previous night. Village A was slightly more populous than Village B, resulting in a higher number of people enrolled into the study. As well, a greater number of blood fed 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> mosquitoes were collected from households in Village A (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t001">Table 1</xref>). Following successive collection of mosquitoes from Village B, substantially more H-DBS were collected than were M-DBS. Previous experience aspirating mosquitoes from inside houses in West Africa implied this was an unexpectedly low number. Consequently, H/M-DBS from Village A were used for the remainder of our study.
