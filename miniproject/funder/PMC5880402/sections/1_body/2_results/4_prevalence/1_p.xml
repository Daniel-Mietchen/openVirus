<p>Virus-specific RT-PCR and qPCR was employed to determine the prevalence of GBV-C and HBV from individual H-DBS and M-DBS that made up the NGS pools. We determined that a single H-DBS from one household assessed in Village A was GBV-C positive, resulting in a prevalence of 14.3%. Out of a total of 34 M-DBS, three were deemed positive, resulting in a prevalence of 8.8% in M-DBS collected from the same household (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006348.t003">Table 3</xref>). At least one positive M-DBS was collected from each house that contained at least one positive H-DBS, while not all M-DBS determined positive for HBV were collected in houses with positive H-DBS.
