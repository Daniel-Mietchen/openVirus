<p>Phylogenetic trees for both GBV-C and HBV were built using a neighbor-joining method with no out group in Geneious 10.2.2. Full length genomes were downloaded from NCBI using the nucleotide feature in Geneious 10.2.2 and aligned. NGS reads aligning to GBV-C and HBV were mapped to their appropriate alignment, and the longest contig from each data set, a 491 nt segment aligning to the NS5B region of GBV-C and a 542 nt segment spanning the C and P gene of HBV, were used for the analysis. Both contigs were made of reads derived from H and M-DBS, as the overlapping regions had &gt; 99% nucleotide identity. These regions were extracted from the alignments and used as the input sequences to build phylogenetic trees.</p>
