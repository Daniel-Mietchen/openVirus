<p>Library preparation inputs were quantified fluorometrically using the Qubit 3.0 High Sensitivity DNA assay (ThermoFisher, USA). cDNA created from RNA NGS pools was not quantifiable using a Quibit due to low concentration. Both RNA and DNA NGS samples were subject to library preparation with Nextera XT following manufactures protocol with slight adjustment (Illumina, USA). Due to low concentrations from RNA NGS samples, the Amplicon Tagment Mix was diluted 10-fold in order to tagment cDNA [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A dual indexing strategy was used for DNA NGS pools, and single end indexing was use for RNA NGS pools. Unique Illumina indices were incorporated to each pool using Kapa Library Amplification Kit for Illumina (Kapa BioSystems, USA). Individual libraries were quantified using the NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, USA). If necessary, libraries were re-amplified using the Kapa Library Amplification Kit for Illumina in order to achieve the necessary quantity for sequencing. Libraries were diluted to equal concentrations and pooled by volume for denaturing and loading. DNA NGS samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using a 600 cycle (2x300 reads) MiSeq v3 reagent kit at the CSU NGS facility. RNA NGS samples were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform using a 150 cycle (1x150 reads) NextSeq Mid-Output Kit at the CSU NGS facility.
