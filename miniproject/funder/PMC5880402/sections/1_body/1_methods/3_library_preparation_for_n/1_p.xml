<p>Laboratory processing of samples has been described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to assess H/M-DBS samples for the presence of pathogen-derived nucleic acid. RNA NGS was performed on H/M-DBS samples from a single household in Village A. The remaining samples from Village A were subject to DNA NGS. RNA NGS samples were separated into two pools by location and sample type. Total nucleic acid extraction on H/M-DBS was performed using the Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, USA) and eluted into 50μL of water. Due to low RNA yield from H/M-DBS, samples were pooled by volume for both RNA and DNA NGS. The H-DBS pool was composed of 25μL of total RNA from each H-DBS, whereas the M-DBS pool was composed of 10μL of total RNA from each M-DBS. Each pool was DNAse treated using DNA-

In order to increase reads of potential pathogen nucleic acid, an in-house protocol that uses gene specific primers and RNAse H to deplete pools of rRNA was employed. Following rRNA depletion, double-stranded DNA (cDNA) was created from the remaining RNA. First-strand synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System following manufactures protocol (Invitrogen, USA). 2
 <sup>nd</sup> strand cDNA synthesis was conducted immediately following 1
 <sup>st</sup> strand synthesis using a Klenow Fragment (3”-5”exo-) (New England Biolabs, USA). For DNA NGS, 10μL of total DNA for H and M-DBS were pooled by sample type.
