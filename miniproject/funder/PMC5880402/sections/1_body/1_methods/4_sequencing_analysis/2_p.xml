<p>Following the taxonomic assessment pipeline, contiguous sequences (contigs) that produced quality alignments of interest were viewed in Geneious 10.2.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Multiple contigs aligning to pathogens were discovered. These contigs were used as to guide for further investigation. This initial dataset was produced following the filtering of reads aligning to mosquito genomic and rRNA. Human genomic DNA was removed using Bowtie2 version 2.2.5 with parameters–sensitive-score-min C,60,0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for further analysis. Reference files for GBV-C (Accession #KM670099.1), HBV (Accession # KU736927.1) and 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Genebank# 256198) were downloaded from NCBI GenBank. Whole genome FASTA files for multiple species of nematode worms, including

Reference FASTA files were indexed using the–build option in Bowtie2. Following removal of mosquito genomic DNA, mosquito rRNA, and human genomic DNA, paired (DNA Seq) or single (RNA Seq) end reads were aligned to indexed reference files using–x and–very-sensitive options in Bowtie2 and exported as .SAM files using the–S option. Aligned .SAM files were converted to .BAM files and sorted to their reference genes using the view and sort options in SAMtools [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Individual reads that aligned were then assessed visually and with the BLASTn -megablast tool under previously listed parameters. NGS reads have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive with links to BioProject PRJNA432355. All sequencing samples have been de-identified.
