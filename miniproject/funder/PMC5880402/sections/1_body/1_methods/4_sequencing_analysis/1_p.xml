<p>The goal of the sequencing analysis was to search for reads and contigs aligning to human derived pathogens. The processing pipeline is similar to that described in [

High level taxonomic assessment of individual reads was initially performed using BLASTn- megablast tool against the nt database with evalue = 1e-8 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] to determine the composition of sequencing pools. An in-house script (tally_hits.pl, available at
