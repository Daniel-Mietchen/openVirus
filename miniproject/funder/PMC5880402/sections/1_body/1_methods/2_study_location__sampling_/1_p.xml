<p>Prior to the study, researchers from CSU and LIBR traveled to northern Liberia in order to recruit villages into the current study. Multiple villages in Lofa County, Liberia were visited (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006348.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Individual households within two villages were enrolled. In an attempt to make our sample size as large as possible, each house in each village was visited, although not every house chose to participate. Upon enrollment, all members of the household provided blood via finger-stick performed by a local nurse recruited into the study. The finger surface was swabbed with an ethanol wipe prior to blood collection. Finger prick blood (hereafter referred to as human dried bloodspots (H-DBS)) was pipetted onto CloneSaver FTA cards (GE Healthcare, USA), and immediately soaked in 25Î¼L of RNA

Body temperature was collected upon enrollment and during each sampling period, however enrollment was not contingent upon presenting as febrile.
