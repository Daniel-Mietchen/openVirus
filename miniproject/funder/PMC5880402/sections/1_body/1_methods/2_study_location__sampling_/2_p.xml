<p>Following enrollment of households, villages were visited every other day for up to two weeks to collect engorged female mosquitoes as previously described with slight modification [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Mosquitoes were aspirated from inside of houses with InsectaZookas (Bioquip, USA) prior to sunrise in order to collect mosquitoes that fed the previous night. Aspiration collections were sorted by date and location. Collections were transported to the LIBR research station in Bolahun, Liberia, where mosquitoes were identified using morphological keys [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with the addition of soaking blood in RNA
 <italic>later</italic>, hereafter referred to as mosquito-dried bloodspots (M-DBS). FTA cards containing both H/M-DBS were placed in multi-barrier pouches (GE Healthcare, USA) containing desiccant beads to reduce humidity and prevent microbial growth. Samples were kept at 4°C until stored on icepacks and shipped to CSU. Pouches containing H/M-DBS were stored at -80°C until further processing.
