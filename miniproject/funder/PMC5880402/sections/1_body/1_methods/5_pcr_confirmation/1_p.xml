<p>In order to validate data obtained through NGS, we designed species-specific PCR primers to 1) confirm the presence of our target of interest in individual DBS, and 2) determine the prevalence of the detected pathogens from our samples. Primers were designed using the Primer3 software version 2.3.4 in Geneious (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006348.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The presence of GBV-C was determined from individual DBS using a one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit (Qiagen, Germany). The sequencing reaction was run on a 1% agarose gel to visualize the amplified product. Samples that produced visible bands were sent for Sanger sequencing using the forward primer at Quintarabio labs (USA). Chromatogram files were then aligned to the reference genome in Geneious 10.2.2 to confirm specificity. The presence of HBV was determined from individual DBS using the iTaq Universal One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Bio-Rad, USA) containing SYBR green on a real-time PCR platform. Positive samples were sequenced and confirmation analysis was performed as stated above.
