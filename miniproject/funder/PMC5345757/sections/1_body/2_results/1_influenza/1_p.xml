<p>For the 2014–2015 flu season we gathered a total of 5,487 trajectories from a set of 48 volunteer participants during the 32 week period spanning 2014w41 through 2015w19. For the 2015–2016 flu season we gathered a total of 3,833 trajectories from a set of 23 volunteer participants during the 30 week period spanning 2015w42 through 2016w19.
