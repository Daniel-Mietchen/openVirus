<p>We next consider the number of regional predictions accurate within a target range, as a function of lead time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005248.g004">Fig 4</xref>). For 2, 3, and 4 weeks ahead, the lead time with lowest accuracy is roughly 2, 3, and 4 weeks ahead of the Peak Week, respectively, which suggests that there is a distinct challenge in forecasting the Peak Height. This is to be expected because there is significantly more volatility around the peak of the epidemic. In general, accuracy in season-wide targets rises sharply 2â€“5 weeks before the epidemic peak and remains high through the remainder of the season.
