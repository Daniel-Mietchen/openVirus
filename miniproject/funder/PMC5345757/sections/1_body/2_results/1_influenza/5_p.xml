<p>The remainder of our analysis is focused on comparing the accuracy of Epicast with individual participants and competing methods; we begin with Win Rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005248.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Overall, considering all targets, Epicast has Win Rates above 0.5 (lower absolute error than a competitor on a majority of predictions) when compared with all but one individual participant and all four statistical frameworks. In season-wide targets, Epicast performs reasonably well; however, six participants and the ArcheFilter method bring Epicastâ€™s Win Rate below 0.5. In short-term targets, Epicast has Win Rates uniformly above 0.5. Epicast has a Win Rate significantly higher than the Spline method in all categories and significantly higher than the Empirical Bayes and ArcheFilter methods both overall and in short-term targets. Epicast never has a significantly lower Win Rate than any of the competing statistical systems.
