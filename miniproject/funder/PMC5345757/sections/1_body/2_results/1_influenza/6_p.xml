<p>Next, we compare predictions in terms of MAE. We calculate, separately for each target, MAE across regions as a function of lead time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005248.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In agreement with previous results, Epicast MAE in season-wide targets generally decreases with lead time and is highest in short-term targets when predicting the peak value of wILI. MAE is occasionally elevated in short-term targets on the Peak Week (lead time = 0), suggesting a relative increase in uncertainty immediately after the true peak (which is not known at the time to be so). Compared with the statistical methods, Epicast particularly excels when predicting short-term targets.
