<p>For the 2015â€“2016 season, short-term accuracy (relative, not absolute) is surprisingly low in several regions around 10 weeks before the peak. This is likely due to the fact that the Peak Week in most regions was exceptionally late during this season. As a result, wILI was still near to baseline values for several weeks after predictions were made. Predicting a premature rise in wILI when ground truth was small in magnitude resulted in errors exceeding 50% of the actual value in several regions. Once it became clear that this would likely turn out to be a mild and/or late-peaking season, accuracy rose to nominal pre-peak levels.</p>
