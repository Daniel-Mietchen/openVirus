<p>We first consider the fraction of predictions accurate within a target range, aggregated over weeks of the season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005248.g003">Fig 3</xref>). For the four short-term Lookahead targets, the Epicast prediction is within 10% of the actual value just under half the time when predicting one week into the future; this falls to roughly one quarter of the time when predicting 4 weeks into the future. The trend is similar, though perhaps less abrupt, at other accuracy thresholds. Accuracy within 50% is achieved near or above 85% of the time, even predicting up to 4 weeks ahead.
