<p>As part of our evaluation of the Epicast system in forecasting flu, we compare with several competing statistical and/or data-driven systems. For the 2014–2015 flu contest, we compare Epicast with “Empirical Bayes” and “Pinned Spline”; for the 2015–2016 flu contest, we compare Epicast with “Stat” and “ArcheFilter”. All of these systems were serious and successful competitors in their respective contest years. Consequently, the performance of these systems provides a measure of the state of the art in flu forecasting. None of these competing systems were used in both flu contests, hence we compare against a different set of systems in different years.</p>
