<p>In regards to terminology in subsequent discussion, there is an important distinction to be made between a 
 <italic>prediction</italic> and a 
 <italic>forecast</italic>. These words are often used interchangeably elsewhere, but here we use them to refer to subtly different concepts. A prediction makes an absolute statement about the future and says nothing about other potential outcomes. In contrast, a forecast is a generalization of a prediction in which a probability is assigned to all possible outcomes. In the case of Epicast, we collect a prediction from each participant—a single possibility. Epicast aggregates many such predictions to produce a forecast—a probability distribution over all possibilities. Because predictions and forecasts make different claims, they are evaluated by different metrics; we use mean absolute error (MAE) to assess predictions and mean negative log likelihood (based on “logarithmic score” [
