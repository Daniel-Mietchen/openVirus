<p>The Empirical Bayes system [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005248.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] is based on the notion that future epidemics will generally resemble past epidemics, up to basic transformations and noise. This system defines a prior distribution over wILI trajectories, draws samples from that distribution, assigns a likelihood-based weight to each sample, and finally produces a posterior distribution over trajectories. The reported forecast for each target is derived from the posterior distribution of wILI trajectories.
