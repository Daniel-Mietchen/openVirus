<p>A natural evolution of systems such as those for epidemiological forecasting is the combination of human and statistical (machine) methods [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005248.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The first question in such a project is whether human predictions should be given as input to statistical methods or whether the output of the statistical methods should be shown to humans for more informed predictions. In theory both directions are viable, and there are intuitive reasons for each. In support of the latter, people are naturally inclined to trust forecasts made by humans (or to distrust forecasts made by machines), a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005248.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Supporting the former, on the other hand, is the observation that in many settings and in a variety of tasks, objective machine prediction is often superior to subjective human prediction [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We have begun to explore both directions; currently, we show a subset of Epicast participants a confidence band derived from a separate statistical method, and we are developing a retrospective analysis wherein we compare performance of various statistical methods with and without a supplemental input of human prediction as an independent data source. In the meantime, we plan to continue to host Epicast and collect predictions for the current flu season, and we end this section with an open invitation to participate [
