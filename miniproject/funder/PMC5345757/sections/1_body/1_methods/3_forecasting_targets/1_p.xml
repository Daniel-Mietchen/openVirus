<p>The objectives of the influenza challenges were to forecast a number of features, or “targets”, of the weekly wILI time series. These included: “Peak Height”, the maximum value of wILI reported throughout the flu season; “Peak Week”, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) week number [

Each of these values was forecasted separately for each of the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions of the U.S. and also for the U.S. as a whole—a super-region which we include in our analysis as one of eleven total regions. The forecast for each target in each region consisted of a set of probability bins over a pre-defined range of outcomes and a prediction of the single most likely outcome. The chikungunya challenge objective was simply to predict the trajectory of cumulative case counts in each country or territory.
