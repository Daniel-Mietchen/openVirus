<p>The Epicast point prediction for any target was defined as the median of the target values measured on user predictions. The Epicast forecast for any target was a Studentâ€™s t distribution with location equal to the median value (the point prediction), scale equal to the sample standard deviation of values, and degrees of freedom equal to the number of participants.
