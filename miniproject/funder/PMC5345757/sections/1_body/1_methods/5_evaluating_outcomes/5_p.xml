<p>To compensate for the varying difficulty over time of predicting and forecasting, we often treat accuracy as a function of “lead time”, the number of weeks preceding the region-specific Peak Week. Positive, zero, and negative lead times indicate predictions and forecasts made before, on, and after the epidemic peak, respectively. We consider lead times for the 2014–2015 flu season that range from +10 to −10 weeks. However, due to the unusually late Peak Week within most regions in the 2015–2016 flu season, we constrain lead times in that season to the range of +10 to −5 weeks.</p>
