<p>We further assess wILI and case-count predictions (for example, Peak Height) by measuring how often predictions fall within some range (± 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%) of ground truth. We similarly assess predictions of weeks (for example, Peak Week) by measuring how often predictions fall within some range (± 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 weeks) of ground truth. We report the fraction of the time that predicted values fall within each range, aggregated over regions and potentially also weeks. We refer to these analyses as “fraction of predictions accurate within a target range”.</p>
