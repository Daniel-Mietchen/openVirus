<p>Our main challenge in presenting results is that the space in which comparisons can be made consists of several orthogonal dimensions: regions (U.S. and 10 HHS regions), targets (Peak Week, Peak Height, and 1–4 Week Lookaheads), season weeks (depending on season and target, up to 32), and error metrics (MAE and log score). To concisely compare system performance, we are given the non-trivial task of reducing this dimensionality, otherwise we would come to thousands of separate figures of merit. Several confounding issues impede aggregation along any one axis; forecasting difficulty varies over time as the season progresses, the various regions may peak at different times in the season, long-term targets are often more difficult to predict than short-term targets, and targets are measured in different units. To work around these complications in the case of point predictions, we rank systems and participants in terms of absolute error and perform our analysis on the relative ranking assigned to each predictor. More specifically, we consider the pairwise ranking in absolute error of Epicast versus individual participants and statistical frameworks. For each lead time, region, and target, we ask whether Epicast or the competitor had a smaller absolute error, and we measure the fraction of instances where Epicast had the smaller error—a “Win Rate”. To assess the statistical significance of each result, we use a Sign test with the null hypothesis that the pair of forecasters is equally accurate. It should be noted that this test assumes that all observations are independent, but results across adjacent weeks, for example, are likely to be correlated to some extent.</p>
