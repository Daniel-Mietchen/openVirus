  <title>Epicast Win Rate against individuals and competing systems.</title>
  <p>All plots show, for each predictor (users participating on at least half of the weeks and statistical systems Empirical Bayes (EB), Pinned Spline (SP), Stat (ST), and ArcheFilter (AF)), Win Rate: the fraction of instances where Epicast had lower absolute error than the competitor, across all regions and lead times (
   <italic>n</italic>
   <sub>2014</sub> = 231, 
   <italic>n</italic>
   <sub>2015</sub> = 176 per target). A Win Rate above the reference line of 0.5 implies that Epicast had lower absolute error more frequently than the indicated predictor. Statistical significance is determined by Sign test; *:

   <bold>(A; D)</bold> all six targets, 
   <bold>(B; E)</bold> the two season-wide targets, and 
   <bold>(C; F)</bold> the four short-term targets.
