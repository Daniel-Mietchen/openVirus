<p>In order to better characterize whether the observed 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-induced health improvement could be due to a local protective effect against influenza-induced gut mucosa damage, histological analyses were conducted on gut tissues before and after influenza infection. Before infection, no histological differences were evidenced in the small intestine of mice fed either with PBS or 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184976.s003">S3a and S3b Fig</xref> respectively). Seven days after intranasal H3N2 viral infection, no alteration of intestinal tissue, such as atrophy of villi or lymphocytic infiltration could be detected in either PBS or 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184976.s002">S2c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184976.s003">S3d</xref> Figs respectively). The selected images were taken from the jejunum region, but similar results were obtained both in the duodenum and ileum. In addition, no diarrhea was observed upon infection in both gavage conditions. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the mouse-adapted influenza cannot affect the intestinal barrier and that the

 <italic>paracasei</italic> induced health status improvement was not linked to protection against intestinal damage. Moreover, we tested the impact of two other

 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> CNCM I-3689 and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>rhamnosus</italic> CNCM I-3690 did not promote improvement in body weight loss (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184976.s004">S4b Fig</xref>). Altogether, the protective effects induced by

 <italic>paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518 in the influenza H3N2 experimental model appeared to be strain specific.
