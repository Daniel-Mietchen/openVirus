<p>To address whether bacterial components could recapitulate

 <italic>paracasei</italic> protective effects, mice were fed with purified peptidoglycan of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518. We selected a dose equivalent to 1 mg peptidoglycan per gavage, since this exceeded the peptidolgycan dose previously found to induce anti-inflammatory immune responses in a mouse model, using a 
 <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> strain [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Health status improvement was observed, but to a much lesser extent than with the whole bacterial strain. Body weight loss and temperature loss were also slightly less pronounced in the

 <italic>paracasei</italic> peptidoglycan-fed mice, compared to the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184976.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Gavage with peptidoglycan triggered a significant reduction of viral loads in the lungs, 7 days after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184976.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Regarding immune cells recruitment in the lungs after 7 days of gavage, prior to influenza infection, a significant increase was observed for dendritic cells but not for other cell types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184976.g006">Fig 6B</xref>); there was actually a decrease of interstitial macrophages and of the B cell population. Thus, oral administration of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> peptidoglycan partially induced the protective effects of the entire

 <italic>paracasei</italic> bacterium.
