<p>In mucosal tissue, the innate lymphoid cell family (ILC) has an essential role for initiation, regulation and resolution of inflammation [

 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the lung of mice, group 2 ILCs are activated in response to IL-33 following influenza infection and subsequent immune-mediated tissue damage [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this context, tissue repair requires IL-23 and/or IL-1β signaling, which promotes a wave of IL-22 production by group 3 ILC and T cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, the functional groups 1 ILC appear to be essential for the early phase of influenza infection [

 <italic>paracasei</italic>-treated mice compared to control treated mice before the influenza infection. However, ILCs cell numbers and the cytokine releases were unaffected in both the control and

 <italic>paracasei</italic> feeding before infection changed the presence of ILC subsets but not cytokine expression, and generated more IFN-γ producing ILC1 (mainly NK cells) and T
