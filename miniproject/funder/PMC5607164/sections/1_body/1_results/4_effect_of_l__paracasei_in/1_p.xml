<p>To decipher whether the observed effect of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> on health improvement and immunity could be linked to an indirect effect via the modulation of gut microbiota, feces samples were collected at different time points of influenza infection. Using alpha and beta-diversity metrics, number of OTUs and weighted Unifrac distance respectively, we did not observe any difference in microbiota composition at D-7 between both groups suggesting that both groups were homogeneous in term of microbiota before any treatment (

 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518 affected gut microbiota before influenza infection in comparison to that of PBS-fed control mice. Following 7 days ingestion of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> or PBS the gut microbiota was not modified when looking at alpha (
