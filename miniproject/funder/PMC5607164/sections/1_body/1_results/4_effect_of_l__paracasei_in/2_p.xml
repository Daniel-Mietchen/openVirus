<p>We next investigated whether consumption of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> modulated gut microbiota in influenza-infected mice 3 and 7 days post-infection. Using Weighted Unifrac distance, we observed a gradual change in gut microbiota (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184976.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), which can be related to both infection and time effect (p = 0.003). However, this effect was independent to treatment group, suggesting that 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> fed mice did not induce differential microbiota after influenza infection. Microbiota richness was increased in PBS-treated mice only 3 days post infection, while no difference was observed in 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-fed mice. However, no difference was observed 10 days post infection. Regarding microbiota composition at genus level, two genera were significantly modulated between both treatments, but only 7 days post influenza infection. 
 <italic>Allobaculum</italic> was significantly increased 7 days post infection in 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-treated group compared to PBS-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184976.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), while a genus related to 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> significantly decreased in PBS-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184976.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> did not strongly modulate gut microbiota before and after influenza infection.
