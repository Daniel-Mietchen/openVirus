<p>Probiotics, specifically lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, have been extensively studied for their protective effects toward respiratory infections in children, young adults and the elderly. Recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews indicated that probiotic consumption could reduce incidence, duration, or severity of respiratory infections [
