<p>In this report, we provided an extensive characterization of the modifications in the innate immune response associated with 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> administration. 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> consumption seems to allow an early activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β) and a massive recruitment of immune cells in the lungs after 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> gavage and prior to influenza infection. IL-1α and IL-1β are induced in response to oxidative, inflammatory or metabolic stressors. This initial IL-α/β-dependent chemokine production leads to the recruitment of myeloid cells to the stressed tissue [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Thus, we propose that 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> induces an early induction of an inflammatory response triggered by the passive release of IL-1α/β into the lung tissue as an alarm. This pre-activation state of the immune system seems to be responsible of the faster clearance of influenza virus, confirmed by the rapid expansion of IFN-γ producing ILC1 (NK cells essentially). The lower inflammatory response observed after a viral infection in 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-fed mice may explain the better health state compared to control-fed mice. Interestingly, we also observed that IL-33 was detected at a significantly higher level at D7 in the lungs of mice 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>–fed. IL-33 has an essential role in inducing ILC2 and T
 <sub>H</sub>2 responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Published studies have demonstrated that the T
 <sub>H</sub>2 production of the cytokine IL-13, in response to stimulation with IL-33, can promote the hyperplasia of epithelial cells in the context of airway inflammation [

 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>–fed mice showed an expansion of T
 <sub>H</sub>2 cells after viral infection, which suggest that IL-13 and IL-5 produced by T cells have beneficial effects for the tissue homeostasis. Although lung resident ILC2 were able to produce large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13, these cells (ILC2) might have not a prominent role in this viral context. It remains unclear whether IL-22 producing ILC3 and T cells are implicated in the tissue repair in our model, or whether they are implicated in the early phase of the viral infection in 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-fed mice. Finally, 10 days after viral infection, we observed more of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, in the lungs of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-fed mice compared to those gavaged with PBS. This observation supports our hypothesis of an early beneficial induction of the pro-inflammatory response before influenza infection and a lower inflammatory response after this infection to counteract an overactive immune response.
