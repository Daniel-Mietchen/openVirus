<p>Our results suggest that 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic>-induced signals influence the immune response at distal site. However, the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. To investigate whether this effect could be mediated by bacterial component(s), 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> peptidoglycan was orally administered to mice. Peptidoglycan is a major component of bacterial wall that was already shown to be involved in the induction of the immune response in the lungs of Balb/c mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Peptidoglycan is able to partially reproduce the effect of entire 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> bacteria. In particular, dendritic cells recruitment in the lungs at D0 after peptidoglycans gavage may help controlling viral infection as suggested by the reduction of viral load at D7 of flu infection. Further work will be required to understand which other bacterial components or secreted metabolites such as Short Chain Fatty Acids promote additional modifications that are involved in the health improvement. Indeed, it has been described that acidic exopolysaccharide from 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>bulgaricus</italic> was able to confer protection against influenza in mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We also investigated whether the impact of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> on influenza infection could be indirect, via modulation of the gut microbiota. Indeed increased amount of studies observed a relation between gut microbiota members and respiratory tract, the so-called gut-lung axis [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. At homeostasis, after 7 days of gavage without infection, we did not observe significant differences in the microbiota composition between 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> and control-fed mice. Interestingly, we observed that 7 days post infection, two bacterial genera were differently modulated between 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> and control groups. 
 <italic>Allobaculum</italic> was significantly increased while an unclassified [
 <italic>Prevotella</italic>] significantly decreased following 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>paracasei</italic> gavage. Interestingly, Cox et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] observed that 
 <italic>Allobaculum</italic>, positively correlated with RORÎ³t and IL-17 expression, suggesting roles in intestinal Th17 differentiation in a low-dose penicillin murine model.
