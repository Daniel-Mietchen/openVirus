<p>It was previously described that influenza virus could induce intestinal injuries even after intranasal injection [

Nevertheless, in our model, no histological lesions were evidenced in the small intestines of influenza-infected mice compared to control Balb/c mice fed with PBS. However, the viral strain and host genetic background could be important pathogenic factors [
