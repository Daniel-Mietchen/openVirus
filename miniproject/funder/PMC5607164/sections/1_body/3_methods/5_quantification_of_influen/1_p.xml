<p>Lung tissues were homogenized and RNA was isolated with an RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, then cDNA was generated using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega). An ABI7300 real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems) was used for real-time quantitative PCR analysis of cDNA with primers generated to be specific for the sequence encoding the M2 protein of IAV. Samples were normalized to Ribonuclease P expression. Viral load was determined by relative quantification using the 2
 <sup>(-ΔΔC(T))</sup> method [
