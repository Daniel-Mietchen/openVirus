<p>Bacterial cultures were grown overnight to stationary phase in MRS broth, and peptidoglycan purified as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, sacculi were extracted by boiling in SDS (4% wt/vol) for 1 hour, washed by resuspension with MilliQ (MQ)-H

 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Cells were broken by mechanical shearing with glass beads (Sigma Aldrich) using a Precellys24 homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). Cell walls were resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7 and sequentially digested at 37°C with α-amylase (100 μg/ml; overnight), DNase (10 μg/ml) and RNase (50 μg/ml) plus 20 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> (2 hours) and trypsin (100 μg/ml) plus 10 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (overnight). Following boiling for 15 min in 1% SDS, the cell pellets were washed once by resuspension with MQ-H
 <sub>2</sub>O and centrifugation as before. Pellets were incubated for 15 min at 37 with 8M LiCl °C, followed by 100 mM EDTA pH 8, and then washed twice with MQ-H2O by resuspension-centrifugation as before. The pellet was resuspended in acetone by sonication, then the cell pellet collected, washed twice with MQ-H2O by resuspension-centrifugation, and the white pellet dried by speed-vac, then resuspended in 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 48 hours. HF was removed by extensive resuspension and centrifugation with MQ-H2O until the pH was stable at around 5. The purified peptidoglycan was dried then resuspended to 5mg/ml with 12.5 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 5.6 and digested overnight with 100 units/ml mutanolysin (Sigma). Reagents were prepared using endotoxin free water. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 3 min. No undigested material was observed, suggesting the peptidoglycan was fully solubilized. Mice were gavaged with 200 μl volumes of the resulting solution, equivalent to 1 mg
