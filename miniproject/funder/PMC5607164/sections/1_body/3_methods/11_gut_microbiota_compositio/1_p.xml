<p>80 fresh fecal samples were collected from

 <italic>paracasei</italic> and PBS- gavaged mice at several time points. Pellets were stored at −80°C until extraction. Fecal DNA was extracted using mechanical lysis (Fastprep
 <sup>®</sup> FP120 (ThermoSavant) followed by phenol/chloroform-based extraction as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Gene specific primers for the bacterial 16S rRNA were used to amplify the V3-V4 region (341F-806R) following the protocol from [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The library pool was mixed with 10% of Illumina PhiX control libraries. Mixed Phix/16S libraries were sequenced in multiplex on the MiSeq machine with the MiSeq v3 chemistry to perform paired-end 300bp sequencing. The paired-end reads were assembled with FLASH [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] (default parameters). Quality trimming and filtering (quality and length based) have been realized with QIIME (v1.8) [

 <italic>e novo</italic> OTUs were picked using vsearch algorithm (version 2.0.3). RDP classifier trained on GreenGenes database (version 13.8, august 2013) [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] was used for the taxonomic OTU annotation. A second level of sequence filtering based on OTU read counts (OTU read count&gt; 0.005% of total read count) was performed as recommended in [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. After quality filtering, a total 2,481,960 assembled reads, 31024 ± 8488 / sample, were included for downstream analyses. For alpha- and beta-diversity analyses, samples were rarefied to 15,000 sequences per sample. Alpha-diversity (that measures diversity within samples) was assessed using rarefaction curves for richness (Observed OTUs), and evenness (Shannon index). Beta-diversity analysis (that measures diversity between samples) was performed on weighted Unifrac distances. Raw counts were normalized with the DESeq2 Bioconductor package normalization function [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Normalized counts were converted to log2(CPM), counts per million (voom function, limma package) [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Paired statistical analysis of the transformed data was performed with limma (block factor: mouse). Benjamini-Hochberg method [
 <xref rid="pone.0184976.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] was used for p. value adjustment for multiple testing, (FDR threshold: 0.05). An additional filter was used to filter significant OTU/taxa: at least 3 non-zero counts, in at least one of the groups considered in the contrast. Global comparison of groups was performed using permutational anova [
