 <italic>paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518 was cultured in MRS (Man, Rogosa, Sharpe) broth (DIFCO
 <sup>®</sup>) at 37°C overnight in aerobic conditions. The cultured bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (4500 g) and washed with sterile PBS (Gibco). After washing, the optical density was measured at 600 nm (OD
 <sub>600nm</sub>) and adjusted with additional PBS to obtain a final OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> of 1. The bacterial suspension was stored at -80°C in aliquots until use. Influenza A virus, A/Scotland/20/74 (H3N2); IAV) adapted to mice was made from lung homogenates in 30% glycerol and stored at -80°C. The virus was prepared, stored in aliquots at -80°C and thawed prior to infection as previously described [
