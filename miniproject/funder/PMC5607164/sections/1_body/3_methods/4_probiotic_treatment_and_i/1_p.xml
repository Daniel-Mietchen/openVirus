 <italic>paracasei</italic> oral gavage was continued during the whole period of viral infection. Health status and appearance score of mice were followed during the whole experiment (17 days). Weight, coetaneous temperature (using Infrared Thermometer from Bioseb) and fur appearance of each mouse were measured daily. Results were expressed as body weight loss and temperature loss compared to values for each mouse at D0. Fur appearance was scored after infection at D0 as follows: 3; Coat is smooth, 2; Patches of hair piloerected, 1; Majority of back is piloerected, and 0; Piloerection may or may not be present, mouse appears “puffy”[

Mice were sacrificed at different time points of the experiment (n = 5 mice sacrificed at each time point/ experiment, unless otherwise mentioned). After perfusion, lungs were extracted, homogenized in order to eliminate heterogeneity of lesions distribution and then divided into three lots and used to perform the cytokine assay, flow cytometry analysis and RT- real time PCR.
