  <title>Effects of 
   <italic>L</italic>. 
   <italic>paracasei</italic> consumption on health status of influenza-infected mice.
  </title>
  <p>(A) An overview of the experimental scheme; (B) Body weight loss that was expressed in comparison to day 0 of viral infection for each mouse. We scored each individual mouse in comparison to its weight at day 0 as no significant differences were observed prior to viral infection. (C) Temperature loss expressed as the difference between values at D0 in mice after influenza infection with 260 pfu; (D) Score appearance of mice after influenza infection. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM for each group (n = 31). (*p&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001, **** P&lt;0.0001). (E) Viral load measured with RTq-PCR at D7 or D10 post influenza infection in the lungs of mice fed with either 
   <italic>L</italic>. 
   <italic>paracasei</italic> (N = 15) or with PBS (N = 16). (F). Hemorrhagic lesion in the lungs of 
   <italic>L</italic>. 
   <italic>paracasei</italic>- or PBS fed mice at day 7 post influenza infection compared with non-infected mice. Data are means ± SEM of each group of mice. (*p&lt;0.05).
