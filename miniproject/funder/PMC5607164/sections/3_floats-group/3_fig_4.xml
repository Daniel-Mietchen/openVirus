   <sup>+</sup> cells. The analysis of ILC3 subsets were supported by the expression of NKp46 and CCR6. Numbers adjacent to boxed areas indicate relative percentage of gated populations. Representative results from 4 independent experiments. (B-C) Representative histograms show the absolute numbers of ILC subsets (B) T cells (C) in lung. (D) Lung cells were stimulated for 4h with IL-12, IL-18, IL-33, IL-23 and IL-1β and IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-22 expression in ILCs and T cells was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Graph represents the absolute numbers of cells. Representative results from 4 independent experiments (n = 9/group). *, P&lt;0.05.
