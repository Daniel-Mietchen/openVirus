<p>The DENV 3 phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006817.g004">Fig 4</xref>) classified the current outbreak strains into genotype I and genotype III. The 2014–2015 DENV 3 strains were commonly noticed among genotype III clade, whereas the 2016–2017 strains appeared more in genotype I clades. The dengue strains from genotype III branched into two clades whereas genotype I strains were clustered together. The DENV 4 strains in this study belonged to genotype I and genotype II (
