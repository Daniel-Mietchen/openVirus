<p>The 2014–2017 DENV 1 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006817.g002">Fig 2</xref>) displayed a monophyletic relationship being clustered in the genotype I group. These strains showed a distant connection with strains from Vietnam, Cambodia, China and Taiwan-imported case from the same genotype. D1/Malaysia/330877/04 and D1/Malaysia/36139/05, which were two strains from the former 2004–2005 outbreaks formed their own clade, quite distinctively from the recent outbreak strains. One recent outbreak strain (D1/Malaysia/PUR/765027/15), isolated in December 2015 was noticeably set apart from other DENV 1 genotype I strains. There was no obvious clustering within the 2014–2017 DENV 1 strains as all of them were randomly dispersed within the clades.
