<p>The DENV 2 phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006817.g003">Fig 3</xref>) displayed a well-defined clade formation within the Cosmopolitan genotype. The Cosmopolitan genotype of Malaysian strains formed two main clades, which are referred to as Clade 1 and Clade 2. Clade 2 was further divided into sub-clade 2a and sub-clade 2b. There were two strains within Clade 1, namely D2/Malaysia/BAG/ 680429/14 and D2/Malaysia/WCK/738138/15, which were isolated in December 2014 and August 2015, respectively. Clade 2 comprised of strains isolated during the 2014–2017 outbreak. Domination of dengue strains by year of outbreak within sub-clade 2a and sub-clade 2b was observed. Early outbreak strains from the year 2014–2015 clustered in sub-clade 2b whereas late outbreak strains from the year 2015–2017 dominated sub-clade 2a.
