<p>Serotyping results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006817.g001">Fig 1</xref>) from 120 study subjects revealed that more than half of the study population were infected with DENV 1 (64/120; 53.0%) followed by DENV 2 (31/120; 26.0%), DENV 3 (20/120; 17.0%), DENV 4 (4/120; 3.0%) and mixed serotype DENV 1/ DENV 2 (1/120; 1.0%). The distribution of these serotypes by year of infection is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006817.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Among our study subjects, a domination of DENV 1 was seen from the year 2014–2016 with prevalence of 35.3% (6/17), 63.2% (36/57) and 58.6% (17/29) each year, respectively. In 2017, DENV 2 was more frequently observed than other serotypes (7/17; 41.2%) among the study subjects. The number of DENV 3-infected cases from 2014–2017 were less than DENV 1 and DENV 2 except in the year 2014 with prevalence of 29.4% (5/17), 19.4% (7/57), 13.8% (4/9) and 23.5% (4/17), respectively. DENV 4-infected cases were observed more in 2014 (3/17; 17.6%) and one case in 2017 (1/17; 5.9%) while one DENV 1/ DENV 2 mix serotype case was found in 2015 (1/17; 5.9%). Further, phylogenetic analysis classified these dengue strains into genotypes (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006817.g003">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006817.g006">6</xref>). All DENV 1 and DENV 2 strains were classified under genotype I and cosmopolitan genotype, respectively. DENV 3 strains clustered into two distinct genotypes. Genotype III comprised most of the DENV 3 strains as compared to genotype I. The DENV 4 strains from the study belong to genotype I and genotype II. In addition, one dengue strain with mixed serotypes of DENV 1/DENV 2 were identified. However, only DENV 2 from the mixed strain could be amplified by PCR and sequenced. All 120 sequences were deposited in NCBI with accession numbers MG450795 –MG450914.
