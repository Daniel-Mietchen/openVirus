<p>The investigation of dengue serotype-specific clinical manifestations demonstrated that DENV 2-infected patients were more frequently present with persistent vomiting (p = 0.010), epigastric pain (p = 0.018), severe plasma leakage (p = 0.004) and shock (p = 0.038). Additionally, myalgia and arthralgia were the two major musculoskeletal symptoms observed in DENV 3 infection (p = 0.015, p = 0.014). Although statistically insignificant, relatively high proportion of DENV 1-infected patients suffered from lethargy (9/58; 15.5%) and diarrhea (12/58; 20.7%). Furthermore, genotype I of DENV 3 was frequently found in patients with myalgia (p = 0.036). Likewise, genotype III of DENV 3 and arthralgia were found to be associated with one another (p = 0.035).</p>
