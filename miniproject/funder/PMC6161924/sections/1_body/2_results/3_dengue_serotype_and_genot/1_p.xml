<p>Of the total 120 cases investigated, 101 cases were included in the statistical analysis while the remaining 19 were omitted. As mentioned earlier, the excluded cases were those with incomplete clinical information, co-infection with leptospirosis and small sample size for particular serotype (DENV 4 and mixed serotype). The demographic details of the 101 study subjects are shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Age of the patients was significantly related to dengue serotypes. The median age group for DENV 1, DENV 2 and DENV 3-infected patients was 14, 27 and 23 respectively. A significant relationship was detected between dengue serotypes and disease classification (p = 0.007) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Dengue infections without warning signs were observed more frequently in patients who were infected with DENV 1 (29/58; 50.0%) and DENV 3 (8/16; 50.0%). Notably, DENV 2-infected patients more frequently developed severe dengue (9/27; 33.3%). In the present study, a total of 17 severe dengue cases were identified of which two were noted as fatal cases. Apart from this, dengue with warning signs were frequently displayed by patients infected with DENV 2 (13/27; 48.1%).
