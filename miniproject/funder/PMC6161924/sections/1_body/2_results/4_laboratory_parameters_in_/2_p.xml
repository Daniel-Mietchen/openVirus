<p>Serotype association with disease severity in regards to primary and secondary infection was elucidated in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In the primary infection group, the percentage of severe and non-severe dengue cases was 16.5% (16/97) and 83.5% (81/97), respectively. Also, within the primary infection group, disease severity was significantly associated with dengue serotype (p = 0.014). Among the severe dengue cases within the primary infection group, a great proportion were infected with DENV 2 (9/16; 56.3%) followed by DENV 1 (6/16; 37.5%) and DENV 3 (1/16; 6.3%) whereas among the non-severe dengue cases, 63.0% (51/81) were infected with DENV 1, followed by DENV 2 (17/81; 21.0%) and DENV 3 (13/81; 16.0%). In addition, within the secondary infection group, the percentage of severe cases was 25.0% (1/4) while 75.0% (3/4) were non-severe cases. The only severe dengue case in the secondary infection group was infected with DENV 3 while the three non-severe cases were each infected with DENV 1, DENV 2, and DENV 3.
