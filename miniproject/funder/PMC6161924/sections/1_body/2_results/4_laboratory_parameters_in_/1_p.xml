<p>Investigation of laboratory parameters in relation to dengue serotype and genotype is shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. None of the laboratory parameters were significant among dengue serotypes and genotypes. A majority of the study subjects that were infected with DENV 1 (57/68; 98.3%) and DENV 2 (26/27; 96.3%) had primary infection. The percentage of secondary infection was greater in the DENV 3 (2/16; 12.5%) infected group than other serotypes. The mean platelet count was the lowest among DENV 2-infected patients as indicated by mean (±SD) of 106 x 10
 <sup>9</sup> (±71.5) whereas the hematocrit level was the highest among DENV 3 patients (43.0 (±5.9)).
