<p>With advanced laboratory tests, the serotyping of the dengue virus from an infected patient can be performed even on the first day of fever. Most clinical symptoms of severe dengue infection only manifest at a later stage of dengue infection. Therefore, information on serotype or genotype-specific dengue manifestations may serve as early surrogate markers to predict disease progression. Furthermore, specific clinical manifestations may be over-represented in patients infected with certain DENV serotype and genotype. In consideration of the above discussion, this study aims to investigate the clinical manifestations of dengue patients in relation to dengue serotype and genotype during a dengue outbreak period in Malaysia.</p>
