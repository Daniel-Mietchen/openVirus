<p>Since the 1950’s, dengue has become a serious health problem in the South-East Asia region. In 1902, Malaysia experienced its first case of dengue [

Since then, Malaysia has increasingly become popular for perpetual dengue endemic issues, resulting from the continuous rise in reported dengue infection cases. The country experienced major outbreaks in 1974, 1978, 1982, 1990. Notably, Malaysia recorded the highest number of dengue cases between 2014 and 2017. In 2014, a total of 108,698 cases were reported in Malaysia which was equivalent to an incidence rate (IR) of 361.1 cases in 100,000 populations with 215 mortalities. This alarming figure had outnumbered the previous recorded dengue cases in 2013 by 150.8%. Meanwhile, there was a noticeable increase in 2015 with 120,836 cases (IR = 396.4), along with 336 mortalities. In 2016, the total number of dengue cases declined to around 101,357, although, the mortality rate was 10% higher as compared to that in 2014. [

However, the number was still higher as compared to that in 2013. Subsequently, this prompted the Malaysian government to implement a program to eradicate
