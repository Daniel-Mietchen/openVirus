<p>Several risk factors at various intensities have contributed towards the severity of dengue infection during the course of an outbreak. Viral factors are often considered as one of the risk factors and components of interest in many studies in this field. A shift in the distribution of dengue serotypes and genotypes may contribute to the accelerating number of dengue cases due to an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This comparison is particularly important to further aid in the early prediction of a patientâ€™s condition based on the clinical characteristics and information on the serotype and genotype of the dengue virus infecting the patient.
