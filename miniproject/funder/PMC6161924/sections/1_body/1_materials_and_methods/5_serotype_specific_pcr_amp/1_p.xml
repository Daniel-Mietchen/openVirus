<p>The partial E gene of dengue virus was amplified before sequencing by using four sets of serotype-specific oligonucleotides [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. All amplification reactions were carried out in a 96-well conventional Thermal Cycler (Bio Rad, USA). The PCR was undertaken at 50°C for 30 min, 94°C for 2 min and 45 cycles of (94°C for 15 sec, 50°C for 30 sec and 68°C for 1 min) followed by an extension reaction at 68°C for 5 min. A 25 μl aliquot of each PCR reaction was analyzed on 1.5% pre-stained agarose by gel electrophoresis and viewed under UV illumination. The corresponding amplicons were extracted from the agarose gel and purified by a Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The final elution contained 30 μl of purified PCR amplicons whereby 5 μl of these were reanalyzed on 1.5% agarose gel to substantiate the accuracy of purification step. The purified PCR amplicons were outsourced for Sanger Sequencing (1
