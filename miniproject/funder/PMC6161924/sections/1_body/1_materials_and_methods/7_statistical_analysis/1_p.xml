<p>Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 was adopted to analyze data collected from the dengue patients. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (percentages). Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact test was performed to analyze the significance of the categorical variables. Continuous variables were tested for normality with the Komolgorov-Smirnov test. Non-parametric analysis by Kruskal-Wallis was employed for data with non-normal distribution and presented in median and interquartile range (IQR). The normally distributed data were analyzed by One-Way ANOVA and expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD). The patients’ data were tabulated according to categorical variables including gender, serotypes, genotypes and a spectrum of clinical manifestations. Meanwhile, continuous variables refer to parameters such as age, day of fever and laboratory test results. These data were utilized to determine the distribution of dengue serotype and genotype in the study population and describe the relation with demography, clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters. The analyses were performed at 95% confidence with level of significance of p&lt;0.05.</p>
