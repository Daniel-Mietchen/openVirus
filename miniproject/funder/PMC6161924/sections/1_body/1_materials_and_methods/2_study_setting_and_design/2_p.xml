<p>Dengue fever was diagnosed and defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 dengue classification and severity level. The classification was used to indicate dengue, dengue with warning sign and severe dengue. Severe dengue includes severe plasma leakage, severe haemorrhage and severe organ dysfunction. To make the clinical diagnosis and determine the severity of the dengue infection, a medical officer performed physical examination on the patient, after which the findings were keyed in the e-file and request was made for necessary laboratory tests to be performed. Following this, a team of experienced clinicians including consultants or specialists further verified the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis during daily clinical ward round based on patientsâ€™ progress in their symptoms, clinical findings as well as the latest laboratory test report. The implication of the observation was to determine whether the patient requires intensive unit (ICU) care or normal ward management.</p>
