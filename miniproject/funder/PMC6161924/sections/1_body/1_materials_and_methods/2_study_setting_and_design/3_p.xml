<p>Dengue serotyping and phylogenetic analysis were performed for all 120 specimens. Socio-demographic, clinical profiles and laboratory data were obtained from the patient's record from the respective hospitals. The information was later analyzed with the dengue serotyping and genotyping results performed in this study. Notably, in the sta-tistical analysis, some samples were excluded due to incomplete clinical information, the presence of co-infection with leptospirosis and small sample size for a particular serotype. The rationale for excluding the samples of patients co-infected with leptospirosis was due to the overlapping clinical features of the patients infected with leptospirosis and dengue. These samples, however, were not tested for other closely related co-infections such as Zika or Chikungunya due to budgetary constraints. Moreover, the information on the history and clinical presentation of the patients were unlikely to be of these diseases.</p>
