<p>This is a retrospective observational study performed with a total of 120 dengue serum specimens obtained from two tertiary hospitals and a research institute in Malaysia. The serum specimens were acquired from patients who were primarily admitted for dengue fever and confirmed for dengue infection at Hospital Serdang (n = 94) and Hospital Ampang (n = 24) from October 2014â€”May 2017. Two more sera from DENV 4-infected patients were obtained from the Virology Unit, at the Institute for Medical Research (IMR), in Kuala Lumpur. The inclusion criteria at the time of sample collection included samples that were positive for dengue NS1 antigen whereas exclusion criteria included suspicion for dengue but were negative for NS1 and identified as other febrile illnesses. The dengue confirmation criteria incorporated the results from the NS1 antigen rapid test, with or without Dengue IgM/IgG rapid combo tests performed by the hospitals. These tests were typically performed as soon as dengue infection was suspected in a patient. If dengue IgM was negative before day seven of the onset of fever, a repeat sample was taken at the recovery phase. The IgM and IgG rapid tests results were used to classify the cases as primary and secondary infection. Dengue cases that were positive for IgM but negative for IgG were regarded as primary infection whereas cases that were positive for either IgG only or both IgM and IgG were classified as secondary infection. The commercially available diagnostic kits incorporate an immunochromatography-based technique manufactured by Pan Bio (Brisbane, Australia). The NS1 antigen rapid test was interpreted by a single band targeting the dengue NS1 antigen. The IgM/IgG Dengue Duo Cassette highlights the presence of anti-dengue IgM and IgG antibodies in their specific bands. The results of the tests were displayed as reactive or non-reactive without titration. The reactive IgG result was semi-quantitative, showing the presence of antibodies in the serum which was equivalent to HAI titer of 1:2,560, indicating a secondary dengue infection.</p>
