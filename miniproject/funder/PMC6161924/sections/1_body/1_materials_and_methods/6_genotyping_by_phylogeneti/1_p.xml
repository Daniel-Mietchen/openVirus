<p>The sense and antisense sequences obtained by sequencing were aligned to produce a consensus partial E gene sequence by using CLUSTAL Omega software (

Reference sequences of E gene for each serotype were extracted from the GenBank database from various geographical regions. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with Mega 7 software adopting neighbor-joining method (bootstrap replication 1000x) for all four serotypes to determine the genotypes of dengue virus isolates.
