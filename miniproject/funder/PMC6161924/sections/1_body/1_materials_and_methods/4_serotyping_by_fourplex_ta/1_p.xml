<p>Dengue virus serotyping was carried out in a fourplex Taqman Real-Time RT-PCR detection platform as described by Johnson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2005) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. PCR reactions were prepared in a cocktail of 12.5 μl of 2X RT (reverse transcriptase)-PCR Mix (i-Script One Step RT-PCR kit, Biorad, USA), 0.5 μl of each primers (DENV 1 and DENV 3 primers: 50 μM; DENV 2 and DENV 4 primers: 25 μM), 0.45 μl of each probes (10μM), 0.5 μl of RT Enzyme Mix, and 1.2 μl of nuclease-free water. Positive controls for each serotype comprised of RNA from previously confirmed dengue patients, and obtained from the Virology Unit, IMR. The negative control consisted of reactions without an RNA template, which was substituted with 5μl of nuclease-free water. Taqman Real-Time RT-PCR amplification was performed on the CFX 96 (Biorad, USA) platform at 50°C for 10min, 95°C for 5min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 30 sec. The aforementioned PCR mix and cycling conditions were optimized by the Virology Unit. io:
