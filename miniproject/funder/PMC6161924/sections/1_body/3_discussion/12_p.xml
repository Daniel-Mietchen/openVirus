<p>Our study findings demonstrated that symptoms of dengue infected patients in Malaysia were indeed serotype and genotype-specific. DENV 1 was found to cause dengue without warning signs and mild symptoms. DENV 2 patients were more likely to present with severe dengue as compared to other serotypes. In addition, DENV 3-infected patients frequently had musculoskeletal symptoms. These findings suggested that different dengue serotypes targeted different receptors or organs to establish infection. Following our findings and to benefit from further research, we recommend continuous monitoring of dengue clinical manifestations in relation to serotype and genotype and investigate the link between DENV 3 genotype III and disease severity with larger sample size. We also propose to look into the recent prevalence of primary and secondary dengue infection among Malaysian population as this has an implication on dengue vaccine.</p>
