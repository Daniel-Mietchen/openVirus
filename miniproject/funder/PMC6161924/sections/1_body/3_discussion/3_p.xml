<p>Apart from serotype replacement, emergence of new genotypes or genotypic clade replacements have been reported during dengue outbreak [

In the current study, all DENV 1 strains were classified into genotype I, which subsequently formed minute branches within the same genotype but well conserved. The monophyletic pattern indicated high genetic similarity among the DENV 1 Malaysian strains. As for DENV 2 Cosmopolitan genotype, the current outbreak strains diverged into clades, indicating minor evolution.
