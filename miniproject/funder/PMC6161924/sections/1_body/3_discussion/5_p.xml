<p>A handful of studies have shown the differences in dengue symptoms are serotype specific, but majority of these studies are conducted outside outbreak periods. A study among adult dengue patients in Singapore from 2005–2011 found that cases infected with DENV 1 were more likely to be presented with red eyes and had higher risk of developing severe dengue. In contrast, those DENV 2-infected patients were found to have frequent joint pains and significantly low platelet count [

The findings showed that DENV 3 had a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal manifestations while DENV 4 had a higher prevalence of respiratory and cutaneous manifestations [

On the other hand, a group of Indian researchers who undertook a study from 2002–2006 in New Delhi reported a significant result of hepatomegaly and abdominal pain in DENV 2-infected patients. The results of their study also noted that DENV 4 patients suffered from severe hemorrhagic manifestations [

All the aforementioned results showed that there were differences in clinical manifestations of dengue patients relating to the serotype owing to the differences in terms of year of study and level of endemicity in particular regions. In response to this, the present study investigated the relationship between dengue serotype and genotype, and the disease spectrum in Malaysia, a dengue hyper endemic country, during a recent outbreak period.
