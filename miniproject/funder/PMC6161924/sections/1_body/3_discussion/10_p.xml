<p>Comparison of serotype severity after stratifying by infection types demonstrated that among primary dengue infection cases, there is a significant association between DENV 2 and the disease severity. This indicates that primary infections caused by DENV 2 may lead to more severe presentations than DENV 1. Interestingly, only one severe case was found in the secondary infection group and no significance was observed among the serotypes and severity in this group. One possible explanation, in this case, could be that the patients in the secondary infection group could have been previously infected by the same serotype (homotypic infection). Recent studies have reported the evidence of homotypic dengue re-infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The findings for these studies demonstrate that, in some cases, serotype-specific immunity to DENV may be short-lived. Such cases challenge the paradigm of lifelong, serotype-specific DENV immunity following a natural infection. A greater risk to develop severe dengue is caused by heterotypic secondary DENV infection with a dengue serotype distinct from the primary infecting type [

Having said that, prior to the onset of the recent outbreak, DENV 1 were equally circulating with other serotypes (DENV 2 and DENV 3) from the year 2010â€“2012. It was only in the year 2013, there was an upsurge of DENV 2. Since the information is not available on the serotype that previously infected the patients in the secondary infection group, therefore our findings raised the possibility that these patients had been previously infected by DENV 1 also. Hence, increased disease severity was not observed. The theory of peak enhancement titer provides a second possible explanation. The enhancement of severe dengue is dependent on the pre-existing antibody titer, resulting from a different serotype infection. The pre-existing dengue antibody titer of 1: 21 to 1:80 induced high risk to develop severe dengue, whereas, a titer above 1: 320 triggered a protective effect [

It is more likely that the pre-existing dengue antibody titers in the secondary infection group in our study did not fall into the peak enhancement zone, thus causing less risk for severity. The IgM and IgG rapid test results were utilized to discriminate between primary and secondary infection. Several studies have evaluated the accuracy of infection status assignment using this method. One such study demonstrated a 100% sensitivity of an IgM/IgG rapid test in an attempt to distinguish between primary and secondary dengue virus infections [
