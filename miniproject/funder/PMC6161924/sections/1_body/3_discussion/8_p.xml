<p>The comparison between genotypes also exhibited that genotype III of DENV 3 may appear to be more virulent than genotype I. This is supported by the presence of two severe cases among DENV 3 genotype III-infected patients. These two cases were presented with severe organ impairment and shock (dengue shock syndrome), respectively. This finding may warrant further interest to investigate severity associated with DENV genotype III with inclusion of larger sample size. It can be postulated that since genotype III has been circulating dominantly among DENV 3 genotypes in Malaysia for extended period from its introduction in 2007 till 2013, thus it acquired sufficient survival fitness to become virulent over time as compared to genotype I which was dormant from 2012â€“2013 and had re-emerged during the outbreak in 2014. However re-emergence of DENV 3 genotype I has to be cautiously monitored as it could undergo adaptation to become more infectious to replace and diminish the existence of DENV 3 genotype III. This highlights the importance of studying serotype and genotype specific clinical manifestations during dengue outbreak to allow prediction of an outbreak outcome.</p>
