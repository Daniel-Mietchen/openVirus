<p>The present study showed a significant number of DENV 2-infected patients developed severe dengue more frequently as compared to other serotypes. These patients were also frequently presented with clinical manifestations such as persistent vomiting, epigastric pain, plasma leakage and shock. Many studies have proven that severity and DENV 2 are common especially in relation to shock manifestation [

Similarly in a retrospective study of dengue cases in Thailand, it was also found that DENV 2 was the most frequent serotype isolated from dengue hemorrhagic (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) cases followed by DENV 3, DENV 1 and DENV 4 [
