<p>The DENV 3 strains in our study were divided into genotype I and genotype III. Genotype III was constantly documented in Malaysia from 2007–2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, genotype I of DENV 3 was last documented in 2011 and also circulated in this country during dengue epidemics in 1974 and 2007–2008 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence, the appearance of genotype I that was equal to genotype III among DENV 3 strains in our study raised the possibility of re-emergence of genotype I especially during outbreaks. DENV 4 is a rare dengue serotype in Malaysia. Three strains from genotype I and a strain from genotype II were detected in the present study. One of the DENV 4 strains clustered together with the dengue strains from Myanmar, reflecting the likelihood of an imported case.
