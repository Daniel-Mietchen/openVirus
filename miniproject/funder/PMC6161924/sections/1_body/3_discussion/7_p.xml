<p>Our data suggested that both DENV 1 and DENV 3-infected patients displayed the mildest clinical presentation. The data also signified that DENV 3-infected patients suffered from myalgia and arthralgia. When compared across the genotypes, DENV 2 cosmopolitan was highly prevalent among patients with epigastric pain and shock. Besides that, DENV 3 genotype III was significantly observed among patients with arthralgia whereas DENV 3 genotype I was common among patients with myalgia. Several studies also reported an association between DENV 3 and musculoskeletal manifestations. According to Chan et al. (2009), the findings showed a significant relationship between DENV 3 and myalgia, but the genotype information was unknown [
