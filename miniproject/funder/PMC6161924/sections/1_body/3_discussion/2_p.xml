<p>In Malaysia, the serotype distribution of dengue virus has been inconsistent. However, there was a seemingly interesting pattern of circulation during outbreak period whereby major outbreaks were likely to follow the switching of DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A predominantly circulating dengue serotype before an outbreak is replaced by another serotype which persists towards the end of the outbreak. Once the number of cases decline, the persistent serotype is again replaced by another serotype. For instance, during the 1996–1998 dengue outbreaks in Malaysia, both DENV 1 and DENV 2 dominated other serotypes. Prior to 1996, DENV 3 was consistently circulating. After the outbreak subsided, DENV 2 began to surge from the year 1999 onwards. Similarly, when there was a sharp increase in the number of dengue cases in 2001 and 2002, DENV 2 in the prior years was replaced by DENV 3. Then, DENV 3 was overtaken by DENV 1 from year 2003 onwards as the number of cases declined [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006817.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, DENV 1 was primarily present at the study area from 2014–2017. This indicated that DENV 1 had replaced a formerly predominant DENV 2. The existing trend contended that serotype replacement, most probably with DENV 3 is predicted to take place once the current outbreak subsides. In contrast to our prediction, Tan et al (2017) reported the unlikeliness for DENV 3 to surge as serotype cyclical outbreak cycle in Malaysia has recently been disrupted with DENV 3 remained in the background of DENV 1 and DENV 2 from 2003 until now [
