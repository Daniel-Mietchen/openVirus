<p>Several strengths are inherent in this study. To the best of the researcher’s knowledge, this is the first observational study to investigate the relationship between dengue serotype and genotype with patients’ clinical manifestation during the recent outbreak peri-od among Malaysians. Additionally, our study findings may warrant further research to elucidate the strong association of dengue serotype and genotypes focusing on a larger population and localities. However, the study has limitations as well. Firstly, all retrospective studies depend on the completeness of medical data, and missing data is therefore unavoidable. In the present study, a number of subjects had to be excluded from the original count due to incompleteness of clinical data, thus resulted in a smaller sample size. Secondly, in Malaysia, many dengue specimens from hospitals were sent to the national reference laboratories for molecular diagnosis and surveillance purpose. Therefore, our collaborators from the hospitals were only able to provide those specimens that were not required for national surveillance. We need to acknowledge that there is a possibility of selection bias but, the findings in our study of resurgent DENV 1 infection during the recent outbreak period is consistent with the national surveillance of the dengue infection. In view of this, the selection bias was not substantial. Not only that, there was underrepresentation of certain serotypes in this study due to the small numbers such as DENV 4 causing it to be omitted from the statistical analysis. Lastly, the proportion of dengue subjects obtained in the year 2014 was low despite a spike in the dengue cases because the sample collection was initiated towards the end of the particular year.</p>
