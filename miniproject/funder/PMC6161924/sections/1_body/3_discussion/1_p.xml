<p>The present study focused on identifying the pattern of dengue serotype and genotype distribution from the year 2014â€“2017 in Malaysia and attempted to investigate the clinical spectrum of patients in relation to this distribution pattern. It was found that DENV 1 genotype I was the predominant serotype and genotype in the recent dengue outbreak in Malaysia. This reflected a serotype shift replacing the formerly predominant DENV 2 prior to the outbreak. Comparison of dengue serotype and genotype with disease spectrum contended that these clinical characteristics are serotype and genotype-specific. As most clinical symptoms of severe dengue infection only manifest at a much later stage of dengue infection, therefore, information on serotype or genotype-specific dengue manifestations may serve as early surrogate markers to predict disease progression.</p>
