  <title>Simulated and reconstructed phylogeographic spread.</title>
  <p>Viral spread in North and Central America, shown by transitions between locations for the underlying ground truth of the simulation (panel A) and phylogeny, and the inferred spread and phylogeny in panel B, which was reconstructed based on sequences simulated along the phylogeny in A. For the phylogeographic reconstruction, effective distances were used. Transitions between locations are colored by their origin. In the simulation, the outbreak was set in Veracruz (yellow), which was mainly involved in the spread, together with Cancún (green). Transitions from Mexico City are shown in orange, all others in dark blue. In the reconstruction, the origin was placed in Zacatecas (light blue). From there, the virus mainly spread via Mexico City (orange), Cancún (green) and Chicago (pink). All other transitions are shown in dark blue. The actual origin in Veracruz was not inferred and no sequences were sampled here, which is why this location is missing in the map. While the origin and main spread routes differ, the locations are geographically close, leading to a Fréchet tree distance of 39,591.53. The spread was visualized using Spread3 [
