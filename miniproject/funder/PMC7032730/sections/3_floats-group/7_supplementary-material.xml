  <title>Fréchet tree distances for reconstructions with BEAST using fixed rates and a fixed tree topology on the airport level.</title>
  <p>Fréchet tree distances shown on a log
   <sub>2</sub> scale for all six analyzed parsimonious reconstructions on the airport level in comparison to a BEAST reconstruction with fixed rates and a fixed tree topology. The rates were set to inverse effective distances while the tree topology was set to the tree inferred using Fasttree, which allowed for short MCMC runs with 1 million steps and therefore enabled a reconstruction on the airport level with a larger number of locations.
