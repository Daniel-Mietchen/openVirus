  <title>Fréchet tree distances for four additional GLEAMviz simulations.</title>
  <p>Fréchet tree distances shown on a log
   <sub>2</sub> scale for all six analyzed parsimonious reconstructions using four additional simulations (shown in panels A-D) of geographical spread using GLEAMviz. For each simulation of spread, the sampling, the tree and the sequences were simulated 50 times. Reconstructions were performed both on the airport (on the left) and the country level (on the right).
