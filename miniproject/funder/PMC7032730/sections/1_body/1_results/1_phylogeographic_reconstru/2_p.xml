<p>For each simulated dataset, we used the tree inferred on the simulated sequences as well as their sampling locations for a phylogeographic reconstruction with the Sankoff algorithm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007101.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We tested both geographic, effective and equal distances. Using equal distances corresponds to a reconstruction with the Fitch algorithm, minimizing the number of changes along the tree, and might be used when no other distance information is available. Further, the phylogeographic reconstruction was done using the simulated tree topology to assess the level of variation introduced by the tree inference and the robustness of our method in case of inaccurate topologies.
