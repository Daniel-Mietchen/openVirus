<p>To explore the reconstructed spread in more detail, we counted the number of transitions to a new location for each observed location. 46 of the 68 locations only occured at terminal branches without seeding infections to new locations. Instead, there was a small number of airports mainly involved in the spread. The airports with the highest numbers of links to new locations were New York (31), Phoenix (24), Los Angeles (21), Houston (13), Mexico City (11) and Philadelphia (11). As expected with effective distances, the method infers large airports, but not only the largest airports of the region (as measured by the number of passengers) or the airports with the highest numbers of sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007101.s005">S1 Table</xref>). For example, Phoenix is the 10th largest airport in North America with 7 sampled sequences, Houston the 11th largest with 1 sequence, and Philadelphia the 20th largest with 4 sequences. This indicates that the main airports are not only determined by the numbers of passengers or the number of samples, but are dependent on the specific outbreak and its origin.
