<p>If sequence data together with sampling locations are available, the origin and spread of viruses can be reconstructed using phylogeography. Given a phylogeny as well as locations for the leaf nodes of the tree, phylogeography infers locations for internal nodes of the tree. This approach reconstructs the source of the outbreak as well as spread routes. Current state-of-the-art methods for phylogeography are based on Bayesian inference. Discrete Bayesian phylogeography [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] followed efforts to use parsimonious methods for the reconstruction by minimizing the number of changes between states [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Bayesian methods improved this approach by incorporating uncertainty and branch lengths, giving posterior probabilities to evaluate the quality of the reconstruction and allowing the extension to a generalized linear model (GLM) to test potential predictors of viral spread [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, Bayesian phylogeography is now commonly used to study viral pathogens like influenza [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], HIV [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Ebola [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, these methods have several drawbacks that have not yet been addressed. First, due to the large number of parameters that are estimated in Bayesian phylogeographic studies, the analysis is slow for larger datasets and the number of distinct states is limited. Instead, locations are often aggregated into larger regions such as continents [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], although more fine-grained locations such as countries, states or sometimes even cities are available for a lot of sequences. Second, since discrete Bayesian methods generally estimate rates of movements from the data, these methods will only infer locations which are observed, excluding possible intermediate states which have not been sampled [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Continuous phylogeography, based on inferring geographic coordinates using Brownian diffusion models, are an alternative which allow to infer intermediate locations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While this is a good model for local diffusion of rapidly evolving viruses, it is less applicable for viruses that travel both locally and over large distances in a very short time, e.g. by air travel in the case of influenza A viruses.
