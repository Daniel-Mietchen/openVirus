<p>We used the latter as a list of transmissions to simulate the isolate sampling, the tree and the sequences. For these steps, the simulation software FAVITES was used [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To simulate the beginning of the pandemic, only the first 200 transition events were included, corresponding to day 85 in the simulation. We chose the number of samples per location via a Poisson distribution with 
 <italic>Î»</italic> = 0.5, therefore simulating an incomplete sampling of locations. The sampling times were chosen from an uniform distribution. Each sample represented one viral sequence in the subsequent analysis. Based on the sampling events, a tree was simulated using a coalescent model with exponential growth. Branch lengths on this tree corresponded to time as measured in days. We scaled these branch lengths with a rate of 0.000014, therefore assuming a rate of evolution of 0.00511 mutations per site per year, which is close to estimates reported for pH1N1 [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Given the tree with scaled branch lengths, nucleotide sequences of length 1700 were simulated under a GTR model using seq-gen [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This resulted in a set of sequences for each tip in the tree. These sequences along with their sampling locations were then used for phylogeographic inference, while the simulated tree (including the locations for the internal nodes as given by the transition events) was used as a reference dataset.
