<p>While the result of the parsimonious reconstruction was comparable to the GLM extension of the classical Bayesian methods, our approach allowed to study viral spread in more detail. Instead of summarizing locations into large geographic areas like continents, the phylogeographic reconstruction was possible on fine-grained locations to the resolution of single cities. Both the simulated and real data proved that the analysis was feasible with a large set of total locations (3865 airports in the air transportation network) as well as observed locations; 76 locations on average—including 23 countries—in the simulated data and 67 in the real data. The reconstruction could be done within minutes, while the Bayesian reconstruction was time-consuming and ran for several days to reach a sufficient number of steps in the MCMC, even when using countries instead of airports. In theory, Bayesian reconstructions could be sped up by fixing some parameters instead of estimating them; e.g. by fixing the tree and by fixing the rates between locations to inverse distances. However, this is not commonly done in practice and further did not perform well when we tested this approach to infer airports instead of countries (
