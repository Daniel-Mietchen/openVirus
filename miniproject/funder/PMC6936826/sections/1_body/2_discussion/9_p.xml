<p>While we can incorporate a broad variety of network structures our PWID network structure is of clustered small-world type with varying sizes of the local “buddy” neighborhood and probabilities of small-world linkages. Zhong et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] suggested that the distribution of the links is likely to be exponentially distributed. This could be a good approximation when the links are considered to be of the same strength and are not dynamically changing. Because links can have different weights depending on the strength of relationships (e.g. buddy or stranger), accounting for that strength changes the nature of the networks and the dynamics of HIV spread. Dynamic partnership changes can shift the infection dynamics towards higher homogeneity i.e. over time a person will have higher number of encounters with the others than when inferred from a network snapshot. Our network structure somewhat compensates for these factors by considering clustered small-world structure with links of different strength. For example, individuals who belong to large high-risk buddy clusters share syringes with many strangers (i.e. random individuals from the rest of the network) and thus can become super-spreaders. Although these individuals might have a relatively small number of buddies (compared to the total network size) they are connected to a large number of buddy networks can facilitate HIV outbreaks. We thus keep the networks complex enough to capture the major clustered buddy-stranger structure, but simple enough not to get tangled in overly extensive parameterization.
