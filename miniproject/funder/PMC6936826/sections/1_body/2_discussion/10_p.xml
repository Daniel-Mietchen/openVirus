<p>In our model, we were specifically focused on a question that relates BTH and PH availability and the role the related injecting practices can have in HIV transmission when keeping all other factors the same. From this perspective, modeling studies allow an unparalleled opportunity to explore “what if” scenarios that are not possible in the real world. Although simulation results do not necessarily reproduce real-life processes, they do provide insight into the variability of HIV prevalence as a function of several additional risk factors, such as frequency of syringe sharing, mixing patterns, and specific use practices. Another factor that justifies such simplification is the lack of reliable data about these practices. Ethnographic research provides in-depth insights into specific behavior, but it is very localized, while epidemiological studies are broad but lack depth. Some measurements are just not ethical and not feasible to obtain. For example, ethical concerns prohibit using controlled human experiments to estimate the dependence of HIV transmission on viral load.</p>
