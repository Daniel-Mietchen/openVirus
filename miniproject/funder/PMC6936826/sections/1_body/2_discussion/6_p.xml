 <underline>Limitations and data considerations</underline>. As with most simulation studies, ours has a number of common limitations. The utility of a simplified simulation modeling is limited because the results are dependent on a number of simplifying assumptions. Some assumptions are technical (e.g., the structure of the injecting networks, homogeneous mixing within networks). Others are critical to the description and understanding of the underlying process. For example, as is mentioned in Tempalski et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] there are many explanations for why HIV prevalence and incidence among PWID is so different between U.S. regions. They mention “program efforts to increase users’ access to clean syringes both through syringe exchange programs and pharmacies; efforts to promote safer injection practices; effects of antiretroviral therapies on infectivity of PWID, deaths from HIV not being matched by new infections; and possible changes in risk networks and other social mixing patterns which vary from place to place. Differences in HIV prevalence rates may also reflect differences in availability, accessibility and effectiveness of HIV prevention and treatment programs across metropolitan areas.” More explanations can be found in Ciccarone and Bourgois [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These are all important factors and could be further considered in the models. For our simple exercise we rolled up many effects into a few proxy factors. For example, access to clean syringes and effectiveness of prevention practices are rolled into mechanistic risky behavior factors related to HIV transmission (i.e., how often PWID share syringes with “buddies” and “strangers”). Access to HIV treatment programs could be also represented by the level of risky behavior and the level of HIV viral load, which could then be translated into the probability of transmission.
