<p>Sexual pathway is an important factor in HIV transmission but perhaps not as much among persons who inject heroin. It is possible that there are certain individuals with high rate of sexual contacts and risky injection which puts them at the elevated risk to receive and spread HIV. Adding variability in sexual behaviors, will add variability to the background HIV prevalence. We assumed that sexual behaviors are not directly related to the type of heroin used, and although increased HIV prevalence could slightly amplify the incidence in BTH group, the effect will not alter our conclusions.</p>
