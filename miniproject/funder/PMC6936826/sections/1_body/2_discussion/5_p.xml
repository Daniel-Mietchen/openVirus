 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215042.g005">Fig 5</xref> illustrates the variability of the trajectories for a single scenario where for presentation purposes we focused on the uncertainty associated with internal stochasticity. Additional variability of network structures, between-person variability in viral load, uncertainty in parameter estimates, and structural uncertainty (i.e., different modelers would model and program the same process differently) will increase the spread of possible outcomes. Adding these levels of uncertainty results in coverage of the entire range of possibilities (i.e., in some simulations some runs will produce prevalence of 1). Although such outcomes are very unlikely, for small communities such as Scott County, IN, high-risk behavior could lead to very high incidence and then prevalence.
