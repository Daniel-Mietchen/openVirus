 <underline>Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty assessment</underline>. The simulation model shows that the results are naturally sensitive to the rates of sharing, initial prevalence, and risky behavior factors. The effects of these factors are more strongly pronounced in communities with no or little of BTH. For example, to detangle a potential role of initial prevalence from the effects of BTH we compared simulation results when both eastern and western models stared with the same HIV prevalence. We considered 2 levels of HIV prevalence: 0.03 and 0.06. When simulating western US (BTH presence 95%), HIV prevalence gain was about 0.01 for both 0.03 and 0.06 starting prevalences. In simulated eastern US (BTH presence 5%) prevalence rose by 0.09 and 0.13 respectively. In general, initial prevalence plays a stronger role in communities with higher transmission potential (higher risk, use of BTH, use of HDS syringes). In communities with low risk of HIV transmission the prevalence can decline due to the elevated mortality among HIV positive individuals and low incidence. Similarly, the higher is the risk or prevalence, the higher is the effect of BTH. This leads to an important observation regarding public health interventions. The effect of BTH is strong in high-risk networks (i.e., networks where agents share often within their network and with agents from the other networks [strangers]). For low-risk networks the protective effect of BTH is negligible as seen in

These results offer a simple explanation that when a network is of low risk (an extreme situation is when no sharing of any equipment occurs) then HIV is not spreading through injecting contacts regardless of whether the network is using PH or BTH. When the level of sharing is high and is more aggravated by unsafe sharing practices the protective role of BTH becomes more evident.
