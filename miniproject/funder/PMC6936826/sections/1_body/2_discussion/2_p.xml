<p>New populations of PWID who are joining high-risk networks might not be exposed to harm reduction norms and will thus suffer. Because syringe exchange programs have been shown to substantially reduce syringe sharing in injecting networks [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] our simulations implicitly suggest that new pockets of HIV could emerge in areas where needle and syringe programs are lacking and PWID routinely share their equipment. According to the Foundation for AIDS Research [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] currently needle and syringe exchange programs remain illegal in 15 states (Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida in the South and Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Wyoming, and Idaho in the West). Even in states where needle and syringe programs are legal, rural areas often lack access to them, and 93% of counties that are under high risk of HIV/HCV outbreak do not have these programs [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The opioid crisis has brought some persons who use pills to injection practices, whether by transitioning to injecting heroin [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] or through injecting opioid pills, opening a specific opportunity for HIV outbreaks. In Scott County, Indiana, between 2014 and 2015, 181 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in a county that had seen only 5 diagnoses from 2004 to 2013. Eighty-eight of those diagnosed reported injection use of extended-release oxymorphone which may be crushed, dissolved, and cooked [
