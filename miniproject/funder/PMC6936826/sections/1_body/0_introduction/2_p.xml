<p>Heroin varies in physical and chemical characteristics by production source [

To the west of the Mississippi River heroin is mostly available as a solid form (i.e., Mexican-sourced “black tar” [BTH]. “Powder heroin” (PH) is predominant east of the Mississippi River and although the source is changing from Colombian to Mexican, heroin
