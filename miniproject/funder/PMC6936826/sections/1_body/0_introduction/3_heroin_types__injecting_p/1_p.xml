<p>HIV transmission can occur when a small amount of infected blood from a previous HIV-positive PWID remains in the syringe and enters the bloodstream of the next PWID. The striking difference in virus survivability when different source-types of heroin (BTH vs. PH) are used could substantially influence the probability of HIV transmission associated with heroin type [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that injection preparation practices associated with these heroin types explain the higher prevalence of HIV among PWID in cities with more prevalent PH versus more prevalent BTH. Despite some biological evidence that the virus does not survive well in high temperatures, actual survival and consequent HIV transmission are not well quantified for each individual injecting practice. In this study we attempted to identify and quantify behavioral and mechanistic factors affecting HIV transmission, and to translate them into HIV incidence and prevalence. Several mechanistic factors affect virus survivability [
