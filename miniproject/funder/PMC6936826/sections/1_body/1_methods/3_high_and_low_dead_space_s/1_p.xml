 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have shown that different syringe designs retain different amount of blood that can be transferred to the next person who injects during sharing. The syringes were classified as HDS or low dead space (LDS). Although the percentage of HDS syringes currently used by PWID in the United States is small (around 5%), in the late 1980s the percentage was higher and was critical to supporting HIV transmission, especially in high-risk populations that share syringes more than 10 times a year [
