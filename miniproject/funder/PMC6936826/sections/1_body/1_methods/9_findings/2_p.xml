 <underline>The role of PH from the perspective of dominance in the illicit drug market (Scenario B)</underline>. Simulation results show a significant increase in the incidence and prevalence of HIV if PH replaces BTH in a community. When simulating what could happen in the western United States if PH became dominant there, we started with an average HIV prevalence of 5% and 20% of high-risk networks. In 10 years, the HIV prevalence increased to 8%, but the variability of outcomes was high ranging from 4% to 17%. For high proportion (0.8) of high-risk networks the mean prevalence became 13% but the variability of the outcomes was even higher ranging from 4% to 30% as illustrated in
