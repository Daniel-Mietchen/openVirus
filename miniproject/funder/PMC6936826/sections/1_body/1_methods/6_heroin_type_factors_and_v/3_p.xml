 <underline>Acidity</underline>. In vitro experiments show that HIV-contaminated syringes are significantly less likely to yield recoverable HIV when rinsed with citric acid solutions of pH at or less than 2.3 [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], data on the acidity of BTH solutions is poorly known. Because BTH is produced with acetic acid rather than acetic anhydride used in PH and because of other ethnographic observations BTH is suspected to be acidic [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We thus do not use any specific HIV survival factor associated with acidity but note that our estimates are conservative (i.e., the effect of BTH on killing the virus is likely stronger because of the additional effect of acidity).
