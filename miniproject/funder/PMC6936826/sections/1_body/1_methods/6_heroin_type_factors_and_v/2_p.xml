 <underline>Rinsing syringes</underline>. Most PWID rinse their syringes at least once if they expect to use them in the future to prevent blood from clotting and clogging the needles. However, ethnographic observations show that among BTH PWID an extra syringe rinse became the norm to additionally ensure that tar residuals do not clog future injections. Following [

 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] we assume that 0.084ml of liquid is left in an HDS syringe and that a 1ml syringe is rinsed with 0.5 ml of water. Such a rinse reduces the amount of blood (and thus a number of virions) by a factor of 0.084/0.5 = 0.17. For LDS the reduction is much stronger and is around 0.002/0.5 = 0.004.
