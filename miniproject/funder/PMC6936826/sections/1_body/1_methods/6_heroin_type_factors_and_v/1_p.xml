 <underline>Heating the solution</underline>. Following Clatts et al.’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0215042.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] observations of cooking times and temperatures achieved in cookers and syringes in New York and Denver we considered that the solutions on average reach a temperature of 65ºC (range 10–100) and it took about 6 seconds (range 3–10) to reach the mean temperature. In that study, when heated to 66ºC in one sample the virus was not recoverable after 10 seconds and in another sample, HIV was not recoverable after 7 seconds when heated to 64ºC. Heating for less than 5 seconds had some effect but not as strong as for heating over 5 seconds. It is notable, however, that extensive heating capable of eliminating the virus does not happen all the time. In Denver where BTH is predominantly used, about 20% of the time it was heated for less than 10 seconds and 40% of the time it did not reach 66ºC. Thus, although protective, heating practices of BTH leave a window of opportunity for HIV transmission. We consider that when solutions of BTH are heated up to 66ºC for over 10 seconds all viruses in the cooking equipment are inactivated. When heated liquid is drawn into syringes the temperature drops by about 2ºC and the virus remaining in the syringe might still survive. We assume that in those 40% of heating events when the temperature does not reach 66ºC, virus survival is about 70%. PH is either mixed cold or heated for up to 15 seconds, reaching 66ºC for over 5 seconds only 10% of the time. Thus, on average, when heating the BTH solution, the survival rate of HIV virus in a syringe is around 10% (1–0.6*100%-0.4*70%), compared to 90% (1–10%) when using PH solution heated to lower temperature.
