 <underline>Agent rules in the model.</underline> Agents in the model behave according to the following rules. At each time step (corresponding to one day) agents in the network can probabilistically share syringes. If sharing a syringe, the agent can choose to share with some “buddies” from the network, and/or with a stranger. Recall that probability of sharing is compounded probability corresponding to the probability of injecting, and the probability of sharing given injection. The probabilities are guided by the network type. If syringe is used after an HIV positive individual it can transmit the virus to an HIV negative person who injects next. At each time step an agent has a very small chance to contract HIV. This is a proxy for sexual transmission.
