<p>We computed incidence and prevalence trajectories for the simulated PWID population and for high- and low-risk individuals under different combinations of parameter values. We repeated simulations 1,000 times to obtain stable and smooth estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence and uncertainty bounds. At each simulation we considered uncertainty in parameter values (by drawing a value from a distribution), structural uncertainty (the number of networks and their structure), and internal stochasticity (randomness in behavior and disease transmission).</p>
