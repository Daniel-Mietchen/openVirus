<p> According to RECON website: package incidence corresponds to “Computation, handling, visualisation and simple modelling of incidence”. It is honourable that the name of a package “incidence” is the choice of the creators of course. It is true that incident cases are all individuals who change to non-disease status from disease, so in this way “incidence” could refer to the occurrence of new cases. In recent modelling papers, the term incidence has been associated to count time series under the same approach, so-called “incidence time series”
