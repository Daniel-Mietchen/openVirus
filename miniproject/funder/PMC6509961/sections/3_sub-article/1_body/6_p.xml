<p> With regards to the structure of the article, it would be easier to start with an example based on simple line listing (see comment on figure 1) with simple epicurve without stratification (with different timing hour, day. week), then move to more complex representation (stratification with various colour in the legend; +/- facetting), and then an example of tailor-made polished figure (see code below). In doing so the figure 1 which would start for a line-list format would be easier to understand.</p>
