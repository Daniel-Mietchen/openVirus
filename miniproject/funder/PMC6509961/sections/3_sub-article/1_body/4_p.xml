<p> Nevertheless, the current name can be misleading for a certain number of epidemiologists. The reason is that in epidemiology the term incidence is traditionally associated to a measure of morbidity, so-called 'Incidence proportion' (or attack rate or risk; for more information see: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section2.html" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section2.html</ext-link>). The latter comprised the numerator (= count of case used for a raw epi-curve) but as well a denominator representing the population at risk during the selected time interval. At the first glance, the target audience reading the package name might believe that the package is dedicated to incidence calculation rather than epidemiological curve graphic representation and some basic modelling utilities. Indeed, the package is presented as being able to compute, handle and visualize time-related count data through epi-curve and additional derived features which are not related to measure of incidence (proportion) strictly speaking.
