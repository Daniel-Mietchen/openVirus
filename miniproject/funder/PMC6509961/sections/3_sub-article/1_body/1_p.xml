<p> The proposed package is addressing some of the topmost descriptive elements of any epidemiological data set, namely a systematic time-place-person description. With regards to epidemiological curves, a limited number of dedicated packages addressing these aspects were available at the time of this package release (mainly: epitools,

The alternative was a tailor-made, and time consuming, customization based on existing dedicated packages (for instance using customized

While the data storage and representation is well addressed by the authors, the proposed package offers: i) some basic utilities for outbreak description across time, ii) basic tool for outbreak modelling and iii) a standard for data storage to enhance interoperability between released projects and packages from the

In the introduction a short overview of the alternative tools mentioned above should be provided to the reader, together with the new added-values of the current package. It would be an asset in order to ensure a benchmarking analysis with pre-existing resources.
