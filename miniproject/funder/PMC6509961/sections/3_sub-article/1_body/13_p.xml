   <p>“Two worked examples are used to demonstrate the functionality and flexibility of the 
    <italic>incidence </italic>package. The first example illustrates how to compute and manipulate stratified weekly incidence directly from a line-list”. - Consider “The first example illustrates how to create directly from a line-list incidence object in order draw an epicurve of the weekly number of cases with or without stratification on patient characteristics”.

   <p>“while the second example shows how to import pre-computed daily incidence and fit a log-linear model to estimate growth rate ( 
    <italic>r</italic>) and doubling time for the growing phase.” - Footnote to be included in the section about the function for more clarity.
