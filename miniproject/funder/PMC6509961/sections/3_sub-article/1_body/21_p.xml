<p> Please consider comments made above for the other figure on figure title and axis labels: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>“Epicurve of the daily number of Zika virus disease between Sep and Jan 2016”. Panel (A) stratified by location and (B) pooled across locations. “</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Y axis title: 'Number of cases'</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>X axis title: ' Week of onset of illness'</p>
  </list-item>
 </list> Some readers might wonder if the faceting capabilities of ggplot2 would be supported or not. An evident alternative is to prepare separated epicurve for the both locations and further combined them using specific package (ggarrange for instance). Would it be possible to add information on this point, and if supported, provide an alternative presentation of the both epicurves using two vertically aligned panels?
