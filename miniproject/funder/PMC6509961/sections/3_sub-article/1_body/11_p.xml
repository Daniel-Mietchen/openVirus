   <p>“[…] representing dates including Date and POSIXct objects”. - The EpiCurve package supports hourly data. This intends to cope with some peculiar situation in which an hourly epi-curve can be of interest (acute food intoxication or environmental source). Could give an example with hourly data (it should be fairly easy as POSIXct is date format in the ggplot2 framework). See an example here:

   <p>“The dates are aggre­gated into counts based on the user-defined interval representing the number of days for each bin.”- Consider 'user-defined time interval' instead of user-defined interval.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>“number of days for each bin” - “days” is too restrictive. It is just the chosen time interval, it can be the number of weeks, etc.</p>

   <p>“The function subset() can be used for isolating case data from a specific time window and/or groups, while the [ operator can be used for a finer control to subset dates and groups using integer, logical or character vectors.” - If several functions are to be presented, it is easier to use bullet points to structure the reading. </p>

   <p>“Figure 1. Generalized workflow from incidence object construction to modeling and visualization.” - The first example in the paper is using a line-list format as data inputs but showed a stratified graphic. To be consistent and easier to follow for the reader, this figure illustrates the flow of such of data type, knowing that line-list is the primary source of epidemiological surveillance. A solution present in the figure is the two types of data inputs (non-aggregated/aggregated count). It would be easier, from a reader point of view, to capture the data flow from the line-lit to the final products proposed by this package.</p>

   <p>[…]: an option for a ‘long’ format which is readily compatible with

This might good to elaborate a bit more about date and user's customization with ggplot2. This can be addressed later in the manuscript (see proposal for a theme).
