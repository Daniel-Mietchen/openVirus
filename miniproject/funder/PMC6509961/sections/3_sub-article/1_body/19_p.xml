   <p> - Add an intermediate line to illustrate that in this period selection (e.g. print i.7), cases are coming from four hospitals, to hosp_colors would a four colours vector. Keep the legend out of the main graphic frame (top or bottom).</p>

   <p>“Here, because of the few numbers of cases in the first few weeks, we have also highlighted each case using show_ cases = TRUE (Figure 3)”. - The figure is displaying the individual case which is the standard representation of an epicurve according to number of training programs (US CDC, EPIET …). This is of primary importance in outbreak investigation to able to delineate case number in an easy-to-read visual and often stratified representation by case characteristics (sex, exposure, location …).  This type of representation is adopted by default in package EpiCurve (see  
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiCurve/vignettes/EpiCurve.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiCurve/vignettes/EpiCurve.pdf</ext-link>) as well as US CDC training example of epicurve (

Representation of case as square can be achieved with the current package as illustrated in at the end of the package vignette (see: vignette ("customize_plot", package="incidence") in the section Applying the style of European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET). It’s understandable that square form can be changed in case of a large dataset making the size of the intervals for the x- and y- axes different.
   </p>
   <p> It would be an asset for the target audience and the current manuscript to contain a full example of an epicure with case made under square representation (somehow close to the example cited above in the vignette) combined with a full theme following simple and standard representation.</p>

   <p>Consider change in the layout of Figure 2: 'Number of EVD cases stratified by hospital ... between week XX and week YY'.</p>
   <p> Y axis title: 'Number of cases'</p>
   <p> X axis title: 'Week of onset of illness'</p>
   <p> X axis ticks should be made visible for all weeks even the label displayed for any other week.</p>

   <p>Would it be possible to give some more information to which ggplot2 geometry are used when show_ cases = TRUE is specified? This is of importance to provide the reader with a clue about how both borderline and colour content of each square can be further customized.</p>

   <p>As standard the label of the X axis time interval is displayed on the left side of the bin. Formally, the ideal position would be right below the bin (as illustrated in the CDC example above and numerous of published epicurve). In the EpiCurve package, the standard representation is not ideal as the X axis tick is right in the middle of the bin. The position of the label can be customized by the user, but would it be possible to look at the option to place the time label under each bin instead of to the left bin tick mark (see an example of ad hoc customization below). Of note, such label position should support figure export resizing.</p>
