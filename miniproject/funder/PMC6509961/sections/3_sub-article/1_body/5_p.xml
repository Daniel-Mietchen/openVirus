<p> You may wish to consider adding such features and include new capabilities to this package which can cover calculation/representation of incidence in epidemiology. For instance, adding a slot for population data to populate the denominator of an incidence proportion calculation. This can be completed by dedicated graphic outputs with points for each incidence values and line through all data points (geom line). Factor-specific incidence rate (and corresponding CI) can be considered as further extensions (factor: sex-, age-, or any other factor). The advantage is the possibility to overlay and compare several incidence line charts coming for different locations (e.g. attack rate for different health districts or for several population group). It is a suggestion and it is acceptable that the authors would keep the package focus on basic utilities and epicurve representation.</p>
