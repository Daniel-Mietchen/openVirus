   <p>“Without any knowledge on the splitting date, we can turn to the fit_optim_split() function to look for the optimal splitting date”. - Could you please reconsider the phrasing as “Without any knowledge on the splitting date” which seems not logical when looking retrospectively to an outbreak epicurve and visually identifying the peak of the epidemic wave.</p>

   <p>“The predictions and their 95% CIs from the two incidence_ft objects, ‘before’ and ‘after’, can be added to the existing incidence plot of i.pooled using the piping-friendly function add_incidence_fit().” - Provide more explanation on “the piping-friendly function” aspect. Provide an example of layout customization of the two log-linear regression models (linetype, colour, size).</p>

   <p>Please find below a proposal for an advanced and custom-made layout epicurve representation using the Zika dataset. In this example, some of the important layout feature of an epicurve are available: i) no space around the limits of both x and Y axes, ii) representation of each case with a square, iii) x label under each bin and make the graphic as light as possible based on Tufte’s advice (less grid as possible, visible labels …).</p>

   <p>In the graphic below, an incidence_fit object can be added for the pooled location with a specific customization to give a complete overview to the package capabilities.</p>
