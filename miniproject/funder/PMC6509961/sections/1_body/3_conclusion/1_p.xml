<p>This article has described the package 
 <italic>incidence</italic> and its featuresâ€”which include three lightweight data classes and utilities for data manipulation, plotting, and modeling. We have shown that an 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object can flexibly be defined at different datetime intervals with any number of stratifications and be subset by groups or dates. The most important aspects of this package are use-ability and interoperability. For both field epidemiologists and academic modellers, the data received are often in the form of line-lists where each row represents a single case. We have shown that these data can easily be converted to an 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object and then plotted with sensible defaults in two lines of code.
