<p>We have additionally shown that because the data are aggregated into a matrix of counts, it becomes simple to perform operations related to peak-finding, model-fitting, and exportation (e.g. using 
 <monospace>as.data.frame()</monospace>) into different formats. Thus, because it has built-in tools for aggregation, visualisation, and model fitting, the 
 <italic>incidence</italic> package is ideal for rapid generation of reports and estimates in outbreak response situations where time is a critical factor.
