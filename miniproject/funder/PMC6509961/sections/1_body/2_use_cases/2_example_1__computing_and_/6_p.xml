<p>The weekly incidence stratified by hospitals is computed by running the function 
 <monospace>incidence()</monospace> on the Date variable 
 <monospace>dat1$date_of_onset</monospace> with the arguments 
 <monospace>interval = 7</monospace> and 
 <monospace>groups = dat1$hospital</monospace>. The 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object 
 <monospace>i.7.group</monospace> is a list with class of 
 <bold>incidence</bold> for which several generic methods are implemented, including 
 <monospace>print.incidence()</monospace> and 
 <monospace>plot.incidence()</monospace>. Typing 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object 
 <monospace>i.7.group</monospace> implicitly calls the specific function 
 <monospace>print.incidence()</monospace> and prints out the summary of the data and its list components. The 5,829 cases (the total number of cases stored in the 
 <monospace>$n</monospace> component) with dates of symptom onset ranging from 2014-04-07 to 2015-04-27 (spanning from 2014-W15 to 2015-W18 in terms of the ISO 8601 standard for representing weeks) are used for building the 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object 
 <monospace>i.7.group</monospace>. The 
 <monospace>$counts</monospace> component contains the actual incidence for defined bins, which is a matrix with one column per group. Here 
 <monospace>$count</monospace> is a matrix with 56 rows and 6 columns as groups by hospital with 6 factor levels are specified. The bin size in number of days is stored in the 
 <monospace>$interval</monospace> component. In this example, 7 days suggests that weekly incidence is computed, while by default, daily incidence is computed with the argument 
 <monospace>interval = 1</monospace>. The 
 <monospace>$dates</monospace> component contains all the dates marking the left side of the bins, in the format of the input data (e.g. Date, integer, etc.). The 
 <monospace>$timespan</monospace> component stores the length of time (in days) for which incidence is computed. The 
 <monospace>$cumulative</monospace> component is a logical indication whether incidence is cumulative or not.
