<p>Note that when weekly incidence is computed from dates, like in this example, the ISO 8601 standard weeks are used by default with the argument 
 <monospace>standard = TRUE</monospace> in the 
 <monospace>incidence()</monospace> function. Under this situation, an extra component of 
 <monospace>$isoweek</monospace> is added to the 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object 
 <monospace>i.7.group</monospace> to store those weeks in the ISO 8601 standard week format “yyyy-Www”, and the 
 <monospace>$dates</monospace> component stores the corresponding first days of those ISO weeks. Meanwhile the x-axis tick labels of the weekly 
 <italic>incidence</italic> plot are in the ISO week format “yyyy-Www” (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) rather than in the date format “yyyy-mm-dd” as the argument 
 <monospace>labels_iso_week</monospace> in the 
 <monospace>plot()</monospace> function is by default 
 <monospace>TRUE</monospace> when plotting the ISO week-based 
 <bold>incidence</bold> objects.
