<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>, the missing hospital name (NA) is treated as a separate group, resulting from the default of the argument 
 <monospace>na_as_group = TRUE</monospace> in the 
 <monospace>incidence()</monospace> function. This argument can be set to 
 <monospace>FALSE</monospace> to not include data with missing groups in the object.
