<p>The predictions and their 95% CIs from the two 
 <bold>incidence_fit</bold> objects, ‘before’ and ‘after’, can be added to the existing incidence plot of 
 <monospace>i.pooled</monospace> using the piping-friendly function 
 <monospace>add_incidence_fit()</monospace>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>, based on visual comparison of models and data, these two log-linear regression models provide a decent approximation for the actual dynamics of the epidemic (adjusted

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.83 and 0.77 for the increasing and decreasing phases, respectively).
