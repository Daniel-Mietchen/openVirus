<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>, the pooled daily incidence in Colombia shows approximately exponential phases before and after the epidemic peak. Therefore, we fit two log-linear regression models around the peak to characterize the epidemic dynamics of ZVD in Colombia. Such models can be separately fitted to the two phases of the epicurve of 
 <monospace>i.pooled</monospace> using the 
 <monospace>fit()</monospace> function, which, however, requires us to know what date should be used to split the epicurve in two phases (see the argument 
 <monospace>split</monospace> in the 
 <monospace>fit()</monospace> function). Without any knowledge on the splitting date, we can turn to the 
 <monospace>fit_optim_split()</monospace> function to look for the optimal splitting date (i.e. the one maximizing the average fit of both models) and then fit two log-linear regression models before and after the optimal splitting date.
