 <monospace>zika_girardot_2015</monospace> and 
 <monospace>zika_sanandres_2015</monospace> are data frames with the same variables 
 <monospace>date</monospace> and 
 <monospace>cases</monospace>. In order to obtain a more complete picture of the epidemic dynamics of ZVD in Colombia, we merge these two data.frames into a single one, 
 <monospace>dat2</monospace>, by variable 
 <monospace>date</monospace>. 
 <monospace>As dat2</monospace> is already pre-computed daily incidence rather than a vector of dates such as those in example 1, we can directly convert it into an 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object grouped by geographical locations, 
 <monospace>i.group</monospace>, by using the 
 <monospace>as.incidence()</monospace> function. This shows the flexibility of the 
 <italic>incidence</italic> package in making 
 <bold>incidence</bold> objects. Using the 
 <monospace>pool()</monospace> function, the daily incidence stratified by locations, 
 <monospace>i.group</monospace>, can be collapsed into an incidence object without groups, 
 <monospace>i.pooled</monospace>. The stratified and pooled daily incidence plots of ZVD in Colombia are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, from which we can see that the epidemic of ZVD occurred earlier in San Andres Island than in Girardot.
