<p>The returned object 
 <monospace>fos</monospace> is a list with 4 components. The 
 <monospace>$split</monospace> component suggests that the optimal splitting date is 2015-11-15. The 
 <monospace>$fit</monospace> component is an 
 <bold>incidence_fit_list</bold> containing two 
 <bold>incidence_fit</bold> objects named ‘before’ and ‘after’. These each contain the information extracted from the fitted log-linear regression models. Printing the 
 <monospace>$fit</monospace> component shows a daily growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic> of 0.067 and its 95% confidence interval (CI) ([0.059, 0.074]), and a doubling time of 10.4 days (95% CI, [9.31, 11.8]) during the first phase, and a daily decreasing rate 
 <italic>r</italic> of -0.048 (95% CI, [-0.054, -0.042]), and a halving time of 14.4 days (95% CI, [12.7, 16.6]) during the second.
