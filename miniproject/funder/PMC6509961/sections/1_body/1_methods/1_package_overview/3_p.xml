<p>This package facilitates the manipulation of 
 <bold>incidence</bold> objects by providing a set of handler functions for the most common tasks. The function 
 <monospace>subset()</monospace> can be used for isolating case data from a specific time window and/or groups, while the [ operator can be used for a finer control to subset dates and groups using integer, logical or character vectors. This is accomplished by using the same syntax as for matrix and data.frame objects, i.e. 
 <monospace>x[i, j]</monospace> where 
 <monospace>x</monospace> is the 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object, and 
 <monospace>i</monospace> and 
 <monospace>j</monospace> are subsets of dates and groups, respectively.
