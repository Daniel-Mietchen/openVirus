<p>In line with RECONâ€™s development guidelines, the 
 <italic>incidence</italic> package is thoroughly tested via automatic tests implemented using 
 <italic>testthat</italic> ( 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Wickham, 2011</xref>), with an overall coverage nearing 100% at all times. We use the continuous integration services 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://travis-ci.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">travis.ci</ext-link> and 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ci.appveyor.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">appveyor</ext-link> to ensure that new versions of the code maintain all existing functionalities and give expected results on known datasets, including matching reference graphics tested using the visual regression testing implemented in 
 <italic>vdiffr</italic> ( 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Henry 
  <italic>et al</italic>., 2018
 </xref>). Overall, these practices aim to maximise the reliability of the package, and its sustainable development and maintenance over time.
