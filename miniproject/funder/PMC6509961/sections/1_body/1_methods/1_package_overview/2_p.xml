<p>The general workflow ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) revolves around a single type of object, formalised as the S3 class 
 <bold>incidence</bold>. 
 <bold>incidence</bold> objects are lists storing separately a matrix of case counts (with dates in rows and groups in columns), dates used as breaks, the time interval used, and an indication of whether incidence is cumulative or not ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object is obtained by running the function 
 <monospace>incidence()</monospace> specifying two inputs: a vector of dates (representing onset of individual cases) and an interval specification. The dates can be any type of input representing dates including 
 <bold>Date</bold> and 
 <bold>POSIXct</bold> objects, as well as numeric and integer values. The dates are aggregated into counts based on the user-defined interval representing the number of days for each bin. The interval can also be defined as a text string of either "week", "month", "quarter", or "year" to represent intervals that can not be defined by a fixed number of days. For these higher-level intervals, an extra parameter— 
 <monospace>standard</monospace>—is available to specify if the interval should start at the standard beginning of the interval (e.g. weeks start on Monday and months start at the first of the month). 
 <monospace>incidence()</monospace> also accepts a 
 <monospace>groups</monospace> argument which can be used to obtain stratified incidence. The basic elements of the 
 <bold>incidence</bold> object can be obtained by the accessors 
 <monospace>get_counts()</monospace>, 
 <monospace>get_dates()</monospace>, and 
 <monospace>get_interval()</monospace>.
