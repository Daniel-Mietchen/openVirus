<p>As a basic model, we implement the simple log-linear regression approach in the function 
 <monospace>fit()</monospace>, which can be used to fit exponential increase or decrease of incidence over time by log-transforming case counts and applying a linear regression on these transformed data. The log-linear regression model is of the form 
 <italic>log</italic>( 
 <italic>y</italic>) = 
 <italic>r Ã— t</italic> + 
 <italic>b</italic> where 
 <italic>y</italic> is the incidence, 
 <italic>r</italic> is the growth rate, 
 <italic>t</italic> is the number of days since the start of the outbreak, and 
 <italic>b</italic> is the intercept. This approach estimates a growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic> (the slope of the regression), which can in turn be used for estimating the doubling or halving time of the epidemic, and with some knowledge of the serial interval, for approximating the reproduction number,
