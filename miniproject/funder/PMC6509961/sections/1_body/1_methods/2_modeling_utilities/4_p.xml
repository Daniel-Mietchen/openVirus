<p>The 
 <monospace>fit()</monospace> function returns an 
 <bold>incidence_fit</bold> object and the 
 <monospace>fit_optim_split()</monospace> function returns an 
 <bold>incidence_fit_list</bold> object, which is a specialized object designed to contain an unlimited number of (potentially nested) 
 <bold>incidence_fit</bold> objects. While the 
 <italic>incidence</italic> package returns 
 <bold>incidence_fit</bold> objects containing log-linear models by default, they can be constructed from any model from which itâ€™s possible to extract the growth rate ( 
 <italic>r</italic>) and predict incidence along the model. Both object classes can be plotted separately or added to an existing epicurve using the function 
 <monospace>add_incidence_fit()</monospace> ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>).
