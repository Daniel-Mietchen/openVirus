<p>In the presence of both growing and decreasing phases of an epidemic, the date representing the peak of the epidemic can be estimated. In 
 <italic>incidence</italic>, this can be done in two ways. The function 
 <monospace>estimate_peak()</monospace> uses multinomial bootstrapping to estimate the peak, assuming that a) reporting is constant over time, b) the total number of cases is known, and c) the bootstrap never samples zero-incidence days. This function returns the estimated peak with a confidence interval along with the boostrap estimates. Alternatively, the function 
 <monospace>fit_optim_split()</monospace> can be used to detect the optimal turning point of the epidemic and fit two separate models on either side of the peak. This is done by maximizing the combined mean adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> value from the two models (
