<p> I had trouble fitting epidemic curves to data sets that only included incidence up to the peak or shortly beyond (it seems that the model was automatically trying to estimate a decline rate as well as an increase rate). This seems like an odd choice for a tool that people may be using to work with data from emerging epidemics that have not yet peaked.</p>
