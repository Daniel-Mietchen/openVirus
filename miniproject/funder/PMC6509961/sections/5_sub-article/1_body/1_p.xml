<p> Overall I think this package is sensible and well-designed.Â My only major concern is with the log-linear fitting procedures; on the one hand, the authors say clearly that there are many fitting procedures which cannot (and should not) all be squeezed into this package, and I suspect that they don't intend these fits to be taken as very precise measures of the growth rate. On the other hand, I'm quite concerned by the possibility that users will take growth rates and confidence intervals estimated by these simplistic fits too seriously. There are a number of delicate issues around the estimation of epidemic growth rates: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Assume log-Normal incidence (as done by a log-linear fit), or make other distributional assumptions (e.g. Poisson or negative binomial)?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>If using exponential or log-linear fits, what time window should one use to capture enough of the beginning of the epidemic but not bias the growth rate downward by capturing the saturation phase of the epidemic (Ma 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014 
    <sup>
     <xref rid="rep-ref-45526-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
    </sup>)?
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Should one allow for the influence of both process and measurement error (King 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015 
    <sup>
     <xref rid="rep-ref-45526-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
    </sup>)?
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Is growth exponential or sub-exponential (Viboud 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016 
    <sup>
     <xref rid="rep-ref-45526-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
    </sup>)?
   </p>
  </list-item>
 </list> I think I would have preferred that, if they were not going to go deeply into this area, that the authors instead provide some sort of non-parametric smooth fit (perhaps constraining the changes to be monotonically increasing before the peak and decreasing after the peak) rather than oversimplifying in this way.
