<p> The package suggests that the fit() function is extendable to allow other fitting methods ("While the incidence package returns incidence_fit objects containing log-linear models by default, they can be constructed from any model from which itâ€™s possible to extract the growth rate (r) and predict incidence along the model"); I wasn't able to figure out how to achieve that goal.</p>
