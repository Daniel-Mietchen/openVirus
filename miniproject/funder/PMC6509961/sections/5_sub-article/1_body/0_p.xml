<p>The authors have written an R package that does some useful tasks in aggregating and manipulating incidences and plotting them. For the most part the paper is clearly written and technically correct, and the package seems well-constructed.Â The abstract says that the package is "solely dedicated to building, handling and plotting epidemic curves", although it also fits simple epidemic models to incidence data.</p>
