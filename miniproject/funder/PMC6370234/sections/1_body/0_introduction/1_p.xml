<p>Zika virus is a flavivirus primarily transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitos and is the causative agent of a recent global outbreak of exanthematous febrile illness complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), microcephaly and other birth defects [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007060.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ZIKV was first discovered in Uganda in 1947 and was subsequently noted to cause sporadic human infections throughout sub-Saharan Africa and in parts of Asia [
