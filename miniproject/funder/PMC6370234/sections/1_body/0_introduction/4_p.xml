<p>Early in the ZIKV Americas epidemic, several 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and murine studies suggested that prior DENV infection may not only fail to cross-neutralize ZIKV but also may lead to ZIKV ADE, greater ZIKV viremia and, therefore, perhaps increased clinical morbidity upon subsequent ZIKV exposure. Priyamvada et al showed that both DENV-exposed sera and derived plasmablast monoclonal antibodies from DENV-infected individuals in Thailand enhanced 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ZIKV infection in the U937 cell lines [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007060.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Castanha et al found that sera from DENV-3 exposed humans led to the enhanced replication of ZIKV PE/243 in FcγRII-expressing K562 cell lines [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> data with an immunodeficient (Stat2−/−) mouse model and showed that plasma from DENV-experienced human hosts led to increased morbidity and paralysis in PRVABC59 ZIKV infections compared to those that received control plasma. These findings were in contrast to earlier 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data which indicated that cross-reactive DENV antibodies from human natural infections actually neutralized a range of ZIKV strains [
