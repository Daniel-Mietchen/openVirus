<p> An issue that would make the article difficult to read is the use of very long sentences. In some instances, a single sentence constitutes a complete paragraph (para 2 in the background section). This is seen mainly in the background section and in case study 1. The sentences are much shorter in case study 2, but here too there are instances where long sentences have been used.</p>
