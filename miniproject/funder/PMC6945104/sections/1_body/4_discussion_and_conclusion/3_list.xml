   <underline>Collaboration</underline>: The model should recognise that collaboration among all researchers is essential for ethical, fair and sustainable data and sample sharing. Leaving aside ‘parachute research’, which is now increasingly condemned, even beneficence as an underlying consideration, though it has positive connotations, fails to recognise the contributions from the intended beneficiary, preventing true partnership among international colleagues. The H3 Africa initiative, for example, recognised this factor when it termed that the capacity building work done was ‘in return’ for providing access to African data for secondary analysis, rather than as a beneficent measure (

  <p>In the same vein, research participants in LMICs should also be considered collaborative partners in the research process, as they bear the most significant risks, for example, by placing at risk their privacy and right to confidentiality when providing data and samples. Respect for participants and their communities needs to be displayed through implementing consent measures and adequate protections, and greater efforts need to be taken to propagate patient and public involvement and engagement measures in LMICs, similar to what is being done in the global north.</p>

  <p>Funding agencies such as the Wellcome Trust and the MRC, UK, have taken great steps forward in promoting a collaborative approach; they now require collaborations with research institutions in the country where the research is carried out as a pre-condition of funding global health research. This collaborative approach is, however, taking time to dwindle down to other HIC research institutions, which, in some cases claim all rights to intellectual property created through the research collaboration, contrary to the word and intent of the terms and conditions imposed by the funding agency, which specify that ownership of intellectual property lies with the institution generating it.</p>

   <underline>Fairness</underline>: Fairness towards all participants is essential for long-term collaborations. A governance framework should ensure fair sharing of benefits with data and sample providers, ensure fairness towards the primary data/sample collecting researchers by recognising their contributions and equally balance the interests of science and the funders of data by ensuring that maximum benefit is derived from the data collected. Simple measures such as a requirement of at least one author from the country where the data is collected, and a ‘taxonomy of contributor-ship’ indicating the roles of authors could help promote fairness (

   <underline>Work towards a level playing field</underline>: Neither fairness nor collaboration can be effectively achieved with the significant power differential that exists between institutions of the global north and the global south. Many guidelines for good practice in collaborations exist; however, inequity persists. The degree of the inequity depends on the ‘experience and empowerment of the LMIC researchers, research infrastructure… and the amount of funding available’ ( 
   <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Hedt-Gauthier 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
   </xref>). For over thirty years (if not more), concerned individuals and institutions from both sides of the divide have been discussing the need for collaboration and capacity building to bridge this gap and over the past few years, signs of progress are visible. Funding agencies such as the Wellcome Trust and the MRC, UK, consider collaborations and capacity building as a factor when evaluating a research funding application, compelling researchers to engage in such efforts.

  <p>Human capacity building in LMICs is possibly the most important step to be taken to reach a more level playing field. Lack of technical and research expertise in LMIC research institutions is often cited as the reason for the need for analysis to be carried out in an HIC during an international collaboration. It is time to lay this poor excuse to rest, particularly in data analysis. The world’s most advanced industries using state-of-the-art, high-end technology carry out data analysis functions in LMICs: Google, for example, has nine offices in the South East Asia region, with over 2,000 data scientists / analysts working in India alone. Other ‘big data’ companies – Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle – all run offices in LMICs, having successfully harnessed the human capacity in LMICs. The capacity for data analysis already exists in LMICs, it merely needs to be fine-tuned for health research.</p>
