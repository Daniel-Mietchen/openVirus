<p>International data sharing is garnering greater attention as it is now well-established that obstructing the free flow of data is an important factor that can threaten global health and global security, in addition to impeding the obvious benefits of data sharing in healthcare research. The importance of data sharing, the ethical imperative to share data and the criteria required for such data sharing to be ethical have been frequently discussed and well-established (
