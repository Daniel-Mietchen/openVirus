Two solutions have been proposed to deal with this issue of lack of infrastructure, technology, expertise and funding for data storage and analysis in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings: a commercialization model where samples and data are monetized, and secondly, to transfer samples and data to HICs where the capacity and infrastructure to store and analyse already exists, whilst ensuring access and benefit to the data/sample providers from LMIC (
