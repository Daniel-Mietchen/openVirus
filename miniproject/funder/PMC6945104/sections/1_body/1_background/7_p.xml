<p>A second aspect of these concerns regarding exploitation is that researchers and research institutions from LMICs do not receive the benefits from their initial work in the form of their ability to continue the research, attributions and publications (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>). Due to insufficient research infrastructure (technological and human) in LMICs, institutions and researchers in well-resourced countries can analyse and publish data much faster, resulting in lack of reward (in the form of recognition of their efforts and lack of publications, extending to lack of career progression) for LMIC scientists who bear the initial risk and burden of collecting data/samples. For example, in the H5N1 case, other countries published and presented data analyses of Indonesian virus samples without reasonable notification, permission, opportunities for collaboration on further research or attribution to the scientists generating and sharing the data/samples (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). Furthermore, there is a risk of misinterpretation and misuse of data when researchers without any connections to or understanding of the data-supplying communities engage in data analysis. There is also the concern of potential violations of privacy and patient re-identification, especially in cases where patientsâ€™ personal data remain linked to the samples/data (
