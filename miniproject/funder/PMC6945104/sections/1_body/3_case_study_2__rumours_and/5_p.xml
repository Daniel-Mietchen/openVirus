 <underline>Lack of accountability and good governance</underline>: Communities are aware that during the Ebola epidemics, there were various initiatives to collect samples that were subsequently shipped abroad for research or public health purposes (i.e. Ebola vaccine trials, Ebola Treatment Centers, Plasmapheresis Unit). Communities invited to assent to biobanking in Liberia may perceive that the destination and usage of exported samples cannot be controlled by local research staff and, hence, that fair conditions for de-identification and re-identification, usage, protection of personal data, storage, retrieval, tracking and disposal of samples cannot be guaranteed to the study participants.
