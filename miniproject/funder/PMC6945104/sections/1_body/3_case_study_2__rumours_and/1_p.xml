<p>During the Ebola outbreak, many Liberian patients with infectious diseases other than Ebola saw their healthcare needs neglected. Malaria became one such rather neglected disease and the Saint Joseph’s Catholic Hospital (SJCH) undertook a number of measures to support the development of new diagnostic, preventive and elimination tools for malaria, as well as to enhance local capacity building in malaria research in Liberia. In this context, a study was carried out to investigate the feasibility of establishing a SJCH-hosted biorepository of blood samples obtained from malaria-exposed individuals attending the hospital that aimed: i) to support the development of improved cost-efficacious high-sensitive malaria diagnostic tools; ii) to support quality assessment of presumably substandard and unregistered rapid diagnostic tests that are known to be easily available over-the-counter in Liberia, and iii) to provide information on the burden of malaria and antimalarial resistance to guide public health interventions. This study was nested within a mixed-methods study that aimed to assess the burden of malaria among pregnant women attending antenatal care at the SJCH (
