<p>Sustainability of a biobank in Liberia could largely depend on cost recovery of its running costs. Study participantsâ€™ narratives indicate that community members may not oppose the commercialization of their samples provided a benefit sharing plan engaging participants and their communities is implemented. However, the feasibility of a pay-per-service system should be evaluated considering the adverse impact it may have on the perception of trustworthiness. To improve trustworthiness, a clear structure for accountability and a benefit sharing plan needs to be agreed upon by research, regulatory, hospital staff and the affected communities at the initiation of a project. In addition to improving communication on research plans and proposed activities, all stakeholders need to receive accurate information on accountability, human resources, financial and sustainability issues. A transparent attitude and willingness to negotiate benefit sharing may help communities trust in biobanking research in Liberia.</p>
