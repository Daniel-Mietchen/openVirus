<p>Innovative approaches to improve trust, targeted at both individuals and communities, need to be designed and implemented ahead of the creation of biobanks. Clear information on risks, benefits and compensation, as well as reassurance that there will be no negative implications if consent is withheld, should be provided during the consent process to all approached individuals to avoid undue inducement to participate. Broad consent may be inappropriate in these cases as people may want to know the exact intended use of their samples and may want reassurance that there will be no negative consequences from participation. During this study, it was suggested that implementing a stepped wedge consent system could be used so that participants can decide exactly what clinical, public health and research use of their data and samples they authorize, as well as to what type of communication from the biobank regarding the use, export, retrieval and disposal of their samples they expect to receive. Given the cost and the administrative difficulties, it is not feasible to use a stepped wedge consent system in a large research population; therefore, a generalised approach to sample and data usage could potentially be based on peopleâ€™s preferences derived from this project. </p>
