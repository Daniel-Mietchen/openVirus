 <underline>Fear of discrimination and restricted access to healthcare</underline>: A key factor that can impede consent for biobanking is the widespread fear that samples collected in clinical and research settings may be used to test for stigmatizing diseases such as HIV without seeking permission from the sample donor. On the other hand, given the difficulties of accessing free-of-charge healthcare services, fear that refusal to provide samples could restrict their access to healthcare, as well as therapeutic misconception, can motivate people to consent to participation in biobanking.
