 <underline>Cultural issues related to lack of trust and fear of exploitation</underline>: Any activity involving blood is considered to be of a sensitive nature in the Liberian culture. Blood sample extraction in a clinical setting is acceptable to most, whereas the same activity in a non-clinical setting would be viewed with suspicion. This was exacerbated in some cases by exposure to Ebola vaccine trials in Monrovia, leading to the belief that samples are collected from trial subjects for illicit purposes. The generalised lack of trust in the healthcare and research establishment impedes voluntary participation in biobanking activities. Closely related to the issue of lack of trust in healthcare service providers and researchers, there are widespread concerns that researchers would export the samples collected for financial benefit without sharing such benefits with the researched communities.
