The response from the IRD was to engage in extensive awareness-raising and community engagement activities using multiple routes, ranging from regular newspaper advertisements, feature articles, radio talks, exhibitions, leisure activities and television programmes to the usual small group discussions and focus groups, as well as sensitising other professional and academic groups. The tri-lingual magazine of the IRD, ‘Gaveshana’ (Explorations), mainly aimed at school children and undergraduates as well as the wider general public, published thematic issues on twin research, ethics and governance. Cultural activities engaging twins, publication of a newsletter in the local languages called ‘Twin News’, regularly updated and distributed among the members of the twin registry, formed part of the community engagement activities.
