<p>The Sri Lanka Twin Registry was set up in 1997 as the first twin register in South Asia, by the Institute for Research and Development (IRD), Sri Lanka, with funding from the Wellcome Trust. It is still one of the very few large-scale, functional, population-based twin registries in a LMIC with 9,570 twin pairs and 46 triplets from the Colombo district of Sri Lanka, and a separate island-wide volunteer register comprising 7,000 twin pairs and 86 triplets. The first wave of research using the register was the Colombo Twin and Singleton Study (COTASS) in 2005, conducted to estimate prevalence, heritability and gene-environmental interplay of a range of psychiatric disorders (depression, somatisation, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse), resulting in 18 publications and another eight papers from the twin research consortium, the CODATwins Project, which pooled data from 67 worldwide twin projects. A follow-up study of the same cohort was completed in 2016, examining the prevalence and inter-relationship of key cardiovascular/metabolic risk markers and diabetes with depression and anxiety. The Sri Lankan Twin Registry Biobank was established in 2012 as a major component of the second wave data collection of COTASS. The biobank consists of 3,483 serum and 3,360 DNA samples of twins and singletons and is the first twin bio-specimen biobank in South Asia. Two papers have been published using the follow-up data and two papers submitted, while more are planned. In 2018, the Medical Research Council (MRC), UK, awarded a pump-priming grant to set up an infant, child and adolescent twin registry for mental health research. Ethical sensitivities are similar in all projects, arising from the research focus including a vulnerable group (minors, some having mental illness), involving proxy consent, potential for complex genetic and omics research, sensitive personal data and most of all, the complications related to international collaborations.</p>
