<p>The IRD considers that its international research collaborators for the twin registry and biobank-related projects exemplified what research collaborations between the global north and south should aim for: being generous in sharing expertise, carrying out extensive capacity building efforts, supporting Sri Lankan researchers by enabling first authorship of publications and, most of all, being respectful of cultural sensitivities. Their support enabled research capacity building not only at the IRD but in the wider Sri Lankan research community through numerous training programs. Within this context, the IRD had to seriously consider the request to transfer biological samples to the UK for analysis based on the premise that it would take time to develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise in Sri Lanka. It was necessary to weigh the benefits of faster research output by transferring samples abroad against the detrimental impact of Sri Lankan researchers being relegated to mere sample gatherers and losing the long-term benefits of developing capacity in Sri Lanka.</p>
