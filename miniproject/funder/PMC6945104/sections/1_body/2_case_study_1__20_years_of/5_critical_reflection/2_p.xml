<p>The negative media campaign that was framed as a warning from medical experts sensationalized cultural sensitivities and concerns founded on past misdemeanours by other researchers and historical injustices. The IRD recognised that the concerns, though unfounded in this situation, were valid expressions of the mistrust the community had towards unethical researchers and therefore aimed to achieve true community engagement through developing mutual respect and trust to combat misinformation. The activities carried out helped build understanding and awareness about the research and helped the twins and wider society to understand that the research team viewed them as participants with an important role to play in an activity that would benefit humankind. This feeling of mutual respect and camaraderie between the research team and the participants was the key factor that helped the IRD team overcome negative publicity and carry out two waves of research among these twins since 1997. </p>
