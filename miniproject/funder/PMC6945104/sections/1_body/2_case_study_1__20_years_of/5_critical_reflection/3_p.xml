<p>Existing ethical guidelines and frameworks were reflected on and found to address issues that dominate ethics in a Western context and rarely address real life issues faced by LMIC researchers. For example, the case studies usually provided are rarely applicable in the developing world context, and the mechanisms suggested to address ethical issues are not feasible in the extremely resource-constrained situations faced in LMICs. It is therefore necessary to initiate home-grown mechanisms to deal with these constraints and develop ethical guidelines and governance frameworks to support LMIC researchers. </p>
