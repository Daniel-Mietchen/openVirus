<p>As the twin registry was set up at a time when research ethics was at a nascent stage of being codified in Sri Lanka, the IRD team faced multiple challenges in ensuring that the ethical concerns specific to building a database in an LMIC were addressed. As the project progressed, the twin database expanded into a biobank, bringing about further challenges related to the collection, storage, use and protection of samples. The lack of consensus on a broad ethical framework and overarching ethical guidance was also a key issue at the time. This was complicated by the lack of effective guidance on managing relationships with influential international research collaborations, in a manner that was respectful of cultural sensitivities of the research participants/communities, ensured research benefits were shared equitably and at the same time ensured the generation of maximum utility from the research funds.</p>
