<p>Due to the lack of infrastructure and technical expertise in Sri Lanka, it was suggested that the biological samples from the twin biobank should be sent abroad for genetic analysis. The IRD team chose to delay the genetic analysis and, although it took five years, necessary infrastructure including a genetic laboratory as well as research expertise were developed at the IRD with extensive support from the Wellcome Trust and international collaborators. The decision to delay the genetic work until the infrastructure and expertise were developed and the IRD was confident of its ability to effectively manage the multiple ethical and technical challenges raised by this work has, in retrospect, showed itself to be the correct one, since the IRD genetic laboratory is now carrying out extensive work in genetic analysis. Even more importantly, the capacity building programs carried out by the IRD in this sphere help build expertise, not only in Sri Lanka, but the entire South Asian region.</p>
