<p> Two issues missing from the analysis include:

   <p>The fact that research is driven by market forces and not by academic pursuit. This necessitates looking at data as an equivalent of bitcoin, since the bottom line for all market-oriented companies is profit. How this influences the way data from LMICs is used by HICs needs to be addressed.</p>

   <p>Besides the power inequities mentioned by the authors as a reason for unfairness in data-sharing, another angle that needs consideration is the notion of widespread corruption in LMICs. If data is a commodity to be bought and sold then it is tempting to consider that "poor" nations might "sell" the data of their citizens to the "rich" corporate bodies that are believed to be controlling or directing the course of research, for personal or organizational gains. How much of an impact does societal corruption have to play in the issue of data-sharing and how it can be prevented from influencing how data-sharing is done could be factored into the framework suggested. If not the framework, in the introduction or the issues at hand it could deserve a mention. </p>
