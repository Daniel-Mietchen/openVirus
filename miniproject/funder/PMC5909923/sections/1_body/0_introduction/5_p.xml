<p>During initial epidemics in the US, crows were considered to play an important role as virus amplifiers. It has been proposed that corvids, including magpie, are also involved in a WNV endemic cycle in human habitats in Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Viral RNA has been detected in 5 to 9% of the tested population [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, in order to consider the magpie as an infectious source of WNV transmission, it should develop a competent viremia and/or shed virus, aspects that have never been explored before. Therefore, herein we described the first experimental infection of magpie, one of the most abundant corvid species in Europe, in order to examine the pathogenesis of WNV infection in this host and elucidate the possible role of these birds in WNV ecology.
