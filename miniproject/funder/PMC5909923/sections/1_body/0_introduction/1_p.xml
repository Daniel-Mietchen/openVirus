<p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) belonging to the family Flaviviridae, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, which is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving several species of birds and mosquitoes appertaining mainly to the 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> complex [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Occasionally, it can infect humans and horses, which are considered dead end hosts due to the low viremic titers that they develop, which are insufficient to infect mosquitoes and maintain the transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While the majority of human WNV infections are sub-clinical, approximately 20% of patients suffer West Nile fever with flu-like symptoms and 1% develop a severe neuro-invasive potentially fatal disease [
