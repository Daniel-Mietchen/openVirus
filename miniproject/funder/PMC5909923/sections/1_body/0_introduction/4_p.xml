<p>Pathogen transmission dynamics are related to host-feeding patterns of mosquitoes, resident or migratory bird behavior, and host susceptibility to the virus. For instance, the high mortality rates observed in WNV lineage 1 infected birds in Israel and North America, particularly among corvids [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, WNV has been isolated from dead birds in Europe, including Passeriformes like magpie (
