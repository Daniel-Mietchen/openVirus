<p>At 3, 7, 10 and 17 d.p.i., all surviving animals were weighed and sampled (blood, feathers, and oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs). Blood samples (0.5 ml per bird) were collected via the jugular vein and allowed to coagulate at 4°C overnight prior to centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Pulps of growing feathers and swabs were placed into 0.5 and 1 ml of EMEM medium, respectively. Any dead or euthanized magpie was subjected to full detailed necropsy and tissues were collected, splitted, and stored in PBS at -80°C and in 10% buffered neutral formalin for further virological and histopathological analyses, respectively. Additionally, swabs and feather pulps were also collected from dead and euthanized birds.</p>
