<p>WNV-specific neutralizing antibodies to both viral lineages (1 and 2) were detected in serum samples by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) on Vero cells using twofold serial serum dilutions, as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution, diluted at least 1:20, which reduced plaque formation â‰¥ 90% (PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>) relative to samples incubated with negative control pooled sera.
