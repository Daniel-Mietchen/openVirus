<p>Lineage 1 viral RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] using a High Scriptools-Quantimix Easy Probes kit (Biotools). For lineage 2 WNV-RNA quantification primers used were forward, 5’-CAGACCACACTCTAGTG-3’, and reverse, 5’-CCCACGCGGCCATAA-3’; enclosing nucleotides 10691 to 10793 of the WNV, SRB-Novi Sad/12 strain [GenBank accession no. KC407673; [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]]. Viral RNA was quantified as genomic equivalents (GE) to p.f.u. by comparison with RNA extracted from previously titrated samples [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
