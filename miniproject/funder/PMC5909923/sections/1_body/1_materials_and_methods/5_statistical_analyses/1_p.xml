<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism for Windows, version 6 (Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, 2005). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed by a log-rank test. Mean survival time (MST) was calculated for every group of inoculated magpies. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroniâ€™s correction for multiple comparisons was used to evaluate the weight differences of the animals along the experiment. Unpaired t-test was used to compare viremia between the groups infected with the two lineages used. Statistically significant differences are indicated by asterisks * (p&lt;0.05), ** (p&lt;0.01), *** (p&lt;0.001).</p>
