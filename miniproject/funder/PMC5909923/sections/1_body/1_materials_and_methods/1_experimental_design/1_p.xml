<p>Magpies were captured under permit 346760 of the regional government of the autonomic Community of Castilla-La Mancha using walk-in cage traps in several hunting locations in South-Central Spain. Traps were checked daily and, upon capture, birds were aged based on plumage and molt patterns, sampled, and tested for the presence of WNV-RNA by consensus flavivirus real time RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the presence of flavivirus antibodies by a commercial blocking ELISA (Ingenzim West Nile Virus, Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain), respectively. Birds that tested negative were transferred to mosquito-net covered flight cages at the experimental farm of the IREC (Instituto de Investigación en Recursos Cinegéticos, Ciudad Real, Spain). Captures took place between April and June 2017 and only individuals younger than a year old were selected. Magpies were maintained for a maximum of two months in groups of ten in mosquito-proof flight cages with 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> food and water supply, and were weighed and re-tested on a monthly basis to confirm well-being and lack of exposure to Flaviviruses. A final group of 34 magpies was transported to the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities at INIA (Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria, Madrid, Spain), where they were housed in 3 separate cages (11–12 birds/cage). Each cage was equipped with a net-covered flight cage with several fixed and one free-swinging perch with artificial grass cover, rough cardboard lining on the ground, and enough space for free flight. After one week of adaptation, animals were weighed and blood was collected via the jugular vein for preinoculation serology (0 days post-inoculation, d.p.i.). Then, they were subcutaneously inoculated in the neck with 5x10
 <sup>3</sup> plaque forming units (p.f.u.)/bird of WNV diluted in 100 μl of Eagle Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, BioWhittaker, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium). One group of magpies (n = 12) was infected with NY-99 WNV lineage 1 strain (GenBank accession no. KC407666), another group (n = 11) with SRB Novi-Sad/12 WNV lineage 2 strain (GenBank accession no. KC407673), and the third negative control group (n = 11) was similarly sham-inoculated with medium. Two magpies per group were euthanized at 3 d.p.i. by intravenous injection of a sodium pentobarbital overdose.
