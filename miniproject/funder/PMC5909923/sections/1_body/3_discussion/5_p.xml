<p>We have performed the first experimental infection of magpies with 2 lineages of WNV isolates currently circulating in Europe. Birds were infected with the viral lineage 1 prototype NY-99, known to be highly pathogenic for the American magpie [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and the SRB Novi-Sad/12 lineage 2 strain isolated from a dead Northern goshawk (
 <italic>Accipeter gentilis</italic>) during recent outbreaks in eastern Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A high susceptibility to WNV infection was observed in magpies infected with both viral strains with survival rates of 30% and 42.8% for lineage 1 and 2, respectively. All infected magpies lost weight and elicited high neutralizing antibodies titers. In addition, all of them had high virus titers 3 d.p.i. (5x10
 <sup>3</sup>-8x10
 <sup>8</sup> p.f.u/ml), demonstrating magpies can be a likely source of vector feeding transmission. In fact, host competence for WNV has been experimentally established based on viremia levels that range above 10
 <sup>4</sup> to 10
 <sup>5</sup> p.f.u/ml [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and it should also be noted that the reduced mobility observed in viremic birds might increase exposure to host seeking mosquitos.
