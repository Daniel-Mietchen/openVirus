<p>WNV is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle between its natural hosts -birds- and mosquitoes. In countries with continental climate, the enzootic cycle is apparently disrupted during the winter season, as vectors die or enter in diapause. Nevertheless, WNV vertical transmission in vectors has been described, indicating that the virus can overwinter in vertically infected mosquitoes [
