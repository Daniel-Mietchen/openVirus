<p>The high mortality rate recorded here is in line with previous data obtained from experimentally infected North American black-billed magpie (
 <italic>Pica hudsonia</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our experimental infection, the viral dose administered (5x10
 <sup>3</sup> p.f.u/magpie) was in the range of the amounts inoculated by feeding mosquito [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although lower pathogenicity with lower mortality from WNV in the European avian community has been proposed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], our data suggest that the susceptibility of the European magpie to WNV could be underestimated. In fact, under the experimental conditions here reported, the development of signs prior to death took less than 24â€“48 hours.
