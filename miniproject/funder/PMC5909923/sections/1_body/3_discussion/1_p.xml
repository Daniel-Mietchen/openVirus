<p>Magpie is one of the most abundant corvids in Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and it is suspected to be a source of WNV transmission. Using experimental infections, we showed that magpies are highly susceptible to fatal and nonfatal infections with WNV, elicit neutralizing antibodies, and develop viremic titers higher than those necessary for the successful transmission of WNV to mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additional demonstration of infectious virus and viral genome in swabs and feather pulps, point to this species as a likely source of viral transmission.
