<p>Magpie is widely distributed in Europe, representing the most abundant resident corvid, which is highly adapted to human environments. Additionally, magpie is one of the feeding preferences of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, a bridge WNV vector to humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, only three isolations of WNV from magpies have been reported in Europe. In 2004, a WNV lineage 1 was isolated from a magpie in the Camargue, France [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and in 2008 the virus was isolated from three magpies in Italy [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Lineage 2 strain was detected in Greece in a hunter-harvested magpie in an area where human cases had occurred [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Despite briefing of hunters for recognition of encephalitis or collection of dead birds, no sick or dead magpies were recovered in the outbreak area. In contrast, WNV epidemics in America were associated with high bird mortality [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], leading to considerable declines in populations of related North American magpie species [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A similar picture has been observed for American crows (
 <italic>Corvus brachyrhynchos</italic>) suffering substantial die-offs from WNV while no reports of mortality exist for the European carrion crows (
 <italic>Corvus corone</italic>), even though recent experiments have shown that both species are highly susceptible to WNV [
