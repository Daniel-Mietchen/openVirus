<p>Two lineage 2 infected magpies died 12 and 13 d.p.i. (5 and 6 days later than any of the other infected animals). They succumbed presumably to aspergillosis, although WNV was also present in their brains, hearts and feathers. 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, the primary cause of avian aspergillosis is an ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen and the combination of high concentrations of spores in the environment and impaired immunity of the bird are considered factors leading to the development of clinical disease [
