<p>A low survival rate was observed in magpies infected with WNV lineage 1 (30%) and 2 (42.8%), with mean survival times of 6.7 (range 6–8) and 6.5 (range 6–7) d.p.i., respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006394.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Clinical signs in magpies that died included lethargy, ataxia, inability to fly, and leg paralysis. Death typically occurred less than 10 hours after first showing clinical signs. Surviving, infected birds were lethargic 6–12 days post-infection. All infected magpies showed significant weight loss until they died. Surviving birds gained weight from 7 d.p.i. while control magpies did so throughout the course of the experiment (
