<p>Serum samples were tested for infective virus at different time points (3, 7, 10 and 17 d.p.i.) and positive samples were only detected at 3 d.p.i. in infected magpies, with high titers (range 5x10
 <sup>3</sup>-8x10
 <sup>8</sup> p.f.u/ml) in both viral lineages (

 <sub>90</sub> titers ranged from 1.6x10
 <sup>2</sup> to 1.35x10
 <sup>3</sup>, showing a discreet tendency to increase in surviving animals. All samples from sham-inoculated magpies resulted negative.
