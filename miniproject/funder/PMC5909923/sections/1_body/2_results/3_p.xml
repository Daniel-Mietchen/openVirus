<p>Two magpies per group were euthanized at 3 d.p.i. to analyze the presence of WNV-RNA in their hearts and brains. Viral genome was detected in all samples from infected magpies, except in the brain of one lineage 1 infected bird (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006394.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The initial organ sampling schedule was abrogated due to the high mortality observed, so only organs from animals that succumbed to the infection and from surviving birds at the end of the experiment were analyzed. All samples from dead birds were positive regardless of the infecting lineage. WNV-RNA was also detected in the brains from two surviving magpies, each one infected with a different lineage, as well as in the hearts of all surviving animals infected with lineage 1 virus, and in one of the three lineage 2 infected surviving birds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006394.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These results were confirmed by conventional RT-PCR and sequencing. WNV-RNA was also amplified from swabs (oral and cloacal) of infected birds from 3 to 7 d.p.i., peaking at 6 d.p.i. with no viral genomes detected in oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs after 7 days d.p.i (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006394.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, upper panels). Presence of infectious virus was also analyzed in some representative WNV-RNA positive samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006394.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, lower panels). On the other hand, almost all feather pulps from infected birds were WNV-RNA positive from 3 to 10 d.p.i., and in some of them virus could be also recovered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006394.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Notably, at 17 d.p.i., feather samples from one magpie of each group were also WNV-RNA positive, results that were confirmed after sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons. The two magpies that died at 12 and 13 d.p.i. had WNV-RNA in their brains, hearts, and feathers, but not in their swabs. Both individuals had a severe fungal pneumonia and airsacculitis, presumably caused by 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. that has to be considered the primary cause of death.
