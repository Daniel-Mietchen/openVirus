Resident birds play an important role in flavivirus epidemiology, since they can serve as reservoirs and facilitate overwintering of the virus. Herein, we report the first experimental infection of magpie (<italic>Pica pica</italic>) with two strains of West Nile virus, lineages 1 (NY-99) and 2 (SRB Novi-Sad/12), which are currently circulating in Europe. Magpies were highly susceptible to WNV infection, with similar low survival rates (30% and 42.8%) for both lineages. All infected magpies developed viremia detectable at 3 days post-infection with titers above those necessary for successful transmission of WNV to a mosquito. Neutralizing antibodies were detected at all time points analyzed (from 7 to 17 days post-infection). WNV genome was detected in the brains and hearts of all magpies that succumbed to the infection, and, in some of the surviving birds. WNV-RNA was amplified from swabs (oral and cloacal) at 3, 6 and 7 days post-infection and feather pulps, from 3 to 17 days post-infection, of infected animals. Even more, infectious virus was recovered from swabs up to 7 days post-infection and from feather pulps up to 10 days post infection. Sham-infected control animals were negative for viremia, viral RNA, and antibodies. These results suggest that the magpie, which is one of the most abundant corvid species in Europe, could represent a source of WNV transmission for birds and humans. Our observations shed light on the pathogenesis, transmission, and ecology of WNV and can benefit the implementation of surveillance and control programs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Birds play an important role in the epidemiology of flaviviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) since birds are natural hosts and facilitate hibernation of the virus in periods of absence of mosquitoes that transmit the virus. Since it has been proposed that magpies play an important role in an endemic WNV cycle in human habitats in Europe, we conducted the first experimental infection of magpie with the two WNV lineages currently circulating in Europe. We observed high susceptibility of magpie to WNV infection with virus titers higher than those necessary for the successful transmission of WNV to a mosquito and often resulting in death. Likewise, we detected elevated titers of neutralizing antibodies in all the samples tested as well as the viral genome in the organs, oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feather pulps of the infected animals. Our results suggest that the magpie, which is one of the most abundant corvid species in Europe, could be a source of WNV transmission to other birds and humans, which expands the knowledge about WNV pathogenesis, transmission and ecology, that benefits monitoring and control programs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>INIA</institution></funding-source><award-id>E-RTA2013-00013-C04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saiz</surname><given-names>Juan-Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>INIA</institution></funding-source><award-id>RTA2015-009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saiz</surname><given-names>Juan-Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>INIA</institution></funding-source><award-id>E-RTA2017-00003-C02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saiz</surname><given-names>Juan-Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Comunidad Aut&#x000f3;noma de Madrid</institution></funding-source><award-id>P2013/ABI-2906 (PLATESA)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saiz</surname><given-names>Juan-Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>INIA</institution></funding-source><award-id>E-RTA2013-00013-C04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>H&#x000f6;fle</surname><given-names>Ursula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by grants Recursos y Tecnolog&#x000ed;as Agrarias (E-RTA2013-00013-C04, RTA2015-009, and E-RTA2017-00003-C02) from Instituto Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA); and by grant P2013/ABI-2906 (PLATESA) from Comunidad Aut&#x000f3;noma de Madrid.

Occasionally, it can infect humans and horses, which are considered dead end hosts due to the low viremic titers that they develop, which are insufficient to infect mosquitoes and maintain the transmission cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While the majority of human WNV infections are sub-clinical, approximately 20% of patients suffer West Nile fever with flu-like symptoms and 1% develop a severe neuro-invasive potentially fatal disease [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>After reaching the American continent in 1999, WNV spread around the globe, and is now considered the most widespread arthropod-borne virus in the world, and the main causative agent of arboviral encephalitis in the U.S. [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Europe, only lineage 1 strains were circulating until isolation of a lineage 2 strain from a goshawk in Hungary in 2004 [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since then, lineage 2 strains have been responsible for high bird mortality and dozens of human deaths in several Southeast European countries [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The pivotal role of migratory birds in spreading WNV infection is well documented [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Resident birds are also considered important in maintaining WNV circulation in nature [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, WNV overwintering in Europe by local birds and mosquitoes has been suggested [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Pathogen transmission dynamics are related to host-feeding patterns of mosquitoes, resident or migratory bird behavior, and host susceptibility to the virus. For instance, the high mortality rates observed in WNV lineage 1 infected birds in Israel and North America, particularly among corvids [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], have not been observed in Europe, where lineage 1 viruses are circulating [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, WNV has been isolated from dead birds in Europe, including Passeriformes like magpie (<italic>Pica pica</italic>) [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>During initial epidemics in the US, crows were considered to play an important role as virus amplifiers. It has been proposed that corvids, including magpie, are also involved in a WNV endemic cycle in human habitats in Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Viral RNA has been detected in 5 to 9% of the tested population [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and neutralizing antibodies in 1.5 to 11% [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, in order to consider the magpie as an infectious source of WNV transmission, it should develop a competent viremia and/or shed virus, aspects that have never been explored before. Therefore, herein we described the first experimental infection of magpie, one of the most abundant corvid species in Europe, in order to examine the pathogenesis of WNV infection in this host and elucidate the possible role of these birds in WNV ecology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Magpies were captured under permit 346760 of the regional government of the autonomic Community of Castilla-La Mancha using walk-in cage traps in several hunting locations in South-Central Spain. Traps were checked daily and, upon capture, birds were aged based on plumage and molt patterns, sampled, and tested for the presence of WNV-RNA by consensus flavivirus real time RT-PCR [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the presence of flavivirus antibodies by a commercial blocking ELISA (Ingenzim West Nile Virus, Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain), respectively. Birds that tested negative were transferred to mosquito-net covered flight cages at the experimental farm of the IREC (Instituto de Investigaci&#x000f3;n en Recursos Cineg&#x000e9;ticos, Ciudad Real, Spain). Captures took place between April and June 2017 and only individuals younger than a year old were selected. Magpies were maintained for a maximum of two months in groups of ten in mosquito-proof flight cages with <italic>ad libitum</italic> food and water supply, and were weighed and re-tested on a monthly basis to confirm well-being and lack of exposure to Flaviviruses. A final group of 34 magpies was transported to the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities at INIA (Instituto Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n y Tecnolog&#x000ed;a Agraria y Alimentaria, Madrid, Spain), where they were housed in 3 separate cages (11&#x02013;12 birds/cage). Each cage was equipped with a net-covered flight cage with several fixed and one free-swinging perch with artificial grass cover, rough cardboard lining on the ground, and enough space for free flight. After one week of adaptation, animals were weighed and blood was collected via the jugular vein for preinoculation serology (0 days post-inoculation, d.p.i.). Then, they were subcutaneously inoculated in the neck with 5x10<sup>3</sup> plaque forming units (p.f.u.)/bird of WNV diluted in 100 &#x003bc;l of Eagle Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, BioWhittaker, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium).

Using experimental infections, we showed that magpies are highly susceptible to fatal and nonfatal infections with WNV, elicit neutralizing antibodies, and develop viremic titers higher than those necessary for the successful transmission of WNV to mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additional demonstration of infectious virus and viral genome in swabs and feather pulps, point to this species as a likely source of viral transmission.</p><p>WNV is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle between its natural hosts -birds- and mosquitoes. In countries with continental climate, the enzootic cycle is apparently disrupted during the winter season, as vectors die or enter in diapause. Nevertheless, WNV vertical transmission in vectors has been described, indicating that the virus can overwinter in vertically infected mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], as well as in those horizontally infected that survive the increasingly warm and short winters.</p><p>Besides overwintering in mosquitoes, WNV can also be re-introduced by migratory birds. Moreover, climate change alters the migratory behavior of some wild bird species, some of which have now become residents in Europe, or shortened their migratory routes by wintering in Southern Europe instead of migrating to the African continent. In this new scenario, the idea of local birds acting as competent reservoirs that amplify and/or maintain the virus during winter in Europe is gaining force [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Magpie is widely distributed in Europe, representing the most abundant resident corvid, which is highly adapted to human environments. Additionally, magpie is one of the feeding preferences of <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, a bridge WNV vector to humans [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, only three isolations of WNV from magpies have been reported in Europe. In 2004, a WNV lineage 1 was isolated from a magpie in the Camargue, France [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and in 2008 the virus was isolated from three magpies in Italy [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Lineage 2 strain was detected in Greece in a hunter-harvested magpie in an area where human cases had occurred [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Despite briefing of hunters for recognition of encephalitis or collection of dead birds, no sick or dead magpies were recovered in the outbreak area. In contrast, WNV epidemics in America were associated with high bird mortality [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], leading to considerable declines in populations of related North American magpie species [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A similar picture has been observed for American crows (<italic>Corvus brachyrhynchos</italic>) suffering substantial die-offs from WNV while no reports of mortality exist for the European carrion crows (<italic>Corvus corone</italic>), even though recent experiments have shown that both species are highly susceptible to WNV [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>We have performed the first experimental infection of magpies with 2 lineages of WNV isolates currently circulating in Europe. Birds were infected with the viral lineage 1 prototype NY-99, known to be highly pathogenic for the American magpie [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and the SRB Novi-Sad/12 lineage 2 strain isolated from a dead Northern goshawk (<italic>Accipeter gentilis</italic>) during recent outbreaks in eastern Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A high susceptibility to WNV infection was observed in magpies infected with both viral strains with survival rates of 30% and 42.8% for lineage 1 and 2, respectively. All infected magpies lost weight and elicited high neutralizing antibodies titers. In addition, all of them had high virus titers 3 d.p.i. (5x10<sup>3</sup>-8x10<sup>8</sup> p.f.u/ml), demonstrating magpies can be a likely source of vector feeding transmission. In fact, host competence for WNV has been experimentally established based on viremia levels that range above 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> p.f.u/ml [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and it should also be noted that the reduced mobility observed in viremic birds might increase exposure to host seeking mosquitos.</p><p>The high mortality rate recorded here is in line with previous data obtained from experimentally infected North American black-billed magpie (<italic>Pica hudsonia</italic>) [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our experimental infection, the viral dose administered (5x10<sup>3</sup> p.f.u/magpie) was in the range of the amounts inoculated by feeding mosquito [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although lower pathogenicity with lower mortality from WNV in the European avian community has been proposed [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], our data suggest that the susceptibility of the European magpie to WNV could be underestimated. In fact, under the experimental conditions here reported, the development of signs prior to death took less than 24&#x02013;48 hours.</p><p>The detection of infectious virus and viral RNA in feather pulps and cloacal and oral swabs suggests that magpie could also act as a source of horizontal transmission of WNV, not only within bird communities, but also to horses and humans, since they are highly adapted to human habitats and frequently forage on pastures. Even more, infections of birds after ingestion of infected animals has been described [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and, therefore, death magpies can also be a source of WNV transmission for scavenger birds.</p><p>Two lineage 2 infected magpies died 12 and 13 d.p.i. (5 and 6 days later than any of the other infected animals). They succumbed presumably to aspergillosis, although WNV was also present in their brains, hearts and feathers. <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, the primary cause of avian aspergillosis is an ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen and the combination of high concentrations of spores in the environment and impaired immunity of the bird are considered factors leading to the development of clinical disease [<xref rid="pntd.0006394.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Confinement, handling for sampling collection, and concomitant West Nile virus infection may more probably have contributed to development of the disease in these two individuals.</p><p>In summary, magpie is highly susceptible to West Nile virus infection; it amplifies the virus to sufficient levels to transmit it to other hosts and sheds it in considerable amounts, which probably contributes to maintain the viral life cycle. Since magpie lives close to human population, it should be a priority target in surveillance programs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank M.
