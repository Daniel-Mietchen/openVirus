<p>Quantifying the main factors driving pathogen emergence can be approached using mathematical models, but accounting for the diversity of the processes underlying emergence remains a challenge due to the lack of existing data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Because of its insular nature, its epidemiological connections to the African mainland and its 12-year (2004â€“2016) RVF serological dataset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Mayotte offers an ideal setting to attempt to disentangle the impact of environmental and anthropogenic factors driving RVF dynamics in the livestock population. Here, we developed the first mathematical model for RVF emergence that accounts for livestock susceptibility, climate factors, and the import of infectious animals, while fitting serological data in a Bayesian framework. It allowed an estimate of (
