 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005767.g004">Fig 4B</xref>. The incidence started to rise slightly in April-May 2007, that is before the import of infectious animals, and despite the imports starting in June 2007, the incidence remained stable and slightly decreased due to substantially below-average NDVI values. The highest incidence peak was reached the following year, in June 2008 (1558 cases, 95%CrI [707–2684]), and very likely resulted from the combination of infectious imports with above-average NDVI seasonal values; similarly to what is observed for the 2009 peak (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005767.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Following that import period in 2007–2009, the model predicted a very low probability of endemicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005767.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, Forecast 1), with 99.74% of the trajectories indicating extinction in 2016 in a closed ecosystem. As of October 2016, 97.9% (95%CrI [97.6–98.2]) of the Mayotte livestock is estimated to be susceptible to RVF, such that the import of 40 infectious animals at that date (low NDVI values, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005767.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, Forecast 6) or in April 2017 (high NDVI values, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005767.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, Forecast 11) would result in an incidence peak similar to 2008 (Forecast 6: Jul 2017: 1063 cases 95%CrI [242–2385]; Forecast 11: Jul 2018: 936 cases 95%CrI [297–1696]). However, if the number of infectious animals introduced into Mayotte is less than 40, then the incidence peak remains substantially higher if importations take place in April, compared to importations taking place in October (April: Forecasts 2–5 in
