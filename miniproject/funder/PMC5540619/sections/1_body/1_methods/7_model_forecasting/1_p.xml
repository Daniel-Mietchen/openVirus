<p>To estimate the probability of re-emergence, we simulated 5000 stochastic trajectories of the exponential model, sampling randomly from the posterior distribution. The simulations were done for Oct 2004-Jun 2020, adding 48 months (Jul 2016-Jun 2020) to the original model, additional time for which the long-term NDVI monthly average values were used (however keeping a seasonal pattern). In “Forecast 1” infectious animals were only imported in 2007–09. To estimate the impact of future infectious imports and their seasonal timing on RVF re-emergence, we simulated the import of 1, 10, 20, 30 and 40 infectious animals in October 2016 (low NDVI values, Forecasts 2–6), and in April 2017 (high NDVI values, Forecasts 7–11).</p>
