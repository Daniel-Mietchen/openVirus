<p>The parameters of the model were related to the natural history of disease and demographics, the climate-dependent transmission scenarios, or the viral introduction through animal import (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005767.t001">Table 1</xref>). However, whilst some parameters were fixed input values, others were estimated by fitting the model predictions to the serological IgG prevalence data. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005767.t001">Table 1</xref> presents which parameters were fixed input values and which were estimated by fitting the model. Specifically, the fixed input parameters were the demographics parameters
