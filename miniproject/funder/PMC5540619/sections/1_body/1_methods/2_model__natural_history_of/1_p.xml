<p>The livestock population (cattle, sheep and goats) was modelled with an animal as a unit but without differentiating animals according to their species (one livestock population considered), or their spatial location. Animals could pass through four successive and mutually-exclusive infection states of RVF infection: Susceptible (S), Latent (E), Infectious (I) and Immune (R). Once infected, we assumed that animals remained in the (R) compartment, as natural infection is assumed to provide life-long immunity [

The model was deterministic and discrete-time (weekly time step). While we assumed homogeneous mixing, the livestock population was purposively stratified in 10 yearly age groups
