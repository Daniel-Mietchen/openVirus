<p>Mayotte is a small island (374 km
 <sup>2</sup>), with an estimated livestock population size of about 30,000 heads [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (17,000 cattle, 12,000 goats and 1,000 sheep). The production system is agro-pastoral; animals are raised for family consumption or ceremonies. No official export or import of animals exists. The movements of people on small boats (named "kwassa-kwassa") between Mayotte (French overseas 
 <italic>d√©partement</italic>) and the nearest island of Anjouan (Union of Comoros), 70 km apart, became illegal since the installation of French visa requirements to enter Mayotte in 1995. Nevertheless, people attempt the journey with livestock on board [
