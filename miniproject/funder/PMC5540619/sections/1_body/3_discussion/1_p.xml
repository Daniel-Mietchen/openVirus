<p>Our work is the first dynamic mathematical model on RVF that accounts for climate and animal imports, and which is fitted to long-term epidemiological data [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our model narrowed the virus entry window in Mayotte to May-July 2007, which represents a plausible 6 to 4-months delay following the first RVF report in Kenya and Tanzania (Dec 2006 and Feb 2007) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also estimated the import of about 40 infectious animals per month over 23 months, which is possible back in 2007â€“10. In the absence of animal movement data and epidemic curve in neighbouring territories, we assumed constant entrant flows of animals. While the actual entrant flows may have varied with time, due to climatic or anthropogenic factors (such as political or economic factors), the proportion of boats seized may have also varied for the same reasons. Therefore, choosing a constant import flow was the least biased and most parsimonious option, that could be improved should better data be available.
