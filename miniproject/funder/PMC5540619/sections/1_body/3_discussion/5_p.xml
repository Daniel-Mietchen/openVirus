<p>Model forecasts indicated a very low probability of RVF virus endemicity and therefore of re-emergence in a closed system. With a very high proportion of naive animals as reached in 2016, the livestock population remains vulnerable to the introduction of infectious animals. Since 2011, few RVF infections in Mayotte have been reported (few young RVF IgG positive animals, or IgM positive animals in 2013–15 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and no IgM positive in 2016), whilst the surveillance system has been strengthened over years, giving weight to our model results. Ongoing surveillance including both active (annual serological surveys), passive surveillance activities (reports of animal mortality and abortions by farmers), but also the strict control measures for illegally introduced animals (immediate euthanasia) are still currently in place in Mayotte. Given that the animal population is naïve, our results suggest that such surveillance must be maintained, and reinforced should RVF be reported in neighbouring territories. This includes raising farmers’ awareness to report mortality and abortion events, and mitigating the risk of human exposure through communication and preventive messages (best practices for abortion and raw meat handling, since most animals are still slaughtered at the farm with no individual protection equipment). Finally, assuming the availability of RVF, NDVI and animal movement data, our model framework could be adapted to other ecosystems to refine the ecosystem-specific relative role of livestock susceptibility, animal movements and NDVI-related transmissibility on RVF dynamics.
