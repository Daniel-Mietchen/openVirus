<p>The credibility intervals of the estimated parameters were relatively narrow, and impacted only on the variability of the trajectories observed in 2004–08, when monthly prevalence estimates were informed by a small number of sampled animals, generating large confidence intervals. Little information was available on how these samples were collected [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which could bias the model results. However, these samples retrospectively analyzed were randomly selected from a bank of sera collected under the annual veterinary services prophylaxis campaign, which attempted to be representative of the livestock population. Both models did not reach the peak prevalences in 2008–09, and since these points corresponded indeed to recent infections (IgM positive animals) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005767.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a biased serological sample in the data collected remains the most plausible explanation. From July 2008 onwards, trajectories showed only very little variability, and indicated a very low probability of a future re-emergence in the absence of new viral introductions; which is consistent with previous modelling conducted for Mayotte [

Finally, after 2008, the model is fitted to the age-stratified IgG prevalence and is in good agreement with the observed IgG prevalence, even in the latest years (2015–2016). The overall observed IgG prevalence in 2016 which appears higher than the simulated one is an artefact which can be explained by a high number of animals sampled in the oldest age-group.
