  <p>Functional categorization of proteins found in differentially regulated spots of C6/36 cells under different infection modalities. 
   <bold>a</bold> At 24 h post infection, (
   <bold>b</bold>) at 120 h post infection by CHIKV. Blue bars, functions impacted by 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Monoinfection and dominance profile); red bars, functions impacted by CHIKV (Monoinfection and dominance profile); gray bars, functions impacted by cumulative effect; yellow bars, functions impacted by interference effect. The results are expressed in % values of total differentially accumulated proteins by cell functions (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02; 2-fold change)
