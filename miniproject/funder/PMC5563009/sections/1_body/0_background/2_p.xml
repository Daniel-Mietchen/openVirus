 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is naturally infected by the intracellular bacterium 
 <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic> that are maternally transmitted from mother to offspring. Two distinct 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains (
 <italic>w</italic>AlbA and 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB) are present in variable density in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and they usually induce sterility through the phenomenon known as cytoplasmic incompatibility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, naturally devoid of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, transinfected females harboring the 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB strain have been found to inhibit the transmission of both CHIKV and DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> dissemination of DENV serotype 2 to salivary glands of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from La Reunion was considerably diminished in comparison to 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-uninfected individuals generated by antibiotic treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. When 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was transinfected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Mel strain derived from 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> the transmission of DENV serotype 2 was totally abolished [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, the inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is not universal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and one study noted an increase in parasite infection in 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], suggesting that variable mechanisms are involved depending on the interacting partners. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms behind 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> interference have suggested that the bacterium may act by modulating expression of insect innate immune genes, including antimicrobial peptides, or more broadly by inducing oxidative and metabolic stresses that will in turn impact the behavior of the infectious agent in the host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is also proposed that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and viruses would compete for the host cells’ resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
