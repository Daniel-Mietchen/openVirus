<p id="Par19">The Asian tiger mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is a species native to South and East Asia, with a great capacity for invasion. It has been classified by the WHO as the fourth most invasive species in the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since the mid-twentieth century, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has considerably increased its distribution, and is currently present on five continents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is involved in the transmission of many human-infecting arboviruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and probably Zika virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Historically, 
 <italic>Ae. Albopictus</italic> has been considered of secondary importance in terms of arbovirosis incidence relative to 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. However, this has changed since the implication of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the explosive epidemics of CHIKV on La Reunion Island and neighboring islands in southern Indian Ocean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], as well as in the CHIKV outbreaks in Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and successive autochthonous transmissions of both CHIKV and DENV in metropolitan France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Efficient transmission of CHIKV has been associated with a mutation in E1 envelope glycoprotein (Ala-226-Val) that increases viral infectivity in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> compared to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Advances in technologies of large-scale analysis and the availability of genome sequencing allow the meaning of this host tolerance to be examined at the molecular level by the screening of cell factors possibly mobilized during viral cell invasion. In 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> differential trends of proteomic expression were seen in the midgut and salivary glands infected by CHIKV or DENV in comparison to uninfected specimens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Using cellular models, microarrays studies have shown that CHIKV enters 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], activating diverse biological processes, including protein folding and metabolic pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Overall, the modulation of the synthesis of some classes of host proteins clearly favors virus survival, replication and transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].
