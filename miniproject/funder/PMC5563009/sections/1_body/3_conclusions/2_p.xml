<p id="Par43">At later times post infection, the proteome is clearly altered, and CHIKV activity seems to have taken control of some cellular functions. Consequently, the virus seems to limit the impact of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on its replication cycle by hoarding the majority of resources, and even blocking 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>â€™s access to these resources. This shift partially explains the increased viral titer that is observed at later periods post-infection. Even if 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> no longer controls some of these cellular processes, its presence limits the effect of CHIKV infection on certain cellular functions, thus modulating its replication, particularly early after the infection process. This cellular level interference could explain phenotypes observed in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in vivo, where 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> limits transmission of dengue virus by reducing the viral titer in salivary glands [
