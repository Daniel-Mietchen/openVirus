<p id="Par42">This study highlights complex processes that occur during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells in symbiosis with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Even though these findings were obtained using a cellular model, the observed trends pave the way for future research into the in vivo characteristics of tripartite interaction. In our experimental conditions, the combination of 2DE and nanoLC-MS/MS revealed a balance in protein synthesis mostly in favor of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, which may explain the simultaneous inhibition of viral replication that we observed using RT-qPCR. At early times post infection, the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> greatly influences many cellular processes related to management of anti-oxidant activity, protein production, various metabolic pathways linked to the provisioning of resources; likely impacting CHIKV replication. Under such conditions, CHIKV faces a hostile environment for replication and appears to counterbalance this negative impact by blocking some key cellular pathway, including the inhibition of transcription, translation and locking of an miRNA pathway.
