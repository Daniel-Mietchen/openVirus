<p id="Par44">Several studies have shown that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can modulate the expression of genes involved in immunity that affect arbovirus infection, suggesting that interference acts by pre-immunization of the host [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Strikingly, we do not observe significant modulation of proteins related to immune response upon CHIKV-inhibition by 
 <italic>Wolbachia.</italic> Even though C6/36 lacks functional siRNA pathways, other immune response mechanisms could have been mobilized. The fact that we did not identify proteins involved in immunity might suggest that other cellular processes can lead to the antiviral profile, corroborating results obtained from other cellular models. For example, in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> Aa23 cells infected with either 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB, 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel or 
 <italic>w</italic>MelPop, whose density varied from 2.5 to 38 bacteria per host cell, no changes were observed in innate immunity related functions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Recently, an elegant work demonstrated that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> could inhibit viral replication at early stages post infection by affecting RNA translation or transcription, suggesting a likely direct effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Together these cellular models revealed alternative mechanisms to immunity in 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based viral inhibition that need further investigations. An interesting perspective could be the extension of proteome profiling to mosquito organs as well as testing other 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-transmitted arboviruses, such as Dengue and Zika, with emphasis on functions revealed in this study.
