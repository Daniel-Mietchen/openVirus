<p id="Par36">In contrast, the presence of CHIKV alone has only limited effect in comparison to uninfected cells. Few differential spots containing proteins at a very low percentage (&lt;5%) were detected, with tendency to be down-regulated. The majority of the proteins detected were related to the ATP transport and binding, glycolysis, cytoskeleton and stress responses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For instance, many proteins associated with ATP consumption were significantly reduced in the presence of CHIKV. Moreover, we observed a decrease in expression of the gene encoding A0A023END7 LSD2 (Lipid Storage Droplet-2), suggesting that CHIKV blocks lipid storage, potentially making them available incorporation into the viral envelope. This phenomenon has already been shown in
