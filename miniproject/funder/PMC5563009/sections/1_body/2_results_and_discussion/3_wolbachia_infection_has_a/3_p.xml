<p id="Par37">In dominance profiles, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> exhibited different protein trends in respect to virus, from a neutral level (W_DOM_1 and W_DOM_3), an increased (W_DOM_2) or repressed (W_DOM_4) synthesis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The W_DOM_1 profile reduced the CHIKV structural polyprotein V5UMV1 at 24 h post infection (hpi)., whereas the W_DOM_4 profile targeted specifically the viral capsid protein (A0A059VQ68) at 120 hpi (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These results are in agreement with the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> blocking phenotype observed recently for CHIKV in C6/36 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Viral blocking is therefore explained by inhibition of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cellular proteolysis machinery, thus limiting the maturation of virion-associated protein structures and reducing viral replication. Overall, this effect appeared more diverse at early stages post-infection, but of greater magnitude at later times (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). At 24 hpi 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> tends to sustain necessary cellular processes, such as oxidizing processes including glutathione peroxidase activity, translation and transcription (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Whereas, this is not the case at 120 hpi, when the bacterium limits processes that will be exploited by the virus, including oxidative stress, transportation and translation.
