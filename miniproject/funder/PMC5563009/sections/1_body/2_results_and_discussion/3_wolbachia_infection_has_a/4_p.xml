<p id="Par38">The viral dominance profile occurred at 120Â hpi, when the virus had established chronic and dense infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The ATP synthase subunit beta (A0A023ETB9), involved in active trans-membrane ion transport, appeared negatively regulated as well as Glutathione peroxidase (Q16N54), albeit to a lesser extent. In contrast, some structural proteins such as actin (Q0Z987) and those related to heat shock (A0A023EWK8) were over-synthesized, suggesting a role in the production of virions [
