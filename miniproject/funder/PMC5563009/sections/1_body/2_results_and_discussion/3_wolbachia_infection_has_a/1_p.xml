<p id="Par35">Among the 89 spots detected, 77% were specifically synthesized in the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in both mono-infection (53 spots) and dominance (16 spots) profiles (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Since the aim of this study was to characterize the impact of coinfection rather than monoinfection, we have chosen to sequence only 27 out of 53 spots, that were selected on the basis of a particular fold change as indicated above. Results of sequencing showed that spots linked to 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in both mono-infection and dominance profiles contained proteins involved in many cellular functions, including processes related to metabolism for acquisition of resources from the host, regulation of anti-oxidation and cellular functional machinery (transcription and translation), as well as active transport and cellular structures (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These proteins were present at the two times at relatively high percentage (64.5% at early time and 35% at late time) of the total proteins, and some of them have been already described in literature as being upregulated by 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]
 <italic>.</italic> One example is the Glutathione S-transferase (A0A023EL34) for the regulation of anti-oxidation process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which is abundant at early time in the presence of the bacterium. The large number of proteins mobilized in the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> indicates a strong relationship between the two partners.
