<p id="Par32">For the two time points (24 h and 120 h p.i.) and the four modalities (uninfected, mono-infected by either 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> or CHIKV and bi-infected by both microbes), three independent biological replicates were performed. Total proteins were extracted and similar amounts (approximately 150 μg, estimated on a 1D gel) were used for 2DE. For each modality and each replicate, a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 5 gels were used. Typical 2D gels with spots obtained are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The global gel analysis using the ProGenesis SameSpots software enabled detection of 906 spots at 24 h and 901 spots at 120 h p.i. ANOVA analysis allowed identifying 58 spots at 24 h and 32 spots at 120 h p.i that were statistically different (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02 and fold change &gt;2) in comparison to uninfected cells. As many of the spots identified at early time point were linked to 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection alone, only 30 of the 58 spots were selected for mass spectrometry sequencing, including all 32 spots observed at the late time point.
