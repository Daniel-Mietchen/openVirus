<p id="Par34">The 2DE combined with mass spectrometry sequencing did not allow quantification of the level of protein accumulation per spot, and one spot can contain several proteins, consequently it was not possible to identify which protein was involved in the variation observed. In addition, the presence of many identical proteins in several spots simultaneously makes the analysis complex. Therefore we proceeded by annotating proteins in GO terms that were used to construct interacting networks for each protein profile. This procedure allowed comparison of functions shared by all modalities with those belonging specifically to each partner.</p>
