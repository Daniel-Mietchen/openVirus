<p id="Par33">A protein was considered present in a spot when a minimum of two different peptides were identified by mass spectrometry (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Consequently, a total of 495 unique proteins were identified from 948 sequences at 24 h p.i., whereas 105 unique proteins were found among 168 sequences at 120 h p.i. The elevated number of identified sequences in the analysis can be explained by two major reasons; (i) a high number of proximate proteins that have possibly been subjected to post-translational modifications and (ii) protein fragmentation during experimentation that resulted in modified migration patterns. All peptide sequences and observed fold changes are described on the Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. By combining the protein level in each time point and the modality of infection, a total of four major profiles were defined, including monoinfection, dominance, cumulative and interference (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Accordingly, in the monoinfection profile each microbial partner tends to affect a particular protein or a group of host proteins. The dominant profile indicates a major impact of one microbial partner on the host protein synthesis (up or down) whereas the other microbial partner showed an opposite profile. The cumulative effect means that the two microbial partners displayed a synergic effect on protein synthesis. Lastly, the interference profile indicates that each microbial partner induces a specific protein pattern but the co-infection displays a totally new trend.
