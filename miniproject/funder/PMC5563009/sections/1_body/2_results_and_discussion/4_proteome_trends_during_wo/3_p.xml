<p id="Par41">When comparing the peptides detected in this study with those already described in mono-infection models using mass spectrometry approaches, some common proteins were identified. These include enolase (A0A023ETA6), which was found to stimulate transcription of the Sendai virus genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and upregulated in the interference profile (INT_3). If CHIKV seems to enhance the enolase synthesis, as already shown by Lee et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> tends to reduce its production. Consequently, in the bi-infection status, this conflictive pattern appears unfavorable to CHIKV replication. Among proteins involved in glycolysis and metabolism, one promising candidate is the disulfide isomerase protein (A0A023EP23) which has been shown to be modulated by CHIKV according to the infected organs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and the duration of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In our study, this protein is modulated by 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (W_Up_1), affecting the early CHIKV replication. Similarly, some chaperonins such as the putative calreticulin-like 2 (A0A023EQL3), chaperonin 60Â kDa (A0A023EV59), heat shock cognate 70 (Q1HQZ5), alpha and beta tubulin 1 (A0A023ERN1 and A0A023ESE6) have been described to be modulated during CHIKV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and for which we found to be impacted by bi-infection status. These observations are also operating in glycolysis with for instance triosephosphate isomerase (A0A023EIM8) shown to be important in energy input necessary for viral replication. Indeed, at early time, this protein is overexpressed in 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected cells, inducing a favorable environment for CHIKV. In contrast, at latter time, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> seems to reduce the expression of triosephosphate isomerase while CHIKV tends to increase its activity (V_DOM_3 profile), suggesting the importance of such protein in this tripartite interaction.
