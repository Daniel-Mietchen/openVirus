<p id="Par40">The second pattern was an interference profile (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). At 24 hpi, interference seemed to be directed against CHIKV and in favour of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Indeed, despite 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> neutral (INT_2) or negative (INT_1) effects, cellular processes that were found to be up-regulated were those that may be of benefit to the bacterium, including cell development processes, transcription, translation and various metabolic pathways. At 120Â hpi the INT_3 profile showed establishment of a balance between 
 <italic>Wolbachia,</italic> which decreases metabolic processes, and the virus who in turn activated them for its own benefit. This sum of effect allows maintaining these processes at a steady-state level in cell. INT_4 profile was essentially related to structural proteins that were inhibited by each microbial partner, but during bi-infection where these proteins were not down-regulated. INT_5 profile identified ATP synthase subunit beta of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (H0U0S7) that was inhibited by the virus. This later profile highlights a particular pattern where the presence of virus inhibited bacterial proteins through the blocking access to resources, thus limiting the potential of the bacterium to affect the virus.
