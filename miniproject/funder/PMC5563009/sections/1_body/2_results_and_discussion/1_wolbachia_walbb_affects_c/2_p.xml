<p id="Par31">Statistical analyzes demonstrated that the density of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was not affected by the presence of the CHIKV, and was marginally affected upon time (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.05262) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As expected, the viral titer was significantly reduced in the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2e-16), without reaching complete inhibition. The inhibitory effect decreased with time, being lower at a late time (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007825) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It has been reported that viral inhibition by 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is density-dependent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. At the two time points tested here the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density remained stable, around 12 bacteria per cell, and the level of CHIKV inhibition was similar to previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The chronic 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection and the permissiveness to viruses make the C6/36 cell line an interesting model for exploratory functional studies. One unfavorable point of this cell line is the lack of siRNA pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], a primary immune response against viral infection in mosquitoes. However, it has been shown that insects can mobilize other RNA interference pathways to control viral replication. For instance, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> induces miRNA and specific piRNA pathways to control the replication of DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> could have an effect on synthesis of small RNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Therefore, this cellular model seems suitable for the study of induced host-cell responses following mono- or bi-partite infection by 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and/or CHIKV as well as the CHIKV replication cycle.
