<p id="Par30">As our previous study of the C6/36 infected with 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB showed that presence of the bacterium decreased the viral titer compared to uninfected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we measured 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB and CHIKV densities at 24 and 120Â h post infection (p.i.) using qPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively. The density of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was about 12 
 <italic>wsp</italic> gene/
 <italic>actin</italic> ratio (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The percentage of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected cells ranged from 60 to 70% (not shown) as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization published protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The CHIK RNA copy number was estimated between 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 10
 <sup>9</sup> per ng of total RNA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Both 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected and uninfected cells produce infectious viral particles without visible cytopathic effect (not shown). This was expected as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> cells are permissive to many arboviruses, including CHIKV, that are found non pathogenic to mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This is why the C6/36 cell line is extensively used to propagate viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].
