<p id="Par24">Genomic DNA isolation was performed using 
 <italic>DNeasy blood and tissues Kit</italic> (Qiagen, France) following manufacturer’s instructions. Cell pellets were resuspended in 180 μL of ATL lysis buffer and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 mg/mL lysozyme (Euromedex, France). Residual co-extracted RNA was eliminated by adding 100 mg/mL RNase A, for 2 min at room temperature, then isolated DNA was eluted in 30 μL of DNase-free water. To isolate total RNA, cell pellets were crushed in 350 μL RLT lysis buffer of 
 <italic>RNeasy Mini Kit</italic> (Qiagen, France) using RNase-free piston pellet (Kontes, USA) and following manufacturer’s recommendations. Then RNA was eluted in 37 μL of RNase-free water and treated with DNase using the TURBO-DNA free kit (Ambion, USA) in 50 μL final volume following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA and RNA were quantified using a UV-mc
 <sup>2</sup> spectrophotometer and diluted to 5 ng/μL, then frozen at −20 °C (DNA) or −80 °C (RNA) until use.
