<p id="Par25">To monitor the relative density of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> per cell, qPCR was performed using 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> Surface Protein (
 <italic>wsp</italic>) gene for the bacterium and 
 <italic>actin</italic> gene for the host cell. Standard curves were drawn on 10-fold serial dilutions from 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL of the DNA plasmid pQuantAlb16S containing fragments of the two targeted genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Amplification reaction was done in a total volume of 20 μL containing 10 ng of template DNA, 1× (10 μL) Fast-SYBR-Green Master Mix (Roche, Suisse), 200 mM of each 
 <italic>wsp</italic> primers (5’AAGGAACCGAAGTTCATG3′ and 5’AGTTGTGAGTAAAGTCCC3’) and 300 mM each 
 <italic>actin</italic> primers (5’GCAAACGTGGTATCCTGAC3’ and 5’GTCAGGAGAACTGGGTGCT3’). Amplification was performed on LC480 LightCycler (Roche, France) and consisted of 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, and a final elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. To quantify CHIKV RNA copy number, RT-qPCR was done on the envelope 
 <italic>E2</italic> gene using a standard curve of 10-fold serial dilution of a synthetic CHIKV RNA transcript [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. One-step RT-qPCR was performed using EXPRESS One-Step SYBR GreenER Kit (Invitrogen, France) in a volume of 20 μL containing 10 ng of RNA template, 1× (10 μL) EXPRESS SYBR GreenER SuperMix Universal, 200 nM of sense Chik/E2/9018/+ and anti-sense Chik/E2/9235/− primers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and 1× (0.5 μL) EXPRESS Superscript Mix. Amplification was performed on a LC480 LightCycler (Roche, France) and consisted of 15 min at 50 °C and by 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 63 °C for 1 min. All PCR reactions were done in triplicate. DNA and RNA extracted from C6/36 uninfected were used as negative control.
