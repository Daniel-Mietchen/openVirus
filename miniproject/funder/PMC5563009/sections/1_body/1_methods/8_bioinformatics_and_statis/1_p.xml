<p id="Par29">The continuous response variables (viral and bacterial titers) were log
 <sub>10</sub>-transformed. They were analyzed using a multifactorial linear model, with a normal error distribution and an identity link function that included the effect of the time and MOI as ordinal variables, treatment as discrete variable and their interactions. All the statistical analyses were performed using R environment (version 3.1.0). An annotation in GO term was carried out on the proteins identified using Blast2GO (3.2.7) then they were used to detect possible interaction networks using Cytoscape (3.3.0).
