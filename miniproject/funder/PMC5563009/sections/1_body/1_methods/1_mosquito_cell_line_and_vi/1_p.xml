 <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>AlbB strain and uninfected cells generated by removing the bacterium through tetracycline treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] were cultured at 28 °C in medium consisting of equal volumes of Mitsuhashi/Maramorosh (Bioconcept, Switzerland) and Schneider’s insect medium (Sigma, France), supplemented with 10% (
 <italic>v</italic>/v) of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (PAA, USA) and penicillin/streptomycin (50 U/50 μg/mL; Gibco, Invitrogen, France). Cells were continuously passaged in 25-cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks by scrapping and seeding a new flask with 1:5 of the cell suspension in 5 mL of fresh medium, every 4 days. The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) 06.21 strain was isolated in C6/36 from newborn serum sample with neonatal encephalopathy during the outbreak in La Reunion Island [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Viral stocks were produced on C6/36 cells in 25-cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks, at Multiplicity Of Infection (MOI) of 0.01. After 3 days at 28 °C, supernatants from infected cells were recovered and virus titration was done using plaque assay on Vero E6 (green monkey kidney) cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The titer stock virus was estimated to 10
 <sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until used.
