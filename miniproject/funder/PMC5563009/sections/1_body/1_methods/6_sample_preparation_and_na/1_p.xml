<p id="Par27">Protein spots were destained in 60 mM potassium ferricyanide and 200 mM sodium thiosulfate mixed 1:1 until all brown color was removed. The spots were washed through successive incubations with water until all yellow color was removed and shrunk in acetonitrile (ACN) for 10 min. After ACN removal, gel pieces were dried at room temperature. Proteins were digested by incubating each gel slice with 10 ng/μL of trypsin (T6567, Sigma-Aldrich) in 40 mM NH4HCO3, 10% ACN, rehydrated at 4 °C for 10 min, and finally incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel by three steps: a first incubation in 40 mM NH4HCO3, 10% ACN for 15 min at room temperature followed by two incubations in 47.5% ACN, 5% formic acid for 15 min at room temperature. The three collected extractions were pooled with the initial digestion supernatant, dried in a SpeedVac, and resuspended with 25 μL of 0.1% formic acid before nanoLC-MS/MS analysis. Online nanoLC-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC Nano-UPHLC system (Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled to a nanospray Q-Exactive hybrid quadruplole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Ten microliters of each peptide extract were loaded on a 300 μm ID × 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn (Thermo Scientific, USA) at a flow rate of 20 μL/min. After 5 min desalting, peptides were online separated on a 75 μm ID × 25 cm C18 Acclaim PepMap® RSLC column (Thermo Scientific, USA) with a 4–40% linear gradient of solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 80% ACN) in 48 min. The separation flow rate was set at 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode at a 1.8 kV needle voltage. Data were acquired using Xcalibur 3.0 software in a data-dependent mode. MS scans (m/z 300–2000) were recorded at a resolution of 
 <italic>R</italic> = 70,000 (@ m/z 200) and an AGC target of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> ions collected within 100 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s and top 15 ions were selected from fragmentation in HCD mode. MS/MS scans with a target value of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> ions were collected with a maximum fill time of 120 ms and a resolution of 
 <italic>R</italic> = 35,000. Additionally, only +2 and +3 charged ions were selected for fragmentation. Others settings were as follows: no sheath and no auxiliary gas flow, heated capillary temperature, 200 °C; normalized HCD collision energy of 25% and an isolation width of 3 m/z.
