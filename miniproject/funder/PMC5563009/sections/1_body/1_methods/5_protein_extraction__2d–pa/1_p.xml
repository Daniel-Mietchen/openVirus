<p id="Par26">To extract proteins, cell lysates were defreezed on ice and proteins were precipitated with 10% (

 <italic>v</italic>) trichloroacetic acid (Sigma, France) at 4 °C overnight. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C and washed three times with glacial acetone (VWR Chemicals, France). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed using the Protean IEF System (Biorad, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The rehydration buffer contained 8 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich) and 4% (

 <italic>v</italic>) CHAPS (Sigma). IEF was performed with 11 cm no-linear strips, pH 3–10 (Biorad), using the Voltage Ramp protocol recommended by the manufacturer (100 V/30 min/rapid, 250 V/30 min/linear, 1000 V/30 min/linear, 7000 V/3 h/linear, and finally 32,000 V/h (pH 3–10 IPG)). The second dimension was carried out using the Criterion Dodeca system (Biorad). A minimum of four gels loaded with biological replicates was used for each condition. Criterion any kD TGX gels (Biorad) were run at 10 °C in Laemmli buffer [
