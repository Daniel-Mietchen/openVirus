<p id="Par23">To assess the impact of cell co-infection by 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and CHIKV, we compared four modalities of infection; cells uninfected, mono-infected by 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB or CHIKV and bi-infected, each with three independent biological replicates. The day prior infection, 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells were transferred in 25-cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask and allowed to attach for 18 h at 28 °C. Infection at MOI 0.1 with CHIKV 06.21 was performed in 0.5 mL new medium with 2% fetal bovine serum, using virus-free medium as control. After 1 h, 5 mL of fresh medium with 10% fetal bovine serum were added and incubation extended. Cells and supernatants were harvested at 24 and 120 h post-infection. For uninfected cells, we applied the same protocol but fetal bovine serum medium did not contain any virus particles. Blue trypan staining used for cell counting and light microscopy employed to monitor cell monolayers did not show apparent necrotic cells along the course of the experiment (not shown). At the two times (24 h and 120 h), cells were scrapped and pelleted by centrifugation and a fraction of these cells was conserved in 1.5 mL tube for genomic DNA and RNA isolations. Each cell pellet was washed once in 10 mL PBS 1× pH 7.4 (Gibco, Invitrogen, France) and then resuspended in lysis buffer composed of urea 7 M (Sigma, France), 2 M thiourea (Fluka, Sigma, France), 4% CHAPS (Sigma, France), 0.5% Triton ×100 (Sigma, France) and TBP 0.08 mM (Sigma, France) in distilled water (Gibco, Invitrogen, France); and incubated on ice for 30 min with regular vortexing. Cell lysates were stored at −80 °C until protein extractions.
