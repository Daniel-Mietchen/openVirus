<p>Prediction of strain dynamics requires long time series data of lineage specific isolates. In fact, prediction using data from only one year cannot capture the strain dynamics, and the opposite lineage of a yearâ€™s dominant lineage, as shown in the data, was selected as the dominant lineage each time (the data is not shown in this paper). Surveillance with an appropriate and consistent study design is essential for predicting the lineage dynamics for vaccine strain selection.</p>
