<p>Even though the dominant lineage can be predicted, selection of the specific strain is still required. Especially, the antigenicity of the Victoria lineage changes rapidly, so further understanding of the evolution of the Victoria lineage is necessary. Phylodynamic studies showed that the time series change of the genetic diversity of Victoria is similar to influenza A H3N2 and H1N1, so the model must take into account evolution at the strain level [
