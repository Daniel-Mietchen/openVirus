<p>In this paper we estimated the dynamics of two major IBV lineages using a parsimonious mathematical model. Although the prediction of the dominant lineage of IBV is important for vaccine strain selection, the complex lineage dynamics of IBV makes this prediction difficult. Our result suggests that the prediction of the dominant lineage of IBV may be possible if the epidemiological interference between lineages was quantified.</p>
