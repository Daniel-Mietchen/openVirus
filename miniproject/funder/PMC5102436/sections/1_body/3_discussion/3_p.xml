<p>Our estimates of lineage-specific reproduction numbers agree with phylodynamic analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; the average reproduction number of Victoria is larger than that of Yamagata. The seasonal fluctuation of the reproduction number of Victoria is also larger than that of Yamagata. Our estimate of the reproduction number takes into account both cross-reactivity of immunity between Victoria and Yamagata and waning immunity. If we misestimated these two factors, estimated values would be far from the estimate by phylodynamic analysis.
