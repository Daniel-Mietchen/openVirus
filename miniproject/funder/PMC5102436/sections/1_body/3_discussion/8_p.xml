<p>In conclusion, we developed a parsimonious mathematical model describing the lineage dynamics of IBV. Using the weekly number of lineage specific isolates we estimated the reproduction number, the waning rate of immunity, and the strength of cross-immune reaction. Our prediction suggests that models taking into account epidemiological interference due to cross-immune reaction and the seasonality of transmission can predict the lineage dynamics of IBV for the next year.</p>
