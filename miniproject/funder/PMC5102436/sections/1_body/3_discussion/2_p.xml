<p>Our estimates of the waning rate of immunity suggest that immunity against the Yamagata lineage is shorter than immunity to Victoria. This tendency is robust even when the seasons of the data for the estimation were changed; 2010–2013, 2011–2014, 2012–2015, 2010–2014, and 2011–2015 compared to the result using 2010–2015 seasons (

There are two possible interpretations of this result: i) the antigenicity of Yamagata changes much faster than Victoria or ii) the immunity against Yamagata wanes faster than Victoria. The results of phylogenetic analysis and the antigenicity measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay suggest that the Victoria lineage is under stronger selection pressure due to host immunity, and the antigenicity of Victoria changes faster than that of Yamagata [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore hypothesis i) is not likely to be true. On the other hand, the hypothesis ii) is not rejected by the result of phylogenetic and antigenicity analyses. If the immunity itself wanes rapidly, the lineage cannot be under selection pressure by host immunity and the change of antigenicity is not essential for the persistence of the lineage. Furthermore, the broader age-distribution of infection of Yamagata than Victoria implies frequent re-infection with the Yamagata lineage [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], supporting the possibility of rapid waning immunity against the Yamagata lineage. The clinical trial of vaccines against the Yamagata lineage showed stronger immune reaction to Yamagata than to Victoria [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but this immunity may persist temporarily and wane rapidly. To conclude, whether the immunity against the Yamagata lineage is of long or short duration will require further study.
