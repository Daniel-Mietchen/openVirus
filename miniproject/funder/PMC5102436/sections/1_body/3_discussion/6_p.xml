<p>For simplicity, our model assumed constant antigenic evolution within each lineage. This assumption is based on the fact that no new lineage has emerged after the branching of IBV to Yamagata and Victoria, which suggests it has relatively stable evolutionary dynamics compared to IAV. Our model is sufficient for the short-term prediction of lineage dynamics, however, when we predict the emergence of new lineages and the extinction of current lineages, the evolutionary dynamics at the quasi-species level would need to be taken into account.</p>
