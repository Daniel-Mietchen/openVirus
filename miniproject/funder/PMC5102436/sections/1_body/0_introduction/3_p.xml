<p>To predict an effective vaccine strain for IBV, a good model capturing the mechanisms of its complex dynamics is needed. Important factors to consider regarding the complex epidemic dynamics of the Yamagata and Victoria lineages are i) the seasonal variation of transmissibility, ii) epidemiological interference between the two lineages, and iii) time series changes of antigenicity due to the evolution of the pathogens. The incidence of IBV shows seasonal fluctuation which can be explained by the seasonality of the transmissibility of IBV. This transmissibility seasonality has been shown to be determined by seasonal variation of absolute humidity [

 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], therefore a model capturing seasonal fluctuation of transmissibility is essential to predicting epidemic dynamics. Epidemiological interference is also a known factor in complex epidemic dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The time series of confirmed cases between two lineages are negatively correlated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166107.g001">Fig 1</xref>), implying epidemiological interference between the two lineages. Moreover, vaccine efficacy studies also imply the existence of immune cross-reaction between lineages [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The epidemic dynamics of a lineage are affected by that of the other lineage assuming the existence of immune cross-reaction. The change of antigenicity of influenza across seasons is one major obstacle for prediction. Especially in the case of IAV, the large variety of lineages and epidemic interference between these lineages makes it difficult to predict the dynamics. To analyze these complex dynamics, models taking into account these complex evolutionary dynamics have been proposed so far [

 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although the number of co-circulating IBV lineages is limited compared to IAV the large genetic diversity within the lineages and the changing antigenicity over time, especially for the Victoria lineage [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], makes dominant lineage prediction difficult. Modelling the complex evolutionary dynamics is essential to predicting future changes in IBV.
