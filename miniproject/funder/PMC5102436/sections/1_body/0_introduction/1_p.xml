<p>The influenza virus is one of the most common respiratory viruses and causes a high disease burden worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The influenza viruses co-circulating among humans can be classified as influenza A viruses (IAV) and influenza B viruses (IBV). Approximately 75% of confirmed cases of influenza are infections by the IAV [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. IAV shows high antigenic diversity and rapid change in antigenicity, and appropriate intervention against IAV epidemics is quite difficult in terms of vaccine strain selection. The disease burden of IBV is also high, and 25% of confirmed cases of influenza virus infection and 22â€“44% of pediatric influenza related deaths in the US are caused by influenza B [

 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The number of major lineages of IBV is relatively low compared to type A. There are only two major genetically and antigenically distinct lineages; the Yamagata lineage and the Victoria lineage.
