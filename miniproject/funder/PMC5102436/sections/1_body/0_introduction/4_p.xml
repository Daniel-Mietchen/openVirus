<p>In this paper, we assess the predictability of the dominant lineage of IBV using a mathematical model describing IBV epidemics. To this end, we construct a parsimonious mathematical model that takes into account the seasonal variation of transmissibility, the epidemiological interference between lineages, and the time series change of antigenicity. We first estimate the parameters of our model, including these three factors, from the time series of IBV confirmed cases per lineage and time series of specific humidity. Using these estimated parameters we assess the predictive potential of the dominant lineage in the next season.</p>
