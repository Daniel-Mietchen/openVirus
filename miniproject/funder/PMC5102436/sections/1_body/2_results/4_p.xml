<p>Due to the similar number of isolates between Yamagata and Victoria in the 2015–2016 season, it was difficult to determine the dominant strain. We also compared our prediction to the frequency of Victoria lineage isolates among all the IBV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166107.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Our model can predict the frequency of lineage as well. The predicted frequency of the Victoria lineage using the observed emergence timing by

 <sub>0,n</sub> is 0.58 (95%HPD: 0.01–0.99), the predicted frequency using estimated emergence timing by

 <sub>0,n</sub> is 0.61 (95%HPD: 0.01–0.99), the average predicted frequency of Victoria among varied emergence timings is 0.64 (95%HPD: 0.12–0.97), and the observed frequency of Victoria was 0.51 from the field data.
