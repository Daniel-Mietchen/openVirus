<p>Our model captured the lineage dynamics of both Victoria and Yamagata from the 2010–2011 season to the 2014–2015 season well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166107.g003">Fig 3</xref>). 
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the estimated values of parameters; with most parameters being similar between Yamagata and Victoria, with the exception of 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>κ</italic>. The amplitude of seasonal fluctuation of transmission rate for the Victoria lineage, 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>Victoria</sub>, is higher than that for Yamagata. 
 <italic>κ</italic>
 <sub>Yamagata</sub> is much higher than 
 <italic>κ</italic>
 <sub>Victoria</sub>, the average sojourn time until the loss of immunity is 1.15 years for Victoria and 0.079 years for Yamagata. As validation of our model, we simulated the epidemics in 2015–2016 season using the estimated posterior distributions and the field data of the emergence time of Victoria and Yamagata in 2015–2016 season, and the simulated final epidemic sizes per lineage were compared to the field data (leave-one-out cross-validation). Our model can capture the final epidemic size per lineage well (
