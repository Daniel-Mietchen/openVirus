<p>Using the posterior distribution of parameters in our model we predicted the dominant lineage for the 2015–2016 season. The number of isolates for the Yamagata and Victoria lineages were close during the 2015–2016 season in Japan; 663 isolates of the Yamagata lineage and 694 isolates of the Victoria lineage were reported by 12th April 2016. Although the emergence timing plays a key role in determining the dominant lineage, at this moment we do not know the future emergence timing. The average accuracy obtained by varying the emergence timings of Yamagata and Victoria is 0.614. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0166107.g005">Fig 5A</xref> shows the sensitivity analysis of the accuracy of prediction for the dominant lineage. The accuracy was improved to 0.688 if we use the actual emergence timing.
