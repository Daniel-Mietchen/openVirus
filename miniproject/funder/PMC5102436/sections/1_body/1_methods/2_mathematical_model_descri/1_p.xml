<p>We employed individual-based Monte Carlo simulation (IBM) with host populations of 10,000. The host population was determined based on a sensitivity analysis of posterior distributions to the host population size (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0166107.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We described the transmission process of the Yamagata lineage and the Victoria lineage using the compartmental SEIRS model. Based on the natural history of IBV, we classified the host population into four classes by infection state against each lineage; susceptible 
 <italic>S</italic>, latent 
 <italic>E</italic>, infectious 
 <italic>I</italic>, and recovered 
 <italic>R</italic>. A total of 4
 <sup>2</sup> = 16 infection states were considered. We denote these infection states by 
 <italic>XY</italic> where 
 <italic>X</italic> is the infection state against Victoria and 
 <italic>Y</italic> is that for Yamagata. For example 
 <italic>SE</italic> denotes 
 <italic>S</italic> for Victoria and 
 <italic>E</italic> for Yamagata.
