<p>Using the time-series data of the number of laboratory-confirmed IBV cases per lineage and specific humidity, we estimated the parameters (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic>, and 
 <italic>κ)</italic> in the model described in the last section. Based on previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0166107.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we parameterized 
 <italic>ε</italic> as 1/
 <italic>ε</italic> = 0.6 day and 
 <italic>γ</italic> as 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> = 4.0 day. These parameters are estimated for each lineage. We also estimated the herd immunity against each lineage at the beginning of the period explored in this study, i.e., 
 <italic>SS</italic>, 
 <italic>SR</italic>, 
 <italic>RS</italic>, 
 <italic>RR</italic> at the beginning of the 2010–2011 season. Hereafter, we refer to 
 <italic>SS</italic>, 
 <italic>SR</italic>, 
 <italic>RS</italic>, 
 <italic>RR</italic> at the beginning of the 2010–2011 season as 
 <italic>SS</italic>(0), 
 <italic>SR</italic>(0), 
 <italic>RS</italic>(0), 
 <italic>RR</italic>(0), respectively.
