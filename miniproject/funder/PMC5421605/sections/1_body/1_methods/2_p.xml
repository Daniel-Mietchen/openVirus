<p>A cross-sectional study was conducted during February and March 2016. A total of 72 brown lemurs, collected over 12 days, from nine different capture sites, in five communes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>), were captured, blood sampled, and released. The whole island had been previously affected by RVF (Cetre-Sossah et al. 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The selection of the capture sites attempted to cover the main island, taking into account site accessibility, known regular presence of lemurs, and logistical constraints. Brown lemurs in Mayotte live in trees and in groups of varying size of 5–15 individuals. Animals were caught in groups, using large fruit-baited cages (H160 × W120 × L200 cm). Once in the cage, the animals were caught one by one using a net and anesthetized with a routine dose of 0.125 mg/kg of medetomidine and 7.5 mg/kg ketamine by intramuscular injection in the thigh. During the anaesthesia, 3 mL of blood was withdrawn from the femoral vein. Data on age (&lt;1 year old, 1–3 years old, 3–6 years old, and &gt;6 years old) were collected on 70 animals. The estimation of age was based on the examination of the teeth and the development of the primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Animals were kept under surveillance until full recovery and were released on the same day, at the site of capture. Blood samples were centrifuged and sera were kept at −80°C and shipped to La Reunion (France) for laboratory testing. To look for acute infections, detection of RVF virus genome was performed using the RT-PCR technique based on the L segment with a detection limit of 0.5 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL (Wilson et al. 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Evidence of past infections was examined by detecting RVF-specific IgG antibodies in serum (ID Screen RVF Competition multispecies ELISA kit; IDVet, Grabels, France) with a diagnostic sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100% (Kortekaas et al. 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
