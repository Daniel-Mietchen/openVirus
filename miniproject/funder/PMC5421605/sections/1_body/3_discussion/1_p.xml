<p>There is evidence that lemurs can be exposed to Chikungunya and Flavivirus infections in Mayotte and Madagascar (Fontenille et al. 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>, Vourc'h et al. 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). All our study animals were found negative to RVF. Although the lemur population on the island might have been infected by RVF during the epidemic phase, it seems very unlikely that they play a major role in the interepidemic persistence of RVF virus in Mayotte. In addition, despite the ELISA test used had not been validated with lemurs, it is not species specific, and therefore gives weight to the results obtained. Finally, as previous surveys of lemurs in Mayotte did not target populations sharing an environment with RVF-seropositive livestock and humans (Lernout et al. 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), our article presents the first study investigating the potential role of lemurs in the epidemiological cycle of RVF virus in Mayotte. Although tenrecs (Family 
 <italic>Tenrecidae</italic>) and rodents (Family 
 <italic>Nesomyidae</italic> and 
 <italic>Muridae</italic>) in neighboring Madagascar showed no evidence of RVF infection during 2008â€“2010 after the RVF epidemic (Olive et al. 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), similar serological studies in other wild mammals would be necessary in Mayotte to assess their role in RVF persistence.
