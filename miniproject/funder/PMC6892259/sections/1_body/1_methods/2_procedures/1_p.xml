<p id="para150">Blood samples were obtained by standard venipuncture. The measured outcomes were the serum concentration of neutralising antibodies to yellow fever virus 4·5 years after vaccination (Mali) or 2·3 and 6·0 years after vaccination (Ghana) and, in each cohort, the relative proportions of seropositive, borderline, and seronegative study participants at these timepoints. Titres of neutralising antibodies to yellow fever virus were determined by a microneutralisation assay. Briefly, 100 50% tissue culture infective doses of a yellow fever virus suspension (strain YF-17D-204, Stamaril, Sanofi Pasteur, Val de Reuil, France) were reacted with serial two-fold dilutions of sera (starting at 1:4) before inoculation into Vero cells cultured in 96-well plates, which were microscopically examined for cytopathic effect after 7 days. Baseline samples were tested in the same run as the matching post-vaccination sera. A neutralisation antibody titre of 1:10 or higher is considered a surrogate of protection.

On the basis of earlier studies,

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> we applied a concentration threshold to discriminate seropositive (≥0·5 IU/mL) from borderline sera (measurable concentrations &lt;0·5 IU/mL). Accordingly, we defined seroconversion and seroreversion as the crossing of this threshold over time. We classified samples as seronegative if they were ineffective at the initial dilution in the assay (1:4).
