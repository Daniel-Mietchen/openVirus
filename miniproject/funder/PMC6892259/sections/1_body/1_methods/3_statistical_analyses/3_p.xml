<p id="para180">We characterised sets of vaccinees by the geometric mean, the median, and the IQR of antibody concentrations. We used a percentile bootstrap procedure with 10
 <sup>6</sup> replications to compute the 95% CI for the geometric mean. We compared two sets of concentrations by either an independent-samples permutation test on the difference of geometric means or a permutation-based sign test for paired data, as applicable. The permutation tests involved 999â€ˆ999 random replications, ensuring precision to three decimal digits for the p value near the significance threshold, as estimated by the 95% CI for the p value.
