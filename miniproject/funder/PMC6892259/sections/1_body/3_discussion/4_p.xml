<p id="para330">We normalised assay results to a WHO international standard for yellow fever neutralising antibodies, which makes it possible to compare our data with those from other investigations using standardised antibody concentrations. Additionally, we conservatively introduced a seropositivity cutoff (≥0·5 IU/mL), because very low antibody concentrations might straddle the sensitivity threshold of the assay and were associated with inconsistent protection in previous studies.
