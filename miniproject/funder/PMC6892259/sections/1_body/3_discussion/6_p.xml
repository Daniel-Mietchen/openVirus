<p id="para350">Antigenic interference between the live-virus vaccines against measles and yellow fever co-administered under the Expanded Programme on Immunization should be considered as an explanation for the drop in immunity. In some studies, the immunogenicity of the yellow fever vaccine was decreased by co-administration with the measles vaccine, either alone
