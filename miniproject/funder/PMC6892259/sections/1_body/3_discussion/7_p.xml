 </xref> Relative to the seropositivity in that study (at the ≥1:8 titre threshold), we noted an approximately two times long-term decrease in seropositivity for either population. Direct comparison, however, is hindered by differences in the population samples and study methods and by non-standardisation of antibody values in that earlier work.
