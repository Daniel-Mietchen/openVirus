<p id="para320">We have analysed the long-term persistence of neutralising antibodies against yellow fever virus among two population samples of African children vaccinated under the Expanded Programme on Immunization. The importance of humoral immunity in protecting against yellow fever is well established,

The role of T-cell-dependent immunity is uncertain; humoral immunity is known to be crucial, but neither the cellular component nor the presence of neutralising antibodies alone might be sufficient for protective immunity.
