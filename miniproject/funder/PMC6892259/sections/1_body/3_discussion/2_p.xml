 </xref> Waning seroprotection is a major determinant of the need for, and periodicity of, revaccination, and the population immunity achievable with a single dose of vaccine depends on the rate of vaccination failure and on the duration of conferred immunity. These parameters are important for immunisation programmes in endemic areas, where protective immunity covering about 80% of the population is necessary to prevent outbreaks.
