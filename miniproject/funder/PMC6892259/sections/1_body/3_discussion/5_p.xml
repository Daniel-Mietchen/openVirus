<p id="para340">Our findings point to a large decline in yellow fever immunity in children vaccinated as infants. The reduction in seropositivity, especially among the Ghanaian group after only 2·3 years, is noteworthy in comparison with previously reported seroconversion 28 days after vaccination.

Additionally, half of the Ghanaian borderline participants became seronegative at 6·0 years, which suggests that Malian borderline participants (38·8% of borderline and seronegative participants) were likewise affected by waning immunity (eventual seroreversion could not be determined without a later follow-up sample).
