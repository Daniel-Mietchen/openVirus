<p id="para380">The inability to control for environmental factors that might bias the measured response to yellow fever vaccination is a limitation of this study. We cannot exclude immune activation by unrelated infections or immunisations within the time frame of sample collection, or an antigenic challenge of memory immunity by other cross-reactive, circulating flaviviruses. Additionally, the presence of other vaccines, notably against measles, prevents the outcome of yellow fever vaccination from being assessed in isolation; however, it is unavoidable in a study in endemic countries with routine immunisation programmes, and the data are useful within this real-life context. The absence of two long-term follow-up points in Mali matching those of the Ghanaian cohort also limits comparisons between the two groups.</p>
