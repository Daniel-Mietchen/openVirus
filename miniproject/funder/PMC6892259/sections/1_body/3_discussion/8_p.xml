<p id="para370">The numerous late seroconversions in the Ghanaian year-6·0 data might have arisen from an external cause. The spread of a yellow fever outbreak in the Builsa, Kassena-Nankana West, and Kintampo South districts of Ghana in 2011 overlapped with the catchment area of this study and, chronologically, with the dates of the year-2·3 collection. Additionally, mass vaccination campaigns in the affected areas targeted 5·8 million people in early 2012.

 </xref> Vaccine immunity might have been boosted by natural yellow fever virus infection, unreported revaccination, or both. In this scenario, averted antibody decay in some children or new seroconversions in others could lead to an overestimation of the seropositivity resulting from the vaccine received at 9–12 months of age, a common issue in studies of vaccination in endemic areas.

 </xref> Unreported infection with wild or vaccinal virus might also have contributed to the enrichment in high antibody concentrations in the Ghanaian relative to the Malian seropositive children, and to the observed increase in year-6·0 antibody values among serostable boys. Although a higher antibody response to yellow fever vaccination has been noted previously in male individuals, the incidence of yellow fever is also greater in male than in female individuals, possibly determined by epidemiological and host-intrinsic factors.

 </xref> Additionally, the seroconversion of the majority of borderline participants to the low tier of seropositivity is in line with reports of a negative correlation between pre-existing antibodies against yellow fever and the magnitude of the B-cell response on subsequent exposure to the virus.
