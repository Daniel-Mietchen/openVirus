 </xref> The re-emergence of yellow fever has led to the largest outbreak in Africa of the past 20 years: the Angola outbreak of December, 2015, connected with the 2016 outbreak in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. During the outbreak that started in Brazil in 2016, the virus spread into areas that were not previously considered at high risk, including the densely populated periphery of the large cities of SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador de Bahia.
