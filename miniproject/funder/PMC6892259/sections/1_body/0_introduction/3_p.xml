<p id="para30">The vaccines against yellow fever are safe and efficacious and consist of live attenuated virus that is usually administered by subcutaneous injection. WHO guidelines advocate a single dose of vaccine for life-long protective immunity against yellow fever.

 </xref> In endemic countries, the vaccine is routinely given to infants at 9–12 months of age as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization. The merits of one-dose vaccination at such early ages have not yet been supported by evidence that shows vaccine-elicited immunity to yellow fever persisting for many years in the absence of booster doses. Several studies have shown a decrease in seropositivity and antibody titres in vaccines over time, with 71–82% of adults seropositive 10 years or more after vaccination.

 </xref> Studies on the loss of immunity in adults done in non-endemic settings, where a boost of vaccine-induced immunity by later natural infections is unlikely, have reported that up to 30%–40% of individuals serorevert 5–10 years after vaccination.

 </xref> Children, however, showed lower seroconversion rates and titres than healthy adults and might lose immunity faster.
