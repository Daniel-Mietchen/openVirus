   <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para60">WHO has recommended a single lifetime vaccination against yellow fever since 2013, following published evidence of long-lasting immunogenicity of the YF-17D vaccine. The requirement for a booster dose every 10 years was accordingly removed from the International Health Regulations in 2016. A shortcoming of this policy change is the scarcity of information on the effective duration of protective immunity elicited in vaccinated infants, even though this age group constitute the main vaccination target in yellow fever-endemic countries. We consulted reference documents prepared by WHO and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on yellow fever vaccination and the primary sources on the duration of yellow fever vaccine immunity surveyed from four review articles from 2013–16, including one meta-analysis and one systematic review. We also searched PubMed on May 18, 2018, with the expressions “yellow fever immunity” and “children” or “infants”, “yellow fever immunity” and “persistence”, and “yellow fever vaccine”, and did a reverse search on the Web of Science database, for articles citing three highly relevant research reports. We did not apply any language or date restrictions. Although the yellow fever vaccine can elicit lifelong immunity, studies in healthy adults have observed a time-dependent decrease in the proportion of seropositive individuals to 71–82% 10 years or more after vaccination, down from the proportion of more than 90% usually detected during the first year. Studies in non-endemic settings, where interference from circulating flaviviruses can be discounted, have reported a 30–40% decrease in vaccine-induced immunity 5–10 years after yellow fever vaccination. Infants, and children in general, exhibit a higher vaccine failure and lower immune responses after vaccination than adults, but previous studies on the outcome of yellow fever vaccination have focused mainly on adults or older children. Studies covering vaccinated infants have been limited to determining seroconversion 1–3 months after vaccination.</p>

   <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para80">We show a large decline in humoral immunity to yellow fever after 2–6 years in each group of children relative to earlier observations 4 weeks after vaccination. Proportions of seropositive children approximately halved, leaving large proportions of the study populations with a negative serostatus. These results address an important knowledge gap and are informative on the evolution of conferred immunity, in two different African settings endemic for yellow fever.</p>

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para100">Our findings argue for the one-dose-for-life guidelines to be reconsidered for individuals who receive yellow fever vaccination as infants. The long-term decline of humoral immunity suggests that a single dose of the vaccine, administered at 9 months of age, might not achieve a population immunity protective against yellow fever epidemics.</p>
