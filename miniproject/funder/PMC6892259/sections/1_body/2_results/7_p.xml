<p id="para270">By contrast, 27 seropositive children (22·3% of seropositive children in year 2·3) seroreverted in the year-6·0 data—ie, deteriorated to negative or bordeline serostatus. These children had markedly lower year-2·3 antibody concentrations than the serostable children (geometric mean 0·74 IU/mL [95% CI 0·67–0·83]

We consequently used 1·8 IU/mL as a tentative functional threshold to define a low and a high tier of seropositives. 27 (30%) of the 90 low-tier year-2·3 seropositives seroreverted at year 6·0 after vaccination, whereas an even larger proportion of year-2·3 borderline participants (24 [47%] of 51) deteriorated to negative serostatus (
