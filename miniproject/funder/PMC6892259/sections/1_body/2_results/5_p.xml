The distributions of measurable antibody concentrations (ie, those of broadly seropositive participants) in the Malian and the year-2·3 Ghanaian sera were similar, and we recorded the same median concentration (0·721 IU/mL), but we observed an excess of higher values in the Ghanaian relative to the Malian sera (
