<p id="Par72">The most likely phylogeographical scenario, supported by two independent analyses (ABC and RASP) is that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from the New World arrived in Asia ~150 years ago, coinciding with previous studies and the historic record [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, it is unclear if the species invaded the Black Sea region from Asia (Scenario 3; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, Structure plots in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) or BS originated directly from the New World (Scenario 2; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and assignment tests) since both ABC and RASP analyses retain a degree of uncertainty regarding the relationship of New World-Black Sea-Asia (see Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Specifically, in ABC analysis both scenarios (Scenario 2 and 3) are almost equally probable and in the RASP analysis there is a probability of 0.3 (compared with 0.5) for BS being ancestral to all Asian populations. Inferring the exact biogeographical relationships between these regions is challenging for two reasons: (i) the lack of the now extinct Mediterranean populations from our analyses in order to test if BS is a remnant of this population; and (ii) the difficulty in estimating the actual age of this population. As mentioned above (see Methods section) the transformation from generations to years depends on the number of generations per year, but we lack such estimates for the BS region or regions with similar climatic conditions. However, the BS is considerably cooler than tropical Africa and Americas, so the number of generations/year must be lower. This, combined with the fact that the estimated divergence time (in generations) indicated by the analysis is relatively broad (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2), prevents us from precise estimates. Here, we chose to present the mean time divergence estimates for BS as we did for all the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations studied, however, we note that given the limitations presented above, we cannot reject that the actual age of the BS population could exceed the ~100–150 years, which would allow the estimate to be consistent with historical epidemiological data.
