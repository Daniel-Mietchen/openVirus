<p id="Par69">Our population genetics analyses on the Black Sea populations using two types of genetic markers (12 microsatellites and ~19,000 SNPs) revealed relatively low differentiation between the populations within this region and subtle genetic structure (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5), which is expected considering the intense road traffic between Georgia and Turkey. Thus, we consider the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations of Turkey and Georgia as parts of a single Black Sea genetic unit that we will refer to as BS. Placing this genetic unit into the worldwide reference panel of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations, all analyses concluded that BS populations clearly belong to the subspecies 
 <italic>Aaa</italic> and are distantly related to African 
 <italic>Aaf</italic>. Within 
 <italic>Aaa</italic>, BS, Asia and New World are all equally genetically differentiated from each other,
