 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2), shortly after the Europeans arrived in the New World. The first appearance of established yellow fever and dengue in Europe were in Spain in 1801–1804 (while cases of yellow fever are reported in European ports prior to this time, annually repeated epidemics are documented for first time in early 1800s, indicating establishment of year-round breeding

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>; Scenario 5), the absence of data on Mediterranean populations prior to 1950 likely accounts for the lack of support for the hypothesis.
