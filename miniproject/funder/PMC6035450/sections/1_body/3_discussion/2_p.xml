 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] raise questions on the origin(s) and the approximate age of BS. It is well documented that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, although present in Europe during 1800s and 1900s, has been rarely recorded since the 1950s (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and references therein) due to a combination of factors (e.g. insecticides, improvements in sanitation). However, in recent years the species re-appeared in the periphery of Europe, with established populations reported in Madeira in 2004 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and in the Black Sea region (Russia and Georgia) in 2001 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The Madeira population is very likely a recent re-invasion, as suggested by previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The Madeira population shares mitochondrial alleles with South American populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], clusters together with South America and Asia in the microsatellites structure analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and falls within the South America-Caribbean and Asia clouds in our DAPC and PCA analyses (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S3 and S4). In contrast, BS is quite different in being equally and strongly genetically differentiated from both Asia and the New World (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
