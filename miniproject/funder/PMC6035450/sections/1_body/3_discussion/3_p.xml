<p id="Par71">If the Black Sea population is a recent invasion [occurring in 2001 (first record in Sochi area) or shortly before] it should have close genetic affinities with some other population(s) in the reference panel, as observed in several other cases of recent re-invasions around world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. As noted in the Results section, individual assignment tests of random individuals in our data set are re-assigned to their correct population of origin &gt; 98% of the time with SNP chip data. While BS shows genetic affinity with Asia (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), this relationship is in the context of broader biogeographical patterns and the evidence is not consistent with a recent invasion that occurred during the last 10–15 years from Asia (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S2-S4). On the contrary, the high genetic differentiation combined with assignment tests, and estimated divergence times (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2; on average ~950 generations back) support the hypothesis that the Black Sea is a remnant population that has existed in the region despite the apparent elimination of this species in the Mediterranean, and that remained cryptic until its detection in 2001. Bottleneck signatures found in this population are also consistent with the remnant hypothesis. Importantly, during the years after presumed eradication, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was sporadically reported in Turkey (in 1961, 1984, 1992, 1993 and 2001) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], suggesting that small populations of the species were maintained there after the 1950s, when it was reported eliminated from the Mediterranean. The relatively high genetic diversity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) in the Black Sea is consistent with this being an older population. However, the direct invasion source of the BS population is difficult to be found because (a) the gene flow between BS and modern Asian-North American populations may obscure the true pattern and (b) the population of origin could be a population not in our reference dataset (e.g. old Mediterranean populations or Russian population).
