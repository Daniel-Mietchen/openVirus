 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S4. Populations in the range of 
 <italic>Aaa</italic> that includes the Black Sea samples have significantly lower levels of allelic richness (AR) and observed heterozygosity (Ho) compared with 
 <italic>Aaf</italic> (Fig.

 <italic>χ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 14.035, 
 <italic>df</italic> = 4, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0072). Focusing only on 
 <italic>Aaa</italic>, the Black Sea region shows similar levels of Ho when compared with the other regions, but lower levels of AR compared to Asia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Private allelic richness (Np) for the full dataset (56 populations) was low (Np ≤ 0.09) in all cases with the exception of some African and Argentinean populations. Analysis of the Black Sea populations’ dataset (only Turkey and Georgia) revealed that the Np richness range between 0.09–0.17, but no private alleles were found in the Black Sea populations, relative to the populations of the New World or Asia. However, if we consider the region level instead of the population level, Black Sea has, on average, a small proportion of private alleles (Africa 2.36, New World 0.50, Asia 0.64, Pacific 0.11 and Black Sea 0.13).
