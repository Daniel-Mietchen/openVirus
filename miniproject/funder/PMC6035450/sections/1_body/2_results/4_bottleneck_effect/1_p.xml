<p id="Par65">Bottleneck analysis on the Black Sea samples provided evidence of a recent bottleneck in all four populations. Specifically, both tests (Wilcoxon and mode shift) and both models (TPM, SMM) showed significant (Wilcoxon test one tail for H excess

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.046) demographic changes for the Turkey-Hopa population, while for the other three populations (Turkey-Pazar, Georgia-inland, Georgia-coast) only Wilcoxon test and only the TPM model showed marginally significant (Wilcoxon test one tail for H excess 0.04 &lt;
