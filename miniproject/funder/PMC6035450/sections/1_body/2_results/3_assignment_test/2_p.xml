<p id="Par63">When using the worldwide reference panel, individuals from the Black Sea were assigned primarily to North American populations, with scores of 50% or higher, based on microsatellite data (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). A large number of individuals from the Turkish populations were assigned with the highest average assignment probability to New Orleans (America), closely followed by Ho Chi Minh (Asia) and Miami (America). New Orleans and Miami were also assigned a large number of individuals from the coast population in Georgia, based on highest average assignment probability, while individuals from the inland-Georgia population were assigned with high probabilities to Pakistan, Thailand, Brazil and Mexico (Additional file
