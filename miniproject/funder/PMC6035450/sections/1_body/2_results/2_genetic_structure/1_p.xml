<p id="Par59">Structure analyses on both datasets showed that the Black Sea populations are genetically distinct (Evanno method; 
 <italic>K</italic> = 2) from sub-Saharan 
 <italic>Aaf</italic>, clustering within 
 <italic>Aaa</italic> populations (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Subsequently, within 
 <italic>Aaa</italic>, Black Sea clusters first with Asia (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>) and then as a distinct group (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Structure analyses on the smaller datasets, normalizing the number of populations per region with those of the Black Sea region, confirmed that the Black Sea is of the 
 <italic>Aaa</italic> typeÂ (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1) and according to the Evanno et al. method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], forms a distinct group within this range (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2).
