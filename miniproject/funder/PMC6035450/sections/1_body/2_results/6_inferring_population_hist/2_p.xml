<p id="Par68">As mentioned above, Asia-Black Sea and South America-Caribbean are sister clades. RASP analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) supported that the ancestral area of these two major clades isÂ likely North America (probability 0.74). However, focusing on the ancestral area of the Asia-Black Sea region, there is a degree of uncertainty. The probability of Asia being the ancestral area is 0.53, compared to 0.34 for the Black Sea ancestral [the remaining 0.13 is either to be unknown (black proportion in the pie in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) or a continuous region (brown proportion in the pie) covering both Black Sea and Asia]. Thus the most likely scenario according to RASP (probability of 0.51), suggests that mosquitoes arrived in Asia from New World and then went to the Black Sea region through dispersal from Asia.
