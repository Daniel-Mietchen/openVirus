<p id="Par67">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows the scenarios tested for the diaspora of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Africa. The analysis indicated two scenarios with the highest Posterior Probability (PP); Scenario 3 (PP = 0.56) supporting that the species arrived in New World from Africa ~500 years ago, then from the New World invaded Asia ~150 years ago and later the Black Sea from Asia ~150–110 years ago (assuming 6–8 generations per year); and Scenario 2 (PP = 0.41) indicating that Asia and Black Sea may have been two independent invasions from the New World. Detailed information on the results of the demographic analysis is provided in Additional file
