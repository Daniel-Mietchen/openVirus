<p id="Par74">The use of two types of markers and several population genetics analyses revealed high genetic differentiation between the Black Sea population and an extensive reference panel of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations distributed worldwide. This high genetic differentiation combined with the mean approximate age estimated for this population of &gt; 100 years, signs of a bottleneck, and the sporadic reports regarding the presence of the species in Turkey after 1950s, support the hypothesis that the present populations in the Black Sea are recently expanded populations of small remnants that existed in the area long before its discovery in 2008. We could not definitively determine whether the Black Sea population is a remnant of old Mediterranean populations that has been hypothesized to be the invasion source of Asian populations, or is an independent introduction from Asia.
