 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> bears the official common name of “the yellow fever mosquito”, although today it is more feared as the major vector of viruses causing dengue, chikungunya and Zika fevers. There is little doubt that the origin of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is Africa. This is consistent with ecology, biogeography, genetics and historical records (for a review see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and references within). The ancestral form of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> still breeds in tropical forests in sub-Saharan Africa, where its larvae are found inside tree holes and females prefer non-human blood meals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At some point during its evolutionary history, this forest-breeding mosquito became adapted to human habitats, with larvae breeding in man-made containers and adult females favoring human blood meals. This “domesticated” form of the mosquito spread with man around the world to tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These two forms have been given subspecific names, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti formosus</italic> (
 <italic>Aaf</italic>) for the ancestral forest form and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti aegypti</italic> (
 <italic>Aaa</italic>) for the domestic form.
