<p id="Par37">Here we present genetic data (microsatellites and SNPs) on populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from Turkey and Georgia. We examine the genetic diversity and differentiation patterns among these populations and compare them with the known established populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> worldwide, with the goals of (i) determining whether present-day Black Sea populations are recent invasions or re-emergence of older cryptic populations; (ii) reconstructing the most probable biogeographical scenario for the invasion to the Black Sea region; and (iii) revealing the evolutionary relationships of the Black Sea populations with the known established populations in the New World, Asia and Africa.
