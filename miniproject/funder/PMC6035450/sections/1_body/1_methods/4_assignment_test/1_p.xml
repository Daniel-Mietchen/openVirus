<p id="Par49">To test the degree of assignment of any individual mosquito to a specific population of origin or geographical group, we used the program GeneClass2 v2.0 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Assignment tests were performed on both datasets using the Rannala &amp; Mountain criterion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the Monte Carlo resampling algorithm of Paetkau et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1000) for level of significance 0.05. Due to limitations on the number of loci that can be analyzed by the GeneClass2 software, five independent analyses were run using 4000 randomly selected SNPs. Self-assignment tests on the reference population panel resulted in 97.7% of the individuals correctly assigned to their population of origin.
