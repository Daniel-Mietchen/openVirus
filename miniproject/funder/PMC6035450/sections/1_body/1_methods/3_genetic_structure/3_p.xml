<p id="Par46">Both methods identify genetic clusters and assign individuals to clusters with no 
 <italic>a priori</italic> information of sampling location. For the STRUCTURE analysis the most likely number of clusters (
 <italic>K</italic>), was determined by conducting 20 independent runs for each 
 <italic>K</italic> = 1 to the maximum number of populations included in the analysis. Each run assumed an admixture model and independent allele frequencies (λ set to 1), using a burn-in value of 100,000 iterations followed by 500,000 repetitions. The optimal number of 
 <italic>K</italic> clusters was determined using the Δ
