<p id="Par47">Since there is increasing evidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] that STRUCTURE analysis is severely affected by uneven sampling, which could lead to wrong inferences on hierarchical structure, each population was represented by a random subsample of 34 individuals (or less if not available) in the microsatellite dataset and by 12 random individuals (or less if not available) in the SNP dataset, to match the sizes of the Black Sea samples (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Following the same reasoning and given that the Black Sea region is underrepresented (four populations) compared with the other geographical groups, we performed the genetic structure analyses of both the microsatellite and the SNPs datasets twice: (i) using all the populations available; and (ii) by randomly selecting (multiple times) four populations each from Africa, New World and Asia-Pacific regions. Results from the analyses of all datasets were summarized and plotted using the online version of CLUMPAK [
