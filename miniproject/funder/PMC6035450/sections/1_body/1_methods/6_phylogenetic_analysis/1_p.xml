<p id="Par52">To infer the evolutionary relationships among populations we used Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis, as implemented in RAxML [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], using 1000 bootstraps and the GTR model of evolution along with the CAT model of rate heterogeneity. For the runs we used the string “ASC” to apply an ascertainment bias correction to the likelihood calculations, and the standard correction by Lewis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] when only variant sites are included in the data set, as directed by the software’s manual. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the SNP dataset and randomly choosing two individuals per population (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The final dataset consisted of 62 individuals (including two 
 <italic>Aedes mascarensis</italic> individuals that served as outgroup and were genotyped for the same SNPs using the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> SNP-chip). Since a major assumption in the phylogenetic analyses is the neutrality of the loci under study, we identified outlier SNPs (q-values &lt; 0.05) using the 
 <italic>pcadapt</italic> package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] in R, which is based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and it does not require grouping individuals into populations. The SNPs identified as outliers were then filtered out to exclude SNPs that might be under selection. In total, 134 SNPs were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis as possibly being under selection. The final dataset after filtering to include only variant sites for this specific pruned dataset of 62 samples resulted in 19,092 SNPs that were used for the ML analysis.
