<p id="Par40">For both datasets, total DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer instructions, with an additional RNAse A (Qiagen) step. DNA samples were stored at -20 Â°C until further analysis. For the microsatellites dataset, individual mosquitoes were genotyped as described in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Microsatellite alleles were scored using GENEMAPPER version 4.0 (Applied Biosystems). The SNPs dataset included the 25,589 SNPs as they genotyped in the 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> SNP-Chip [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of Affymetrix. Briefly, genomic DNA (~200 ng per sample) was sent to the Functional Genomics Core at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, for hybridization and production of genotypes. The Affymetrix Genotyping Console and the R package SNPolisher v1.4 (both from Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used to generate and process genotype calls.
