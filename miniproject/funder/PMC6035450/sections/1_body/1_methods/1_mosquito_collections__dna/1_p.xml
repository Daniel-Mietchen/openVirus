<p id="Par38">Two different datasets of genetic markers were used in this study: (i) twelve previously published microsatellite loci [A1, B2, B3, A9 (tri-nucleotide repeats), and AC2, CT2, AG2, AC4, AC1, AC5, AG1, and AG4 (di-nucleotide repeats)] [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; and (ii) a panel of ~25,000 SNPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The complete microsatellite dataset consisted of 1795 individuals from 56 populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), while the SNP dataset consisted of 306 individuals from 30 populations (for details see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).
