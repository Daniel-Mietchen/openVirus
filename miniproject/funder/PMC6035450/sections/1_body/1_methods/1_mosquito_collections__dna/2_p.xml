<p id="Par39">The Black Sea region is represented by samples from Turkey and Georgia. Two locations were sampled from Turkey (~50 km apart) and three locations from Georgia (inland: 2 locations; 15 individuals in total; and coast: 23 individuals). Since the sample size of the two inland Georgia localities was small (6 and 9 individuals), the preliminary analysis indicated that they form one homogenous group with low differentiation among them, and due to their geographical proximity (within ~10 km), these samples were pooled and treated as a single population sample of 15 individuals labeled as Georgia-inland.</p>
