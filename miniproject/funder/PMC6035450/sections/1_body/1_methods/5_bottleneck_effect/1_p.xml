<p id="Par50">We tested for evidence of population bottleneck events using two methods, as implemented in BOTTLENECK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the first method, the distribution of the expected heterozygosity from the observed number of alleles is calculated for each population and locus, under the assumption of mutation-drift equilibrium; the second method is based on allele frequency distributions. The allele frequency distribution is expected to be approximately L-shaped under mutation-drift equilibrium, while a shift in this distribution is indicative of a recent bottleneck [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although the program provides results under three possible mutation models; the Infinite Allele Model (IAM), the Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM) and the two-phase mutation model (TPM), we took into account only the TPM and the SMM model, which perform better for microsatellites datasets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Simulation of heterozygosity at mutation-drift equilibrium distributions for the TPM model assumed 70% single-step mutations and 30% of multiple-step mutations. Significance was assessed using Wilcoxon’s signed rank test, as recommended for less than 20 markers.
