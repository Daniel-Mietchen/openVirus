<p id="Par42">Within-population deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were estimated using the exact HWE test in GENEPOP v.4.5.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The test was run with 10,000 dememorizations, 1,000 batches and 10,000 iterations per batch. Bonferroni correction (Î± = 0.05) was applied to the resulting matrix of HWE. Number of alleles, allelic frequencies, and average observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosities were estimated using GenAlEx [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Allelic richness (AR) and private allelic richness (Np) were calculated in HPRARE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] using rarefaction and assuming 30 genes. The non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test was used to test for significant differences on Ho and allelic richness between different groups of populations.
