<p id="Par53">Bayesian computation methods (ABC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] as implemented by DIYABC v.2.0.4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] were used to infer the population history of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the Black Sea. The ABC analysis was performed on the microsatellite dataset. We tested five scenarios to identify the origin of the Black Sea populations (Scenario 1: Black Sea originated from an admixed event between New World and Asia; Scenarios 2 and 5: New World origin; Scenario 3: Asian origin; and Scenario 4: African origin).
