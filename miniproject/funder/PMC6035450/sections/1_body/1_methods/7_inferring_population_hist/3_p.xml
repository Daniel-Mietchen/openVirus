<p id="Par55">We did not run a DiyABC analysis on the SNP dataset due to the possible SNP ascertainment bias introduced during the SNP-chip design (the chip was designed to capture representative variation across different regions of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) that could affect the inference of demographic history through its effect on the Allele Frequency Spectrum-AFS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Alternatively, we used the output of the ML analysis (see phylogenetic analysis section) to perform a Bayesian Binary MCMC (BBM) analysis on RASP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] to reconstruct the ancestral area distribution of the Black Sea populations. For the MCMC analysis we ran 10 chains of 50,000 cycles, we set the maximum number of areas to four and we did not take the distribution area of outgroup into account for the analysis.
