<p id="Par54">The best-fit scenario and confidence on the model of choice were evaluated using the DIYABC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Divergence times were estimated in generations and the priors setting (for details see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2) was based on the historical record information from previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Given that the number of generations per year for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is affected by the climatic conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], we collected climatic data (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldclim.com</ext-link>) for our Black Sea sampling localities and compared them with tropical and subtropical regions where 
 <italic>Aaa</italic> is established (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3). The transformation of divergence time from generations to years for Black Sea region is challenging since studies estimating the number of generations per year have been mainly conducted for tropical populations and it is usually assumed an average of 10 generations per year (for details see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]). However, considering that at least one quarter of the year the mean temperature in the Black Sea region is much lower than in other localities that established 
 <italic>Aaa</italic> populations occurred (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3), it is possible that in Black Sea less than 10 generations per year exist. Thus, for the time estimates regarding the Black Sea region we provide a range assuming 6–8 generations per year. A mutation rate ranging from 9 × 10
 <sup>-6</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>-5</sup> was used based on rates reported in the literature for other Diptera species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Details on the effective population size and split time between regions used as priors for the ABC analysis are provided in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2.
