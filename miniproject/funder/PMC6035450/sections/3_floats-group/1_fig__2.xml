  <p>Genetic diversity estimates based on the microsatellite dataset. Observed heterozygosity (
   <bold>a</bold>) and number of alleles per populations using rarefaction (
   <bold>b</bold>). Populations are grouped by region and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was implemented to test for differences between groups (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The groups that differ significantly areÂ indicated with matching symbols of different colors (asterisk or arrow tip) above the respective boxplot. The mean, standard deviation (SD) and the standard error (SE) are presented in each panel
