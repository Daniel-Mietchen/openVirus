 <caption>
  <p>STRUCTURE bar plots for all 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations in the microsatellite dataset. Two genetic clusters were supported using a representative set of populations from the entire distribution (
   <bold>a</bold>), while two (
   <bold>b</bold>) and four (
   <bold>c</bold>) clusters were supported focusing on the populations outside Africa. Population names are reported on the X axis. The Y axis reports the probability of each individual (Q-value) assigned to one of the genetic groups identified by STRUCTURE, which are represented by different colors. Each bar represents an individual. Individuals with 100% assignment to one group are identified by a single color. Individuals with mixed ancestry are represented by bars with different percentages of colors. The thick black lines within the plots indicate population limits. The bars on the top apply to all three plots.
