  <p>Evaluated evolutionary scenarios of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> invasion to the Black Sea region, using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) inference, as implemented by the DIYABC software. The time scale on the right of each scenario is the relative time, with t0 representing the present and increasing values going back in time. Numerical estimates of the generations associated with these times are in Additional file
