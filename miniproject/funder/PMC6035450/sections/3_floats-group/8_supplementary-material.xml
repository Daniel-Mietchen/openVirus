    <bold>Table S4.</bold> Genetic diversity. Summary of the population genetic diversity statistics for the 56 populations of 
    <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> consisting the microsatellite dataset. 
    <bold>Figure S1.</bold> STRUCTURE bar plots based on the microsatellite dataset, including equal number of populations from each region. Population names are reported on their X axes. For each STRUCTURE run only the number of genetic clusters supported by the Evanno method is presented. For details see legend of Fig.
