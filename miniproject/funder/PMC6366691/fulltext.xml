However, their relative roles will vary depending on the viruses and ecosystems involved. We combined field studies, phylogenetics and experimental infections to document with unprecedented detail the stages that precede initial outbreaks during viral emergence in nature. Using serological surveys we showed that in the absence of large-scale outbreaks, horses in Mongolia are routinely exposed to and infected by avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulating among wild birds. Some of those AIVs are genetically related to an avian-origin virus that caused an epizootic in horses in 1989. Experimental infections showed that most AIVs replicate in the equine respiratory tract without causing lesions, explaining the absence of outbreaks of disease. Our results show that AIVs infect horses but do not spread, or they infect and spread but do not cause disease. Thus, the failure of AIVs to evolve greater transmissibility and to cause disease in horses is in this case the main barrier preventing disease emergence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Viral diseases pose a constant threat to humans and animals. Occasionally, viruses establish in new hosts, sometimes with devastating consequences. While we still do not know what allows a virus to infect and become transmissible in a new population, it is clear that ecology and evolution play an important part in this process. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) constitute the archetypical example of emerging viruses: their main natural reservoir is in wild birds but they have also established in humans, pigs and horses. To better understand how IAVs circulate in nature we sequenced over twenty avian influenza viruses collected from wild birds in Mongolia. We show that these viruses are partially related to a virus that caused an equine influenza epizootic in 1989, that they can infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse without causing any tissue damage, and that -based on serological evidence- horses in Mongolia have been regularly exposed to them over a broad geographical area without causing clinically evident outbreaks. We conclude that equine infections by avian viruses able to replicate in horses are more common than originally thought and that the failure to acquire key genetic changes is in this case the main barrier to disease emergence.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12014/9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4352-394X</contrib-id><name><surname>Murcia</surname><given-names>Pablo R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contract HHSN266200700007C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9930-4383</contrib-id><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001280</institution-id><institution>Horserace Betting Levy Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>779</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4352-394X</contrib-id><name><surname>Murcia</surname><given-names>Pablo R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Support for this project was provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services (Contract HHSN266200700007C).

Viral emergence causing an epidemic of disease in a new host is a rare event, despite the wide diversity of viruses that are known to exist [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and the constant exposure of hosts to viruses that circulate in other species that share the same habitat. Multiple virus introductions may precede large-scale epidemics, as was seen in the cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses leading to the epidemic spread of the human immunodeficiency virus groups O, N, and P, with only the group M viruses becoming pandemic [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Transmission of H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) to dogs has been reported in Australia [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the United Kingdom [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and United States of America [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but only in the latter did the canine influenza virus (CIV) emerge and become established as a novel pathogen of dogs, in which it has been circulating for over 15 years. In contrast, and despite hundreds of human zoonotic infections being reported for H5N1 avian influenza virus (AIV), this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit among humans [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The apparently low proportion of successful cross-species jumps could be explained by the actions of ecological, genetic and immunological barriers barriers. For example, the transmitted pathogens often lack key (but poorly understood) phenotypic features required to undergo efficient transmission, and the structure of the recipient host population may not provide sufficient contacts between infected and susceptible individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Viral emergence could also be impaired in the presence of ample ecological opportunities if mutations required to adapt to a new host are difficult to acquire or have a high fitness cost in the donor or recipient host [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Indeed, even in the presence of the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; ecological and evolutionary factors, influenza virus emergence could be impaired by hemagglutinin imprinting, a biological process by which the first IAV infection of an individual confers lifelong cross-protection against severe infection by viruses carrying an HA of the same phylogenetic group [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that favor or impede viral emergence requires the study of spillover events and the so-called &#x0201c;stuttering chains of transmission that lead to the evolution of increased transmissibility&#x0201d; that have been suggested to form the initial stages of viral emergence [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To cause outbreaks, spillovers therefore likely require favorable combinations of donor and recipient host ecology leading to exposure; viral-host combinations required for infection; and evolution allowing successful adaptation for increased infection and transmission within the recipient host population. Understanding the relationships between spillover events and emerging outbreaks requires longitudinal monitoring of exposures. While phylogenetics enables to link viral changes with host range shifts, experiments are generally required to understand whether certain mutations that arise during viral emergence cause host adaptations (so-called &#x0201c;gain of function&#x0201d; mutations).</p><p>Wild aquatic birds are the main natural reservoirs of most influenza A viruses (IAVs) subtypes. Migratory birds are key for viral spread over long distances, where the viral lineages are often found to be associated with the different flyways, which also favor the generation and maintenance of IAV diversity [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. H3 AIVs are highly prevalent in wild birds, being found in birds from many different genera across multiple continents [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and different viruses with the H3N8 glycoprotein combination appear to be particularly prone to transfer into new hosts, having caused outbreaks or epidemics in horses, dogs, pigs, camels and harbor seals [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this work was to examine interspecies transmission of H3 AIVs to horses in Mongolia, and to determine the relative contribution of ecological and evolutionary processes that precede, and which might lead to viral emergence. Horses are a suitable species to study the biological processes that underpin the transfer, adaptation and establishment of IAVs in mammals: they have supported at least four major IAV epidemics, including a virus of unknown serotype around 1872, an H7N7 that emerged in Czechoslovakia in 1956 and died out in the 1970s [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and two phylogenetically distinct H3N8 viruses. The first one emerged in 1963, became endemic in horse populations and still circulates in most countries [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The second one caused a large epizootic in Jilin, China, in 1989 and circulated in horses for only a couple of years before dying out [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While the direct ancestors of the equine viruses have not been identified, phylogenetic studies of the three known viruses indicate that they likely arose from direct transfer from avian hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Mongolia possesses favorable ecological features for influenza emergence in horses: it contains a large horse population (~3.3 million) [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and sizable numbers of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

To this end, we combined surveillance and sequencing of viruses from wild birds to allow phylogenetic analysis of a large number of influenza virus genomes, and also performed prospective and retrospective seroepidemiological analysis of horses from Mongolia (and the United Kingdom as a control population) to identify ecological factors associated with AIV interspecies transmission. We isolated and sequenced EIVs from Mongolian horses to determine whether AIV-like viruses were present.

We inferred phylogenetic trees for each genomic segment from multiple sequence alignments that represented ~21,300 IAV genomes obtained from publicly available databases.

This is a highly specific process that includes multiple steps including receptor binding, virus entry, gene expression, genome replication, virus assembly, and release of infectious virus that transmits to new individuals of that host species. In alternative hosts, species barriers impede infection by novel viruses, presumably by blocking one or more of those steps. To test whether AIVs isolated from wild birds in Mongolia could infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse, we inoculated horse tracheal explants with the same AIVs used in our serological survey, as well as with a classical H3N8 EIV isolate (A/equine/South Africa/2003). We monitored infected explants for five days. This timeframe was used because in natural infection horses start showing symptoms and shedding virus as early as 24 hours post-infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and histopathological lesions are evident at 48 hours post-infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>With the exception of AIV/2106 all H3N8 AIVs tested were able to infect and replicate in the horse trachea, but they replicated to lower levels than EIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). A clear difference between AIVs and EIV was observed when histopathological changes were assessed. EIV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g007">Fig 7H</xref>) caused evident lesions including loss of ciliated epithelium, squamous metaplasia, necrosis, apoptosis and reduction of goblet cells similar to those observed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, explants infected with AIVs did not exhibit any evident microscopic lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g007">Fig 7C to 7G</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that some H3N8 AIVs circulating in wild birds in Central Asia have the necessary attributes to successfully infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse, but that they lack the properties necessary to cause tissue damage in the horse trachea.</p><fig id="ppat.1007531.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007531.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Infection phenotype of equine and avian influenza viruses in horse trachea.</title><p>A.

As a result, viral emergence can be influenced across different scales: from molecular interactions between virus and host proteins or glycan receptors, to ecosystem landscapes that determine the geographical distribution and contact rates between donor and recipient species [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Multidisciplinary studies that combine field, phylogenetic and experimental approaches are essential to understand how viruses infect and spread in new host populations.</p><p>The transfer of IAVs to new hosts is relatively rare and appears to occur on only a limited number of mammalian hosts, including humans, swine, seals, horses and dogs, as well as poultry. In many other cases influenza viruses are seen to spill over to cause individual infections in a new host with limited capacity for transmission in the new host&#x02013;as is seen for H5N1, H7N9 and H10N8 IAVs to name a few [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Here we documented with great detail the frequent exposure of horses to AIVs that are genetically close to EIV/Jilin/89. This is consistent with repeated spillover infections by viruses near a genotype that caused an epidemic in the past and thus had an R<sub>0</sub>&#x0003e;1. As horses are clearly permissive hosts for some IAVs, their study provides opportunities to ask fundamental questions about viral emergence that can lead to new insights into the processes that are associated with virus spillovers and emergence.</p><p>A proportion of the circulating AIVs in birds carry some mutations that have been shown to be associated with mammalian adaptation. While this observation implies that some AIVs are closer to an equine genotype, adaptation might require epistatic interactions that could be specific (and different) for EIV/Jilin and Classical EIV. In addition, some AIVs efficiently infected the equine respiratory tract in culture, suggesting that they can successfully infect horses&#x02013;which is supported by the finding of antibodies against those viruses in 10&#x02013;30% of the horses sampled in Mongolia.</p><p>Why have large outbreaks of disease caused by avian-origin influenza viruses not occurred in horses in Central Asia over the last 25 years? Different scenarios could explain this situation and the data presented here does not favor any particular one. In the first scenario, it is likely that AIVs circulating in wild birds are not genetically adapted to transmit among horses. This is supported by the presence of some but not all of the mutations that are shared between the two H3N8 epizootic viruses (<xref rid="ppat.1007531.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition, all AIVs examined harbored three genomic segments (PB2, PB1 and NP) that were distantly related to EIV/Jilin/89, and in other cases of viral emergence in new hosts, mutations in those segments control virus replication and transmission [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While our results suggest that there is an "emergence ready" genotype (EIV/Jilin/89) in the genetic neighborhood of the AIV strains circulating in Mongolia, we do not know how many mutations will be required for a new EIV to emerge. Experiments that are beyond the scope of this work -such as site directed mutagenesis or serial passaging of AIVs in equine cells- will be required to answer this question.</p><p>A second possible scenario is that AIVs are being transmitted from horse to horse (albeit not very efficiently) and the circulating viruses are undetected. This is supported by the lower seroprevalence of AIVs when compared to EIV and by the absence of lesions observed in our experimental infections, which suggest that infected animals might not display clinical disease. If this were the case, we may be observing low levels of transmission that are the preceding stages of influenza emergence and one of the viruses may evolve to become more transmissible in horses by gaining adaptive mutations [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Experimental transmission experiments could help to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p>A third possibility that should be considered is cross-protective immunity resulting from hemagglutinin imprinting [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since 1974 there have been five EIV epizootics documented in Mongolia: 1974&#x02013;1975, 1983&#x02013;1984, 1993&#x02013;1994, 2007&#x02013;2008, and 2011 [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As vaccination coverage in the country is seemingly very low [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it can be reasonably assumed that most seropositive horses have acquired EIV immunity by natural infection, which is known to induce a potent immunological response. Since all AIVs studied here possess the same subtype as EIV (H3), the high seroprevalence of the latter could provide enough pre-existing immunity against H3 AIVs, thus acting as an effective barrier against AIV emergence in horses. While this seems counterintuitive as we showed that EIV does not cross react with H3 AIVs in HI assays, it has been shown that even viruses possessing different HA subtypes can elicit cross-protective immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>How could avian-origin influenza viruses emerge in horses? They may evolve higher transmissibility through acquisition of point mutations. The likelihood of viral emergence through this process will depend on the number of mutations that separate the viral replication and transmission fitness peaks in the donor and the recipient species [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results suggest that the evolutionary landscape that H3N8 AIVs would have to traverse to emerge in horses might not be particularly steep as they can already infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g005">Fig 5</xref>), as has happened on at least two occasions in the past. Since there is continuous spillover occurring and the IAVs that we sequenced already harbor putative adaptive mutations this seems a likely scenario (<xref rid="ppat.1007531.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, or in addition, the IAVs may acquire the &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; genomic constellation by reassortment either in birds or in horses. While reassortment in birds frequently occurs, it seems unlikely to give rise to equine infecting viruses given the seemingly random distribution of genome constellations present in wild birds [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the likely selective pressure for avian -rather than equine- adapting viruses. Emergence of novel EIVs via reassortment in horses seems more probable, particularly since we observed that horses as young as two years old are being infected by both avian and equine viruses, opening up the possibility of coinfections. Also, selection pressures for equine-adapted viruses are more likely to occur in horses. Future experiments using AIV/EIV reassortant viruses generated by reverse genetics will address this issue.</p><p>It should be noted that we sequenced 13 viruses isolated from horses during outbreaks of equine influenza and did not detect any avian-like viruses, nor any AIV-EIV reassortant virus. However, our dataset shows that an H9N2 avian-like influenza virus was isolated from horses in 2011 in Guanxi, China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Including this event, there have been four reported independent introductions of AIV in horses, three of which led to EIV emergence (i.e. H7N7 in 1956 [Prague], H3N8 in 1963 [Miami], and H3N8 in 1989 [Jilin]). In addition, a previous study reported an outbreak of H5N1 influenza virus in donkeys living in close proximity with H5N1-infected poultry in Egypt in 2009 [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As horses and donkeys are closely related, it is feasible to think that H5N1 AIVs might infect horses. Animal management measures should be considered in H5 endemic areas where horses and poultry are in close contact.</p><p>In sum, our results advance our understanding of what it takes to allow IAVs to emerge successfully in a mammalian host. We identified a geographical &#x0201c;hotspot&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] for viral cross-switching where future large-scale disease outbreaks appear to depend on evolutionary factors. Surveillance efforts should be directed to monitor for the presence of horse adaptive mutations in viruses derived from birds and on additional serological surveys to determine exposure levels in horses. Our results also show that horses are susceptible to infection by some AIVs, but that they likely display effective species barriers that prevent the establishment of novel IAVs. Future studies aiming at understanding those blocks to cross-species transmission using avian and equine influenza viruses will provide insight on the mechanisms and determinants that underpin influenza emergence in mammals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Sampling and virus isolation</title><p>Avian influenza viruses were obtained during surveillance studies carried out in Mongolia [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Sera that inhibited hemagglutination at a dilution &#x02265; 1:40 were considered positive. Horse antisera that tested positive to AIVs were further tested using microneutralisation assays as described in [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We used the Prevalence package in R (version 3.2.2) to calculate seroprevalences including confidence intervals using the Agresti-Coull interval with 0.95 confidence. Maps were generated in R using the Maps package to plot sampling sites. The serology heatmap and UpSet plot were generated in R using the ggplot2 and UpSetR packages, respectively. Data used in the heat map was manually ordered based on serological profiles, and HI values transformed to dilution factors. For the UpSet plot, data was converted to a binary matrix (i.e. positive or negative).</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Explant preparation, infection, processing and virus titration</title><p>Horse tracheas were aseptically collected upon euthanasia from healthy Welsh Mountain ponies and prepared as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

Embryonated eggs (9&#x02013;12 days old) were sourced from the State Central Veterinary Laboratory's farm, where they are specifically produced for virus isolation. For this reason no ethics is required by SCVL. In addition, as embryos were killed before the start of the final third of the incubation period, our virus isolation protocol is not considered a regulated procedure under the UK's Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986. Our study protocols adhered to the UK's Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986 or to any nationally or internationally recognized guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1007531.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic relationship of the MP genes derived from AIVs isolated from wild birds in Mongolia between 2009 and 2011.</title><p>Maximum likelihood tree using a sequence dataset comprising 860 IAV sequences representing 21,277 IAV genomes.
