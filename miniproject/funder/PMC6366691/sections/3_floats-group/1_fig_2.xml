  <title>Phylogenetic relationship of viruses within the H3 lineage.</title>
  <p>EIV/Jilin/89 is marked in the phylogeny with a red circle, AIVs isolated in Mongolia (AIVs/2009-11) are indicated with blue and green circles (the latter represent the isolates used in HA assays) and the currently circulating H3N8 EIV lineage (“Classical EIV”) is indicated with a red box. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. Bootstrap values are indicated next to the relevant nodes.</p>
