  <title>Phylogenetic relationship of AIVs isolated from wild birds in Mongolia between 2009 and 2011.</title>
  <p>Maximum likelihood tree using a sequence dataset comprising 860 HA IAV sequences representing 21,277 IAV genomes. Colored triangles represent lineages that correspond to individual HA subtypes as indicated. The H3N8 and H7N7 EIV lineages are indicated with green and red circles, respectively. Bootstrap values are indicated next to relevant nodes. Scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site.</p>
