  <title>Phylogenetic relationship of the NA genes of AIVs isolated from wild birds in Mongolia between 2009 and 2011.</title>
  <p>Maximum likelihood tree using a sequence dataset comprising 859 IAV sequences representing 21,276 IAV genomes. Colored triangles represent lineages that correspond to individual NA subtypes as indicated. AIVs isolated in Mongolia (AIVs/2009-11) are indicated with blue and green circles (the latter represent the isolates used in HA assays) and the currently circulating H3N8 EIV lineage (“Classical EIV”) is indicated with a red box. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. Bootstrap values are indicated next to relevant nodes.</p>
