  <p>A. Phylogenetic relationship of the PA genes derived from AIVs isolated from wild birds in Mongolia between 2009 and 2011. Maximum likelihood tree using a sequence dataset comprising 860 IAV sequences representing 21,277 IAV genomes. EIV/Jilin/89 is marked in the phylogeny with a red circle, AIVs isolated in Mongolia (AIVs/2009-11) are indicated with blue and green circles (the latter represent the isolates used in HA assays) and the currently circulating H3N8 EIV lineage (“Classical EIV”) is indicated with a red box. Some branches have been collapsed and appear as triangles for clarity. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. Bootstrap values are indicated next to relevant nodes.</p>
