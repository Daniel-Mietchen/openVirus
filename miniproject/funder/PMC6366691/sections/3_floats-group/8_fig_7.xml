  <title>Infection phenotype of equine and avian influenza viruses in horse trachea.</title>
  <p>A. Growth kinetics of the indicated viruses in horse tracheal explants. Vertical bars represent average titers from three experiments. Dotted line indicates the titer of the inoculum used to infect the explants. B. Light micrographs of an H/E stained section of an uninfected horse tracheal explant. C to H. Light micrographs of H/E stained sections showing explants infected with EIV and indicated AIVs. Ciliated epithelium (C.E), goblet cell (G.C) and squamous metaplasia (S.M) are indicated with arrows. Images magnification: 400X.</p>
