<p>Mongolia possesses favorable ecological features for influenza emergence in horses: it contains a large horse population (~3.3 million) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The country lies at the intersection of two major migratory flyways, hosting migrants from as far as the Indian Subcontinent and Australasia that arrive in the spring to breed or pass through to nesting areas further north. From mid-summer large congregations of Anseriformes gather in Mongolia to molt, before returning south in the autumn. Finally, H3N8 EIVs and AIVs co-circulate in Mongolia [
