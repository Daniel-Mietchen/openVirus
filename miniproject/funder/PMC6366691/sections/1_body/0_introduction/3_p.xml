<p>Wild aquatic birds are the main natural reservoirs of most influenza A viruses (IAVs) subtypes. Migratory birds are key for viral spread over long distances, where the viral lineages are often found to be associated with the different flyways, which also favor the generation and maintenance of IAV diversity [
