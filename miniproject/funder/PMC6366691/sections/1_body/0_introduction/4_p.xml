<p>The objective of this work was to examine interspecies transmission of H3 AIVs to horses in Mongolia, and to determine the relative contribution of ecological and evolutionary processes that precede, and which might lead to viral emergence. Horses are a suitable species to study the biological processes that underpin the transfer, adaptation and establishment of IAVs in mammals: they have supported at least four major IAV epidemics, including a virus of unknown serotype around 1872, an H7N7 that emerged in Czechoslovakia in 1956 and died out in the 1970s [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While the direct ancestors of the equine viruses have not been identified, phylogenetic studies of the three known viruses indicate that they likely arose from direct transfer from avian hosts [
