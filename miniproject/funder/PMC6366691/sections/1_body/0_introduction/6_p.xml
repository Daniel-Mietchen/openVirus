<p>Here we examined through phylogenetic, serological and experimental approaches the ecological and evolutionary factors mediating viral emergence. To this end, we combined surveillance and sequencing of viruses from wild birds to allow phylogenetic analysis of a large number of influenza virus genomes, and also performed prospective and retrospective seroepidemiological analysis of horses from Mongolia (and the United Kingdom as a control population) to identify ecological factors associated with AIV interspecies transmission. We isolated and sequenced EIVs from Mongolian horses to determine whether AIV-like viruses were present. We also carried out experimental infections of equine tracheal explants with Mongolian AIVs to determine whether the viruses were able to infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse.</p>
