<p>Understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that favor or impede viral emergence requires the study of spillover events and the so-called “stuttering chains of transmission that lead to the evolution of increased transmissibility” that have been suggested to form the initial stages of viral emergence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To cause outbreaks, spillovers therefore likely require favorable combinations of donor and recipient host ecology leading to exposure; viral-host combinations required for infection; and evolution allowing successful adaptation for increased infection and transmission within the recipient host population. Understanding the relationships between spillover events and emerging outbreaks requires longitudinal monitoring of exposures. While phylogenetics enables to link viral changes with host range shifts, experiments are generally required to understand whether certain mutations that arise during viral emergence cause host adaptations (so-called “gain of function” mutations).
