<p>Viral emergence requires efficient replication of the virus in cells and tissues of the novel host. This is a highly specific process that includes multiple steps including receptor binding, virus entry, gene expression, genome replication, virus assembly, and release of infectious virus that transmits to new individuals of that host species. In alternative hosts, species barriers impede infection by novel viruses, presumably by blocking one or more of those steps. To test whether AIVs isolated from wild birds in Mongolia could infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse, we inoculated horse tracheal explants with the same AIVs used in our serological survey, as well as with a classical H3N8 EIV isolate (A/equine/South Africa/2003). We monitored infected explants for five days. This timeframe was used because in natural infection horses start showing symptoms and shedding virus as early as 24 hours post-infection [
