<p>With the exception of AIV/2106 all H3N8 AIVs tested were able to infect and replicate in the horse trachea, but they replicated to lower levels than EIV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). A clear difference between AIVs and EIV was observed when histopathological changes were assessed. EIV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g007">Fig 7H</xref>) caused evident lesions including loss of ciliated epithelium, squamous metaplasia, necrosis, apoptosis and reduction of goblet cells similar to those observed

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g007">Fig 7C to 7G</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that some H3N8 AIVs circulating in wild birds in Central Asia have the necessary attributes to successfully infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse, but that they lack the properties necessary to cause tissue damage in the horse trachea.
