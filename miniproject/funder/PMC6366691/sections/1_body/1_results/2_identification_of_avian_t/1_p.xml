<p>To identify amino acid mutations in AIVs that might play a role in horse adaptation we used a site-wise non-homogeneous phylogenetic model developed by Tamuri et al. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which takes into account the phylogenetic relationships between the viruses. This method identified 17 mutations (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) distributed in six of the eight IAV genomic segments. Notably, 15 of those amino acids were present in both the AIVs we sampled in Mongolia and an H3N8 equine virus (either Jilin/89 or what we called the classical EIV lineage). Further, two amino acid changes (D701N in PB2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and S345N in NP [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) have been shown to mediate mammalian adaptation of avian viruses. These results suggest that AIVs circulating in Mongolia already harbor some, but not all the mutations that might be required for successful interspecies transmission and emergence in horses.
