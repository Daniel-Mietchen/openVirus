<p>Longitudinal surveillance studies carried out in wild birds in Mongolia between 2008 and 2012 indicate that H3 AIVs are highly prevalent [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As H3N8 AIVs have emerged in horses in two independent occasions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we isolated and sequenced the genomes of 22 H3 AIVs (including 17 H3N8 viruses) collected from wild birds in Mongolia between 2009 and 2011 to determine whether they were phylogenetically related to EIVs (

We inferred phylogenetic trees for each genomic segment from multiple sequence alignments that represented ~21,300 IAV genomes obtained from publicly available databases. Interestingly, the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of all Mongolian AIV isolates were closely related to A/equine/Jilin/89 (referred to as EIV/Jilin/89, Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g002">2</xref>), an avian-origin influenza virus that caused a large epidemic of respiratory disease in horses in 1989 and in the early 1990s [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of individual gene segments showed that the neuraminidase (NA, Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007531.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) genes of 11 of the 22 Mongolian AIVs clustered together with high support with EIV/Jilin/89. Further, the polymerase acidic gene (PA) of AIV/963 was also very closely related with that of EIV/Jilin/89 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007531.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), while the non-structural gene (NS) of 19 of the AIVs showed a relatively close phylogenetic relationship with EIV/Jilin/89 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007531.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the polymerase basic 2 (PB2), polymerase basic 1 (PB1) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007531.s004">S4</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007531.s006">S6</xref> Figs) of all AIVs sequenced exhibited a distant phylogenetic relationship with EIV/Jilin/89. These results indicate that AIVs bearing several genes closely related to EIV/Jilin/89 were still circulating in wild birds in Mongolia between 2009 and 2011.
