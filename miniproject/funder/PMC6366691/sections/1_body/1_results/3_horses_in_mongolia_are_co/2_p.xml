<p>As EIV is endemic in Mongolia and all the AIVs that we collected in Mongolia are of the same HA subtype (H3) we sought to rule out any cross reactivity between them to avoid false positive results. We thus determined if there was cross-reactivity between H3N8 EIV and the AIVs under study. To this end, we carried out HI assays using the aforementioned avian viruses together with an H3N8 EIV, against a set of antisera from convalescent horses that were known to have been infected with H3N8 EIVs in the US and which were unlikely to have been exposed to AIVs circulating in Mongolia. 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that there was no cross-reactivity between AIVs and EIVs.
