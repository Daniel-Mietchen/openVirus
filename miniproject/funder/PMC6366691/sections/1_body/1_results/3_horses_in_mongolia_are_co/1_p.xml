 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), so we examined whether horses had been exposed to and infected by AIVs. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were conducted on sera that had been collected from horses during outbreaks of equine influenza that took place in 2007â€“8 and 2011, as well as on sera collected from healthy horses during routine surveillance in July 2012. Samples were collected from various geographical locations across Mongolia (
