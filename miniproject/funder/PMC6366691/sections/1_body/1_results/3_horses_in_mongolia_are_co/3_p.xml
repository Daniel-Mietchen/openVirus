<p>In the HAI tests we observed a relatively high proportion of AIV-seropositive horses each year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The lowest proportion was observed in 2012 (~0.13, Agresti-Coull interval = 0.1–0.16), while the highest was observed in 2011 (0.32, Agresti-Coull interval = 0.2–0.48). Of note, of the 97 horses that were seropositive to AIVs, 18 were negative to EIV indicating exposure to avian but not equine influenza viruses. Age information was only obtained from horses sampled in 2012. From this group, 41 horses were seropositive for both AIVs and EIV and the median age of those animals was three years, indicating that exposure to both viruses occurred over a relatively short time period. We observed a significantly higher proportion of EIV seropositive animals in all years compared to AIV (p = 0.05, two-sample z-test), consistent with EIV being endemic in Mongolia. It should be noted that an EIV vaccine is available. However, as it is very rarely used, we assumed that our serology results reflect natural infections. Results on individual testing for each animal are available in
