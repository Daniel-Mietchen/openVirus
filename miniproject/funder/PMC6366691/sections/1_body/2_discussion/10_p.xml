<p>It should be noted that we sequenced 13 viruses isolated from horses during outbreaks of equine influenza and did not detect any avian-like viruses, nor any AIV-EIV reassortant virus. However, our dataset shows that an H9N2 avian-like influenza virus was isolated from horses in 2011 in Guanxi, China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Including this event, there have been four reported independent introductions of AIV in horses, three of which led to EIV emergence (i.e. H7N7 in 1956 [Prague], H3N8 in 1963 [Miami], and H3N8 in 1989 [Jilin]). In addition, a previous study reported an outbreak of H5N1 influenza virus in donkeys living in close proximity with H5N1-infected poultry in Egypt in 2009 [
