<p>The emergence of epidemic viruses is a rare event that requires both exposure of the new host, as well as the correct properties of the virus to allow efficient onward transmission among individuals of the new host species. As a result, viral emergence can be influenced across different scales: from molecular interactions between virus and host proteins or glycan receptors, to ecosystem landscapes that determine the geographical distribution and contact rates between donor and recipient species [
