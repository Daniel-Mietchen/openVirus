<p>Alternatively, or in addition, the IAVs may acquire the “right” genomic constellation by reassortment either in birds or in horses. While reassortment in birds frequently occurs, it seems unlikely to give rise to equine infecting viruses given the seemingly random distribution of genome constellations present in wild birds [

Emergence of novel EIVs via reassortment in horses seems more probable, particularly since we observed that horses as young as two years old are being infected by both avian and equine viruses, opening up the possibility of coinfections. Also, selection pressures for equine-adapted viruses are more likely to occur in horses. Future experiments using AIV/EIV reassortant viruses generated by reverse genetics will address this issue.
