<p>How could avian-origin influenza viruses emerge in horses? They may evolve higher transmissibility through acquisition of point mutations. The likelihood of viral emergence through this process will depend on the number of mutations that separate the viral replication and transmission fitness peaks in the donor and the recipient species [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results suggest that the evolutionary landscape that H3N8 AIVs would have to traverse to emerge in horses might not be particularly steep as they can already infect and replicate in the respiratory tract of the horse (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007531.g005">Fig 5</xref>), as has happened on at least two occasions in the past. Since there is continuous spillover occurring and the IAVs that we sequenced already harbor putative adaptive mutations this seems a likely scenario (
