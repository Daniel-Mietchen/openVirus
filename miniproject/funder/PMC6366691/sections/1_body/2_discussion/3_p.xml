<p>Here we documented with great detail the frequent exposure of horses to AIVs that are genetically close to EIV/Jilin/89. This is consistent with repeated spillover infections by viruses near a genotype that caused an epidemic in the past and thus had an R
 <sub>0</sub>&gt;1. As horses are clearly permissive hosts for some IAVs, their study provides opportunities to ask fundamental questions about viral emergence that can lead to new insights into the processes that are associated with virus spillovers and emergence.
