<p>A proportion of the circulating AIVs in birds carry some mutations that have been shown to be associated with mammalian adaptation. While this observation implies that some AIVs are closer to an equine genotype, adaptation might require epistatic interactions that could be specific (and different) for EIV/Jilin and Classical EIV. In addition, some AIVs efficiently infected the equine respiratory tract in culture, suggesting that they can successfully infect horses–which is supported by the finding of antibodies against those viruses in 10–30% of the horses sampled in Mongolia.</p>
