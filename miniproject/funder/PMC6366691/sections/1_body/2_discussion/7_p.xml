<p>A third possibility that should be considered is cross-protective immunity resulting from hemagglutinin imprinting [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it can be reasonably assumed that most seropositive horses have acquired EIV immunity by natural infection, which is known to induce a potent immunological response. Since all AIVs studied here possess the same subtype as EIV (H3), the high seroprevalence of the latter could provide enough pre-existing immunity against H3 AIVs, thus acting as an effective barrier against AIV emergence in horses. While this seems counterintuitive as we showed that EIV does not cross react with H3 AIVs in HI assays, it has been shown that even viruses possessing different HA subtypes can elicit cross-protective immunity [
