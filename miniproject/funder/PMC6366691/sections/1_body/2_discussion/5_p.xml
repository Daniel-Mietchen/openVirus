<p>Why have large outbreaks of disease caused by avian-origin influenza viruses not occurred in horses in Central Asia over the last 25 years? Different scenarios could explain this situation and the data presented here does not favor any particular one. In the first scenario, it is likely that AIVs circulating in wild birds are not genetically adapted to transmit among horses. This is supported by the presence of some but not all of the mutations that are shared between the two H3N8 epizootic viruses (

In addition, all AIVs examined harbored three genomic segments (PB2, PB1 and NP) that were distantly related to EIV/Jilin/89, and in other cases of viral emergence in new hosts, mutations in those segments control virus replication and transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While our results suggest that there is an "emergence ready" genotype (EIV/Jilin/89) in the genetic neighborhood of the AIV strains circulating in Mongolia, we do not know how many mutations will be required for a new EIV to emerge. Experiments that are beyond the scope of this work -such as site directed mutagenesis or serial passaging of AIVs in equine cells- will be required to answer this question.
