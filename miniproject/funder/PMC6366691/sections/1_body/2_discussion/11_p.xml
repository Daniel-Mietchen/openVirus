<p>In sum, our results advance our understanding of what it takes to allow IAVs to emerge successfully in a mammalian host. We identified a geographical “hotspot” [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] for viral cross-switching where future large-scale disease outbreaks appear to depend on evolutionary factors. Surveillance efforts should be directed to monitor for the presence of horse adaptive mutations in viruses derived from birds and on additional serological surveys to determine exposure levels in horses. Our results also show that horses are susceptible to infection by some AIVs, but that they likely display effective species barriers that prevent the establishment of novel IAVs. Future studies aiming at understanding those blocks to cross-species transmission using avian and equine influenza viruses will provide insight on the mechanisms and determinants that underpin influenza emergence in mammals.
