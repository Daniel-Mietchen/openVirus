<p>A second possible scenario is that AIVs are being transmitted from horse to horse (albeit not very efficiently) and the circulating viruses are undetected. This is supported by the lower seroprevalence of AIVs when compared to EIV and by the absence of lesions observed in our experimental infections, which suggest that infected animals might not display clinical disease. If this were the case, we may be observing low levels of transmission that are the preceding stages of influenza emergence and one of the viruses may evolve to become more transmissible in horses by gaining adaptive mutations [
