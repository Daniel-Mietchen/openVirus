<p>For each segment, a codon alignment was generated by using MUSCLE. We assigned all sequences to avian and equine groups according to their host. The topology of the phylogenetic tree for each segment was reconstructed based on codon alignments using RAxML with GTR+G model. Branch lengths were re-optimised based on corresponding amino acid data. This step was achieved by using RAxML with the FLU+G model. The sitewise non-homogeneous phylogenetic model of Tamuri et al [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used to identify the amino acid sites with changes in selective constraints following the host shift from avian to equine species. This was performed on each segment based on the re-optimised phylogenetic tree and the corresponding amino acid alignment. Only reported sites with false detection rates (FDR) lower than 0.1 were accepted.
