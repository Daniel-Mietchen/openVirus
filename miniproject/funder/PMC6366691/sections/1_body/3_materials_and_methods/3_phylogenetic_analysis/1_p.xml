<p>We downloaded 21,242 completed influenza A virus genomes from the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource Database. For each segment, a codon alignment was generated by using MUSCLE [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Pal2nal [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and manually edited using SeaView [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. All eight segments were concatenated into full genome sequences. We used CD-HIT [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] to cluster the full genome alignment, and this resulted in a reduction of the original dataset to 825 clusters (sequences that shared â‰¥97% identity were grouped together). Phylogenetic trees were inferred using one representative sequence from each of the 825 clusters generated by CD-HIT, together with the genomes of the 22 influenza viruses collected from wild birds (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007531.s008">S1 Table</xref>) and 13 influenza viruses isolated from horses in Mongolia (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007531.s010">S3 Table</xref>). The final data set comprised 860 sequences for each segment. Codon alignments were then realigned for each segment using MUSCLE. We used RAxML [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] to infer the phylogenetic tree for each segment using the GTRCAT model and 1000 bootstrap replicates.
