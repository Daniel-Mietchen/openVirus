Animal work was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Glasgow (ethics approval R25A/12). As no regulated procedures were carried out on animals a Home Office license was not required. Embryonated eggs (9–12 days old) were sourced from the State Central Veterinary Laboratory's farm, where they are specifically produced for virus isolation. For this reason no ethics is required by SCVL. In addition, as embryos were killed before the start of the final third of the incubation period, our virus isolation protocol is not considered a regulated procedure under the UK's Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986. Our study protocols adhered to the UK's Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986 or to any nationally or internationally recognized guidelines.
