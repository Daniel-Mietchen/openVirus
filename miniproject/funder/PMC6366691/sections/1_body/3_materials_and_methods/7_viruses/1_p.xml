<p>For haemagglutination inhibition assays, sera were tested against A/ruddy shelduck/Mongolia/881V/2009, A/ruddy shelduck/Mongolia/963V/2009, A/common shelduck/Mongolia/2076/2011, A/common shelduck/Mongolia/2106/2011, A/common teal/Mongolia/2271/2011 and A/equine/Ohio/2003. To test for serological cross reactivity between AIVs and EIVs we used A/equine/Kentucky/2/2007, A/equine/Kentucky/1/91, A/equine/Kentucky/4/2007, A/equine/Kentucky/7/2007, A/equine/Kentucky/99, and A/equine/Kentucky/5/2002. For experimental infections of equine tracheal explants we used A/equine/South Africa/2003 and the same AIVs enumerated above.</p>
