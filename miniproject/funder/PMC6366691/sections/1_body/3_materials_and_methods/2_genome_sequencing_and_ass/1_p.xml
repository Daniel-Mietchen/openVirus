<p>Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAmp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) following the manufacturersâ€™ instructions. Reverse transcription followed by PCR amplification were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and amplicons were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Reads were quality controlled and trimmed using FAstQC and Trim Galore. The cleaned reads were then
