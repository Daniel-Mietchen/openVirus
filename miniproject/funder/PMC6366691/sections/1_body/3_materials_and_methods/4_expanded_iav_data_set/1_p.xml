<p>After the maximum likelihood (ML) trees derived from the multiple IAV data set were inferred, we selected a subset of sequences comprising the subtrees containing all H3N8 EIVs and closely related lineages. This data set was expanded to its original number of taxa (before using CD-HIT) with varying number of taxa: 329 for PB2, 98 for PB1, 202 for PA, 257 for HA, 113 for NP, 276 for NA, 981 for M1 and 148 for NS1. Sequences of EIV/Jilin/89 were removed from PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M1 and NS1, as this virus is closely related to avian influenza instead of equine influenza according to the phylogeny. All sequences from other mammals were removed. This left a sequence dataset for each segment with an outgroup of avian sequences and a separate monophyletic equine H3N8 clade corresponding to the host shift event of 1963.</p>
