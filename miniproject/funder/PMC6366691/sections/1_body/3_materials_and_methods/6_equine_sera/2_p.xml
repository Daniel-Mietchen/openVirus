<p>To determine if there was serological cross-reactivity between AIVs and H3N8 EIVs we used a panel of archived equine sera collected from convalescent horses infected with known EIVs. Sera were against the following viruses: A/Equine/Ohio/2003, A/Equine/Kentucky/2/2007, A/Equine/Kentucky/1/91, A/Equine/Kentucky/4/2007, A/Equine/Kentucky/7/2007, A/Equine/Kentucky/99, and A/Equine/Kentucky/5/2002).</p>
