 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Animal work was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Glasgow (ethics approval R25A/12). As no regulated procedures were carried out on animals a Home Office license was not required. Explants were infected with 200 plaque-forming units (PFU) of each virus directly on the epithelium layer. Culture medium (5 μl) was deposited on the surface of mock-infected explants. For histological analysis explants were fixed in 10% (v/v) buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. Paraffin sections were subject to Haematoxylin and Eosin staining and histological images were captured using cell^D software (Olympus). Virus growth kinetics was assayed by plaque assays in Madin- Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK, ATCC CCL-34) cells at different time points as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. All experiments were done in triplicate.
