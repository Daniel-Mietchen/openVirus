<p>Horse antisera were treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE, SEIKEN) and heat inactivated. HI assays were carried out using chicken red blood cells (RBCs) following standard procedures [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Sera that inhibited hemagglutination at a dilution â‰¥ 1:40 were considered positive. Horse antisera that tested positive to AIVs were further tested using microneutralisation assays as described in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007531.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We used the Prevalence package in R (version 3.2.2) to calculate seroprevalences including confidence intervals using the Agresti-Coull interval with 0.95 confidence. Maps were generated in R using the Maps package to plot sampling sites. The serology heatmap and UpSet plot were generated in R using the ggplot2 and UpSetR packages, respectively. Data used in the heat map was manually ordered based on serological profiles, and HI values transformed to dilution factors. For the UpSet plot, data was converted to a binary matrix (i.e. positive or negative).
