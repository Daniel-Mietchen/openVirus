<p>A number of seroprevalence studies have recently been conducted in affected countries and territories in the Americas among specific subgroups of populations and geographical areas. ZIKV seroprevalence was found to be 63% in patient cohorts and university employees in Salvador, Brazil [

 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In Bolivia, ZIKV seroprevalence was estimated in blood donors at 39% in Beni, 21.5% in Santa Cruz de la Sierra and close to 0% in three different highland regions (Cochachamba, La Paz and Tarija) [

It is unclear whether their findings are generalizable to the wider population. No territory-wide study evaluating the impact of ZIKV emergence in the general population has yet been published. Such population-representative studies constitute the most reliable source of information and often estimate seroprevalence rates that are lower but more representative than those obtained in population subgroups [
