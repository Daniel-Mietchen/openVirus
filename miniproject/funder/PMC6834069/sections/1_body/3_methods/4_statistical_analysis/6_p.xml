<p>The outcome of interest was the weighted ZIKV seroprevalence estimate, and the associated factors were identified by using a survey-weighted Poisson regression and prevalence ratios (PRs). Any variable having a significant univariate test with a 
 <italic>P</italic> value cutoff point of 0.25 was selected as a candidate for the multivariate analysis. The strength of the association between selected variables and ZIKV seropositivity was estimated by crude and adjusted PRs with their 95% confidence interval (CI), all PRs excluding 1.0 being considered as significant.
