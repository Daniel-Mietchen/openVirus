<p>All serum samples were tested for anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using a recombinant antigen-based SGERPAxMap microsphere immunoassay (MIA) adapted from Beck et al [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. ZIKV Luminex MIA uses the ZIKV E3 domain as the epitope rather than the whole E protein as in traditional ELISAs. The E3 domain has been shown to limit cross-reactivity between flaviviruses [
