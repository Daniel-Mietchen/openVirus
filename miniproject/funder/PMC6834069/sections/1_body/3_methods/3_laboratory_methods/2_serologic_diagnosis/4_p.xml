<p>ZIKV neutralizing antibodies from the MNT were detected in 63 of 65 (96.9%) of samples with an MIA ratio of &gt;2.5, in 26 of 36 (72.2%) of samples with an MIA ratio between 1.5 and 2.5, and in 12 of 134 (9%) of samples with an MIA ratio of &lt;1.5. A sample was considered positive if its MIA ratio was &gt;2.5 and negative for a value &lt;1.5. All samples with an MIA ratio between 1.5 and 2.5 were tested by MNT and considered positive for neutralizing titers &gt;20. MNT was also systematically performed where the MIA ratio was &lt;1.5 for anyone who had reported an arboviral-like infection in the last 2 years (
