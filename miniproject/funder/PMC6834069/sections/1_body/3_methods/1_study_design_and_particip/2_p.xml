<p>We estimated the sample size for this survey at 2500 persons distributed in the 5 delimited geographical areas based on a 50% seroprevalence, 95% confidence, 90% power, and a cluster effect. To reach the desired sample size, a total of 1600 households were randomly selected for possible participation in the study from household databases maintained by the Geographic Information and Knowledge Dissemination Unit of the Regional Environment, the planning and housing agency, and the National Institute of Economic and Statistical Information. A stratified simple random sampling method was adopted to select households from the 22 municipalities (strata), allowing an overrepresentation of isolated and small municipalities. Villages from 4 municipalities (Roura, Maripasoula, Regina, and Camopi) were specifically considered in the sample design to ensure that all existing submunicipality areas were adequately represented among the selected households. The distribution of households selected from the 22 strata is presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The global sampling fraction of the households was 1:49, varying from 1:103 to 1:5 according to the municipality.
