<p>We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study through household interviews and serologic survey during June–October 2017, involving residents located in the 22 municipalities of French Guiana. The territory is composed of 2 main inhabited geographical regions: a central urbanized and coastal strip area along the Atlantic Ocean (“coastal area”) where a large part of the population lives, and 4 distinct remote areas along the Surinamese and Brazilian frontiers (“interior area”) (
