<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which also transmits dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. It was first isolated in 1947 in African forests, where it circulates between nonhuman primates and sylvatic mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ZIKV was considered as an emergent virus with few sporadic cases reported in Africa and Asia until 2007, when a major epidemic occurred in Yap, Federated States of Micronesia [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], followed by one in French Polynesia in 2013 [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Subsequently, ZIKV continued to spread in the Pacific region [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and emerged in South America in early 2015 [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During these recent outbreaks, the virus was linked to neurological disorders [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], severe congenital abnormalities, and human birth defects [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref>], leading the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several recent studies have also highlighted that ZIKV can be transmitted through sexual contact or from mother to fetus [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In French Guiana, a French overseas department of 260 000 inhabitants that is located in Latin America in the Amazonian forest complex, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes have been responsible for several major dengue fever outbreaks [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and for the chikungunya outbreak in 2014 [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Given the risk of congenital complications, the emergence of ZIKV was particularly concerning for its inhabitants as the territory has the highest fertility rate in the Americas (3.5 children per woman) [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. During the ZIKV epidemic in French Guiana (January–September 2016), approximately 9700 clinical cases (approximately 4% of the population), with 14 congenital abnormalities including 3 instances of microcephaly, were recorded by local health authorities [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A territory-wide active monitoring of pregnant women implemented during the first 4 months of the outbreak also showed that 573 of 3050 (19%) enrolled pregnant women had laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the ZIKV infection burden remains unclear in the general population. In such a context, population-representative seroprevalence studies provide an opportunity to estimate the underlying burden of infection and to assess the potential for future epidemics of ZIKV in the region.
