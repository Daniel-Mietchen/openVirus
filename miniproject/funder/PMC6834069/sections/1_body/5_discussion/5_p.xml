<p>Whereas the proportion of asymptomatic ZIKV infection in ZIKV-positive participants was estimated in previous general population cross-sectional studies at 43% in French Polynesia [

 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and 62% in Yap, Micronesia [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], we found that 74.5% (95% CI, 68.5%–79.8%) of the participants with ZIKV IgG did not report symptoms confirming the high proportion of asymptomatic ZIKV infection. Considering that the survey was conducted 8 months after the end of the ZIKV epidemic in French Guiana, recall bias may nonetheless have led to underreporting of symptoms, particularly when there was a considerable time delay between the symptoms’ occurrence and the time of the survey. Furthermore, even if numerous education campaigns may have considerably increased public awareness of health risks related to arboviruses in a large majority of the population, awareness about Zika; cultural, social, and behavioral practices; or previous expositions to diseases and parasites may have affected the reporting of presumptive ZIKV infection.
