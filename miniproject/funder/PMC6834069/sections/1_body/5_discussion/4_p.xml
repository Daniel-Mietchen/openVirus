<p>We found that individuals with higher income and benefiting from general health insurance had a reduced risk of infection compared to those with lower income and benefiting from universal health or state medical assistance in the univariate risk factor analysis. However, after correcting for spatial differences in risk, no individual or household-level factor was associated with being seropositive. This suggests that the individual risk of infection is more deeply modulated by different ecoenvironments related to geographic factors, urbanization level, and the related quality of sanitary infrastructures that may have an impact on the extent of vector infestation and, hence, viral circulation.</p>
