<p>Here we have presented a large-scale representative ZIKV seroprevalence study in South America from the recent 2015â€“2016 Zika epidemic. We found that approximately a quarter of the population of French Guiana became infected during the outbreak. However, there was substantial heterogeneity in infection risk, with communities in the center of the territory hardly affected at all, whereas up to half of the population was infected in urban communities along the coast. Our results were consistent with a recent report from a systematic monitoring of pregnant women in French Guiana that estimated at 19% the proportion of ZIKV-positive women during the first 4 months of the outbreak [
