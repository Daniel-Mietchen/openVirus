<p>First, given that individuals without health coverage could not be enrolled in our survey because of restrictions from French legislation, immigrants without health coverage were underrepresented in our sample. Although this population was very small in the majority of the municipalities, some households were excluded in the western border part of the territory, which is known for high levels of immigration, because the adults and household referents did not have health insurance status. Second, sample size calculation was determined to obtain a sufficient point estimate of prevalence but not to study risk factors of infection so that we might lack power to ascertain them. Finally, cross-reaction between viruses of the same family could have affected the interpretation of seroprevalence results. In particular, dengue has circulated in French Guiana for decades. Here we used an assay that minimizes the risk of cross-reaction by relying on the E3 domain of the ZIKV in combination with virus neutralization assay (MNT).We estimated that 9% of those with lower MIA values were still seropositive. This means that the true proportion seropositive may be slightly higher than our estimates; however, as 76.4% of samples had low MIA results, this would only raise the proportion seropositive from 23.3% to 27.1%.</p>
