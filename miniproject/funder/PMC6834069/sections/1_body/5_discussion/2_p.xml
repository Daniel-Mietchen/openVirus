<p>Our seroprevalence estimates are slightly lower than most previous estimates from seroprevalence studies in other locations in South America [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24–28</xref>] and in other parts of the world [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].This highlights the importance of conducting population-representative studies. The previous studies in South America have all consisted of single communities or small numbers of neighboring populations. Therefore, it has not been possible to generalize the findings to the wider country as is the case here, where the entire territory was included in the initial sampling frame. The future risk of ZIKV in the area remains unclear. It has been shown in a study conducted in Thailand that ZIKV can transition to stable endemic circulation [
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate that the majority of the population remains susceptible to ZIKV, which would potentially allow future successful reintroductions of the virus. However, the observed differences in seropositivity across the country may partly reflect differences in the distribution of mosquitoes across the territory. Population movements, economic development, and urbanization have facilitated the geographical expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and its implantation in almost all inhabited areas of French Guiana, even in villages along the Maroni river up to the Maripasoula main area and inland up to Saül [
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, to date no study has reported the presence of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations in the most remote villages including Antecume Pata, Twenke-Talhuen, and Camopi [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], where seroprevalence rates varied from 0% to 8%. Furthermore, despite strengthening existing epidemiological surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and entomo-epidemiological investigations coordinated by local health authorities when a clinical or confirmed case appeared in these areas, no autochthonous transmission of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted diseases has been identified in these villages.
