<p>The crude proportion seropositive was 21.6% and the overall weighted seroprevalence of ZIKV antibodies in French Guiana was 23.3% (95% CI, 20.9%–25.9%) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The seroprevalence did not differ according to sex (
 <italic>P</italic> = .65) or age (
 <italic>P</italic> = .47) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Serological results in the different geographical areas are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. While ZIKV circulated in a large part of French Guiana, it barely reached the interior and remote villages located in the most isolated forest areas (Saint-Elie, Saül, Talhuen-Twenke villages, and Camopi) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Elevated probabilities of infection were observed in the main population centers in Maroni river (Maripasoula main area: 45.6% [95% CI, 30.0%–62.0%]; Saint-Laurent: 32.4% [95% CI, 25.7%–39.9%]), in the coastal area (Kourou: 30.1% [95% CI, 23.8%–37.3%]; Cayenne: 25.2% [95% CI, 20.2%–30.9%]), and in Low-Oyapock (Saint-Georges: 27.6% [95% CI, 13.6%–47.9%]). Two smaller geographical areas in the coastal area were also strongly impacted (Sinnamary: 37.4% [95% CI, 24.0%–53.1%]; Cacao: 27.3% [95% CI, 12.2%–50.4%]). Living in the northwestern part of the territory, so-called “Low Maroni,” in urban areas and being born in Haiti was significantly associated with being seropositive in both univariate and multivariate analyses (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Living in a carbet, representing a typical Native American cabin without walls essentially located in the Amazonian forest complex in High Oyapock, interior, and high Maroni villages, was significantly associated with being ZIKV seronegative at univariate level. The seroprevalence estimated in makeshift houses was higher than in individual or collective type of housing. However, this difference was not significant, probably due to small numbers of individuals in this category. Benefiting from universal health coverage or state medical assistance and having a low household income was associated with being seropositive at the univariate level. However, socioeconomic factors and type of housing were no longer significant after adjusting by geographical regions.
