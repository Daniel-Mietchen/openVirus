<p>In total, 1415 households and 2697 individuals were included from the 27 recruitment areas (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The mean household size was 1.9 individuals (range, 1–11). The mean age was 34.1 years (range, 2–75 years). Comparison of the sociodemographic characteristics of the study sample to the census data demonstrated an overrepresentation of women (58.9% vs 50% in the general population of French Guiana) and adults &gt;25 years of age (64% vs 53% in French Guiana). These differences were accounted for in the analyses of seroprevalence and risk factors by allocating poststratification weight to each participant.
