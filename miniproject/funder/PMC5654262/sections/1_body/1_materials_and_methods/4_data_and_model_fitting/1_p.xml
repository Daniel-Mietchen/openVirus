<p>To estimate the seasonal flu transmission rate, we fit a simple deterministic, network-based, ordinary differential equation (ODE) SEIR model of seasonal flu transmission to national influenza data from the United States. We chose 2008-2009 as it preceded the 2009 pandemic and 2003-2004 as a representative

 <italic>ILI+</italic>) throughout these periods by multiplying the CDCâ€™s ILINet estimates of influenza activity by WHO public health lab estimates of percent positive flu tests [
