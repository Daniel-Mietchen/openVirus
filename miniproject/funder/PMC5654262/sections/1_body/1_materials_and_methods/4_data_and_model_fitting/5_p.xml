<p>To estimate both the per contact transmission rate,

 <sub>seasonal</sub>, and time of epidemic introduction for each network, we minimized the sum of the squared errors between the 2008-2009 
 <italic>ILI+</italic> data and the incidence predictions from the ODE model, using the 
 <italic>optim</italic> function in R [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Given that different network structures lead to different rates of epidemic growth, the flexible epidemic start time allows tighter fitting of the models to the seasonal flu incidence data. For the 2008-2009 season, we estimated the epidemic start date to be November 15th and December 18th, 2008 for the homogeneous and empirical networks, respectively [
