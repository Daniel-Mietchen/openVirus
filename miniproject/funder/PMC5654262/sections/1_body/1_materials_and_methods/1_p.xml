<p>We developed a stochastic two-strain influenza transmission model that incorporates contact network structure, heterosubtypic immunity, and new estimates of the seasonal flu reproduction number to investigate the dynamics of pandemic emergence risk. We simulated thousands of novel pandemic virus introductions to estimate the changing probability of pandemic emergence and the
