<p>We included short-term heterosubtypic immunity using a two-strain SEIPR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Protected-Recovered) network model similar to [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005749.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). All individuals are initially susceptible to both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Upon infection with one strain, individuals progress through the Exposed and Infectious classes; upon recovery, they enter a short period of complete protection from infection by the other strain, after which they regain full susceptibility to that strain. Our modeling framework does not allow simultaneous infection (co-infection) by both subtypes, as co-infection is thought to be relatively infrequent during concurrent epidemics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Close sequential infections can occur in the model, as some individuals transition through the protected class almost immediately (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005749.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We modeled single influenza seasons, and thus assumed that recovered individuals are fully and permanently immune to their infecting strain, that there are no births or deaths, and that the network structure does not change over the course of a single simulation.
