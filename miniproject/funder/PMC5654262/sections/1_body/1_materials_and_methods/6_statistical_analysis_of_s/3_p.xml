<p>During the 
 <italic>refractory period</italic>, immunity in the population increases the transmissibility necessary for a pandemic to invade the population. We use 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005749.e015">eq 3</xref> to estimate this changing invasion threshold; we let 〈
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>〉 and 〈
 <italic>k</italic>〉 reflect the current susceptible portion of the network, set 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 1, and solve for 
 <italic>T</italic>. For a given time point 
 <italic>t</italic> and scenario, we calculated 
 <italic>T</italic> for a single, prototypical simulation and divided it by the comparable threshold in a completely susceptible population. Importantly, this analysis assumes that the network susceptibility is frozen in time at the introduction time, and does not take into account subsequent epidemic and pandemic dynamics.
