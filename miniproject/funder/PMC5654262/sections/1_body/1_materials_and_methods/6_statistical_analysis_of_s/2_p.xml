<p>Each time a pandemic successfully emerged, we estimated its 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>eff</sub> by fitting the corresponding (empirical or homogeneous) single strain ODE network model (defined by equations in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005749.e008">1</xref>) to the simulated pandemic time series. The procedure is as described in the Data and model fitting section, with two alterations: (1) we fix the introduction time to that specified by the simulation scenario and only estimate the transmission rate, and (2) we fit the model to the 
 <italic>cumulative incidence</italic> of the pandemic virus. To then obtain an 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimate, we plugged the estimated pandemic transmission rate and full degree distribution into 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005749.e015">eq 3</xref>.
