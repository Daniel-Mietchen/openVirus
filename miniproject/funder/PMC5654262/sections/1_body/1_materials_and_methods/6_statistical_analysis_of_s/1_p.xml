<p>For a given scenario, we restricted our analyses to simulations in which a seasonal epidemic actually occurred (defined as outbreaks with cumulative incidence reaching at least 5% of the population). We then estimated the pandemic emergence probability as the number of pandemic introductions that progressed into sustained outbreaks (infecting at least 5% of the population) divided by the number of simulations with seasonal epidemics of that scenario. We approximated the emergence timing of the pandemic as the first day in which the daily incidence was â‰¥5 individuals, as this was a good indicator for the beginning of the exponential growth phase.</p>
