<p>The spring and summer emergence of the six recent pandemics seems more than just a coincidence (Multinomial test; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but the sample is quite small and derived from imperfect historical data. If, indeed, pandemic risk is seasonal, there are several plausible drivers. Two factors might favor pandemic emergence 
 <italic>during</italic> the typical flu season. First, the socio-environmental conditions thought to promote seasonal influenza transmission (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, humidity and school calendar) might also favor pandemic transmission during the winter months [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Second, pandemic emergence is often preceded by viral reassortment in hosts co-infected by a seasonal influenza virus and a novel virus, which should become more likely as the prevalence of seasonal flu increases [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, transient cross-immunity from seasonal influenza infections may impede infection by novel viruses during the flu season. Together, these counterbalancing factors may produce a tight and predictable window for pandemic emergence.
