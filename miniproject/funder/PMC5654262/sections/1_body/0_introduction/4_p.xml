<p>Viruses of a common subtype (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> H3N2) are known to compete via 
 <italic>homosubtypic</italic> immunity, producing stereotypical single branch influenza phylogenies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, the extent and mechanisms of competition among viruses of differing subtypes (e.g. a resident seasonal virus and a novel pandemic virus) via 
 <italic>heterosubtypic</italic> immunity are not fully understood [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A first childhood influenza infection may provide lifelong heterosubtypic immunity against subtypes within the same phylogenetic group (Group 1 includes H1, H2, and H5; Group 2 includes H3 and H7) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, any childhood or adulthood influenza infection may provide temporary, generalized heterosubtypic protection against other subtypes, lasting from a week to several months [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This is perhaps mediated by cells surviving influenza infection that exhibit an increased antiviral response and naturally turnover within a short period of time [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Immunity may not fully prevent infection, but individuals infected within this period experience reduced viral shedding, disease severity, and infection durations, likely reducing subsequent spread of the disease [
