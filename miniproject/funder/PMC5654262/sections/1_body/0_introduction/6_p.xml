<p>Here, we characterize the impact of seasonal influenza on both the likelihood and magnitude of pandemic emergence events, mediated by transient heterosubtypic immunity following infection, and then integrate environmental constraints on flu transmission to estimate the seasonality of pandemic emergence risk. We fit two mathematical models to historical influenza data–one that assumes a homogeneous population and another that captures realistic heterogeneity in contact patterns–and simulate the introduction of novel influenza virus throughout the influenza season. We focus our analysis on the 2008-2009 seasonal epidemic, since it directly preceded the 2009 pandemic; for comparison, we also analyzed the larger 2003-2004 season (

As expected, the risk of pandemic emergence declines in the wake of seasonal influenza, as does the effective reproduction number (early transmission rate) of any emerging pandemic. The seasonality of pandemic risk depends critically on the duration of immunity and the structure of the host population.
