<p>Influenza pandemics have emerged regularly throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In preparation for future pandemics, public health agencies have enacted measures to expedite pandemic vaccine development [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the manufacturing and distribution process is still expected to take several months, as occurred following the initial identification of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the interim, the primary pandemic control measures will include prophylaxis and treatment with antiviral medications and social distancing measures [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Given the potential severity of disease and rapid pace of emergence, advanced warning and early response are imperative. Thus, public health agencies have established extensive surveillance networks in humans, livestock, and wild bird populations [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While these systems are designed to identify potential pandemic threats as infections arise, researchers have also conducted mutatagenesis experiments to identify 
 <italic>upstream</italic> evolutionary risks, that is, potential pathways toward human infectivity and virulence [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the utility of such “gain-of-function” experiments has been disputed, particularly given the risks associated with handling highly virulent influenza viruses [
