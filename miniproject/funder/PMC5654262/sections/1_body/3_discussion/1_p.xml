<p>The coincidental timing of recent pandemics may reflect multiple constraints, including environmental and behavioral factors that shape influenza’s transmissibility (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> humidity, school calendar, etc.), reassortment events mediated by co-infection, and immune-mediated competition between pandemic and established viruses [

On the one hand, we would expect pandemics to emerge during the flu season, when socio-environmental conditions are conducive to influenza transmission and co-infections are likely; on the other hand, those would be the months of greatest competitive interference. These competing effects suggest that the risk of pandemic emergence may be greatest at the tail of the flu season, when conditions are still favorable and co-infections are possible, but competition is waning. Consider the following scenario. A novel virus is produced by co-infection mediated reassortment during the heart of the influenza season. It initially stutters, hindered by widespread heterosubtypic immunity, but does not completely disappear. With each new infection, emergence is possible and increasingly probable, as heterosubtypic immunity dissipates. This is consistent with the timing of all recent pandemics (
