<p>Pandemics often emerge in multiple waves [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], including a herald wave in the spring or summer and a secondary wave the following fall or winter. These wave patterns are well documented for the 1918, 1957, and 2009 pandemics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Our results provide potential insight into this phenomenon. The asynchronous forces of heterosubtypic herd immunity and suppressive off-season conditions may constrain pandemic emergence to the immediate wake of the flu season, exactly when lingering population-wide immunity is expected to dampen the initial wave of pandemic transmission. In the months following, the limited herald wave runs its course, residual seasonal immunity continues to decline, and socio-environmental conditions slowly become more conducive to flu transmission, thereby setting the stage for a major winter pandemic wave. Early estimates of pandemic

 <sub>eff</sub>, depending on the duration of heterosubtypic immunity, the timing of emergence, and the baseline transmissibility of the virus. Recent analyses of the 1918 and 2009 pandemic waves found that the initial waves were 3.6% and 6.5% less transmissible than the secondary wave, supporting our conclusions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. This finding is broadly consistent with published estimates for the reproduction numbers of primary and secondary pandemic waves, with the exception of the 1918 pandemic in Denmark [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This discrepancy may be attributable to poor data or stem from local differences in the preceding flu season or population structure.
