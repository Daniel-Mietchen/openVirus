<p>Our comparison between homogeneous and empirical contact networks suggests that, while the refractory effect is robust, estimation of pandemic risk prior to and during emergence events will be highly sensitive to statistical assumptions regarding population structure. Several other studies have examined the impact of network structure on herd immunity following an epidemic or vaccination campaign, and similarly found that contact heterogeneity amplifies the refractory effect [
