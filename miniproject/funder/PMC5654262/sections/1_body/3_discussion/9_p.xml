<p>Our model makes several assumptions about the transmissibility of both seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. We assume that the intrinsic transmission rates depend on humidity (

Since we estimated pandemic emergence locations and dates based on reports of major outbreaks, our estimates may be biased towards regions with high reporting rates or population densities. Our study is further limited by the small number of pandemic emergence event; with five natural pandemics emerging in subtropical and temperate climates, we lack the power to fit high resolution predictive model. Instead, we used the North American 2008-2009 influenza season as a prototypical flu season for exploring seasonal and immunological drivers of pandemic risk. The flu seasons preceding the other 20th century pandemics likely varied in both timing and magnitude. Additional historical data from those pandemics and their preceding seasons might enable more reliable spatiotemporal estimates of pandemic emergence risk and the duration of cross-immunity.
