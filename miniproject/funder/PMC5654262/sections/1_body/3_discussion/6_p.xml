<p>Most historic pandemic viruses were likely created by recent livestock-human reassortment events [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], with two possible exceptions. The 1977 pandemic was caused by a lab escapee, and the 2009 pandemic evolved from a human-derived variant that circulated in swine for years before the precipitating reassortment event, which may have occurred in livestock several months or years prior to its 2009 emergence [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have assumed that pandemic introductions will be constrained to the flu season for two reasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005749.g005">Fig 5</xref>). First, the chance of a livestock-human reassortment event will depend on the prevalence of flu in both humans and livestock, and thus increase as seasonal flu gains momentum. Second, flu prevalence in livestock is thought to mirror seasonal flu in humans [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Thus, even viruses emerging directly from livestock, without a precipitating human reassortment event, may be constrained to the same months.
