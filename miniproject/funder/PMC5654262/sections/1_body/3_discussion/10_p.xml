<p>Recent pandemics exhibited similar timing and geographic origins, having all emerged in the Northern Hemisphere. Why this is so, and whether it suggests higher risk of future pandemic emergence in the Northern Hemisphere is yet unknown. Molecular analyses suggest that seasonal flu diversity is seeded in the Northern Hemisphere (Southeast Asia) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. These two factors could suggest that the Northern Hemisphere may be a likely source for future pandemics. If influenza refractory periods are estimated for other climatic zones, as we have done here for the Northern Hemisphere, we may better understand the common origins of past pandemics and gain actionable insights into global dynamics of pandemic risk.
