<p>The rate of pandemic spread will depend on the time of emergence. Pandemics emerging during the seasonal refractory period will initially grow slowly and accelerate as residual immunity dissipates. Thus, the threat and pace of global expansion may far exceed projections based on early estimates of the viral reproduction number (

 <sub>0</sub>). In our model based on the 2008-2009 flu season, we estimate that, at the peak of the refractory period, naturally occurring immunity will reduce the probability of pandemic emergence 73% and reduce the reproduction number of a successfully emerging virus by 30%. We assumed that all recovered individuals experience full protection during their short period of heterosubtypic immunity. If, for example, heterosubtypic immunity is incomplete or fails to prevent subsequent spread, the refractory effect may be diminished. Nonetheless, the qualitative results, including the timing of the refractory period and differences between the two network models should still hold.
