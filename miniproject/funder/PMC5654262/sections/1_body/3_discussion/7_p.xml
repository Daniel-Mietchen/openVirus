<p>When we remove this assumption and introduce pandemic viruses throughout the year, the plausible emergence times start earlier in the fall, before the seasonal flu epidemic takes hold (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005749.s008">S8</xref> Figs). This broader emergence scenario is inconsistent with historical pandemics, given that none emerged in the fall just prior to a seasonal epidemic. While this does not prove our seasonality assumptions, it suggests that there may be factors restricting emergence events in the fall, such as the ones we have hypothesized, or that fall emergence simply has not occurred, by chance alone, across the limited number of recent pandemics. Our study was not designed to detect such seasonal constraints on pandemic emergence (rather we assume them and analyze the consequences), but leaves this as an interesting open question for future work. Interestingly, the broader emergence scenario may apply to the 1977 pandemic, which, unlike the other recent pandemics, did not emerge directly from influenza circulating in livestocks or humans, as well as to risks associated with future gain-of-function avian influenza experiments.
