<p>The refractory period also depends on the transmissibility of the pandemic virus: the greater the transmission rate, the more readily a pandemic will emerge with or without immunological interference; the opposite is true for less transmissible viruses (

The refractory effect is greater in the empirical (network) model than in the homogeneous model, suggesting that mass action assumptions may lead to underestimation of viral interference and overestimation of pandemic risk. Assuming that the pandemic virus has the same intrinsic transmission rate as the seasonal virus, the probability of pandemic emergence is reduced by 73% and 62% in the empirical and homogeneous models, respectively, at the base of the refractory period, relative to comparable introductions in a completely susceptible population. Higher transmission rates lead to smaller reductions (56% and 19% respectively), while less transmissible viruses can be almost fully excluded (99% and 84% reductions respectively) (
