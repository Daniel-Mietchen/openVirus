<p>We fit two network models—an empirical model and a homogeneous model (roughly equivalent to a simple mass action model)—to influenza data from the 2008-2009 season in the US (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005749.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and estimated reproduction numbers (

 <sub>0</sub>) of 1.8 and 1.4, respectively (Analogous results for the larger 2003-2004 flu season are presented in Supplementary Material). Both estimates are consistent with prior studies [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and their discrepancy highlights a potential pitfall of simple epidemiological models. Given the observed heterogeneity in human social behavior [
