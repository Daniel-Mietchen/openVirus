<p>For each simulated pandemic that successfully emerges, we estimate the effective

 <sub>eff</sub> of the emerging pandemic virus decreases as the seasonal epidemic progresses towards its peak, bottoming out slightly before the emergence probability reaches its minimum. However, this occurs slightly earlier and more precipitously in the empirical model than in the homogeneous model (
