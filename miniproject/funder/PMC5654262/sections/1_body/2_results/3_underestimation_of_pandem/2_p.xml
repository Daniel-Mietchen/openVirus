<p>Whether or not a virus emerges depends on its intrinsic infectiousness and structure of the susceptible portion of the population. During the refractory period, the susceptible population is diminished, both in number and connectivity. At the peak of the refractory period in the empirical network, we estimate that a introduced virus must be 1.16 times more infectious (transmissible) to emerge, relative to one entering a completely susceptible population. If the seasonal epidemics preceding the 1918 and 2009 pandemics were similar in timing and magnitude to our simulated epidemics, then we estimate that their intrinsic
