<p>The 
 <italic>susceptible</italic> portion of a network is the subset of individuals that are currently susceptible to pandemic infection and any connections among them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005749.g003">Fig 3</xref>, orange circles and lines). (This is also known as the 
 <italic>residual</italic> network [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].) The 
 <italic>susceptible degree</italic> of a susceptible node is the number of contacts it has with other susceptibles. Upon infection by seasonal flu, individuals and their coincident edges leave the susceptible network, returning only when their heterospecific influenza immunity wanes. This dynamic wake of immunity depends on the underlying network structure and, importantly, determines the populationâ€™s vulnerability to pandemic emergence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005749.g003">Fig 3</xref>, grey nodes and edges).
