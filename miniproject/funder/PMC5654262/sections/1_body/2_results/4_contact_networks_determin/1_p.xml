<p>The different levels of pandemic risk observed in our two models stem from their underlying contact networks. To illustrate this, we use 
 <italic>nodes</italic> and 
 <italic>edges</italic> to represent individuals and contacts between individuals, respectively. The 
 <italic>degree</italic> of a node is defined as the number of edges connecting it to other nodes. The homogeneous model assumes that all individuals have the same number of contacts; the empirical model assumes realistic variation in degree [
