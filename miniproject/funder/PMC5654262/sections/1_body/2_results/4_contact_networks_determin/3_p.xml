<p>As a disease spreads, the chance of a node becoming infected will depend on its degree. The more contacts a node has, the higher its exposure risk. In a homogeneous network, chains of transmission progress randomly; in a heterogeneous network, outbreaks hit the most connected nodes earliest and hardest. Consider two emerging outbreaks–one in the empirical network and another in the homogeneous network–that have reached the same cumulative incidence. Although the susceptible networks will have identical numbers of susceptible nodes, the empirical susceptible network will be much sparser (fewer edges) than the homogeneous counterpart, and will thus be more refractory to pandemic invasion (
