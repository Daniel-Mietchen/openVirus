<p>The above analyses assume that pandemic emergence is constrained solely by heterosubtypic immunity, and do not consider the socio-environmental factors that shape seasonal flu dynamics. When we incorporate humidity-forced seasonality into the model, we find that pandemics are most likely to emerge soon after the seasonal epidemic peak (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005749.g005">Fig 5</xref>), with the timing more constrained to the spring and early summer in the empirical network than in the homogeneous network. For both models, the most probable week of emergence falls within one week of the actual 2009 pandemic emergence event. To assess the consistency of our models with observed pandemics (five emerged in the spring and one emerged in the summer), we conduct multinomial tests of the model-derived probabilities of emergence across each of the four seasons. While the empirical and homogeneous models are consistent with recent history (multinomial exact test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.53 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.35, respectively), the simple null model in which emergence risk is assumed to be constant throughout the year is not (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Although all historic pandemics seem consistent with the model, we note that these estimates are based on the 2008-2009 flu season and thus strictly pertain only to the 2009 pandemic. We speculate that projections from the seasons preceding each of the other historical pandemics would be similar and perhaps even better aligned with the emergence of the corresponding pandemic.
