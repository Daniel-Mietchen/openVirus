  <title>Historical pandemics emerged at the tail-end of flu seasons.</title>
  <p>Gray curves show the 1997-2015 flu seasons in the US, excluding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as estimated by the CDCâ€™s ILINet surveillance system [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Vertical dashed lines indicate emergence week of historical pandemics in their source populations, defined as the first reported outbreak of severe influenza preceding the initial pandemic wave. These estimates were obtained from: 1889 [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], 1918 [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], 1957 [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], 1968 [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and 1977 [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005749.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To be consistent, we date the emergence of the 2009 pandemic according to the first significant outbreak preceding the initial wave, rather than the earlier outbreaks in rural Mexico that were identified only in retrospect [
