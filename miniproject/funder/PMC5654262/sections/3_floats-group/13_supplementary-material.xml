  <title>Pandemic refractory period reduces as transmissibility increases.</title>
  <p>Pandemic emergence probabilities plotted for the 2008-2009 seasonal simulation for a pandemic that is less transmissible than the seasonal strain (Top) and one that is more transmissible than the seasonal strain (Bottom) on the two analyzed networks (fill colors). Probability is estimated as the proportion of introductions that subsequently infected at least 5% of the overall population out of the 5,000 simulations. Horizontal dashed lines indicate the emergence probabilities in a completely susceptible population calculated with 
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005749.e014">Eq 2</xref>. The pandemic refractory periods (shaded regions) are plotted the same as in the manuscript. Refractory period is deeper and wider for the less transmissible strain, and nearly disappears if the pandemic transmissibility is high enough.
