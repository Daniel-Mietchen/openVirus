  <title>Seasonality further constrains pandemic emergence timing.</title>
  <p>Probability density for pandemic emergence timing for pandemics that emerge during the seasonal influenza epidemic for the homogeneous (purple) and empirical (green) networks. Pandemic emergence timing, the time in which the simulated pandemic begins rapid spread, is defined as the day the pandemic strain incidence reaches five or more cases. Results are for a pandemic emerging during the 2008-2009 flu season with the same transmission rate as the seasonal epidemic. Vertical lines indicate the timing of historic pandemics, with the solid line indicating the timing of the 2009 pandemic and dashed lines indicating timing of others.</p>
