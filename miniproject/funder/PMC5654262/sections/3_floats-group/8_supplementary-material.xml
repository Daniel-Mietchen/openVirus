  <title>Larger seasonal epidemics produce larger pandemic refractory periods.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold>: Actual 2003-2004 epidemic curve (solid black line) and 200 stochastic simulations of seasonal epidemics for each network (green for empirical; purple for homogeneous), assuming transmission parameters estimated from 2003-2004 data. 
   <bold>B</bold>: The probability of pandemic emergence upon the introduction of a single infected individual, assuming that the pandemic virus has the same transmission rate as the seasonal virus. Probability is estimated as the proportion of introductions that subsequently infected at least 5% of the overall population out of the 5,000 simulations. Horizontal dashed lines indicate the emergence probabilities in a completely susceptible population calculated with 
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005749.e014">Eq 2</xref> from the manuscript. The pandemic refractory periods (shaded regions) are expected to occur during and immediately following the seasonal epidemic peak.

   <sub>0</sub>. Assuming that the emerging pandemic has an 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> = 3 in a naïve population (dashed horizontal line), we plot the median (points) and interquartile range of the measured 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>eff</sub>, for each introduction time and each network. For example, if a pandemic with 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> = 3 emerged in January of 2003 and we did not account for population immunity, we would interpret the 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>eff</sub> as the 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> and considerably underestimate the true transmission rate (
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> ≈ 2), regardless of our contact network assumptions.
