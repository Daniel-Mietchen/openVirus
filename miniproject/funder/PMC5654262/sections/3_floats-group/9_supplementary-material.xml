  <title>Seasonal flu disconnects the susceptible portion of a population (Large seasonal epidemic).</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold>: For a single (typical) 2003-2004 seasonal epidemic simulation, the number of individuals susceptible to infection by a pandemic virus and the number of edges connecting two such individuals are plotted for each network (green for empirical; purple for homogeneous), with each point representing a single time point over the course of the epidemic. Arrows indicate temporal progression. For any given number of remaining susceptible individuals, the empirical model is always sparser than the homogeneous model (that is, it has fewer contacts remaining between susceptibles). 
   <bold>B</bold>: The distribution of degrees (number of contacts) assumed for the empirical model. The homogeneous model assumes that all individuals have 16 contacts. 
   <bold>C</bold> Snapshot of the susceptible portion of the empirical network at the base of the refractory period (at the time point indicated in panel A by the box labeled ‘C’). Points indicate the percent of the nodes that are immune to pandemic infection, across different levels of connectivity. (We bin degrees by 10; for example, the lowest bin includes individuals with 1 to 10 contacts). For comparison, the horizontal dashed line indicates the overall proportion of individuals immunized in the network at the base of the refractory period. In comparison to an individual with an average number of contacts, a highly connected individual will be more vulnerable to seasonal flu infection, and, once infected and immunized, cause greater epidemiological disruption.
