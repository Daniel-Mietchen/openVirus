  <title>Probability distribution for immune duration.</title>
  <p>We model the immune duration as an exponentially distributed random variable with rate = 1/42, meaning the most likely immune duration is nearly zero days of immunity, but on average individuals will spend 42 days in the immune state. As the influenza epidemics we model last 100 days or more, the immune duration allows for an individual to experience serial infections of the seasonal and pandemic strain.</p>
