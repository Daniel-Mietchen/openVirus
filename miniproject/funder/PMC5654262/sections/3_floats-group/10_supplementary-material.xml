  <title>Seasonality constrains pandemic emergence timing for the 2003-2004 season.</title>
  <p>Probability density for pandemic emergence timing for pandemics that emerge during the seasonal influenza epidemic for the homogeneous (purple) and empirical (green) networks. Pandemic emergence timing, the time in which the simulated pandemic begins rapid spread, is defined as the day the pandemic strain incidence reaches five or more cases. Results are for a pandemic emerging during the 2003-2004 flu season with the same transmission rate as the seasonal epidemic. Vertical dashed lines indicate the timing of historic pandemics.</p>
