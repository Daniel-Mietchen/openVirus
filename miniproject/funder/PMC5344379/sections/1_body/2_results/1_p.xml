 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173225.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The initial literature search yielded 487 unique reports. Two team members evaluated each abstract for inclusion in the study. These researchers modified the age range for inclusion for two reasons. First, they noted that few studies included adolescents as young as 10 years of age. Secondly, the few studies that did include younger adolescents also included children or adults outside the age range of interest, but did not label findings by age. Thus, it was difficult to extract findings only from study participants in the adolescent age range. Therefore, the final criteria for age were modified to ages 13â€“20, inclusive. Forty-five reports met inclusion criteria for full-text appraisal by members of the research team.
