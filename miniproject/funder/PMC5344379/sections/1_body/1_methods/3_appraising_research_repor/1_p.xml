<p>We used a 14-item reading guide[
 <xref rid="pone.0173225.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to appraise multiple aspects of each of the qualitative reports. Sandelowski notes that despite decades of effort to devise criteria and methods for evaluating the quality of qualitative research studies, there is no census on the criteria or whether they should be applied at all. Efforts to codify quality in qualitative research risk losing scientifically relevant findings for reasons that do not render them unimportant. For example, if sample size is a criterion by which quality is assessed, one risks losing important findings in multiple small studies that were judged to be of low-quality for small sample rather than inappropriate methods. Thus, Sandelowskiâ€™s approach to appraising research reports focuses on differences in kind of qualitative findings, rather than quality of research studies.
