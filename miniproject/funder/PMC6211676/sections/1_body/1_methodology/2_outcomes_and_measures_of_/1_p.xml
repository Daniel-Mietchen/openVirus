<p>The relationship between strong peer programme inputs–numbers of PEs trained and supported in micro-planning–and regular outreach contacts is the primary outcome of interest, as peer outreach has been shown to be a critical ‘gateway’ to other services. [
 <xref rid="pone.0205056.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The analysis also includes several secondary ‘service utilisation’ outcomes, which may in turn be catalysed by frequent outreach contacts. The operational strength of peer micro-planning efforts was defined for this analysis as the mean number of KPs for which one PE is responsible (KP:PE ratio). The measure of KP:PE ratio was derived from the total number of KPs to be covered (donor target) divided by the number of active PEs reported by the programme. Outcome indicators such as the proportion of KPs regularly contacted through outreach, counselled on risk reduction, screened for STIs, tested for HIV, condom distribution, and who reported violence, were calculated using donor targets as denominators. It should be noted that these measures likely underestimate performance for some indicators. The target for HIV testing, for example, is the same as the ‘reach’ target, which includes known HIV-positive KPs who are not eligible for HIV testing. Condom distribution does not take into account fluctuating condom requirements, and violence reporting does not factor in reductions in violent incidents (which is a separate aim of the programme).
