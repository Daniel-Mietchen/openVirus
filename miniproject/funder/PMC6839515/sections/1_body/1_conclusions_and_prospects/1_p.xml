<p>Innovations in genomic techniques have the potential to bring a synthesis to the study of host-pathogen interactions across systems and environmental conditions. We highlighted several recent trends in this perspective for genomic studies of host-pathogen systems: (i) evolutionary genomics approaches have allowed the field to move from a candidate gene approach to investigations at the scale of whole genomes; (ii) the use of genomics for the detection and surveillance of host-pathogen systems; (iii) the challenges of the integrating natural history and ecological metadata and genomic data across systems and timescales due to infrastructural challenges of database integration and transparency; and (iv) the impact of anthropogenic stressors on host-pathogen systems that have consequences for global health. Additionally, our survey of the recent literature of ecological genomics of host-pathogen interactions revealed that studies with spatially and ecologically complex settings are rare, as are detailed studies of host genomic responses to pathogens. Any single host-pathogen study is constrained by limited resources or genomic tractability, the geographical and evolutionary time scales involved as well as environmental complexities. Accordingly, transparent and open science will help to achieve a comprehensive understanding of host-pathogen interactions in general. This will contribute to the integration of findings across the different scales (

A large repertoire of comparable and inter-communicative studies will facilitate a more generalizable understanding of the causes and consequences of host-pathogen interactions and a clearer roadmap to combating the continuous threat of pathogens in a changing world.
