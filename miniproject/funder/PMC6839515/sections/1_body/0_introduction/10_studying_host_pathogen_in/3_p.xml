<p>Human intervention also has the potential to alter pathogen communities directly, both by eliminating and by introducing pathogens (

 <xref rid="ref-131" ref-type="bibr">Rogalski et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the introduction of invasive species often inadvertently results in the introduction of novel pathogens against which native hosts may possess little or no protection (

Here again, major future challenges include sample availability, ecological monitoring, and the collection and deposition of appropriate metadata. Additionally, cross-disciplinary scientific integration and communication between scientists, managers and decision-makers are crucial in order to advance global health.
