<p>Natural systems are increasingly subjected to anthropogenic stressors, including climate change, urban development, overexploitation, pollution, noise, and transport (

In recognizing that no host-pathogen system exists in isolation, it is essential to understand how such stressors affect the host’s fitness, immune system and pathogen susceptibility. For instance, immunotoxic contaminants can have substantial population level effects by contributing to anthropogenic stress and infectious disease outbreaks (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Desforges et al., 2016</xref>). This is particularly true for marine and terrestrial top-predators, which, due to their life-history and placement at the top of the food chain, accumulate high levels of ecotoxins. Indeed, high tissue concentrations of persistent pollutants in Baltic seals in the 1970–80s were associated with oviduct occlusions and impaired immune system, leading to sterility and repeated infections (

 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr">Jepson et al., 2016</xref>). Such increased levels of ecotoxins may explain the increasing prevalence and severity of diseases in marine wildlife (
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Härkönen et al., 2006</xref>). A detailed understanding of the role of these and other stressors in host-pathogen systems will require multispecies and multi-methodological approaches integrating information at all levels of the system, including trophic interactions, resource availability, life-history and population dynamics, as well as gene expression and selection.
