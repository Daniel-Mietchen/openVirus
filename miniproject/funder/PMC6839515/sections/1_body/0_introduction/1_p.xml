<p>Pathogens are widely agreed to be among the strongest agents of natural selection in nature, and their influence on the genomes of host species is often readily detectable (

With the advent of rapid DNA sequencing technologies, genetic studies of host-pathogen interactions have moved from single gene perspectives to genome-wide approaches interrogating whole genomes of hosts and/or pathogens. At the same time, these studies have begun to tackle an increasingly diverse array of systems in both the field and laboratory, and have expanded from analysis of single pathogens to multiple pathogens under a variety of conditions. Environmental factors and gene-by-environment interactions, such as those beginning to be studied in microbiome research (
 <xref rid="ref-88" ref-type="bibr">Libertucci &amp; Young, 2019</xref>), are increasingly appreciated as important in modulating the severity and fitness consequences of infections (

As genomic approaches become increasingly accessible and affordable, it is becoming clear that the limiting factor in host-pathogen research is often not the technical aspects of sequencing pathogens or host genomes, but rather the ecological, immunological and epigenetic context in which genomic data are embedded (
