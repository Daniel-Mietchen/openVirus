<p>Overall, genome-wide techniques and approaches provide us with an unprecedented wealth of information upon which specific hypotheses can be formulated and experimentally tested. A lingering limitation to the impact of such studies is low quality and poor annotation of reference genomes, especially for non-model host species. This challenge considerably slows our rate of discovery because many important parts of the host genome that respond to pathogen infection may remain undiscovered if they do not assemble properly or lack known gene annotation. Furthermore, relevant links to host-pathogen interaction could be missed because the link between genetics and the expressed phenotype is only poorly understood (e.g., the layer of mucus covering the mucosal surface in vertebrates whose composition is relevant for the specific host-pathogen interaction; see Box 2).</p>
