<p>Simultaneous genome sequencing of multiple species—metagenomics—can help the field expand beyond the two-organism framework (
 <xref rid="ref-175" ref-type="bibr">Westermann, Barquist &amp; Vogel, 2017</xref>), as has been most extensively demonstrated in microbiome research in the context of host health (
 <xref rid="ref-143" ref-type="bibr">Sekirov et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Kamada et al., 2013</xref>). It is now clear that the whole microbial community shape host health, but are also in turn selected for and manipulated by hosts (

 <xref rid="ref-104" ref-type="bibr">Näpflin &amp; Schmid-Hempel, 2017</xref>). In particular, metagenomics is increasingly able to shed light on the function of individual members of the microbiome, for example, by investigating metabolic pathways present in the community (

Such approaches are employed by the PREDICT project of USAID which attempts to identify new zoonotic threats in “hot spot” regions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America by sampling wildlife (particularly non-human primates, bats, and rodents) as well as people with close contact with wildlife (
