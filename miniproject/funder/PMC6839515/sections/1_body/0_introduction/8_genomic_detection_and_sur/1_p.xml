<p>Ever since the invention of the polymerase chain reaction, molecular approaches have continuously provided sensitive methods for the detection of pathogens, often without prior separation from the host tissues (e.g., malaria pathogens

High throughput sequencing techniques have now become pivotal for both detection and identification of new pathogens, especially in cases of emerging infectious diseases, and in pathogens with complex life histories and co-infections (

Improved pathogen genomics holds great potential to advance our current understanding of host-pathogen interactions in several ways: from an epidemiological perspective, it allows one to reconstruct the spatial spread of pathogen invasion, illuminates pathogen population dynamics, and enables forecasting of future infection scenarios. Although this has been possible previously by using only a few key genetic markers from samples that spanned decades in time, such as in studies of influenza or rabies virus (

 <xref rid="ref-152" ref-type="bibr">Streicker et al., 2016</xref>), whole genome information now allows for high-resolution characterization of outbreaks over shorter timescales (e.g., Ebola (

 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Grubaugh et al., 2017</xref>)). In addition, open source genomic data-sharing sites and analysis platforms like nextstrain (

Moreover, genomic analyses of dated pathogen samples have proven successful in inferring directionality of pathogen spread, for example, among wildlife and livestock, thus informing effective control measures (
