<p>However, many technical challenges still remain for such approaches, especially in situations where pathogens cannot be physically separated from hosts (see Box 1 for an example). For example, pathogen DNA typically makes up only a small fraction of the total extracted DNA from samples of infected hosts, and host samples must therefore be sequenced at an immense depth to obtain even a low coverage of the pathogen (
 <xref rid="ref-168" ref-type="bibr">Videvall, 2019</xref>). A large number of enrichment protocols for high-throughput sequencing methods have been developed to facilitate the detection and quantification of pathogens. These enrichment protocols are often efficient ways of increasing the ratio of pathogen to host DNA. Before DNA extraction, intracellular pathogens can sometimes be isolated from infected host cells using cell-sorting or laser-capture microscopy techniques (

 <xref rid="ref-172" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), or separated from the host cells by targeting different life stages (e.g., gametes, spores) (
 <xref rid="ref-115" ref-type="bibr">Palinauskas et al., 2013</xref>). Also, the process of DNA extraction itself can be tailored to significantly enrich pathogen DNA by selective lysis of host cells (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Bachmann et al., 2018</xref>). This has been successfully demonstrated in the human clinical setting: saponin treatment selectively lyses human cells and thus enriches DNA concentration in mixed samples of diverse communities of microorganisms with an intact cell wall (
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et al., 2016</xref>). After DNA extraction, selective whole-genome amplification can specifically enrich for pathogen sequences in various ways: (i) by using oligos that are more abundant in the pathogen genome (
 <xref rid="ref-100" ref-type="bibr">Melnikov et al., 2011</xref>); (ii) by targeting differences in methylation between host and pathogen genomes (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Gómez-Díaz et al., 2012</xref>); (iii) by sequence capture enrichment protocols for pathogen DNA (
 <xref rid="ref-154" ref-type="bibr">Tagle et al., 1993</xref>); or (iv) by Nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing, a selective ligation of sequence adaptors at cut sites of Cas9 (
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Gilpatrick et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, real-time evaluation of sequence data such as is possible with Nanopore technology could be further exploited to enrich for pathogen sequences during active sequencing (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2019</xref>). When enrichment protocols are not feasible, host and pathogen associated reads can often be separated in silico using reference sequence databases. In such cases, low-coverage detection of genome fragments of pathogens in host genome sequencing reads is a straightforward and fruitful approach (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-84" ref-type="bibr">Laine et al., 2019</xref>). Using this approach, putative RNA viruses of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were identified from de novo assembled RNAseq reads (
 <xref rid="ref-173" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). Dual sequencing analysis of both host and pathogen can be further exploited to characterize the physiological response throughout the course of an infection (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Florens et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Jean Beltran et al., 2017</xref>). However, sequencing coverage and cost are major factors determining feasibility and scope of a study. Enrichment and optimization of protocols carry the caveat that they are study specific and, in many cases, not universally applicable.
