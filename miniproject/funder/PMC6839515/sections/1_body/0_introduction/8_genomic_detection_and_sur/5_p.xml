   <p>Barriers to infections—an example of difficulties linking genotype and phenotype.</p>
  </caption>
  <p>Hosts are continuously exposed to potential pathogens, yet the establishment of an infection upon encounter is a relatively rare event. Most pathogenic infections are successfully prevented by “simple” barriers, the host’s first lines of defense (

   <xref rid="ref-58" ref-type="bibr">Hall, Bento &amp; Ebert, 2017</xref>). One of the most underappreciated pre-infection barriers in (non-human) ecology is the continuously secreted layer of mucus covering the mucosal surface in vertebrates (Fig. 3A), and the glycocalyx that covers other epithelial cells and surrounds some single celled organisms (
   <xref rid="ref-125" ref-type="bibr">Quintana-Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>). As opposed to the skin, which is a dry, acidic, and of much smaller surface, the mucosal surface is orders of magnitude larger and presents a semipermeable, humid environment that many bacteria and pathogens could thrive in. However, the mucosal surfaces are protected by several layers of defense that a pathogen has to circumvent to either gain access to close interactions with host cells, or entry into host cells, or transferring across the host epithelium. The first barrier the pathogens encounter is the continuously secreted mucus layer covering the cells and the epithelial glycocalyx (
   <xref rid="ref-125" ref-type="bibr">Quintana-Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>), into which a range of antimicrobial molecules are secreted, the bulk of this layer consists of a massive amount of highly diverse glycans (Fig. 3B). Among these highly diverse glycoconjugates, there are those that act as protection against infection by binding and disseminating the pathogen, act as steric hindrance or releasable decoys, but also those that act as receptors for pathogens and confer intimate adherence (

   <xref rid="ref-113" ref-type="bibr">Padra et al., 2018</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>In fact, across mammalian and teleost species, most known interactions between viral or bacterial pathogens and their hosts occur via host glycan structures (
   <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Aspholm-Hurtig, 2004</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr">Linden et al., 2008a</xref>;

   <xref rid="ref-147" ref-type="bibr">Skoog et al., 2017</xref>). Interactions between host glycans and pathogens are thus central for host-pathogen specificity and virulence. As such, one would expect that host glycans and pathogen adhesins are subjected to strong selective pressure (
   <xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr">Linden et al., 2008a</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-90" ref-type="bibr">Lindén et al., 2008b</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-91" ref-type="bibr">Linden et al., 2010</xref>, 2010; 
   <xref rid="ref-170" ref-type="bibr">Vitiazeva et al., 2015</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-167" ref-type="bibr">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2017</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-166" ref-type="bibr">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2019</xref>). While certain individual interactions between host glycans and pathogen adhesins have been dissected in detail (
   <xref rid="ref-133" ref-type="bibr">Rydell et al., 2011</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Bugaytsova et al., 2017</xref>) it remains difficult to actually identify different glycoconjugate compositions and their underlying genetic basis.
  </p>
  <p>While enzymes involved in glycan biosynthesis are easily identified based on sequence identity (curated collection: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cazy.org</ext-link>; 
   <xref rid="ref-95" ref-type="bibr">Lombard et al., 2013</xref>) and make up about 5% of the total genome (
   <xref rid="ref-128" ref-type="bibr">Rini, Varki &amp; Esko, 2015</xref>) the resulting glycan structures are governed by stochastic events, substrate availability and state of differentiation and physiological environment. Thus, with the currently available knowledge it is not feasible to predict glycan repertoire and biosynthetic machinery based solely on genomic and/or transcriptomic sequence data of the host. In addition, we currently lack the ability to screen large sample sets for glycan repertoire because mass spectrometric based glycomics discovery is at its best only semi-automatic. Additionally, on the pathogen side, most adhesins of pathogenic organisms have yet to be identified and characterized. In conclusion, advances in the biological understanding of the system and technological innovation likely need to go hand-in-hand with functional validation of the underlying genetic basis to advance the genotype-phenotype mapping of glycan structures generally, and particularly in the host-pathogen context.
