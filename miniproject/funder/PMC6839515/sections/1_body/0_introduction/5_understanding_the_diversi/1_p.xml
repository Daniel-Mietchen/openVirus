<p>We have outlined in the introduction that the published literature on host-pathogen interaction spans a diverse range of genomic, ecological and spatiotemporal scales. However, how the current published literature is distributed within this multidimensional space has not, until now, been mapped out (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To understand the range of investigation at the genomic, ecological and spatiotemporal scale in recent studies on host-pathogen systems, and to discern where gaps in recent efforts might persist, we performed a literature search to classify and quantify the distribution of studies across these three scales. For this, we reviewed 263 studies of host-pathogen interactions published in the period between 2014â€“2018 (see 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for scoring categories and Survey Methodology for specific details). A better understanding of the current placement of host-pathogen studies should help us gain a better insight into how genomics has contributed and will continue to contribute to the understanding of host-pathogen interactions from the perspectives of hosts or pathogens and at various levels of biological detail.
