<p>The evaluation of published studies on host-pathogen systems not only reveals the expected recent increase in whole genome datasets for a broad range of host-pathogen studies, but also what is missing when addressing complex systems on ecological and spatiotemporal scales. This highlights a gap that future efforts might be specifically focused on in order to be able to project and test whether the identified underlying genetics of host-pathogen interactions scale-up from simple systems, such as a laboratory study, to ecological and spatiotemporal complex situations in the wild. The quantity and complexity of the sequence data generated in many recent and ongoing studies of host-pathogen interactions presents a unique opportunity for further investigations addressing as yet unexplored aspects of the data. Perhaps most critically, however, we suspect that this massive volume of complex data poses an increasing challenge for comparisons across studies. The lack of comprehensive cross-taxon comparative databases of host-pathogen interactions likely impedes the synthesis of individual host-pathogen studies and translation of new knowledge into solutions for real world problems. In the real-world, (a) pathogens attack hosts in the context of changing host environments, (b) these environments are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic forces such as climate change, and (c) are usually characterized by diverse communities of pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms. Our cross-section of recent studies of host-pathogen interactions suggests that these complexities are rarely captured in a single study. Thus, it will be essential to conduct comparative studies and perform meta-analyses of existing data across systems in order to achieve a comprehensive synthesis of how genomics can address host-pathogen interactions at different scales. In the following sections, we aim to highlight a few examples of challenges and opportunities and conclude with a suggestion of how integration across studies might be more successfully achieved through improved data and workflow documentation.</p>
