<p>We scored each study on three scales: genomic complexity, temporal and spatial complexity, and ecological complexity (see 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for the scoring key and definition). We found that high genomic resolution (mean score = 5.4 ± 2.1 SD, range = 1–7) at the level of the whole genome is employed to investigate questions that span the whole range of ecological scales, from theory, laboratory systems, and to multi-species natural systems with environmental variability (mean score = 4.1 ± 2.4 SD, range = 1–9; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Investigations of pathogen genomics dominate the dataset, whereas whole genome investigations of hosts are less common and more often examine a reduced representation of the genome (e.g., ddRADSeq, sequence capture, genotype by sequencing), transcriptome, or proteome. Studies encompassing the interaction of both host and pathogens simultaneously are rare. Genomic techniques are rarely used to address complex spatiotemporal scales (mean score = 4.1 ± 2.3 SD, range = 2–11), such as throughout the geographical range of a species, or across multiple different species. (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1D</xref>). However, only a few studies are classified as complex in terms of spatiotemporal setting: across all studies spatial (mean score = 1.6 ± 1.0 SD, range = 1–5) and temporal scores (mean score = 2.4 ± 1.7 SD, range = 1–6) are on average low. In particular, studies of complex spatial scales, such as interrogation across multiple populations across a species’ range, are virtually missing. An overview of the general advantages and disadvantages of different genomic, ecological, temporal and spatial scales are summarized in
