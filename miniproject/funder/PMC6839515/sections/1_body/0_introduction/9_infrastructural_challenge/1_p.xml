<p>The genomic data revolution driven by high-throughput sequencing has created numerous exciting opportunities to study host-pathogen interactions in a multitude of systems in unprecedented detail. This revolution extends to non-model organisms, although inference here may be hampered by a lack of suitable and/or sufficient host or pathogen samples. Moreover, even when such obstacles can be overcome, two major problems of relevance to this review continue to constrain the full impact, reuse, synthesis and reproducibility of host-pathogen studies, particularly for non-model systems: both involve the deposition and analysis of associated sequence data. First, while it should be standard practice to deposit at a minimum raw sequence data in well-curated, detail-rich national databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), or the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), the associated biological metadata of these samples are often inadequate or misleading due to various inconsistencies in available sample information that is being deposited. This problem is not trivial to resolve in the context of host-pathogen studies, in part because the complexity of the standardized metadata forms of these platforms for deposition and retrieval of data (

 <xref rid="ref-146" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Second, the analysis of genomic data is preceded by a large number of computationally complicated pre-processing steps. The choice of algorithm and parameters in this pre-processing procedure can often have significant impacts on the final results but are generally inadequately documented and communicated. Together, the missing metadata and the lack of transparency regarding computational tools confound or even prevent robust meta-analysis and comparative studies; and without meta-analyses and comparative studies, results from individual studies of various host-pathogen systems cannot be integrated into a larger context.
