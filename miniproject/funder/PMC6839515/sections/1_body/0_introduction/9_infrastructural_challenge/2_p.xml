<p>Improving the availability of metadata and the transparency of computational tools requires researchers to collect and analyze their data in an open format, with the goal of making the data and the methods publicly available and useable for comparative studies. Because the interactions between hosts and their pathogens are inherently dynamic across space and time, accurate information on sampling location and timing is essential information to include in metadata. This includes the host source of isolation for pathogens and the infection prevalence of hosts. Importantly, the nomenclature of genetically identical strains or species must be consistent. For example, despite being genetically identical the haemosporidian lineage “
 <italic>Haemoproteus</italic> lineage 22” from birds, first described in 2002, has repeatedly been named differently in publications appearing between 2002-2009: “AP21”, “COLL2” “SWTH.H2”, and “WHA24” (

An obvious first step is to improve the design, user-friendliness and programming interface of existing popular databases for metadata. An integration of a large amount of data sources has been developed for some systems, such as haemosporidian pathogens in birds (MalAvi database,

Such efforts should ideally be extended to all host-pathogen systems and are being realized more systematically under the umbrella of The Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomics Resource (EuPathDB), a database of pathogen genomic data that currently includes a dozen pathogen groups (
