<p>As outlined above, the co-evolution of host and pathogens can result in distinct and measurable genomic signatures of selection, which can reveal the genetic mechanisms by which hosts and their pathogens interact. The genomics revolution has spurred the transition from single-candidate gene studies to genome wide analyses of hosts and pathogens. Historically, a number of different candidate host immune genes families have attracted particular attention for studies of host-pathogen interactions, including components of the innate immune system such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) (
