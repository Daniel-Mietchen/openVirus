<p>Although the candidate gene approach has been the standard method for studying immune genes in the context of host-pathogen interactions, the rapidly decreasing costs of high throughput sequencing are making whole-genome approaches much more feasible. Whole-genome population genetic and comparative genomic studies allow unbiased detection of regions of the genome that are evolving non-neutrally across a variety of time scales. When combined with functional annotations or association studies, such comprehensive genome-wide surveys permit incisive tests of the effects of pathogens on host genomes that are simply not possible from candidate gene studies. Furthermore, whole genome studies are not restricted by 
 <italic>a priori</italic> predictions of which genes are important in responding to pathogen challenges. Thus, whole-genome approaches offer the potential to reveal new unbiased insights into the genetic basis of host-pathogen interactions, e.g., (

 <xref rid="ref-145" ref-type="bibr">Shultz &amp; Sackton, 2019</xref>). Since multiple genes are most often involved in a hostâ€™s response to a particular pathogen, whole-genome approaches also have the potential to reveal these understudied polygenic responses (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Daub et al., 2013</xref>). However, a major caveat associated with the whole-genome approach is that genomic regions of high repeat content, or highly duplicated genes, often do not assemble well or at all, whether considering host or pathogen. This is particularly problematic in the case of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> genome assemblies in non-model species (
 <xref rid="ref-118" ref-type="bibr">Peona, Weissensteiner &amp; Suh, 2018</xref>). Genome assembly problems may be a significant disadvantage for host-pathogen studies given that some key genes which play a role in innate and adaptive immunity are not only highly duplicated but also to some degree physically linked in the genome, such as the beta-defensin and MHC genes (
 <xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr">Kaufman et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Hellgren &amp; Ekblom, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Balakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>). Improved sequence and scaffolding techniques are being developed to remedy problems of assembling such regions (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Dilthey et al., 2015</xref>) and some may be possible to overcome with long-read sequencing methods (
 <xref rid="ref-118" ref-type="bibr">Peona, Weissensteiner &amp; Suh, 2018</xref>). Thus, while the whole-genome approach may become a gold standard for many host-pathogen studies in the future, we currently see a continued need for sequencing methods that target focal genes or a reduced representation of the whole genome, in particular in studies of non-model species.
