   <p>Demonstrating pathogen-induced fitness costs in the wild.</p>
  </caption>
  <p>Determining where an organism lies on the mutualist-pathogen continuum requires an assessment of the fitness costs (i.e., virulence) elicited by a putative pathogen when it has established itself within its host in its natural habitat. In such a scenario, the feasibility of estimating fitness costs strongly depends, on the one hand, on the magnitude of the fitness effect and, on the other hand, the sample size. For example, severe negative fitness effects in birds due to infections by the introduced malaria pathogen 
   <italic>Plasmodium relictum</italic>, have been readily demonstrated in several species of Hawaiian honeycreepers (
   <italic>Drepanididae</italic>) (
   <xref rid="ref-164" ref-type="bibr">Van Riper et al., 1986</xref>)). However, when 
   <italic>P. relictum</italic> infects host species with which it has presumably co-evolved, observed fitness costs are lower (
   <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Bensch et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, hypothetically, demonstrating a negative fitness effect (i.e., mortality) of 5% year-on-year in natural populations (assuming a pathogen prevalence of 20% and an annual background mortality of 50%) requires a sample size of more than 2,000 host individuals and the ability to accurately measure individual survival. The situation becomes even more complex when hosts are repeatedly exposed to the same pathogen and mortality varies across exposures. For example, if mortality is highest upon primary infection, in year two individuals that were unexposed in year one will be at a higher risk of dying than individuals that have been previously exposed. Often only long-term studies, such as that conducted by 
   <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Asghar et al. (2015)</xref> on the effects of 
   <italic>Plasmodium</italic> on lifetime fitness and survival of Great Reed Warblers, provide the sensitivity required to detect fitness costs.
  </p>
  <p>Given that the ecological role of an organism can be dynamic, the fitness consequences for a host of a particular pathogen are strongly dependent on the environmental and genetic context. The most obvious illustration of this is variation in virulence associated with host switches: 
   <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> infection in house finches as compared to other song birds (
   <xref rid="ref-87" ref-type="bibr">Ley et al., 2016</xref>), Ebola virus in humans as compared to bats (
   <xref rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr">Leroy et al., 2005</xref>), or the morbillivirus Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) in harbor seals as compared to other Arctic pinniped species (
   <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Härkönen et al., 2006</xref>) are all cases where virulence dramatically increased after switching to a new host. Second, another level of complexity presents itself in the cases of complex pathogen life cycles, where pathogens may require multiple host species for different developmental stages in order to complete their life cycle (
   <xref rid="ref-116" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 2003</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Blasco-Costa &amp; Poulin, 2017</xref>). In cases such as these, it is often difficult to differentiate between pathogen species and different pathogen life stages morphologically. Third, infections by a single pathogen might actually be rare in nature, instead co-infections by multiple pathogen strains or species are likely to be the norm (
   <xref rid="ref-119" ref-type="bibr">Petney &amp; Andrews, 1998</xref>). In this context, exposure history and the timing of infection might play crucial roles in terms of host fitness and pathogen virulence (
   <xref rid="ref-156" ref-type="bibr">Telfer et al., 2010</xref>; 
   <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Ami, Rigaud &amp; Ebert, 2011</xref>). Fourth, pathogen prevalence may vary across space and time and, hence, these patterns need to be taken into consideration in comparisons across scales (
   <xref rid="ref-160" ref-type="bibr">Thompson, 2009</xref>). This can be on a small scale within a host (e.g., between tissues), or across geographical space (e.g., between populations/species). For example, comparison of host and viral population structure suggests that dispersing male bats spread the rabies virus between genetically isolated female populations (
   <xref rid="ref-152" ref-type="bibr">Streicker et al., 2016</xref>). Fifth, hosts and their pathogens rarely interact in isolation but rather as part of a larger ecosystem, which might modulate how a pathogen interacts with its host and vice versa (
   <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Graham, 2008</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>Overall, the availability of large genomic datasets has been pivotal in untangling each of the five levels of complexity. Nevertheless, relying solely on genetic data can be misleading. While new techniques help to identify new pathogens, ecological patterns, and link the genetic structure of host and pathogen populations, the resulting data are ultimately correlational and cannot establish any causal relationships without an experimental approach. For example, sticklebacks (
   <italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) caught in a lake harbored more macroparasites than those from a river (
   <xref rid="ref-174" ref-type="bibr">Wegner, Reusch &amp; Kalbe, 2003</xref>). With only this observation, one might be tempted to conclude that the sticklebacks from lakes were more susceptible to parasitism than those from rivers. However, subsequent experiments revealed that sticklebacks from lakes were less susceptible to pathogens, but probably experienced higher pathogen exposure (
   <xref rid="ref-140" ref-type="bibr">Scharsack &amp; Kalbe, 2014</xref>). This illustrates the need for experimental studies to confirm causal relationships implicated by field data. However, experiments are restricted in the complexity they can represent (
   <xref rid="ref-121" ref-type="bibr">Plowright et al., 2008</xref>). In conclusion, the interpretation of genetic data without a deep understanding of the host-pathogen ecology, and vice versa, can be misleading.
