<p>A combination of selection scans and association studies has revealed important insights into differences in infectious disease susceptibilities, the identification of specific protective genes and alleles, and their evolutionary origin in humans, the most intensely studied organism with respect to disease (

 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Bourgeois et al. (2017)</xref> was able to confirm and refine previously identified quantitative trait loci that confer resistance in the planktonic crustacean

 <italic>Pasteuria ramosa.</italic> Furthermore, investigations of signals of selection have identified additional genomic regions consistent with the evolution of resistance that were not identified by association approaches. Such loci present further candidates moderating the host-pathogen interactions, but without a clear association with specific phenotypic traits, evolution in response to other environmental variables correlated with pathogens often cannot be excluded (
