<p>Genetic variation is typically studied at different levels, such as across species (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2B</xref>), within populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2C</xref>) or through time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2D</xref>) to disentangle the underlying genetics of host-pathogen interactions. For this purpose, two main approaches are typically employed. On the one hand, the underlying genetic architecture can be inferred using genotype-phenotype association studies. The statistical association between genomic loci and host-pathogen phenotypes is interpreted as evidence for the underlying genetics of a given phenotype (

 <xref rid="ref-134" ref-type="bibr">Sabeti et al., 2006</xref>). While these genome scans typically cannot directly test the causal selective agent, they do provide insight into the possible biological processes that are adapting most rapidly in host genomes (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Biswas &amp; Akey, 2006</xref>). Indeed, analysis of signatures of selection in host genomes identified pathogens as the most likely drivers of the observed patterns in a number of studies. For example, in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Sackton and co-authors (
 <xref rid="ref-136" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) identified that a class of immune genes that directly interact with pathogens, such as receptor genes, exhibited a high proportion of genes under positive selection compared to genome-wide observations. Similarly, across mammals, viral interacting proteins have stronger signals of adaptation than other protein-coding genes across the genome (
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Enard et al., 2016</xref>), and more of these genes than expected by chance are also evolving by positive selection in birds (
