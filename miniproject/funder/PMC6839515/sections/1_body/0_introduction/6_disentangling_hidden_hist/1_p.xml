<p>The pathogenic lifestyle is ubiquitous across the tree of life, and pathogens are estimated to represent a substantial proportion of the diversity and biomass of many ecosystems (

 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr">Kamada et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that a pathogen rarely occurs alone, and instead may commonly be a member of a larger community (

 <xref rid="ref-141" ref-type="bibr">Schmid-Hempel, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Gregory et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, understanding the interplay between multiple pathogens and associated microbiomes requires disentangling several levels of complexity. It is also crucial to gain an understanding of the fitness effects of each putative pathogen on its host, because the magnitude of the fitness cost (i.e., virulence) of a pathogen during infection determines its place on the mutualist-pathogen continuum. In principal, this requires demonstration of a fitness cost to the host, yet demonstrating fitness effects of many putative pathogens in nature is challenging and often requires datasets that are much larger than those obtained in a typical field study (see Box 1). Importantly, the fact that measuring the fitness consequences of infections in wild animals is challenging does not imply that pathogens are insignificant selective agents in the evolution of host genomes. In fact, pathogens are widely presumed to be among the strongest selective agents (
