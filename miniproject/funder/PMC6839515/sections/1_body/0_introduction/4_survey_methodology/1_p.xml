<p>This perspective piece is the result of discussions held during the “Origins of Biodiversity Workshop” organized during May 29–June 2, 2017 by Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, under the auspices of the Gothenburg Centre for Advanced Studies (GoCAS). We gathered international scholars and students with interdisciplinary backgrounds to discuss future perspectives of the study of host-pathogen co-evolution in the genomic era. During the workshop we identified major directions that have been enabled by advances in genomic techniques and in particular we highlight the resulting diversity of host-pathogen studies in their ecological, temporal and genomic detail at which they are studied. Our goal is not to provide a complete overview of the host-pathogen literature, but rather to illustrate the diversity of recent research undertaken in the field and the associated challenges towards a comparable and inter-communicative understanding of causes and consequences of host-pathogen interactions across systems. To quantify currently studied dimensions (ecological complexity, spatiotemporal scope and genomic scale; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1A</xref>) of host-pathogen research we conducted a literature search on Web of Science (accessed August 30, 2018) with the following search query: (host-parasite* OR host-pathogen*) AND (genomic*). We refined the search hits by document type to include only articles, covering the publication years 2014–2018. Of a total of 341 screened publications from this search, 10 publications were excluded due to access problems, 12 publications were unrelated to host-pathogen research, 48 publications were identified as review articles, and an additional 8 publications were excluded because no genomic aspect was present. In total, we scored and evaluated 263 papers based on broadly defined categories for each scale defined in 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The categories were chosen to represent a rough continuous scale along the genomic, ecological, and spatiotemporal axes (
