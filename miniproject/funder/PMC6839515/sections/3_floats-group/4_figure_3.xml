  <title>The mucosal surface.</title>
  <p>Photomicrographs (A and B) show two staining variants of the colonic mucosal tissue (T) of a healthy mouse, where a mucus layer (M) keeps the majority of the fecal bacteria (FB) from direct contact with the surface of the epithelial cells. In panel (A), the Muc2 mucin (the main component of the mucus layer) is stained in green and nuclei from the eukaryote cells in the tissue are stained blue. Muc2 is produced by cells in the mucosal tissue, secreted into the mucus layer, and present in degraded form in the fecal material. In panel (B), the mucosal epithelial tissue is outlined with red, eukaryotic nuclei are purple, the mucus layer unstained (but clearly visible due to the absence of bacteria) and the bacteria are labelled green. Panel (C) gives an overview of glycan structures that build the mucus layer and glycocalyx. Glycolipids and glycoproteins are anchored in the eukaryotic cell membrane, and secreted mucins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins consisting of 70â€“90% of glycans that make up the bulk of the mucus layer. The glycans can be longer and more complex than depicted in this illustration. The glycans can be either N-linked (via Nitrogen in asparagine) or O-linked (via Oxygen in serine or threonine) to the protein core, and these two types of glycan chains differ with regards to biosynthetic pathway and structure.
