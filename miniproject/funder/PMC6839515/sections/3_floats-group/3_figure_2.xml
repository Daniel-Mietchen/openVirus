  <title>Schematic illustration how genetic variation varies (A) across species, (B) across populations, (C) within a population, and (D) on an ecological time scale.</title>
  <p>(A) Comparative genomics across species can be used to identify genomic loci consistently under positive selection in particular lineages or all lineages. (B) Across populations, population genomic variation in different geographic populations can be correlated with pathogen communities. (C) Within a single population, phenotypic variation among individuals can be linked to pathogen variation or differentially expressed genes with transcriptomics. Genome scans may also identify regions of the genome under selection. (D) Finally, time series either derived through experimental evolution or studies of ancient DNA or diachronic samples can be used to identify the dynamics of a phenotype or allele frequency through time.</p>
