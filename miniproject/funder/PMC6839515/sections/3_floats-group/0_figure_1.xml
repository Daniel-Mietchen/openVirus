  <title>The diversity of recent studies of host-pathogen interactions.</title>
  <p>(A) Each of three scales of complexity—genomic, ecological and spatiotemporal—is represented as an axis in this illustration. A study of host-pathogen interaction is placed into this three-dimensional space based on the level of genetic, ecological, and spatiotemporal detail that is being studied (see 
   <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for scores of scales). (B–D) Pie charts summarize the results of the scores for the level of genetic, ecological, and spatiotemporal complexity investigated in host-pathogen studies published between 2014–2018. (B) The complexity of the ecological and genomic settings across studies are not correlated (Spearman’s 
   <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.02, 
   <italic>p</italic>-value adjusted = 1.00; (C) nor are the genomic and spatiotemporal scale (
   <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.16, 
   <italic>p</italic>-value adj. = 0.13. (D) In contrast, the ecological scale positively correlates with the score of spatiotemporal scale across studies (
   <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.50, 
   <italic>p</italic>-value adj. = 0.00).
