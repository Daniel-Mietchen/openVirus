<p>Seasonal and pandemic infections by influenza viruses represent a major threat. Seasonal influenza viruses infect 5–15% of the human population annually, resulting in more than half a million deaths worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Strain complexity, virus drift, and viral reassortment make it difficult to develop vaccines providing protection against a wide range of influenza strains. Current trivalent vaccines include one H1N1, one H3N2 IAV strain and one IBV strain of either the Yamagata or Victoria lineages [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Quadrivalent vaccines include two influenza B strains, one Yamagata and one Victoria strain, in addition to the two IAV strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The efficacy of the annual influenza vaccine varies widely from 10–60% [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and the vaccine does not provide universal influenza virus protection [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Currently, all antivirals face the problem of increasing drug resistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find novel mechanisms by which influenza can be fought, preferably in a strain-independent fashion.
