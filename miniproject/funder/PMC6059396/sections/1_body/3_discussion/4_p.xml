<p>IBVs can cause symptoms similar to IAVs in humans, and are responsible for a large proportion of seasonal influenza infections [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Far less is known regarding the viral and host determinants of IBV disease pathogenicity [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The immune response against IBV is affected by yearly trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines and typically is weaker in humans than that against IAVs [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. NA inhibitors that work well against most strains of IAV are typically less effective for IBVs [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, novel approaches are needed to confront IBV. Our results show that the B/Yamagata/16/1988 strain is sensitive against the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/SCN
 <sup>-</sup> system but remains more resistant against the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/I
 <sup>-</sup> system. After testing two other IBV strains, this pattern failed to be confirmed suggesting that it could be strain-specific. Testing a larger number of IBV strains is needed for a firmer conclusion. Nevertheless, our findings are the first to show that the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/SCN
 <sup>-</sup> antimicrobial system efficiently inactivates IBV strains, as well.
