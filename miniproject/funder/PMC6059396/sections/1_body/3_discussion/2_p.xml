Our results reported here are one of the first ones to document its efficacy against influenza virus. Our prior results established that the H

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/SCN
 <sup>-</sup> system behaves in a very similar fashion and inactivates the same H1N2 strain under cell-free experimental conditions. This cell-free system provides us with an important tool to address the specificity and the mechanism of action of the LPO-based system against influenza viruses. It is important to emphasize that influenza viruses are inactivated by the H

 <sup>-</sup>) system in both the cell-free and airway epithelial model [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in less than 60 minutes. Very few, if any, mechanism of the innate immune system reacts so fast and efficiently.
