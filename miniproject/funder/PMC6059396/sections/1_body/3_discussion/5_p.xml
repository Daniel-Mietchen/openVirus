<p>Given the wealth of historical data showing that these LPO-generated products have antimicrobial effects, they could be used for either therapeutic or prophylactic supplementation before infection or drugs, in combination with current anti-influenza therapies to enhance viral elimination and diminish inflammation. SCN

 <sup>-</sup> in humans have been reported at physiological concentrations (reviewed in [

While lower dose of iodide intake is safe and associated with normal thyroid function, recent works have proven that alterations in thyroid function are associated with high iodide supplementation in maternal rats and their offspring [
