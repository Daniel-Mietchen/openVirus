<p>In the current work we expanded our observation made on the IAV H1N2 strain to other influenza strains. Our central focus has been to address the question of whether SCN
 <sup>-</sup> or I
 <sup>-</sup> serves as a better substrate for the anti-influenza action of LPO. We revealed a LPO substrate preference of influenza inactivation that appears more complex than expected. Based on the current survey of influenza strains we conclude that H3N2 IAV strains are inactivated by OI
 <sup>-</sup> more effectively than by OSCN
 <sup>-</sup>. This is presented as an “H3N2 cluster” on LPO’s substrate preference map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g008">Fig 8</xref>). We did not find this bias towards I
 <sup>-</sup> in case of the other IAVs (H1N1 and H1N2) that were inactivated by the LPO substrates. The potential explanation for this is unclear at the moment but redox-sensitive disulfide bonds may be different among HA or NA subtypes that could help explain this observation [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Differences in OI
 <sup>—</sup>or OSCN
 <sup>—</sup>mediated oxidative modifications of these bonds could lead to altered virion disassembly or inhibition of viral entry into host cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Oxidative stress has been shown to inactivate influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Oxidative damage of the lipid components of the viral envelope or the nucleoprotein could be also the results of the antimicrobial action of LPO [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Differences in susceptibilities of influenza viruses to polyphenols were linked to viral envelope glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. OI
 <sup>-</sup> has a higher oxidative strength than OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. While the main potential targets of OSCN
 <sup>-</sup>/HOSCN are certain SH groups, OI
 <sup>-</sup>/HOI can target SH groups, NAD(P)H, reduced pyridine nucleotides, thioether groups and NH2 groups [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These molecular differences could form the basis for the observed inactivation patterns of influenza viruses in our study. The virucidal effect of OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> and OI
 <sup>-</sup> may be due to their ability to either interact with viral HA or NA directly and interfere with viral cell entry or to cross the outer layer of the viral envelop before oxidizing critical viral elements inside the virion. We know that beneath the lipid membrane of the influenza virus, a viral protein called M1 matrix protein is expressed and may be reacting with OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> or OI
 <sup>-</sup> and interfere with viral infectivity [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Other viral proteins that are cysteine-rich may be the targets of these antiviral agents. In bacteria, for example, the reported bacterial targets of OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> are critical cysteine residues found in glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde triphosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, glycose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and aldolase leading to the hypothesis that OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> effect on bacterial growth is glycolysis-mediated [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Glucose transport and respiration may also be the target of OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> and OI
 <sup>-</sup>. It has been reported to inhibit the activity of urease, which is critical to the ability of H. pylori to alkalinize gastric juice and colonize the stomach [
