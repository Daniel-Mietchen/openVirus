<p>Components of the LPO-based antiviral system were used at the following concentrations: 6.5 μg/ml LPO, 400 μM SCN
 <sup>-</sup>/I
 <sup>-</sup>, glucose (0.005 M) and glucose oxidase 0.01 U/mL. The reaction volume was set to 40 μL with the appropriate concentration of each component mentioned above. Catalase (700 U/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was also used when indicated to inhibit the system. The components were assembled in a sterile Eppendorf tube with the virus being added last. The tubes were then placed on a 37°C heating block for one hour. After the incubation, supernatants were stored at -80°C. Plaque assays were performed on MDCK cells to determine viral concentrations as previously described [
