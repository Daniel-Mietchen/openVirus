 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Briefly, MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing high glucose (HyClone) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone) and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Viral strains were cultured in MDCK cells using infection medium (DMEM containing high glucose supplemented with 1 mM L-glutamine with 1-μg/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone [TPCK]-treated trypsin). Viruses were collected 24–48 hours post-infection.
