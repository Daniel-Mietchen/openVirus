<p>To summarize our results after surveying 12 different influenza strains for their susceptibilities and LPO substrate preferences in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/(SCN
 <sup>-</sup>/I
 <sup>-</sup>) system, we plotted our data as a “substrate preference or susceptibility map” shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g008">Fig 8</xref>. The X-axis represents the extent of viral inactivation that is associated with OSCN
 <sup>-</sup>, while the Y-axis represents the extent of viral inactivation by OI
 <sup>-</sup>. The higher the number, the more susceptible a particular virus strain is to the indicated, LPO-generated antiviral agent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The indicated diagonal crossing the map from the lower left corner to the upper right corner indicates no substrate preference (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The H1N2 influenza strain tested localizes to the upper right corner indicating high susceptibility to the LPO-based antimicrobial system with no considerable preference for the LPO substrate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g008">Fig 8</xref>). All H1N1 strains appear on the diagonal showing no preference for the LPO substrate. While the A/Brisbane/59/2007 strain can be found in the lower left corner, the A/California/04/2009, A/Mississippi/3/2001, and A/Turkey/Kansas/4880/1980 strains are, however, all located in the upper right corner, close to the H1N2 strain, representing widely distinct susceptibilities of the tested H1N1 viruses towards the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/(SCN
 <sup>-</sup>/I
 <sup>-</sup>) system. All four H3N2 influenza A strains showed a clear and noteworthy preference for I
 <sup>-</sup> as the LPO substrate for their inactivation in the cell-free system and were grouped together into an “H3N2 cluster” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The first IBV strain tested (B/Yamagata/16/1988) mapped into the lower right corner indicating its highly susceptible nature to OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> but almost resistance towards OI
 <sup>-</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Two further IBV strains, however, failed to confirm this trend and localized to the vicinity of the center of the graph. Overall, our work represents an unexpected complexity of influenza virus inactivation by the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/(SCN
 <sup>-</sup>/I
 <sup>-</sup>) system.
