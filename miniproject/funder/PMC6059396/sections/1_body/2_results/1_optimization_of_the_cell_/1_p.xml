<p>LPO is produced by submucosal glands and epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and it accumulates in the airway surface liquid [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. LPO concentration in airway secretions has been estimated to be in the range of 3–12 μg/ml [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We used a physiologically relevant LPO concentration of 6.5 μg/ml in our cell-free assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thiocyanate is present in airway secretions in submillimolar concentrations [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Accordingly, we used 400 μM SCN
 <sup>-</sup> in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, and used 400 μM iodide as alternative LPO substrate. The same LPO and SCN
 <sup>-</sup> concentrations were used as previously published in our prior studies using primary bronchial epithelial cells to make results comparable between the cell-free system and epithelial cultures [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> has been detected in airway secretions of humans and other mammalian species, estimating its basal levels is difficult due to its volatile nature. The main 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> sources of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the airways are NADPH oxidases called Dual Oxidase 1 and 2 (Duox 1/2) [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Duox enzymes are highly expressed in the apical plasma membrane of BECs and generate H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> directly into the airway surface liquid [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> system containing BECs, Duox enzymes generate H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> driving the antimicrobial action of LPO [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the cell-free system described here, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is provided by the enzymatic reaction of glucose (5 mM) and glucose oxidase (GO) that produces D-gluconic acid as the end product (

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Generating H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by an enzymatic reaction better models the slow but maintained nature and kinetics of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> release by BECs than a bolus-like addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To mimic the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> output of BECs in the cell-free system, we titrated the dose of GO and chose 0.01 U/ml, a concentration that is the closest to the hourly H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> production of BECs [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (data not shown). Thus, the components of the cell-free system are used in concentrations that are physiologically relevant.
