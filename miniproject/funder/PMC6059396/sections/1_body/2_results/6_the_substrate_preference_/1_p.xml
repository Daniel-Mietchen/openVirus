<p>To test whether the observed, marked difference in susceptibility to OSCN

 <sup>-</sup> of the B/Yamagata/16/1988 strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) is a unique feature of this strain or is generally true for all IBV strains, we tested two additional IBV strains. The B/Great Lakes/1739/1954 strain that also belongs to the Yamagata lineage [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was efficiently inactivated (n = 5) by both, OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> (6.00+/-0.98 log decrease) and OI
 <sup>-</sup> (4.34+/-1.13 log decrease), with a slight preference to OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The B/New York/1056/2003 IBV strain belongs to the Victoria lineage and has been isolated from a pharyngeal swab from a human with unspecified respiratory disease (BEI Resources). This Victoria lineage strain was equally inactivated by OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> (3.23+/-1.00 log decrease) and OI
 <sup>-</sup> (3.23+/-0.75 log decrease, n = 3) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). LPO-mediated inactivation of all three IBV strains was entirely blocked by catalase (

 <sup>-</sup>, data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6C</xref> did not find an overall significant difference between OSCN
 <sup>—</sup>fueled and OI
 <sup>—</sup>mediated inactivation of IBV strains.
