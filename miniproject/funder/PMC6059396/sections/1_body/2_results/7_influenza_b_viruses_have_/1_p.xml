<p>To explore whether there are differences in the previous readouts between IAV and IBV strains, we compared susceptibilities to OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> and OI
 <sup>-</sup>, as well as, their ratio called “OSCN
 <sup>-</sup>/OI
 <sup>-</sup> susceptibility ratio” between the IAV and IBV strains analyzed. As 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows, there was no significant difference between the two viral species in their susceptibilities to the virucidal agents. However, we observed a significant difference (p = 0.0182) in their susceptibility ratios as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g007">Fig 7</xref> (right panel). All IAV strains had very low ratios (0.73+/-0.13, mean+/-S.E.M., n = 9) while IBV strains had much higher values (4.00+/-2.35, mean+/-S.E.M., n = 3) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Thus, IBV strains tend to be more sensitive to OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> whereas IAV strains are equally sensitive to both LPO substrates or more susceptible to OI
 <sup>-</sup>.
