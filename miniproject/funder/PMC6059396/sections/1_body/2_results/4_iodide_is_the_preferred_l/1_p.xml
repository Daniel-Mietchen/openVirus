<p>H3N2 IAV strains have become dominant causes of recent seasonal influenza epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The following four H3N2 influenza A strains were tested in the cell-free system for their LPO substrate specificities: A/Texas/50/2012, A/Wisconsin/67/2005, A/Aichi/2/1968 and A/Hong Kong/8/1968 (
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These H3N2 strains circulate in the human population causing seasonal infections [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> treatment resulted in a decrease of infectious virus titers as measured by plaque assay between 1–3 logs for these H3N2 strains. While OSCN
 <sup>—</sup>mediated inactivation of A/Texas/50/2012 (p = 0.049) and A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (p = 0.023) were significant, there were no detectable significant differences for A/Aichi/2/68 (p = 0.155) and A/Hong Kong/8/68 (p = 0.123) (

 <sup>-</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). When OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> was replaced by I
 <sup>-</sup> as the LPO substrate in the cell-free system, it robustly enhanced viral inactivation that was significant (p&lt;0.0005) for all four H3N2 IAVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The formation of OI
 <sup>-</sup> by LPO resulted in reduced titers of A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (4.21+/-0.25 log decrease, mean+/-S.E.M., n = 3), all other H3N2 strains were completely eliminated by the treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The reversal of OI
 <sup>—</sup>mediated H3N2 inactivation by catalase was highly significant (p&lt;0.01) with all four strains tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We determined H3N2 IAV inactivation in the cell-free system and found it to be significantly (p = 0.029) more robust when I
 <sup>-</sup> was the LPO substrate used, compared to SCN
 <sup>-</sup> (
