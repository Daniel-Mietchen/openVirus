<p>To assess potential association of hemagglutinin or neuraminidase types of IAVs with their susceptibility to the LPO-based system, we compared viral inactivation and substrate preference of all nine IAV strains tested. When IAVs tested so far were grouped according to their HA types (H1 and H3) or NA types (N1, N2), no significant differences were seen between them regarding OSCN
 <sup>—</sup>or OI
 <sup>—</sup>mediated viral inactivation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, left and middle panels). To better characterize the substrate preference of LPO-mediated viral inactivation, we calculated a “SCN
 <sup>-</sup> / I
 <sup>-</sup> substrate preference ratio” or “OSCN
 <sup>-</sup>/OI
 <sup>-</sup> susceptibility ratio” for each strain by dividing the extent of SCN
 <sup>—</sup>fueled virus inactivation by the extent of the I
 <sup>—</sup>mediated one. When these SCN
 <sup>-</sup>/I
 <sup>-</sup> substrate preference ratios of all nine IAV strains were grouped according to their HA type (irrespective of NA), they were significantly (p = 0.0159) higher with H1 compared to H3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, right panel). When the substrate preference ratios were grouped according to the NA type (irrespective of HA), we found no significant (p = 0.111) difference (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, right panel). In summary, H3N2 IAV strains are also susceptible to the antimicrobial actions of LPO and show a surprising preference for I
 <sup>-</sup> as the preferred substrate for inactivation that is associated with H1 and H3 hemagglutinin subtypes.
