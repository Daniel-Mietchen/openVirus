<p>IBV strains primarily infect humans, do not have established animal reservoirs and pose little risk of pandemic infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. IBV may cause seasonal influenza infections and co-circulate with IAV strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Importantly, IBV can dominate influenza seasons and is typically more resistant to antivirals than IAVs [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We investigated whether LPO present in our cell-free system can inactivate the influenza B strain, B/Yamagata/16/1988, a prototype strain of the Yamagata lineage of IBV strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> led to complete, highly significant (p&lt;0.001) inactivation of the viral dose used. Using I
 <sup>-</sup> as the LPO substrate, viral inactivation of IBV was significant (p = 0.021), but was reduced to a 1.6+/-0.62 log decrease (n = 5) in viral titers compared to 7.2+/-0.27 log drop (n = 5) in viral titers following OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). As in the case of IAV strains, both, OSCN
 <sup>—</sup>and OI
 <sup>—</sup>mediated inactivation of this IBV strain was completely inhibited by catalase, as well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Since the used dose of I
 <sup>-</sup> sustained only minor inactivation of the tested IBV strain, we increased the I
 <sup>-</sup> concentration to 40 mM to explore the potential improvement of the antiviral action of LPO. Unexpectedly, we did not observe improved inactivation of the B/Yamagata/16/1988 strain by up to 100-fold higher I
 <sup>-</sup> doses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Thus, the tested IBV strain showed a preference for SCN
 <sup>-</sup> as the LPO substrate for inactivation.
