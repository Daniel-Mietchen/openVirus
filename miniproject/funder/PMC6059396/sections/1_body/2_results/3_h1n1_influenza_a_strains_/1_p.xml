<p>Influenza A viruses are classified based on two of their surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that also determine their antigenic specificities. Since the H1N1 and H3N2 serotypes have been commonly present in human epidemics and pandemics over the last century [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], it was important to compare several H1N1 and H3N2 strains in the cell-free system for LPO-mediated inactivation (
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The IAV H1N1 strains, A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/California/04/2009 and A/Mississippi/3/2001 (
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), cause seasonal influenza virus infections in humans while the A/Turkey/Kansas/4880/1980 H1N1 strain is a virus of swine antigenic phenotype isolated from turkeys [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We tested A/Brisbane/59/2007 and observed a 1.31+/-0.42 (mean+/-S.E.M., n = 3) log (SCN
 <sup>-</sup>) and a 1.06+/-0.28 (mean+/-S.E.M., n = 3) log (I
 <sup>-</sup>) inactivation by the cell-free system, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The extent of OSCN
 <sup>—</sup>mediated viral inactivation was significant (p = 0.011) while that of OI
 <sup>-</sup> was not (p = 0.090) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Catalase had an inhibitory but non-significant (p = 0.092) and incomplete effect on viral inactivation for both substrates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Both LPO substrates mediated A/California/04/2009 viral inactivation beyond detection limit of the assay in the cell-free system which was highly significant (p&lt;0.0001, for each substrate) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Removing H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by catalase treatment significantly reversed (p&lt;0.0001) the virus-inactivating effect of LPO by both substrates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The A/Mississippi/3/2001 strain was also efficiently inactivated by LPO in a substrate-independent manner (log-based extent of inactivation: 6.16+/-0.27 for OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> while 6.88+/-0.55 for OI
 <sup>-</sup>, n = 4) that was entirely blocked by catalase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Although the A/Turkey/Kansas/4880/1980 H1N1 strain was also efficiently inactivated by LPO, its extent did not reach levels of significance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). While the four H1N1 influenza strains tested did not show a strong substrate preference in terms of inactivation by the cell-free H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/(SCN
 <sup>-</sup>/I
 <sup>-</sup>) system, they differed in their susceptibilities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This is also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g003">Fig 3B</xref> where the extent of virus inactivation is calculated as the catalase-dependent difference in viable viral titers (viral doses detected in presence of the full cell-free system are subtracted from viral doses recovered in presence of the full cell-free system plus catalase). Virus inactivation is calculated throughout the entire manuscript the same way.
