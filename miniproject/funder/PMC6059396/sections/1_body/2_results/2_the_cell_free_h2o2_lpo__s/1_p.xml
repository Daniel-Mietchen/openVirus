<p>We have shown previously that BECs are capable of inactivating the A/Swine/Illinois/02860/2009 (H1N2) influenza A strain (
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) in a H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (Duox)-, LPO- and SCN
 <sup>â€”</sup>dependent manner [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Next we wanted to confirm this in the cell-free system. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/SCN
 <sup>-</sup> cell-free system had also a strong and substantial inactivating effect on the A/Swine/Illinois/02860/2009 (H1N2) strain. Importantly, viral inactivation in the cell-free system was entirely blocked by the addition of catalase, a H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-scavanging enzyme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). No viral inactivation was observed when only GO was added but LPO and SCN
 <sup>-</sup> were omitted from the system (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similarly, having LPO and SCN
 <sup>-</sup> without the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-generating GO had no substantial viral-inactivating effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Comparable data were observed on BECs [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] indicating that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> alone is inefficient and OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> is responsible for inactivating the H1N2 influenza strain in both systems.
