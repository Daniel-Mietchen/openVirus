<p>Next, we tested how H1N2 inactivation by the cell-free system changes if I
 <sup>-</sup> (an alternative LPO substrate) is used. I
 <sup>-</sup> has been shown to enhance the antiviral activity of LPO against adenovirus and respiratory syncytial viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. I
 <sup>-</sup> was used at the same concentration as SCN
 <sup>-</sup> (400 μM). Replacing SCN
 <sup>-</sup> with I
 <sup>-</sup> in the cell-free system led to even more effective H1N2 inactivation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similar to results obtained with SCN
 <sup>-</sup>, catalase blocked viral inactivation when I
 <sup>-</sup> was used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Omitting any of the components of the I
 <sup>—</sup>based cell-free system resulted in complete loss of H1N2 inactivation confirming that hypoiodite (OI
 <sup>-</sup>) is responsible for the virucidal effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). To better characterize the substrate preference of LPO in inactivating H1N2, we tested viral inactivation at doses of SCN
 <sup>-</sup> and I
 <sup>-</sup> lower than 400 μM. As the dose-dependence curves shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2C</xref> indicate, H1N2 was more susceptible to I
 <sup>—</sup>mediated inactivation by the cell-free system. Interestingly, sensitivity to OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> drops drastically at SCN
 <sup>-</sup> doses just below 100 μM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199167.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Results presented here confirm that the cell-free system serves as a good model to study influenza inactivation by the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/SCN
 <sup>-</sup> system, and the swine H1N2 strain tested is susceptible to both, OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> and OI
 <sup>—</sup>mediated inactivation by LPO, with a slightly higher sensitivity to OI
 <sup>-</sup>.
