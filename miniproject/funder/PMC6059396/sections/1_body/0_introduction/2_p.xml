<p>Bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) are a primary target for influenza virus replication [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Early response by BECs to influenza virus is crucial in determining progression of viral infection, adaptive immunity, and lung pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. BECs orchestrate an oxidative extracellular antimicrobial system present in the airway surface liquid consisting of LPO, its main natural substrate, the thiocyanate anion (SCN
 <sup>-</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) (

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. LPO is an abundant peroxidase in the airways that uses H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to oxidize its most abundant and preferred substrate, SCN
 <sup>-</sup>, into hypothiocyanite (OSCN
 <sup>-</sup>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hypothiocyanite is a short-lived, antimicrobial agent that is not toxic to the host and has been shown to kill several microbes, mainly bacteria. Its antiviral action remains, however, less characterized and understood.
