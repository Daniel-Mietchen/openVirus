<p>Hypothiocyanite was to shown to inactivate the A/H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza virus in a cell-free system [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We also reported that OSCN
 <sup>-</sup> generated on the apical surface of BECs is capable of inactivating the A/swine/Illinois/02860/09 (swH1N2) influenza A strain [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These observations suggest that the H

 <sub>2</sub>/LPO/SCN
 <sup>-</sup> system is an important contributor to anti-influenza viral defense of the respiratory immune system, and imply that this innate response could be utilized to enhance early clearance of influenza virus perhaps in a strain-independent manner. To better understand the anti-influenza virus action of this oxidative system, we aimed at characterizing its virus-inactivating effect by testing several influenza virus strains. In addition to its natural substrate, SCN
 <sup>-</sup>, we also tested iodide (I
 <sup>-</sup>), as LPO substrate to study the substrate specificity of the antiviral action of LPO. LPO readily oxidizes several halides and pseudohalides using H

 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Iodide is considered to be a better LPO substrate than SCN
 <sup>-</sup> to inhibit growth of certain fungi and bacteria [

 <xref rid="pone.0199167.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, we tested an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, cell-free experimental system to characterize the anti-influenza virus action and substrate specificity of LPO. We found that LPO inactivates a wide-range of influenza strains, but surprisingly the extent of LPO-mediated viral inactivation and LPO substrate preference differed among tested isolates.
