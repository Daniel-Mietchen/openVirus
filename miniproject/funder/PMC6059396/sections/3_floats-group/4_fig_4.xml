   <sup>-</sup>) system was tested against H3N2 influenza A strains: A/Texas/50/2012 (n = 3), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (n = 2), A/Hong Kong/8/68 (n = 4) and A/Aichi/2/68 (n = 5). Viruses were incubated in the presence or absence of the components of the cell-free system as indicated for 1 hour and number of viable viruses was assessed by plate-forming unit assay using MDCK cells. Mean+/-S.E.M. One-way ANOVA, Dunn’s multiple comparison test. (B) Virus inactivations of the H3N2 strains are compared according to the LPO substrates used. Mean+/-S.E.M., n = 2–5. Mann-Whitney test.
