  <title>Hemagglutinin subtypes are associated with LPO substrate preference supporting IAV inactivation.</title>
  <p>Susceptibilities of tested IAV strains to OSCN
   <sup>-</sup> and OI
   <sup>-</sup> in the cell-free system were compared according to their types of (A) hemagglutinin (H1, H3) and (B) neuraminidase (N1, N2). “SCN
   <sup>-</sup>/I
   <sup>-</sup> substrate preference ratios” were also calculated as described in the text for all nine IAV strains and compared among HA and NA types (upper and lower right panels). Ns, non-significant, *, p&lt;0.05. SCN
   <sup>-</sup>, thiocyanate; OSCN
   <sup>-</sup>, hypothiocyanite; I
   <sup>-</sup>, iodide; OI
   <sup>-</sup>, hypoiodite; LPO, lactoperoxidase; GO, glucose oxidase; HA, hemagglutinin; NA, neuraminidase. The gray area highlights the only significant difference in the figure.
