Viruses were incubated in the presence or absence of the components of the cell-free system as indicated for 1 hour and viral inactivation was assessed by plate-forming unit assay using MDCK cells. Mean+/-S.E.M. One-way ANOVA, Dunn’s multiple comparison test. (B) No significant difference can be observed in virus inactivation of the four H1N1 strains tested. Virus inactivation is calculated as the difference in viable viral titers between the sample containing the cell-free system and the sample containing the full, cell-free system plus catalase. Mean+/-S.E.M., n = 2–5. Mann-Whitney test. Ns, non-significant, *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001. SCN
