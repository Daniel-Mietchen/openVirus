   <bold>Comparison of influenza A and B strains for their susceptibilities to the virucidal effects of LPO.</bold> The nine IAV and three IBV influenza strains tested were compared regarding their susceptibilities to OSCN
   <sup>-</sup> (left panel), to OI
   <sup>-</sup> (middle panel) or their LPO substrate preference ratios (right panel) in the cell-free system. This figure does not show new experimental data but presents new analysis of experimental results obtained in Figs
