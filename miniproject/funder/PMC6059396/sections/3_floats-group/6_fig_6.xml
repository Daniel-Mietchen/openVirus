  <p>(A) The antiviral action of the cell-free H

   <sup>-</sup>) system was tested against influenza B strains: B/Yamagata/16/1988, B/Great Lakes/1739/1954 and B/New York/1056/2003. Viruses were incubated in the presence or absence of the components of the cell-free system as indicated for 1 hour and viral inactivation was assessed by plate-forming unit assay using MDCK cells. Mean+/-S.E.M., n = 5. One-way ANOVA, Dunn’s multiple comparison test. (B) B/Yamagata/16/1988 Virus inactivation was measured at increasing I
