  <title>LPO substrate specificity and susceptibility map of influenza strains.</title>
  <p>Susceptibilities of all twelve influenza strains tested in this study against OSCN
   <sup>-</sup> or OI
   <sup>-</sup> in the cell-free system are plotted. Names, species, serotypes or subtypes of the viral strains are indicated. Susceptibility is defined as the decrease in viral doses (log
   <sub>10</sub>PFU/ml) in the cell-free system following catalase treatment—see text for further details. The X axis shows susceptibility against OSCN
   <sup>-</sup> while the Y axis shows susceptibility towards OI
   <sup>-</sup>. Mean+/-S.E.M. for both, X and Y axes, n = 2–5. The indicated diagonal crossing on the map from the lower left corner to the upper right corner indicates no substrate preference, irrespective of susceptibility. The dotted line named as the “H3N2 cluster” indicates that all four H3N2 strains group close to each other. The quadrant circles indicate viral inactivations of different sizes (2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 logs). OSCN
   <sup>-</sup>, hypothiocyanite; OI
   <sup>-</sup>, hypoiodite; LPO, lactoperoxidase; PFU, plaque-forming unit; IAV, Influenza A virus; IBV, Influenza B virus.
