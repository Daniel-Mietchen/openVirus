  <title>Performance curves for the first ten selected data sources.</title>
  <p>The system was built through the sequential addition of data sources to minimize RMSE, as listed from left to right along the x-axis. Graphs show the changing performance of the growing system, where points indicate the quality (mean RMSE, PWE, or PME) of forecasts made using all data sources to the left of and including the given x-axis label. Circles indicate individual performance of selected data sources; shading indicates performance range across the 16 seasons tested.</p>
