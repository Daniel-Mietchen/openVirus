<p>We emphasize that this framework is designed to select optimal combinations of data sources for any combination of predictor data sources, multi-linear forecasting method and objective function. As a case study, we built optimal combinations of data sources for forecasting seasonal flu using a published univariate Bayesian empirical framework ([
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) that we extended to forecast with multiple data sources. The optimized systems provide reliable forecasts of the overall seasonal trends and epidemic peak, in most of the 16 historical out-of-sample evaluations. The data-driven selection of informative predictors revealed that public health surveillance data is invaluable for flu forecasting, and that, when rigorously integrated into forecasting models, proprietary electronic health record data can significantly increase accuracy, to a greater degree than freely available internet data. The same optimization framework, forecasting method and RMSE objective function could be readily applied to designing high performing multi-linear forecasting systems for other diseases, for which we have amble historic data, such as Dengue [
