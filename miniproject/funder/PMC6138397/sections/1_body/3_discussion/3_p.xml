<p>In this study, we have used this framework to design multi-source surveillance systems for accurate forecasting of seasonal influenza, and, in the process, rigorously assess the performance and complementarity of diverse data sources. To do so, we combined two previously published methods. The first is an empirical Bayes strategy for forecasting seasonal flu from a single data source [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Rather than imposing strong assumptions about transmission dynamics, it assumes that the forecasting target (typically, the currently emerging flu season) will roughly resemble past seasons in terms of the shape, peak week, peak magnitude, and pace of the epidemic curve. By combining and perturbing these features from prior seasonal data, we simulate distributions of plausible (hybrid) flu curves. Then, as a season unfolds, we predict future weeks by extrapolating from variates that most resemble recent activity. To forecast flu (target) from 
 <italic>multiple</italic> data sources (predictors), we make empirical Bayes forecasts of each predictor separately and combine them into a target forecast using a linear model previously fit to historical predictor and target data. The second method is a greedy optimization that sequentially selects a maximally informative set of data sources to achieve a specified goal [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In our case, the candidate providers are a diverse set of public health, commercial health-care, internet query and social media data sources. Our public health goal is accurate forecasting of seasonal flu starting in calendar week 48.
