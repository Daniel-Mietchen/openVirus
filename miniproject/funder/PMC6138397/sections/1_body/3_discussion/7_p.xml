<p>While we believe that these insights are robust, they may reflect specific assumptions of our model, and not apply to other diseases, forecasting methods, or objective functions. First, the superior performance of the public health data source is likely biased by our choice of ILINet as the 
 <italic>gold standard</italic> forecasting target. If we had instead sought to forecast athenahealth or GFT time series, these data sources may have been selected as their own top predictors. However, we believe that this choice of target is justified, as it is the only data source specifically designed to estimate flu prevalence in the US. Along with WHO it always selected as a top predictor for selected level forecasts. Second, we follow Brooks et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in assuming uniform distributions for peak height and peak week, constrained by historical observations. This might limit forecasting accuracy for seasons with atypically high, low, early or late peaks. To address this, one could assume distributions that include low probability extreme departures from past seasons.
