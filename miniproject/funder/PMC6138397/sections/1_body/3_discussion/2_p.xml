For any public health surveillance goal, the approach is designed to systematically evaluate up to thousands of candidate data sources and identify complementary combinations of predictors that achieve the stated goal. For example, we have identified optimal zip codes for seasonal flu surveillance and early detection of pandemic flu in Texas [
