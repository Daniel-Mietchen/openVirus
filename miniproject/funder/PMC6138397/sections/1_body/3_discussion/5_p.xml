<p>We optimized forecasting models from three classes of dataâ€“traditional public health surveillance data, electronic health records (EHR) from a data services company, and data aggregated from the influenza-related internet search and social network activity. A priori, each has pros and cons. Official surveillance systems are designed for the purpose of monitoring and predicting flu activity, and thus may provide more accurate and robust signals than the alternatives. However, surveillance data tends to be sparse and time-lagged. Internet source data can be abundant and immediately available, but provides only correlated activity that can be highly susceptible to extrinsic perturbations such as media events and modifications to source websites [
