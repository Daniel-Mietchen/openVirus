<p>Our analyses provide quantitative insights into harnessing these trade-offs for forecasting. First, when data sources are evaluated individually, we find that public health surveillance data yields the most accurate forecasts, followed by EHR data, and internet-source data trailing far behind. Second, optimized combinations of data sources (with or without ILINet) provide far better forecasts than any individual data source alone. Third, EHR data are always selected before internet-source data to augment public health data, suggesting that EHRâ€™s provide a more valuable source of complementary information. Forth, when CDC and WHO data are excluded, the optimal EHR and internet-source systems are unable to achieve comparable forecasting performance. Fifth, state-level EHR data improves forecasts significantly more than national-level EHR data.</p>
