<p>The field has primarily focused on the development of statistical models that predict seasonal dynamics on multiple geopolitical scales, and only secondarily considered the quality of predictor data. Test bed data are often selected based on convenience. Until recently, Google Flu Trends data was free and abundant at multiple scales, and thus a popular choice [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A few studies have integrated multiple different types of data and shown that, for short-term forecasting (one to three weeks ahead), the combination of all independent flu predictors performs better than using single source [

However, they have not systematically optimized the combination of data sources or quantified their relative contributions to forecast accuracy, as we have done here. Our study confirms that multi-source forecasting can outperform single-source forecasting, but only when complementary sources are identified and systematically integrated.
