<p>We also build out-of-sample forecasts of ILINet using ILINet and WHO as predictors, using only (1) three years (2011-2014) and (2) five years of training data (2008-2014) to build the Bayesian prior distributions. In the original out-of-sample forecasts, we used 15 of the 16 available seasons to build priors for forecasting the remaining season. (See

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006236.s006">S4</xref> Figs for more details). Performance increased with the duration of the training data, with average RMSE decreasing from 0.69 to 0.64 to 0.56 as we increase the training period from three to five to fifteen years. However, even the poorest set of forecasts (based on three years of training) are decent. In addition, we note that the original experiments selected Athena Health data as highly informative predictors, despite only being available for three years (2011-2014).
