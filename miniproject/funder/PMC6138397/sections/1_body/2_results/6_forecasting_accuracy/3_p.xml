<p>Performance curves for this optimized system indicate that additional data sources, beyond the five included, are not expected to improve performance considerably, according to our empirical results show in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006236.g003">Fig 3</xref>. On their own, ILINet and WHO are the strongest predictors of future ILINet activity. Although the Athena data sources exhibit poor individual performance, they substantially improve forecast accuracy when combined with ILINet and WHO. The hierarchical selection method was thus able to integrate 
 <italic>complementary</italic> data sources into a multi-source system that is expected to provide more reliable forecasts than single-source systems. This is also true for systems which exclude ILINet and WHO as candidate predictors. (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006236.s004">S2 Fig</xref> for detailed results).
