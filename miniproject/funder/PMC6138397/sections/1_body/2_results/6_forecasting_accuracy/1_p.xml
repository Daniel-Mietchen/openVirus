<p>The best five-source system (optimized from all available data sources) consistently produces accurate historical out-of-sample forecasts, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006236.g002">Fig 2</xref>. After observing only the first nine weeks of the flu season, the system is able to predict the remaining 24 weeks of the season with an average RMSE under 1%. The forecasted 95% credible interval contained the historical ILINet value in 87% of all weeks across all 16 forecasts. However, the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 forecasts capture the peaks but considerably overestimate prevalence towards the ends of the seasons (12 weeks out of 24 lie outside the 95% credible interval). Excluding these two seasons, 92.9% of all historical weeks fall within the forecasted 95% interval. In the system optimized from all national-level data sources except ILINet, accuracy drops to 66% of all historical weeks contained in the credible intervals. (See
