<p>Although these systems were optimized solely to minimize RMSE, the resulting forecasts perform quite well with respect to predicting the timing and magnitude of the epidemic peak. In over 85% of the seasons, the forecasts predict the peak to occur within two weeks of the actual peak; in over 85%, the predicted height of the peak is within 20% of its actual height. Since the Athena predictors are only available between 2011 and 2014, they provide no information for the first 13 of the 16 seasons. Consequently, we see a reduction in RMSE for the three most recent forecasts.</p>
