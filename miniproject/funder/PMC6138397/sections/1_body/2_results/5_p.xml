<p>While ILINet and WHO data are consistently selected as the most informative data sources, they tend to have greater time lags than some of the other 
 <italic>real-time</italic> candidate data sources. To evaluate the viability of a real-time system using alternative national-level data, we optimized two additional systems, one excluding ILINet and the other excluding both ILINet and WHO data. Without ILINet, WHO is selected as the single most informative source and combined with four different national-level Athena data sources tracking flu-related visits and prescriptions (

However, when both ILINet and WHO data are excluded, the expected performance drops considerably. For comparison, we optimized systems for forecasting state-level ILINet (California, New York, and Texas), and found that national-level surveillance data (ILINet and WHO US) are always selected among the top three most informative data sources, with forecasts enhanced by a variety of state and regional athenahealth variables.
