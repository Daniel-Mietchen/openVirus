<p>First, we consider an optimized system consisting of five data sources selected from among all 453 local, regional and national data sources, and compare it to two baseline systemsâ€“one using only ILINet to forecast itself and another using a combination of ILINet and WHO laboratory data to forecast ILINet (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). ILINet is selected as the single most informative predictor when evaluated in conjunction with only WHO laboratory data or with all 453 available sources. The fully optimized system combines ILINet with WHO and three Athena state- and regional-level data sources (no internet-based data sources is chosen), suggesting that proprietary electronic medical record data may provide a more reliable source of real-time epidemiological data than freely available internet source data. In comparing the ILINet plus WHO system to the fully optimized system (All), we find that Athena data improves performance only marginally relative to the addition of all four data sources, which together reduce the historical RMSE by roughly 15%.
