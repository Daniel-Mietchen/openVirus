<p>We analyzed several different sets of candidate data sources, with the goal of identifying subsets of data sources that provide accurate and timely forecasts of ILINet. For each round of data evaluation, we separately predicted each season between 1997 and 2014, excluding the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic. For simplicity, we assumed that all 16 seasons span from the 40th calendar week of a given year to the 20th calendar week of the subsequent year. For each season in each data source, we assume that we observe values during the first nine weeks of the season (i.e., the 40th through 48th calendar week) and then forecast ILINet levels for the remainder of the flu season.</p>
